All right, uh, I, I would like to talk about, just briefly What happened over there in Saudi Arabia in the political context.
I think it's, uh, refreshing to see the, uh, the support that the President got from the American people.
Yeah, it, we, I, I read an interesting article in the paper that discussed, uh, that, uh, seemed that every other time a President tried to get support for an action like, uh, uh, President Carter and his thing with the, the hostage crisis,
Right.
and he always did it through rhetoric.
Right.
And this time President Bush did it through action and he,
Um.
he drove policy by the course he took and almost forced public support,
Yes.
or, uh, I mean, he left almost no alternative.
That's right
And, and it was very interesting how he did it and, uh, I mean, I'm, I'm an Air Force Officer, so it, uh,
Really.
it was interesting for me, uh, you know, I'd certainly, uh, I, I mean I think it's great that all the support.
I have, uh, friends of mine from the Air, I'm, I'm an engineer and work in the Rolm Laboratory,
Right.
but other engi, guys here on base, this is a B fiftytwo base where I work, so,
Yeah.
we had about a thousand people gone from the base that went over there and they're getting a tremendous amount of support out of it.
That's great, um, if, if you remember, the vote in the Congress to authorize war, if necessary, was actually pretty close.
Yes it was.
And if, if my memory serves me right, I believe a majority of Democrats may even have opposed it, it, it was,
Yeah, I'm, I don't know the exact figure but I, I would imagine that because of the, how close the, the vote was I'm, uh, I mean almost certainly would have to be.
Just based on the sheer numbers of, uh, the disparity of, excuse me, Democrats and Republicans in Congress he'd think that it would have to have been, um.
That's right.
And, uh, I, I gosh this, uh, this whole thing now with all the, uh, all the political cartoons on the Democrats and how they're, uh, uh,
Yeah.
they're in, in a sad way for ninetytwo now in terms of the presidential election, anyway.
Especially the ones that came out and said, oh come on guys, let's talk about this little while longer.
Yeah, yeah.
I mean how many years are we going to wait and, and what, what do you do with the people that are over there in the mean time.
Right, right, I think that was, all those factors played a part in, you know, uh, the,
No doubt.
everyone was discussing whether we should, uh, wait longer, but, I, I, I know that there's a lot of reasons to wait longer but I think we were genuinely concerned about how, their military capability and we, uh, I think we over estimated it, but still,
I think so too.
we were really, highly concerned about it and, that we were worried that they were getting dug in and, uh.
Well they were,
Yeah.
and in fact they were so well dug in that, uh, when we sent our tanks around behind them they couldn't get turned around in time.
Right, they couldn't, yeah they couldn't, yeah, it's true they, Saddam thought he had the whole thing, uh, figured out to, to which way we were coming and which, what, what our doctrine was that, uh,
Well, had, had we done a frontal assault it probably would have worked more to his favor.
That's right, that's true.
That's interesting, I think, uh, this political situation over there now is, uh, uh, it'll be interesting to see what comes out of it whether the, this opposition will, uh, uh, today the Turks, uh, agreed to support the Kurds, which is something they've never done before and, uh.
Um, interesting.
And, uh, this, and the Israelis, uh, and not the Israelis but the Arabs all of a sudden are, uh, are cheering for Baker on his drive for, to reconcile relations with the Israelis, so it's like
Well, Baker is really not very much pro Israel.
Yeah I,
And did you know John Sununu is, uh, half Arab?
No, uh, I, I think I did hear that at one time a long time ago,
Yeah.
because I used to live in, uh, Massachusetts, but, uh,
Right, in, in fact, when he was Governor of New Hampshire, I believe.
Yeah, New Hampshire.
Okay.
I believe he was the only one of fifty governors that voted against some kind of resolution of support for Israel a few years back.
Oh my gosh.
And, uh, now he is a conservative, but he is not a conservative that favors Israel,
Uh.
and that, that concerns me greatly.
Well, I don't, yeah, I'd certainly, uh, support Israel in, in their, their policy that in defending themselves and in, uh, in their handling of their foreign policy, I think, I think the stand they have, or, or the way the command respect, I, I support that.
I think that is a, a positive thing for them after, um, uh, thousands of years, they have to, uh, they ha, I think they in, when they be, became a country they more than, or, more or less decided they weren't going to take it anymore, and, uh.
Well, they didn't have much choice, they could either fight or die.
Yeah, exactly, exactly and, uh, um, so, gee, I lost my train of thought here.
But, uh, um, so, okay so I can't say whether that, that I'm pro Israel or anti Israel.
I mean, I'd like to see them resolve something in that situation and get some stability in the region and looks uh, that the joining of forces for this, uh, uh, Desert Shield and Desert Storm thing ended up being a positive thing.
It is a positive thing, um, however, uh, every time an organization such as the P L O says well we'll see if we can work with Israel, then, uh, they get embarrassed some, every few months by documents that reveal that their ultimate purpose is to totally eliminate them.
Right.
And so you, you basically have, uh, mutually exclusive interests, either Israel is going to occupy the area, or the Arabs are going to occupy the area and I'm just not sure that, that there's going to be any easy permanent solution.
Yeah, somebody's going to, and I think that's the problem the P L O has is that when they, whenever one group of them decides that they're going to negotiate, or they're going to do something, they're going to try to make some peace, but, uh, the end result is that they, there so many factions of them and, uh, some more violent than others, some with a certain agenda different than the others, or they split, they end up being, becoming divisive themselves.
Exactly.
Uh, I, it's interesting,
It is.
I, I'm, I'm looking forward to seeing what happens over there in the next couple of months, but, uh, that's,
Yeah, I, I commend Israel for their restraint in not responding to the Scud attacks.
Yeah, I know, that, that is almost, I mean that's absolutely unprecedented that was,
Yeah.
an, an incredible foreign policy coup on the part of the President and the State Department.
Exactly, exactly.
And that, I mean that's never happened before,
No.
and I don't know if it will ever happen again but,
May not.
Well it's been fun, I enjo, enjoyed talking with you.
Yeah, okay, uh, I guess, uh, well maybe the computer will pair us up together another time.
You never know.
All right.
Bye, bye.
Bye, bye.
Well, how, how do you feel about the immigration laws?
At, currently, I think they are a little restrictive.
Uh, particularly for, uh, certain ethnic groups or from certain countries.
Um, I think we should permit, uh, more immigration from eastern Europe, for example, uh, particularly the, uh, the Jewish, uh, uh, people from Russia.
I think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last, uh, several years.
And, I think we have, uh, uh, too much restriction on the, uh, on the Orientals also, but, of course, that's just my opinion
Yeah, well, I'm not real sure why I got this topic, because I don't think I checked it off on the list
Uhhuh.
because I know very little about the current immigration laws.
Uhhuh.
Well, we seem to, uh, to favor certain, uh, uh, countries particularly South American countries.
And, uh, there is no, uh, uh, I have nothing, of course, against, uh, the, uh, the South Americans or, uh, or Hispanics, in that sense, but I think we, uh, are more restrictive of the, uh, so called eastern, uh, European countries than we, uh, we should be.
Of course, that's from my own bias since my ancestors from eastern Europe, so
Oh.
And, uh, so I think, uh, you know, the, uh, embargo we placed on the, uh, on the Russian Jews, although we of, uh, spent years and years, uh, lobbying for their release and their ability to, um, immigrate from Russia
Uhhuh.
as soon as that occurred, we simply said that, uh, instead of the, uh, hundred and fifty thousand or so who wanted to immigrate to this country, we cut that by, uh, two thirds.
So.
Huh.
I do not quite go along with that, but
No, that doesn't make a whole of lot sense.
No.
And I still think, you know, again, kind of having, uh, uh, within this century, come from a, uh, an immigrant family, or immigrant families on both sides.
Uhhuh.
Both my mother's parents and my father's parents were immigrants so, I'm a little touchy every now and then about that
Yeah.
Well, uh, my, uh, my family is from, uh, Europe from, well, from England and Ireland
Uhhuh.
and, uh, have been in this country for, oh, more than a hundred and fifty years
Oh, my
almost two hundred years, so, I don't have any, any, uh, relatives that I am, or, or, uh, several generations back, that I am familiar with their names and how they fit into the family.
They were all, they were all born here
Uhhuh.
so I don't have any real strong ties with any, with, with the immigration laws.
I don't, because I don't, I don't have any personal feelings about them and I haven't taken the time or effort to learn what they are.
Well, I think in a way, though, uh, uh, I also have, uh, an opposite point of view, which is, uh, although I believe we should, uh, permit, uh, you know, constant immigration into this country
Um.
uh, I think we should, uh, primarily for economic reasons, I think we should have, um, some quotas, of course, my family and I, again, again that was, you know, my grandparents came over during the time when, uh, there were quotas.
So they had to wait, uh, you know, in, uh, certain parts of Europe for years before they were permitted to come over.
Uhhuh.
So, you know, but, uh
Yeah.
I, I,
I think unrestricted immigration, I think, is not, uh, is not best, uh.
Well, I agree with that, I, I think if immigration was entirely unrestricted, uh, not only would, would the United States become over populated, well, more over populated awfully quickly, I think it, it would bring in a lot of, uh, people that are, run out of other countries or in trouble in, in other countries.
I think they'd come here trying to find a new market for their, their brand of crime.
Uhhuh.
Well, you know, there's another aspect of this, too.
They're also, uh, uh, diminishing the, uh, health restrictions which,
I was not aware, aware of that.
Well, yes.
There are, were some, uh, regulations over, I don't know whether they're laws passed or, or whatever they're called, uh, just recently, where, uh, people with certain diseases cannot be excluded, uh, from, uh, immigration.
Age is one, for example, and, uh, recently, uh, tuberculosis, which at one time, if you had tuberculosis you could not get into this country
Uhhuh.
uh, they dropped that also.
So I think in, in some as, some ways we are, uh, becoming a little too egalitarian in that, in that sense, but, uh, I think we should be a little more circumspect about it.
Again, my opinion
Yeah.
Think we've talked long enough?
I think so
All right.
Well, I've enjoyed talking to you.
I, I, I have talked long enough.
Okay
Thanks.
Thank you.
Bye.
Goodbye.
Well, how about you.
Do you use P C s?
Oh constantly.
Yeah.
You and me both.
It seems everything I do is computer related.
Huhuh.
And if it goes down, then we're stuck all day.
Yeah.
And so I like the I B M P C, personally.
Huhuh.
But that's pretty much everything I've worked with and, uh, I've become so accustomed to it that, uh, it's second nature.
Yeah.
What do you use?
Well, I have an, I, I B M P S two, model thirty.
Yeah.
It's kind of, kind of getting too slow for me, but my job, I'm an E D P auditor, so I audit, uh, computer applications both on the personal computer and the mainframe level.
Oh, huhuh.
And I use my personal computer constantly, not only do I do P C type things like, uh, using lotus or word processors,
Huhuh.
I also use my P C to emulate a mainframe terminal for our I B M mainframe
Huhuh.
and also to emulate a deck terminal for our deck machine.
Oh, okay.
So all I have on my desk is my P C, but I'm, I'm getting, not only our local area network, but I'm getting two separate mainframe machines, also.
Oh, okay.
So we, um, we use, it's an I B M P S two also.
Huhuh.
And, um, you know, every now and then the file gets so big, that, you know, it moves slower than I'd like
Huhuh.
but I, uh, I do mainly graphic work on it.
Huhuh.
And, uh, a little bit of word processing and then lotus applications to it.
Yeah.
And, uh, I don't know, I just, I enjoy working with them.
Yeah faded>>.
There's so many capabilities out there, I mean, the things you can do are endless.
Yeah.
I've become kind of the P C guru in our audit department because it's mostly financial auditors with an accounting back ground,
Huhuh.
And there's three of us E D P auditors and one of the three of us has an accounting background and so she's not real proficient in P C's and the other just has,
Yeah.
not used P C's that much, so I ended up taking on the load of making sure everybody knows what they're doing and I'm the administrator for our local area network.
And I need to keep that going and,
Huhuh.
So, I, I'm, I couldn't live my life without a P C.
I don't have one at home,
We have one at home, but I just don't find the time that I can use it.
Yeah.
Right now I would rather not have one at home, because I would work at home.
Yes.
Um, we've got a couple of portable lap top P C's at the office that I end up bringing one of them home a lot,
Huhuh.
to do work.
If I had a machine already installed at home I would probably work just about every night
are many breaks in the tape.
>
One of the reasons why I got mine, was before I went on maternity leave, they didn't know how they were going to do without me at work because, I am pretty much the, like you said, the guru,
Yeah.
in the office with the different programs and any trouble shooting that there is,
Huhuh.
and, um, so they didn't know how it was going to work, they knew they were going to have to get a modem so that we could, in the decks machine so that we could, in my home, so that we could make it through this eight weeks or so.
Yeah.
But, uh, you know, it's, uh, it's almost like we could become too dependent on them.
Yeah.
And oh, I, we use a lot of free lance.
Huhuh.
And, uh, that's, uh, pretty much takes up a lot of our day so for as producing transparencies and things.
Yeah.
And, um, it, uh, compared to the way the things have upgraded,
Right.
Have, uh, really, what's the word I'm looking for, I'm just totally drawing a blank
But, uh, the way things have changed over the years with the P C and the different programs is just great.
It's remarkable the things we can do now, and compared to, you know, a few years.
Yeah.
Just the power, I'm, I'm trying to, uh, get an updated machine.
Mine, uh, is just putting along
And it's not fast enough for a new four eighty six chip, but, uh,
Yeah.
I don't know if my boss will spring for it.
But I'm determined to brake mine so he has to get me another one.
We think about that a lot.
Yeah
Well, that's what I do.
We had a printer, a Hewlett Packard Ready Writer.
Huhuh.
And we had about ten people sharing this printer by, it was attached to like a central P C and you had to take your diskette to the P C to print something.
Um, now that's awful.
So the first thing has faded>> when I started working at this bank, is, I said, well, now first of all we need to all be able to share this P C without getting up.
So I talked my boss into investing in a, it's not a, uh, a uh, real elaborate local area network,
Huhuh.
but we can share the printer and we can, uh, send files to each other,
Okay.
And we can mail, send mail messages to each other,
Oh, okay.
which is good enough, it's what we need.
Right.
And then I talked them into buying a H P Laser Jet.
Oh, yes.
And that was a major ordeal to get him to buy it.
But once he bought it, he has been so pleased.
It's, it's fast, it's quite, oh, it has good copy.
Right.
The copy that you can with one of those as compared to one of those dot matrix printers.
Yeah.
I've got a little, little, uh, I B M Pro Printer on my desk,
Yeah.
but, and I can use either the Pro Printer or I've got my P C configured to where I can use either printer.
The one that's on the network or my own.
Huhuh.
So if I just need something real quick, and I don't feel like getting up and going and getting what I printed, I can just print it in my office.
Um, we're just trying to talk ours into getting a laser printer.
Yeah.
And, uh, it's just so, the budget restraints and things like that, it's, makes it difficult and, uh,
They have gotten really cheap.
Hewlett Packard makes, it's actually a dot matrix printer
Huhuh.
but the quality is almost laser quality.
Oh, huhuh.
And I think it's called the desk jet and they're, you understand, I think they're about five hundred dollars now.
And we, uh, got a quote on some laser printers the other day at six hundred dollars.
Oh, really.
Yeah, I don't remember what kind they were, but, uh, we do a lot of transparencies.
Huhuh.
Sometimes the color would take too long to plot out.
Yeah.
So they just want black and white, which see we can just run them through the laser printer real quick.
Yeah.
Because it will only take a minute to print one of those out and then run a thermal copy of it.
Yeah.
But, uh, it, uh,
So that's all you need for like charts and stuff.
You don't need them in four colors.
No, huhuh.
If it was a customer presentation then that would be different.
Yeah.
We would want to razzledazzle a bit.
But, uh, it's, uh, yeah.
We have one in the office and if we want, well in our area, if we want to use it, we have to, you know, like you said, you had to change it, put it on a disc,
And carry it over to there, and see if they're not using the printer,
You use the sneak, system.
Right
Yeah.
And, uh, wait for an opportunity to use it.
Yeah, we you'd have to just sit and wait while someone else was using the printer.
Huhuh.
Until they got off the machine.
I know, I know, I understand.
That was, I was amazed when I came to work, I worked at the, uh, well, it used to be the largest bank in San Antonio until N C N B came up and bought the rival and now N C N B.
Huhuh.
And now N C N B's got a little larger market share, but it's the only, uh, well, it's part of the bank holding company and that bank holding company of the ten largest banking holding companies in Texas.
It's the only one that's still alive.
Oh, huhuh.
Any way, I work in a big prestigious place.
Right.
And I couldn't believe when I walked in the door on my first day and here's the audit department of this, this huge holding company, sharing a H P Rugged Writer
I was going oh, wait a minute
Come on guys, this is crummy.
So how are you supposed to expect to stay number one when you're behind the times in technology.
Yeah, yeah.
We're pushing real hard though.
We're, we're trying, well, see, the entire bank is not like that.
We, the, the bank philosophy is one of innovation and,
Huhuh.
Lead the market.
It's just the audit department happened to be just a little behind the times because the, uh, the senior vice president, over audits, is cheap.
Huhuh.
And it's real hard to pry money out of him to, to do these things, but I was, I was able to convince him that it would be cost effective and that our board presentations would be much better and,
Right.
Um.
We find it hard to believe sometimes, or hard to understand when, uh, we work for a computer company, and, uh, how are we supposed to present the imagine that we're supposed to present with equipment that's outdated,
Yeah.
That's obsolete and the guys that, some of the guys that run this place are very tight and it's like, Well, why do we need this, can't you do that with, you know, what we have, and when we try and then they complain about, this doesn't look good.
Yeah.
Unfortunately, the, the, uh, computer equipment and, and related peripherals are changing and improving so rapidly, like for instance, we bought a have faded>> .
Now.
I'm sorry,
Ready to go.
Okay.
excuse me.
And, uh, I do that, we recycle, uh, newspapers.
We take, you know, the DALLAS MORNING NEWS daily,
Right.
and the Plano paper daily and, you know, after a month of that you got a ton,
Oh,
of newspapers.
I know it builds up really fast.
It really does,
Yeah.
I do recycle,
Yeah.
newspapers and, uh, glass.
Uhhuh.
We don't really have enough plastic to mess with, we don't, you know, like we don't drink milk and we don't have children so we don't have, you know, six thousand plastic milk jugs,
Yeah, we do,
a month, you know.
With two, a two year old and a,
Yeah.
three year old and,
Right.
so it really builds up with us.
But there is, you know there is a place you can take those also you know at the same place just put them in a different, uh, container.
Yeah.
And, uh, Plano has plans I believe it's tentatively scheduled for sometime in May of this year, the city is going to leave, uh, receptacles at people's home.
Oh, yeah,
and they ca,
That would be much more convenient.
It,
Yeah.
certainly would and they can separate it and then the, you know, trash guys will pick it up.
Yeah.
Which would really be handy, you know, for people like shut ins, or,
Yeah.
people who can't or don't drive, you know,
Or it just builds up so often,
they can't get to the these centers.
Yeah.
And I'm sure rather than try to, uh, ask someone to take them for them they probably just pitch them, you know?
Yeah, yeah.
But I think that's probably a good idea.
They used to have several places, um, that were a little ways out in the community that did the paper and all,
Uhhuh.
and they stopped doing it because they said it wasn't profitable.
Right.
So finally, um, they, the people put so much pressure on the city,
Uhhuh.
they did a survey of everybody,
Uhhuh.
and they took a big huge bin that has paper and plastic, um,
and put it in front of the WalMart store in town,
Uhhuh.
and th, they, it just really, e, e, every time you went by there it was just over flowing,
That's right.
and so WalMart complained
Uhhuh, yes.
so they moved it behind the store and nobody knew where it was,
Yeah.
and so people kept piling stuff in the same place,
Uhhuh.
where it used to be.
Great
Oh, it was just like a dump there,
I bet it was.
and so finally, you know, I called and the, they said, you know, it was behind there and I started taking my things behind there.
Uhhuh.
So we do that with, because we have milk cartons, you know, constantly,
Uhhuh.
with two little kids,
Sure.
and the paper, but it just builds up,
Uhhuh.
it would be so nice if they had it, you know at your home,
Uhhuh.
where you could just turn it in so they, they final had enough of a response that they decided to try a small target area
Uhhuh.
in one neighborhood,
Right.
and they have pickup there, it's, uh, I think once or twice a week.
Uhhuh.
And the first couple weeks they did it nobody got their stuff out so they had not much participation, and they were going to cancel it,
Uhhuh.
but then finally people started getting the message.
Yeah.
It's just a matter of education, I think.
Yeah, and I think that, you know, if they can get enough going,
Uhhuh.
they'll continue it, you know, throughout the rest of the city but it's not, I think originally people thought it would be profitable for cities to do this,
Uhhuh.
and it's not going to be,
Yeah,
I don't think
yeah, that's right.
Yeah.
I think basically it's a good idea, you know, I hope it works.
Yeah, I do to because it's amazing, how much, you know, trash,
Absolutely.
we can generate,
absolutely.
I know this year we took our Christmas tree they had a place,
Right.
in the park where you could go have your tree shredded and they gave you a little, um, seedling to plant,
Uhhuh.
you know
Right.
you could take the, the mulch home with you, you know, and take buckets of that home,
Uhhuh.
so that was really good idea,
Sure.
I thought.
Absolutely.
And there's just, you know, the two of us my wife and I and it's amazing how much stuff j, just the two of us generate,
Yeah
you know, I can imagine a family of, you know, four or five.
Oh, yeah it's really, it adds up so fast.
It really does.
Yeah.
As far as new stuff to recycle, you know, I don't really, I don't really know, I really hadn't thought about it to tell you the truth.
Yeah.
Well, they're working on diapers,
That's right, I was,
which would be great,
Uhhuh.
I've read so many different things about diapers and now their saying that e, originally they thought the disposables were just awful,
Uhhuh.
but now their saying that they're, ther, really not that much in comparison to the others because you don't have to use the water to wash them,
That's right.
and, you know, all different kinds of things too, so th, the diaper service, trucks apparently the fuel that they use and the fumes that they produce to deliver,
Uhhuh.
and drop those off
Yeah.
So I don't know what's the, you know, right thing to do but I really would hope that they would come up.
I know there was a brand just briefly on the market that was recyclable
Uhhuh.
but the landfill have to do something special, you know, for those,
I see.
but that just generates a tremendous of volume of trash too, so,
Oh, I'm sure it must.
Yes, you know I'm not personally involved because I don't, you know, I don't have any s, children that wear diapers,
Yeah.
but I'm sure it creates a large amount of, you know,
It does,
uh, refuse.
and you just feel guilty if you don't do,
That's right .
something with them, you know,
That's right.
because you hate to contribute to the problem,
Absolutely.
but on the on the other hand the alternatives aren't to great either
That's right, absolutely,
absolutely.
Yeah, I don't know what else they could recycle more of.
I guess we don't really use that many tin cans.
I guess there's some places where you can recycle aluminum but I don't know about like cans that you keep vegetables and stuff,
Uhhuh.
in, I don't know if those are recyclable or,
I think they're made out of aluminum,
Um.
Yes.
There are, there is a receptacle, you know, at the centers also for aluminum,
Yeah.
but again we don't, we don't generate that much so,
Yeah,
we don't,
we don't either,
Yeah.
we usually use frozen vegetables and things so we don't really have,
That's right.
much of that.
that, ninetynine percent of ours is newspaper and, uh, you know, uh, glass.
Yeah.
Well, now when we lived out in California they actually had places where you could recycle if you change the oil in your car,
Uhhuh.
or for aerosol cans and things,
Uhhuh.
like that because they say it's not safe to put those things,
That's right.
in the regular trash
Car batteries.
Yeah
Uhhuh.
Yeah.
I don't, you know I don't change my own oil,
so I don't, I don't, uh, don't have that problem.
Yeah.
Yeah, well other than that I'm not really sure,
Yeah.
we, we try to recycle old clothes
Uhhuh.
Yeah, well we do to as a matter of fact.
Our church has a place,
Right.
where you can take them and they, you know, pass them on to,
Yeah.
other families, so.
Yes we have one of those in town.
Uhhuh.
Yeah, yeah.
You know, our church each year has a, one of their major fund raisers is, you know, a garage sale.
Oh.
And there's a ton of clothes always, you know left over and I take those down to the, uh, it's called the Clothes Closet,
Uhhuh.
that's what it's called here in Plano.
Kind of like a Goodwill,
Right.
kind of place.
Uhhuh.
Yeah.
And they distribute them to the people,
Yeah.
that need them.
Yeah.
Yeah that's, that's real helpful,
Uhhuh.
too.
Yeah.
Well, I'm not sure I can't really think of anything else that we could recycle.
No, I can't either
Yeah.
I really can't, um, no, I, I really can't either.
Okay.
Okay, well, it was nice talking to you.
You to.
Take,
Okay.
care.
All right.
Byebye.
Byebye.
receiver>> running>>.
Okay, do you want to go first?
Well, I could barely hear what the switchboard operator was saying as what was the topic.
Fitness and exercise.
Oh, God
No, why don't you go first.
Okay, um, I like to do, uh, weight training and, and cycling.
And just walking, uh, swimming.
I used to do a lot of basketball and running and volleyball until I had some knee surgery last fall.
And the doctor said that running and jumping isn't real good for my knee anymore, so I had to kind of change my lifestyle a little bit
Well, let me ask a personal question, how old are you?
Thirtyeight.
Oh, well then you should see over thirtyfive everything goes downhill flop .
Well, the rest of me is in pretty good shape it's just that left knee that just doesn't want to do everything it used to.
Oh, you're lucky then because I've battled arthritis all my life,
Really?
I mean even since I was like about two or three.
Oh.
Then they diagnosed it, and usually most people are just absolutely crippled, and, uh, I do water aerobics.
Oh, I bet that helps.
Religiously do water aerobics,
Uhhuh.
I used to do it about six times a week and now I'm down to about four but it's about the only thing that keeps my mobility in sh, in there, uh, I tried weight training and I'm telling you, you just, I just can't lift the things.
Yeah.
And the shock on the system is, is just too much, so I have stuck to water aerobics basically, you know, the weightless thing and,
Yeah.
trying to keep this shape that way but, you know, it's hard to find.
I mean it's really hard to find a place that's going to offer water aerobics because what I'm finding is that if they do offer it, you get the crowd of women that are, I think they feel this is going to be an effortless sweatless way,
That's right.
to get in shape,
That's right.
without having to spend anything or it's the geriatric crowd.
That's right.
So, I've considered even becoming licensed to teach it.
Well, I mean, if, if you know what your routine is, you can do that by yourself, and you probably do.
Yeah, but you have to have an indoor pool.
This is true.
So, to find an indoor pool where either you can do this by yourself without, you know, drawing a lot of looks, means you're really going to do a strenuous workout activity you look very odd in the water,
Well, that,
that was the one place where I was also able to do weight training, and that does look very odd in the water.
I can believe that.
Have you tried the, uh, the pool at the Spring Creek Fitness Center?
No, and you know, that's the only place I haven't tried and people have told me.
Now that's the Texins facility?
Yes.
I have been told that thing is just lovely.
It is.
They keep it at eightyone degrees yearround.
Huh.
He, do you use that facility a lot?
Um, a fairly, a fairly good amount, uh, more on the weekends, uh, I try to beat the traffic in the mornings when I workout in the mornings, I try to come down to the Dallas Fitness Center.
Huh.
Do you know if they have child care there?
Um, have you done your attitude survey for this year yet?
You need to put that on there, seriously.
They don't, I don't, I don't work at T I.
Oh, you don't?
No, I used to work at T I,
Oh.
as matter of fact I was the only woman that they had in the field in a management position actually when I was working there I was the only woman that was pretty much in the industry and I used to fill out those attitude surveys,
Yeah.
and, uh, uh, me and the insurance adjusters are, are very familiar with each other and my husband still works there,
Yeah.
and, um, I get my attitude expressed through them, but I find it to be very sometimes it's kind of shoot yourself in the foot short, mentality to save a few bucks.
This is true.
Uh, and never having lived in Texas before I starting working for T I and I came down here and, you know, they did an attitude survey like six weeks after I had been working here and I asked about, you know, day care for the shift workers,
Yeah.
and boy I was pulled in by my manager and told that you just don't say that, you know,
Well, it's not,
it was not applicable to me and I was kind of horrified.
Now what year are we talking about?
We're talking nineteen seventyeight.
Okay, uh, things have become much more enlightened since then.
They couldn't have gotten anymore in the dark ages
Yeah, you know, we still don't have a day care facility but people are more sympathetic to it.
I understand, I understand that they're now covering women's preventative health care,
Yes.
Yes.
and, uh, the reason I'm at home is when I had my kids, and I was scheduled to go back and I tell you how much in the dark ages it was.
Um, I had been rated number one in the field and then I took, uh, when I became pregnant I also got meningitis,
Oh.
and then delivered the first baby three months early,
My gosh.
and they put the baby on a heart lung monitor when I took her home, and the insurance carrier was not going to cover this because it was considered preventative treatment.
Could you hold the phone for one second,
Sure.
Thanks.
Okay, I'm back.
And then they used to, uh, and then I had a second one eighteen months later, they told me to put them back to back and, of course, to maintain and I was flat on my back for the last five months with the second one,
Wow.
because that's when I go into labor four and a half months and I don't even know it.
Of course it's real easy to take care of the first one when you're on your back.
Oh, yeah, very easy, very easy and they, they put me on twentyfour hour fetal monitoring then to, to try to control the labor and see how far it was going, and after the baby was born, since it wasn't premature, then they said they wouldn't cover the cost of the monitor.
I think that's kind of when my husband hit the roof,
Really.
because it was a, uh, thirteen thousand dollar bill, but after the second baby was born I was going to go back to work,
Yeah.
and that was when they had, God it would have been the eightyfive layoff,
Yeah.
and I'll tell you how they handled this and I was just outraged, I did not know that since I was on personal leave of absence that I had been, uh, terminated until I filed my insurance claims about four months later and they didn't have any coverage under my name and I went back and I said what the hell is going on here, you know.
Yeah, really.
And they told me that, uh, oh, well, you know, you know, your husband works here and he's got a good salary we didn't think that you'd be coming back anyway, and, uh, you know, we've got people here that really, you know, need to be working and so that we had just, you know, it was, this way we didn't have to layoff an active person and we'd just let you go.
And it took me about a year of arguing, I said, you know, I've got to put this in writing to me,
Yeah.
and because until they put it in writing, I couldn't get my insurance benefits and I couldn't get my, uh, termination benefits either.
There you go.
I was just pissed as hell that they could do that.
I, I can believe that.
But I, I guess things have gotten better, I've been told that this flex hour and those kind of things ,
Oh, yeah, flex time is great.
I still don't think that, they after my experiences that they could, you know, get me to go back, ever again
I, I can understand.
I can understand.
Well, it's been good talking with you.
But let me ask you this, since you use Texans, how much is it a month?
Oh, shoot it's only about ten bucks a month.
Now that's for individual.
Yeah, I mean, uh, to add dependents is, is you know, maybe another dollar or something it's no big deal.
That's it?
Yeah.
Now if you, if you pay your monthly charge, do you then pay separately for classes your taking?
Uh, you do for classes, for classes, but to, I mean to use any of the facilities is, is no extra charge.
God, that's cheap.
Yeah, it is.
That's really cheap.
Do you have to be an active T I employee to join Texans or,
Or, or a depe, or a dependent of one.
Or a depe, God, I am so dependent these days.
Really.
It's a sense
Oh, seen that my, my codependents have turned on the hose and are getting my neighbors fence.
Wonderful.
Yeah
So my position for management to domestic goddess has been an adjustment but boy, I think I'm going to go contact Texans.
I really think I am,
Yeah.
I mean, that beats any offer I've heard in a long time.
Oh, yeah, it's great.
Huh.
All righty.
When you're there on weekends is it crowded as hell?
Uh, well, it would depend on when you go it's not, it's not excessively crowded on the weekends.
See I'd want to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty
Oh, I don't think that would be bad at all.
If you're in Richardson you'd probably wanted to come to the, to the Dallas site.
Oh, I'm actually right on the Plano line.
Oh, well, then you could go either one,
Yeah.
the Spring Creek one is a lot more modern, has a lot more niceties, amenities and you'd probably like the pool there.
Oh, God it sounds like I would.
I might do that then.
Okay, I learned something here.
Well, good.
I'm glad.
You can go back to work now.
Well, thank you.
Thank you.
You have a good day.
Byebye.
Byebye.
Well, Patricia, I was just about to get on my tread mill, and then I remembered that I didn't make a call last night, and I thought I'd make one tonight.
Well, I have an exercise bicycle in my bedroom, but it usually's holding clothes
That's what I did with mine,
for a long time, put it on the handlebars so I can hang them up.
Right
And sometimes she just flops them all over the seat.
Well, that's not why I got it, right
How do you like your tread mill?
I like it.
You don't get, is it less boring than the bicycle or not.
No, it's just as boring.
You watch T V or something while you do it?
I read a book while I'm doing it.
Oh.
But I was doing that on the exercise bike.
Well, I do that too.
I feel like I'm getting a little better of a workout, and I'm losing more weight on this
Really.
than on the other.
Are you?
And my legs, you know, how, okay, I'm going to turn forty this summer, I was getting all dimpled up
Yeah.
And those are going away.
Really.
So that's real good.
Uhhuh.
We got it at a little bit of an incline.
Are they kind of expensive.
Uh, this one, yeah, this is five hundred.
Uhhuh.
I know they get cheaper.
They do?
Uhhuh.
Probably the more you pay, though, the better the machine you have.
Well, I hope so.
Well, you can believe that anyway, right.
Yeah.
I didn't buy it really.
My husband bought it because we, we'd never get out and go walking or anything, and we go to the lake and we ski and swim in the summer but
During the year.
besides that, uhhuh.
Yeah, well, in bad weather, you know, well you'd have to do something inside.
Yeah.
Do you work at T I?
Uhhuh.
I think, your voice sounds familiar.
Really.
Where do you wo,
I live in Arlington.
I wonder if we talked before.
Where do you live?
I'm in Garland.
No, uh, well,
You sound like this girl that I talked to about books, and we got into movies one night.
Oh, really.
Uhhuh.
Uh, no, this is the first time I've done it.
Uh, my husband was just running out the door, he's working at night tonight.
So I decided to do it
I haven't talked before.
Uh, what subjects have you talked about?
Let's see, education.
Oh
Social changes that we've seen in the last ten, twenty, thirty years.
Well, that's interesting.
Yeah, that one was.
It's more interesting than the treadmill and the bicycle.
Right?
The most boring one was about what meal would you cook for a sit down dinner.
Oh, my goodness
The other woman didn't cook too much either.
Right.
really have a lot of variety.
Yeah, they do.
I talked to this old woman that was a retired administrator in Ohio one night about education.
Oh,
And she was,
A school administrator.
Uhhuh,
Well that could,
Retired, but.
That would have been interesting.
Yeah, and then one night I talked to these two guys, no, one night I talked to one guy and then a couple of weeks later I talked to the guy's roommate, in Virginia, about different things.
Really, well that's neat.
Uhhuh.
One was about painting.
When was the last time you painted something? Did you feel like you did a good job? Did you feel, uh, rewarded while you were doing it.
Hm.
Uhhuh.
How long is this going to go on, do you know?
I don't know.
I don't either
It's interesting, though.
I never heard of such a project before.
Huhuh.
Well, how'd you find out about it?
Pardon me?
How did you find out about it?
Oh, I don't know.
I guess my husband got a letter at the office, I, I presume, and they must have been asking.
Does your husband work with T I.
Uhhuh.
Oh really.
Uhhuh.
I have a friend that had a roommate
Uhhuh.
that worked at T I and she saw it on the computer screen
and they made copies of it.
Oh, so they wanted any, anybody, don't have to work at T I.
Uhhuh.
Well, that's interesting.
Uhhuh.
I had no idea that was just for the employees, and I couldn't understand, I kept getting these calls, I thought it was an advertisement and they just were also called T I, you know, there is Texas Industries and different things.
Uhhuh.
I kept hanging up on them for days, until my husband told me what it was
Oh
I didn't know.
Well, if you work for T I you're supposed to get a prize, is what I heard, and if you don't work for them you're supposed to get cash.
Ooh.
But then on the letter it says cash or prize.
Oh.
Well the prizes are pretty nice.
He brought a booklet home and depending on how many calls, I think three was the minimum.
But it went up to, I don't know, nine or ten.
How many calls have you ma, had?
I don't know, gobs.
Well, it sounds like a lot.
This is going on my fourth week to do it.
Oh, my.
And some of the prizes are pretty nice.
Well, like what, tell me.
Oh, I wish I had that booklet here.
Oh, I think I do, it's right here.
I'll look at the end because those would be the best ones, okay?
Yeah.
Um, well, they have some watches that look really nice.
There's one that's got some diamonds on it.
For how many calls?
Does it say?
I haven't quite figured that out.
I thought it was eight or nine, but seems like too nice a prize for nine, just nine calls, isn't it?
Uhhuh.
Says when we have enough calls from you,
background saying Stephen did you start the grill?>>
you will receive in the mail a numbered certificate for your calls and and explanation how to redeem,
in background:
pour some charcoal in there>>.
for gifts.
Are you listening to him?
No, I'm trying not to.
He's telling me to start the grill.
Oh
It says three for a B gift, five for a C gift, et cetera.
And this only goes up to F.
So I thought that was somewhere around nine.
But anyway, it's got these beautiful watches on it.
Let me see what else it has a, uh, clock radio that also plays c, uh, you know, tapes.
Then it's got, oh some binoculars, and some pretty brass lamps.
Got some, oh, a food processor.
So it's not all stuff that T I makes.
Oh no, I don't, I haven't seen anything in here that T I makes.
The Mister Coffee, the double Mister Coffee, you know, the two.
Oh, and there's a phone in here that's hilarious.
It has a button you can push, if you get a call you don't like then it makes machine gun noise
And then there's an attache case, and cordless telephone, and then there's a card table, doesn't have any chairs, just a card table.
Oh, some more jewelry, suitcases, and have you seen those univ, anniversary lamps where the little balls go around.
You mean the clocks.
Yeah, clocks.
Yeah.
I can, I'm going crazy, my daughter's playing the piano and I can't think.
Oh, god.
It's got one of those, and um, well, it's got a lot, I mean, pages and pages.
It's got wheelbarrows.
A lot of kitchen stuff, of the mixer, the toaster, a waffle maker, popcorn popper, all kinds of stuff like that.
Here's where, here's a calculator but it's not even made by T I, isn't that funny.
Did they mail that to you, or he brought it to you?
He brought it home.
Huh.
I believe it came in his, uh, his mail.
Here's a camera and a dustbuster and some tools, someone, a lot of tools, a man might like you know.
Yeah, so you're bound to find something you want.
Oh yeah, you're bound to.
All kinds of phones and clocks and, uh, here's more jewelry and oh, there's even pictures and little porcelain things to put on a coffee table.
Oh, here's some brass animals, brass candlesticks, they're pretty.
So I'm sure you'd find something.
Yeah.
And, uh.
Well, you know,
Silver plated bowls and stuff.
There's a lot of stuff, it's a big booklet.
Well, do you know you have a ten limit, a ten minute time limit.
Oh, no.
Well that's okay, and then they come on and tell you, and they tell you got five seconds to say goodbye.
Oh, well, it's been fun, this is my first time to do it.
We'll keep talking if we want to come up with something else.
Yeah.
Let's see, oh, I tried exercise classes, and I never would go.
We fin, we joined, ex.
I went to Metropolitan a couple of years ago, so I sit and study, I sit in class, and I have really ballooned up since then, and, so, he's says I ought to join one of those that makes you go, but ,
They don't either,
Well the first one I joined, they went out of business and they transferred it to another one that was really far away.
That's a very common experience.
And we were going to do it, there was four of us together.
Well, then forget that, it wasn't near me.
No.
And then the second time I was going to do it at Richland College, and we, I just get with another friend, and we'd end up just smoking cigarettes and riding around like we couldn't find the place
That's funny
So my husband's just discouraged me on those things.
Right, well, if you, if you can make yourself do the tread mill, I mean, gosh, that's a good workout.
Oh yeah, my husband said he's never joined a course, right.
And I got one of those Jane Fonda workout tapes that I dubbed from a friend.
Uhhuh.
That didn't last long I had a baby, I think
Yeah, right, each one of those puts on a few pounds, doesn't it.
How many children do you have?
Two.
Yeah, I do, too.
Two, a girl, one's in college, so I don't have a, have a baby anymore
Oh, Lord, you're lucky.
Well, I've got a stepdaughter, she's in college.
Oh, well.
So there's where the money goes.
tell me about it, tell me, ,
Where's you ki,
putting two of us through, isn't he lucky.
Two.
Well, me, I'm going, and my daughter Janet in Austin.
Uh.
Yeah, right.
So, I'll probably have to sell the prize I get
Where you going to school?
U T A right here.
And what are you doing?
Well, I'm, um, going to be certified as an English teacher teach English as a second language.
Yes, I do.
I just got my certification.
You're kidding.
Huhuh.
Oh, that's ,
The test is a booger.
The test, the exit test.
Hard.
It's hard.
Oh, no.
It is so hard.
Really.
Uhhuh.
Really, how are the other ones.
I haven't taken any of the exit tests.
See I didn't have to take any other exit test because I've been teaching for quite a while.
Oh, yeah, before they started ,
But I've heard they're terrible.
Really.
Bilingual is just horrendous.
I've had friends fail that twice.
Really.
I didn't know any of this.
None of my friends have failed the English or the education ones
Good.
I really ought to take those quickly while I still remember some.
Uhhuh.
Yeah, right after you get out.
I know.
Boring and they really don't help you a whole lot.
Now see, I went to E T and I took one course through T W U and boy yelling in background>> most of the training I've got has been through Dallas just teaching E S L.
Oh .
From Chapter One Tea .
Okay Charles, uh, gun control, what are you, uh, for, in favor or no comment?
I'm very much in favor of gun control.
Oh, you are?
Yes I am.
Well, this should be very interesting,
because I'm against it.
I don't, I don't mind people owning guns, I just think it should be a little, you know, a little, a little more regulated.
Well, you know, uh, now he, here's something that, uh, first occurred to me when they started having all these problems with these automatic, uh, weapons.
Yes.
Uh, now there always has been a federal law against fully automatic weapons.
I believe that's correct, uhhuh.
And, yet, their, uh, the gun control enthusiasts are, are, uh, preaching about the gun control and how they should be, we should have stronger laws and what not.
Uhhuh.
I don't understand why we don't enforce the laws we have.
That would certainly help, I'm sure.
Now this is not just a state law, this is a federal law,
Uhhuh.
controlled by the Treasury Department.
Yep.
Uh, for fully automatic weapons.
Uhhuh.
And, uh, all right, now for instance,
in California where they passed the uh, uh, semiautomatic
Uhhuh.
or, or, uh, now what was it they called them? The military version, attack weapons,
Yeah, right, uhhuh.
or something? Uh, h, how is that going to affect the, uh, sports weapons? I mean, rifles,
Uhhuh.
that are automatic or semiautomatic?
Yep.
I really don't have any problem, Jack, with, you know, uh, people using firearms for sporting purposes.
I don't have any problem, the only thing I, I am in favor of the sevenday waiting period.
I would like to see that, see that happen.
I,
Uhhuh, well, now, uh, I've got to admit I'm inclined to agree with you there
Uhhuh.
uh, even though I am a member of the N R A,
Uhhuh.
and they are again, they, their reason being that well, if you let one little law get through, pretty soon one's going to stack up on top of another,
Right.
and so forth and so on.
Yeah, I understand that.
And you've got to admit that Congress does kind of look at things that way.
Uhhuh, that's true.
I, I, like I say, I don't have any problem with people using firearms, you know, for sporting purposes or hunting purposes, I just think it 's just may be a little too easy you know, to acquire one.
Uh,
On, on a whim of some sort.
That, that's true.
Uh, now did you hear about the, the control that they have up in Virginia?
I'm not sure I have.
Uh, it, it's, it's a little hard to believe, but they can, uh, of course, like just like just about every other state in the union they have a felony law.
Anyone ever convicted of a, a felony is, cannot purchase a weapon.
Uhhuh.
and they don't have a waiting period, because they have access to computer records concerning all these felons.
Uhhuh.
And the, uh, when you go in and buy a weapon or a handgun in, uh, uh, Virginia, the salesman just calls some number and, uh, punches in your name, and if it comes up negative, okay, fine, and you get your gwu, your gun right then and there.
I see.
Uh, but they are the only state that does it.
Hm, that's interesting.
And, uh, according to Virginia, it didn't cost all that much.
Uhhuh.
and frankly, I, I don't understand why a state doesn't have those records available anyway.
Yeah,
Uh, uh, at least
yeah, you would think they would.
uh, records of, of, uh, known felons
Uhhuh.
which are available to local police departments.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, I'm surprised that more states doesn't do that.
Uh, uh, uh, certainly those, those records are available,
Uhhuh.
and all they would have to do is expand it.
Yeah, right.
To, uh, uh, well, connect them into a modem somehow.
Uhhuh.
I wouldn't think it'd be that difficult to do.
Well, Virginia is not a particularly rich state, and they managed to fi, squeak out a few bucks to do it.
Yep, right.
And, uh, it's, uh, uh, onehundred percent successful.
Hm, that's interesting.
Yeah, I just heard about this last week.
Uhhuh.
Uh, they were bragging about it,
Yeah.
with, uh, uh, they should have, have pride in this because it's, it's a good system,
Absolutely.
and it's working well.
Yeah, I agree.
And they don't need that sevenday waiting period.
Uhhuh.
Because the whole idea of that waiting period was,
so that, uh, it, uh, the police could check up on you.
Yep.
Well, you know what's going to happen there, those files are going to back up on somebody's desk, just some of that typical bureaucratic work.
Uhhuh.
that's another, uh, uh, thorn in my side,
Uhhuh.
bureaucratics,
Yeah, right.
I agree.
politicians.
Yep, right.
I was,
So anyway
just thinking there's,
well, we seem to be one in favor and one against.
yeah, I guess that's about right,
Although neither one of us are, are, uh, really uh, uh, dyed in the wool.
Uh,
Uh, we, but we both,
Yeah, I'm not totally rigid on the subject, I just think there should be, you know, shouldn't be quite so easy to do.
well, there should be some way of checking,
Uhhuh.
now here in, in Texas, uh, all you need is a driver's license.
Right.
Uhhuh.
And, uh, even felons can still get a driver's license.
Sure, uh,
So I, I don't think they are too, well, they're not rigid enough here, in Texas.
Yeah, that's true.
But don't tell the N R A I said that.
I wo, I promise.
I won't
They're liable to tear up my membership.
Okay, I promise
You say you retired a year ago?
Yes, I did, uhhuh.
I'm looking forward to it in about a, just, just over a year, myself.
Yeah, I really enjoy it.
Uh,
I stay pretty busy.
Uhhuh.
I do quite a, not quite a lot, I do some, uh, volunteer work here in Plano.
I, I have a few, uh, handicapped persons that I, you know, try to do things for, help them do.
Oh, uhhuh.
Well, uh, I bought a motor home here f, four years ago
Uhhuh.
and I have been living in it ever since,
That's, uh,
and I'm looking forward to just traveling.
Sure, I can understand that.
I have four sons scattered all over the country,
Uhhuh.
and a f, few grandchildren.
Yep.
And I'm looking forward to just traveling around visiting them.
That'd be neat.
Sure would.
Well Charles, good luck to you on your,
Okay.
Nice talking to you.
Yeah, nice talking to you,
Okay.
too.
Take care.
Take care now.
Byebye.
Bye.
So, uh, describe your family budget.
Well, I've, uh, for a lot of years I, I've pretty much flied without one, and, uh, just recently, uh, we, we set up a budget, and, and we're trying to stick to it.
We just bought a new house.
So we've got everything, you know, pretty much we know what our, uh, our fixed expenses are per month, and then we've got some ones that are variable, that pretty much stay within a certain range, and then, uh, then there's the ones that you never know anything about, and that's, that's the food budget.
Well, yeah, and to some extent, utilities, I imagine.
Yeah, well, the utilities are pretty much, you can pretty much figure what they're going to be, and one of the nice things here is the electric company has a plan where they'll average them out for you.
They have that to some extent here, but it's not quite as good.
Uhhuh.
And, uh, transportation expenses, I guess you own a car.
Yes sir.
And you know how much you're going to drive every week?
Well, I used to, um, I used to know, uh, fairly close to exactly how many miles I drove, because I, I was very convenient, I lived, uh, nine tenths of a mile from work.
Huh.
So, so, it was, you know, two miles a day to and from work.
So it kind of cut my transportation costs a lot.
But now I've just bought a new house, and I'm a half hour, and so my transportation costs have gone up by, uh, five times
Yeah, I understand that.
We, we have a real similar situation.
Ours, uh, have quintupled, at least.
So there is a real family budget.
Yeah, pretty much, um.
The problem is there never seems to be enough money.
I have three children, and it seems like the more money you make, the more money you have, the more things that they seem to need, and, uh, of course, nothing ever goes down, I mean, uh, I remember, I have five children total.
I have three left in the house.
Yeah.
And I can remember years ago, when school would start, and I'd go buy all five kids, you know, shoes, and I could get out of the, out of the shoe store without spending more than thirtyfive dollars.
Nowadays, thirtyfive dollars buys about one pair of shoes
If you're lucky.
yeah, so I mean things have just really gone out of sight in the last, uh, I guess about the last ten years.
Exempt or nonexempt.
I'm exempt.
Wow, must be nice.
Part of the high price spread.
Uh, no, well, we don't, we do, but we don't have a family budget.
We have the fixed things we have to pay.
Uhhuh.
And we have the things that are extras.
But it seems that by and large the extras just don't exist.
Yeah.
And, well, you know, the auto budget, car payment sucks a hell of a lot of it dry.
Uhhuh.
And insurance, is insurance bad there?
Um, I've got, uh, two older cars.
There both, one's a seventyseven and one's a seventyeight.
Well, we've got one eightynine.
And my insurance is about, it was running about four hundred dollars a year.
But when I moved to the new town I live in, because it's a different county, which has less crime, and, uh, less, you know, less highways and so it's a cheaper place to live, as far as the insurance company's concerned, so my, my, I think my insurance dropped about sixty dollars a year.
Wow.
That's not bad, four hundred and something a year.
That's, that's,
It's actually three hundred and forty for each one of the cars.
That's cheaper than we pay.
Yeah, I was down in Texas for two years, and I was paying unbelievable rates for both car insurance and for home insurance.
Um,
Well, here in Colorado it's even worse because we have no fault.
Yeah.
Do you have that there?
they have no fault in Maryland also.
Well, no fault's rather funny in Colorado, because it seems that everyone pays all the time
Yeah.
instead of just the guilty party pays.
Uhhuh.
Yeah.
It's kind of, it's kind of strange here the way things go.
Uh, here if you have an accident and no one's injured, the police won't even show up.
You're kidding.
Nope.
They say if nobody's injured, you all exchange names and take it up with your insurance company.
God.
Well, if you, I don't know how familiar you are with Maryland, but, uh,
Not at all.
especially, the center part of Maryland where I NinetyFive runs through it is really heavily populated.
There's just so many people and so many accidents every single day that it'd take a whole another police force just to answer the traffic.
They don't even try to keep up with it.
No.
God.
Not a bit.
So you lived in Texas for a while.
Yes sir.
Huh.
I spent, uh, couple of years down there.
Moved down there in eightyseven and moved out in eightynine.
Are, where you from originally.
Uh, right here in Maryland.
Huh, so you just basically went home when you had a chance.
Yeah, my family, uh, didn't like Texas, and I had a chance to, uh, transfer up.
T I bought a company about seven months after I moved to Texas, right here in .
That's nice.
So I got an opportunity to transfer back, and I took it.
God, that's great.
Uh, I'm a native Texan.
Uhhuh.
West Texan.
Yeah.
There is a difference.
Yeah, believe me, I know there is.
I lived in Plano, and I don't know if you're familiar with Plano
Yeah.
but Plano, maybe five percent of the Plano actually were from Texas.
Everybody else was an import.
Well, I'm a West Texan.
Uhhuh.
Lubbock, Midland Odessa
Yes.
Amarillo, Dumas, Panhandle.
Yeah.
A different world from down there.
Yeah.
So, uh, Colorado's been fun.
But they have a real problem.
Next to every window the state seems to have put up a turnstile.
And every time you look at a, look at the mountains
Yeah.
or think about looking at the mountains, you got to throw in a dollar.
Or so it seems.
I may just be paranoid, but that state income tax is just eating me alive.
Yeah, yeah, they have a state income tax in Maryland.
But I noticed when I was in the, in the, in Texas, they didn't have a state income tax, but they sure nailed you on those darn county taxes and,
Yeah, yeah.
school taxes and property taxes,
Property taxes and,
Oh my God, ate you alive.
Yeah, well, Colorado, ins, you know they have the state income tax, but then they also have property taxes, and they also have sales taxes, and they just get you every direction they can.
Yeah.
And I just don't know, sir, but it seems like they trying to get you every which way.
Yeah, it sure does.
Um, there's, uh, some good books that I've read, um, that you might be interested in.
Uh
Oh yeah?
Charles D.
Gibbons is the guy who runs some ads on light night T V and he's got seminars you can go to, and they try to hook you into his organization, which costs about four hundred bucks.
But he's got a couple of books out.
One of them is called, uh, WEALTH WITHOUT RISK.
I've heard of the book.
Yes, it's a very good book.
It's tells you how to cut money on your taxes and on your insurance and then
Legally?
what to do with the money that you save.
Legally,
Yes, yes,
cut money on your taxes.
Huh.
legally, legally cut money on your taxes, and on your insurance, and then he tells you how to invest that money in order to, uh, you know, be wealthier.
Uh, he also has a new book out that I purchased right before I moved and haven't had a chance to crack it open yet.
Um, FINANCIAL SELF DEFENSE is the name of it.
Uh, the man, uh, has a lot of good ideas, some of them I already knew about, some of them I had already practiced.
But I suggest it to anyone who wants to be better off financially to read it because, uh,
And that includes everyone at T I.
Yes, I'm one of the ones that had my salary frozen for ninetyone.
Yes.
Well, even, the, you know, the nonexempts, technically yet we haven't had our salary frozen yet.
Yet.
But when you're only at living wage it doesn't matter.
You know, survival is a funny state.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I, uh, when I was in Dallas I was supervisor, and I had four non exempts, um, under me.
Yeah.
And, uh, I was appalled at what, how they were paying them.
I just couldn't believe it.
Did, well, I've been with the company for sixteen years now.
I was a W F for several years, and it just n, never seems to improve.
It, and it doesn't seem to get much better for the exempts either, unless you're twentyeight or above.
Yeah, yeah.
It's really a shame.
Well, I, I've, this company that they bought, they ended up buying a very high payroll.
Oh.
And, uh, the, you know, I thought I was making a good wage,
Okay, do you have
Are you there?
Yeah.
Okay
There, okay.
Okay.
Had to mess with my phone here.
Um, do you have children?
Yes, I have one.
Oh, okay.
How about you?
I have three.
Oh, my goodness
Yeah
Yeah, uh, do you work?
Yeah, I do.
Okay.
I do, I work and, and, uh, Brian's in a day care center.
He's uh, he was two in December,
Oh.
so he's not quite two and a half yet.
Uhhuh.
He, uh, I put him, I'm kind of had different, different ideas from what probably the majority of people have,
Uhhuh.
I put him in a day care center from the very beginning.
He started in day care when he was eight weeks old.
Oh, no kidding.
And I just, I don't know, I have kind of the opposite opinion of most people,
Really.
I have had this real problem with a, a private individual.
I mean I, I kind of looked at it like if you take him to a home with a, with private individual, when the door shuts,
Yeah.
that one person has total control,
Yeah.
and I always figured at least in a day care center there are other people around,
Yeah.
and if you get one bad apple, there's are at least other people that can see it.
Yeah.
They can watch, and
Yeah, yeah.
I just kind of always felt that the chances of something happening were less.
Uhhuh.
Because there's,
You know, how can you help depending on the day care center, you know,
Yeah.
you got to when you hear about all the horrible things that happen in day care centers, have you ever noticed they're always like a family owned center where the mother and the daughter and the son run it, you know, kind of thing.
It's like a family thing.
Yeah, yeah.
You never hear about it really in the big ones.
Yeah.
So, that's what I did and I have had just excellent luck.
Oh, good.
I have been just so happy.
He's,
Oh, good.
I was just going to ask you how it, you know, if you liked the, the, but obviously you do or you wouldn't have him there, I know, but,
Right.
Right.
Well he was in, he was in the same center for two years,
Uhhuh.
for the first two years, and, uh, it was wonderful, and I loved it, and I was so happy there and the woman who owned it sold it.
Oh, gosh.
But, I thought okay, I'm going to keep an open mind here,
Right.
and the people who came in, it just wasn't, it,
Wasn't the same.
just wasn't the same and their,
Uhhuh.
their attitude and philosophy was just completely,
Uhhuh.
opposite from mine, and I left him there for about a month and just decided I can't do this anymore, and I,
Yeah.
moved him, which was an extremely traumatic experience but.
Was it? Yeah.
but, he's done well, he's been there,
Good.
a couple of months now, and I just feel so lucky.
Oh, good.
Yeah.
That's great, that's good.
How about you? Do you work or do you get to stay home with them?
Well, I got to stay home with my kids for the first ten years.
My oldest one is ten and a half now,
Wonderful.
or she's, I guess, yeah, it's, was about ten years.
So I, yeah, I, I was really happy that I was able to do that.
But, I, that's what I wanted to, because I, uh, you know I just couldn't wait to have kids and so, if I was, I was so anxious to have them and I couldn't wait to have them it would be kind of silly, you know, to go back to work as soon as I had them, so,
Right.
Right.
so, it, it, it, it was really great.
By the end of the ten years I was really ready
Yeah.
I bet
to go back to work, and my youngest was only, uh, two and a half
Uhhuh.
I mean she was already two and a half,
Uhhuh.
so it wasn't, you know, she wasn't an infant.
A baby.
Yeah.
Yeah
Yeah.
Yeah, so, I felt real good about that, but, uh, boy, I tell you with summer coming up I'm just pulling my hair out, in terms of what I'm going to do, I, I guess I,
went back to work about a year and a half ago and, uh, I worked full time all last year and now I'm going to school part time and, uh, graduate school, and I'm working part time
And, so I'm still,
I know how that goes
Yeah.
I'm still going full time, but I only have half time salary,
Yeah.
and, uh, when school lets out, I just don't,
I haven't, I have no idea what I'm going to do,
because I certainly can't afford what we did last year
Right, right.
which was,
Did you have them in a center or something last summer?
Well, we did, we tried, we had all different things, we sent them to camp.
One, first month, in June, they went to summer school, then the second month they, uh, one, my daughter went home to visit my Mom for a while and my son, uh, went to camp and there we had, uh, I don't know some, forget what else we did but it was all, uh, really expensive
Yeah, that stuff is expensive.
It really is.
So, now they're a year older,
and I, my daughter's eleven, going to be eleven this summer and my son will be,
nine and a half.
And so,
I'm not, I think I can leave them home,
for a, if I can work part of the day, you know, I'm going to leave them home.
Yeah, yeah.
I was going to say they're getting to the age where,
Right.
you should be able to trust that a little bit, yeah.
Yeah.
Yes, in fact I'm doing that right now with their afternoons, when they get home before I do.
You know,
that's okay.
But, the four year old now I hav, I have had her since I went back to work, or before I went back to work really, in a home day care situation,
Uhhuh.
and, uh, we've just been really thrilled,
with it too.
We were what, actually we, it took us two or three different people to find,
To find the right one,
Yeah.
that's what we have to do though.
Right.
But, I wasn't embarrassed to shop around you know,
No.
so, the, the person we found it through the, there's an association here in town of professional home,
care providers or something like that.
Where do, where do you live?
In Plano.
Plano?
Yeah, and they have a number you can call and all these people are registered with their association and, you know, go like our, our, uh, I don't want to call her a babysitter, she's doesn't like,
to be called that, care provider.
Care provider.
Right.
She goes to seminars and, uh,
Oh, that's wonderful.
she gets home visitations by the s, I don't know, the state boards, I guess, some of them and then some by the association, and they have weekly meetings and everything and, so it's just really, really well regulated.
That's great.
And, she's just great.
In fact, uh, she's all upset because Galen is going to go to kindergarten next fall and she says this is it, you know, I'm not going to have her anymore and I said, Oh, no, don't count on that
After noon classes she's going to be here because she's going to morning kindergarten.
Right, right.
So, but, we, we've tried, we've tried everything and one year, I guess last year when I went back to work I had my son was eight at the time, just barely eight, and, uh, we put him in Amrein's Day Care, after.
Uhhuh, I've heard that,
After,
they were very good.
Well, that's why we picked it, because they were, were supposed to be real great, and, you know, I think they were fine, but the thing is he was in school all day,
Uhhuh.
in second grade, in, in Plano, it's open classroom situation where they don't have walls,
Uhhuh.
so there is like a hundred and twenty second graders
Oh.
in the same area with no walls.
And, uh, and then he'd get on the Amrein's Bus to go to Amrein's and then there would be a whole ton of other kids, all in the same room, you know,
Yeah.
you know what fun they had with these computer games and then they'd go outside for awhile, they had snacks and story time and everything.
But, it was just like going to school until five thirty at night instead of being able to get home at two thirty.
Poor kid was in school all day.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Because he was always around with a crowd of kids and he just really missed being able to be by himself,
Uhhuh.
and having some peace and quiet or, you know.
Uhhuh.
Even at that age they need that time,
Yes.
we all need that time,
Yeah.
just some quiet time to wind down from the day.
Right.
That's exactly it.
So, another thing that we tried to do, I, I know your son's too young right now, but we're trying, we tried to sign him up for after school scouts and,
Yeah, yeah.
stuff like that and,
I think that's really important,
Yeah.
and we've already started about, you know, I mean, how young can they start TBall and soccer?
Right
You know, I mean, I just, you know, we both think of that that as just so important,
It is.
to get him involved in stuff like that and,
It is.
And,
you could hardly wait, I mean, he's, he's so much fun now,
Yeah.
he's really, he's really starting to get lots of fun and I can't wait until stuff like that starts happening
I bet, yeah.
you know, and, you know, we did the Easter egg hunts,
Uhhuh.
which was really the first year he was really able to
Un, understand.
and to know what we wan, know what he was doing
Yeah.
you know, and enjoy it, and it was so much fun and gosh he went a couple of weekends ago and rode an elephant and, God
Oh, my gosh.
You're kidding.
he got up on this elephant all by himself and Lord, I couldn't believe it.
You're kidding.
They had so much fun.
Oh, that's great.
I bought us tickets and stood there in line and I thought, I'm going to end up on this elephant with him
you know,
He did it by himself,
Well, good for him.
so stuff like that is starting to come along where it's really,
Uhhuh.
getting fun,
Uhhuh.
you know.
Yeah.
Day care has just done just incredible stuff with him and he like comes home with something new everyday, you know and so,
Well, that's great.
That's so good.
I know, I know they're working with him and he's excited to get there in the morning,
Uhhuh.
and just doesn't even want to kiss me goodbye.
It's just like bye, and he goes running,
He's out of there.
you know, and he's always having fun when I pick him up so, you know.
Yeah, this, this day care is, is,
Uhhuh.
it's Bright Steps in Lewisville.
And,
Uhhuh.
whenever you say Bright Steps, everybody goes, oh, I've heard that's the best day care in town, you know,
Yeah? Good.
and it's, it's one of those that's very hard to get into.
Uhhuh.
and they have, this, this, this woman owns three day cares, two in Lewisville and one in Irving.
Uhhuh.
and she had to open the second one up in Lewisville because,
Uhhuh.
her waiting list was just like, you know, like a year old, it was ridiculous.
Oh, my gosh.
And, she's got two day cares within like three blocks of each other.
No kidding.
Yes, so its,
She knows something right, that she and,
She knows what she's doing, all the teachers, like about half the teachers are degreed teachers.
Yeah, that makes such a difference.
Oh, it makes a huge difference.
That's the way it is at my daughter's nursery school too.
Uhhuh.
And I think that really makes a difference.
Yeah.
They're in it because it's a profession,
That's right.
That's right.
not because it's a job they could get because they didn't qualify for anything else, you know .
That's right.
And, his old day care as much as I loved it, you know,
Uhhuh.
and the owner, I really liked her and she worked really hard to get good people, but the people that she got
Uhhuh.
were there because they weren't qualified to do anything else
Uhhuh.
you know.
Right.
And, and I got lucky and all of his teachers were,
Because, because,
very good.
Right.
Some, sometimes that's fine, that's great, you know.
Yeah, but then sometimes, you know,
Sometimes it isn't.
You just have to.
Yeah.
Well, is it real expensive then?
Um, it just went up the first of this month.
I'm paying,
Uhhuh.
uh, seventy nine dollars a week for now.
So,
Wow.
It's a little high,
Yeah.
but, but it's, you know, it's like where he was before I was only paying sixty three, so there's quite a little jump there,
Right.
Right.
but, I looked all over Lewisville, I looked in every day care there was
Uhhuh.
in Lewisville, and,
Uhhuh.
you know, and there were places that were cheaper, but is it,
No.
you know, your peace of mind is worth a little bit of money,
Yeah.
you know, and I have peace of mind,
where he is
Uhhuh.
and some of those other places I wouldn't have.
That's exactly it.
See, we do the same thing, since Galen goes to nursery school,
we pay our, our home care provider, for our day care provider, full time for a whole week, but she, she's gone three mornings.
Galen just doesn't go there three mornings a week.
Yeah, yeah.
But, I said to her, I said, you know, it doesn't matter if for whatever re, when school holidays come around, I used to have such a problem with that.
Uhhuh.
They wouldn't have anything to do.
I'd either have to fade>>,
All right.
Um, there was a crime here in McKinney,
Uhhuh.
uh, a rather heinous murder.
There was no um, remorse shown by, uh, at least one of the perpetrators.
Uhhuh.
And yet, for whatever reason, um, his crime was not considered a capital crime.
Uhhuh.
An, and quite honestly I, I feel very strongly that the, man ha, the has no redeeming social values and if, if and when he comes, gets free again,
Uhhuh.
he will have no compunction but to complete that, that same kind of lifestyle, I mean continue that same kind of lifestyle,
and perhaps do the same thing again.
So, it really bothers me that there's not a way of getting him out of the way forever.
Really, I think that, I don't know, I don, I don't think our prison system isn't set up,
where we, um, rehabilitate, or, you know, restore anybody.
I think it'll only make them worse, but, I, I believe that God can come in and change a person's heart and genuinely change it, but, that doesn't negate that you do reap what you sow.
And if you do kill a person and it is, you know, you're found to be guilty, I believe God establishes the authority of our court system and I believe that, you know, that I do believe that capital punishment is, uh, alternative.
Even, you know, God can still change your heart but that doesn't mean, like the alcoholic that charges up all the bills on the credit card, or the shopaholic, you know you get your life right with God but you still have to pay your Visa bill.
That's, that's right
You still have to, you know, so, but God sent us his grace and they give pardons but I believe if it's a genuine conversion, there's a genuine, and those prison people know, they know a genuine turnaround in a person's character, they see that.
But, yeah.
And, I, I worked in a prison in Fort Worth.
Did you?
Yeah, I have a degree in social work.
You see it, you know the ones that have a genuine character change.
Uhhuh.
It is obvious.
And they know that.
They're, they're not going to pardon someone from the governor, you know what I'm saying, they're not going to go, without going through every channel of authority in the prison.
So I feel like you know, that's is, there is occasions where there are, they do spare lives and, you know, I leave that with the governor, who, of course, is going to go through every authority because they want to be be reelected, so
Yes but, my concern is,
first of all that not all, all persons who I think, should be receiving capital, uh,
Uhhuh.
whatever, capital, uh, tha, uh, th, uh, hum,
Punishment.
punishment, thank you, I'm sorry, I just got home from work and I'm just kind of spaced out a little bit.
Yeah, that's okay.
Uh, that, not all of them are being convicted of it, that, that, the, the, they're not even being charged with that appropr, I agree with you that, that,
Uhhuh.
a person's heart can be changed, but the same God that can work that miracle also established the laws that said, um, for certain kinds of sin, certain kinds of, of, uh, breaking of the law, there would be a capital punishment.
Uhhuh.
Right then it was, it was, uh, almost immediate.
Uhhuh.
As soon as, as the trial was over, then it was stoning.
Right, but, in, in the Old Testament,
We don't have a speedy trial, we don't have speedy, um, punishment and so it kind of loses its meaning,
Uhhuh, yeah.
if you sit on death row for months and years and so forth
Right, we don't, well, yeah we definitely have lost the JudeoChristian ethic of the judicial system for sure, but the ba, the base is still there, the foundation is still there, though, bu, of the system, but, I know what you're saying, uh, but also, they're under a law, because we haven't been removed from the law we've just been taken out from under, under a law.
Because under the law if your child mo, back talks you,
he would be stoned.
That's correct.
He, under the law he would be stoned, so we've been removed from the law, of un, from being under the law but we're still, you know, we're still accountable to it.
We don't need to back talk, but, you know, it's like God changes your heart to not do that.
He changes your heart not to look upon a woman in lust.
Because in the Old Testament, they could look all they wanted, just couldn't do it.
But in the new, he's looking at your heart and so, I guess that's what, what I mean by their character changes and, you know, what I mean, it's like looking beyond what they're doing and looking at a heart and seeing what is the heart, what's the character showing me here.
And, those, and then any of, if I don't think see, if I don't believe that there's not a character change and the authorities agree, that this person needs to be excused, I believe for murder, uh, rape, I even believe incest, things
Uhhuh.
that will permanently damage, uh, the character of the child.
I believe crimes against children should be punished bu, by, by death.
I believe,
I tend to agree on that, very strongly.
sexual crimes, unless there's a true change of character.
And that's where we just have to, to trust the authorities.
And they're not going to excuse people, if it was, was run like that, I don't, there would probably be very few exceptions to that and if it was done quickly and done swiftly and, but it's not, because the judicial system has rejected, they've rejected the answer to all these problems they have, pretty much.
Plus the, all the judicial system is overloaded with,
Right.
all kinds of, um, problems, and crimes and so forth and then all of the, um, civil things that clog the courts,
Uhhuh.
and having sat on both, uh, uh, criminal and a civil, uh, jury,
Uhhuh.
some of what goes through our courts is a total waste of time.
Yeah.
Because we're suit happy.
Yeah.
But, but back to the, to the capital situation, sounds like you and I have a lot of, of, of, uh, common ground at least as, as far as, as capital punishment is concerned.
Yeah.
I would like to see some, some kind of reform, or some kind of streamlining so that, if a person is, um, convicted,
Uhhuh
and sentenced to, to death, that that automatic appeal which goes in could be more quickly dealt with.
Uhhuh, yeah.
And, and go ahead and get the punishment phase out of the way, because it doesn't do the criminal or the victim's family,
Yeah.
Anybody, yeah.
r, r, any of us, the taxpayer any good to have him sitting around for months and years.
Yeah.
An, an, bu, him could be a her.
Right.
But.
I know in Jamaica, uh, it think it's Jamaica, I think it's Jamaica, I know that they have, you know, crimes punishable by death, and I'm sure they hit a few every now and then, and I wouldn't want to be one of them, that are not guilty.
But, I know that they have like, uh, their, crime rate, it's not Jamaica, I don't think, I can't remember which, it's, uh, one of the Caribbean Islands and, and they, Singapore, is it like that? My husband's going Singapore.
And they don't have a lot of the crime because there is a law and the law is enforced.
And that's what, wh, when you have lawlessness, I mean the law's not being enforced and all that does is lawlessness.
We were, we went on a mission trip to Manhattan and to the Bronx and stuff, two years ago, and all these kids were up on there getting arrested for crack and everyone was out, uh, we were across from that big bus station, I forget what you call it, but anyway, and everyone, they had like fifteen people lined up on the fence and within two hours, there were fifteen boys sitting there doing the same thing.
Um.
And, you'd see the same kid who were back out there in two days.
That's sad.
Because, there's no, the answer is not being given to them, in the court system and I think initially, when our country was set up, it was set up with God and it was really an integral part, and no, you can't, you can't force people, but I think people are hurting and they're out doing crack sitting on the street.
They were the kind of people that, I think mostly, we would want to receive it.
If it was presented to see.
I don't know, I guess, I'm kind of frustrated that, you know, we've gotten away from the Christian basis that our court system was founded upon.
I mean, it reeks of the BIBLE, just, the whole thing, the whole system.
And, so I feel like if that was presented more openly, and not just relying upon, and parachurch ministry to come in and do it, that, that the system itself, you know, you know what I mean.
Yeah.
I feel like that might be better, if it was run on a more scriptural basis, which would include, you know, you know, and expediting the penalties and just getting it over with.
However, certain uh, very liberal minded groups who do not, um, subscribe to the same ethical system that you and I do,
such as the, uh, civil liberties unions and so forth,
Right.
will lobby against that and hold that out as long as they have breath.
Right.
Which is most unfortunate because we all lose out,
Yeah.
when people go so far out to the extreme, on either side.
Yeah.
Because too, too often, they're can be extremism that, that hurts from, from any direction,
Yeah.
regardless of wha, whatever you're arguing or concerned about.
Right.
Yeah, I know, you're right, they would lobby that and, and I see that, and that's why, you know, I'm like, okay, what's my role in this thing, you know,
Yeah.
what's my part, because I don't think the system is going to get fixed.
I think it's crippled .
So, the, the topic is hobbies
In your spare time.
Yeah.
Who has spare time
Um, I don't really, don't really do any handicraft things like that.
I used to.
I used to do, like salt ornaments and things.
Uhhuh.
But that was, oh, good many, many years ago and
Yeah.
I have, I really, my spare time I usually go do aerobics and read, and that's,
Yeah.
about it
Yeah.
I understood that.
I'm, you know, I work full time and I have two kids so my spare time usually involves something with the kids.
Yeah.
You know, hobbies, we, I, I can't really say that we have hobbies.
It's more like maybe projects or something on the weekend.
You know, we like to go out
Yeah,
go out,
family.
Well, well, that's what I meant by salt that we, we did that like as a family, little ornaments and,
Oh.
Uhhuh.
things like that, and just kind of really got into it.
Like during the Christmas season,
Right.
making them up for other people and things like that.
But
Uhhuh.
as far as, I've just never been very skilled at,
far, you know, needle,
Uhhuh.
work
And the things I've tried to do just don't look very good
and,
I, I guess mostly as far as, as crafts go, I've done, um, some needlepoint.
I've done mostly cross stitching.
I used to, uh, do like, um, one that I did for both kids are like, oh, they're plaques with, you know, different kind of animals and then you have their birth date on them,
Yeah.
and then you have a little picture of them and you frame them and stuff,
Uhhuh.
but nothing steady.
Just when I get some spare time here and there I'll work on it, but, you know, it's nothing that I,
It's not,
can really,
like you sit and knit every night
No.
Not at all.
Yeah.
I don't even know how to knit and my mother used to knit, you know,
Uhhuh.
all the time and, and I don't even know how to knit
I'm like, that's a lost art from this family
Yeah.
So, um, but, it's not a very good topic it feels like,
No.
if, you know, not when you're n, neither one of us are really, I, I have seen things I really like,
Uhhuh.
you know, that were done, especially like needlepoint.
Needlepoint,
Yeah.
cushions and things.
But, it just seems like there'd be so much time involved in it,
Yeah.
you know, and, and that the petty point and things like that.
It's like, God, it, it seems like it's easier just to go out and buy it already made
I don't know what, what, is, it's like there, but here a lot of the country stuff is in, you know, a lot of the woodwork, a lot of, uh, stenciling.
Yeah.
And, you know, you can go to any, like a flea market and stuff and there's just tons of stuff everywhere and,
Yeah.
you know, people just do it in their garage and then on weekends they go out and sell it and during the week they go back and do some more.
And see, they do that as their job.
Whereas,
Right
you know, for us it, and they make it cheaper for us to buy
Yeah
Definitely.
So, but, and, I mean, I'm sure it must be relaxing to do things like that because I can remember when I used to do, you know, those little salt, those figurines and things.
It was, it was relaxing, you know, creative, you felt very creative.
Uhhuh.
But, it just was so time, time,
Yeah.
involved, you know, so much time involved and the different steps and things.
Uhhuh.
So, and,
Okay
Well, I think, I think we're okay.
I think we did five minutes, so we don't have to keep talking about nothing anymore
Yeah.
So,
Okay.
Well, thank you.
Okay.
I hope you have a good rest of your weekend.
Thanks.
Byebye.
Okay.
Byebye.
Well, this is a good subject, isn't it?
Yeah.
It's, it's something that you can really talk about.
Yeah.
Um, I don't know what we're going to do about it, but,
Uhhuh.
but it's certainly something that has a lot of things to talk about.
Um, you know, when they say the Middle East,
Uhhuh.
it's such a big area and there's so many different problems there.
Uh, what do you want to concentrate on.
It doesn't matter to me.
Well, uh, I'll tell you something, um, I, I have a sisterinlaw from Israel,
Uhhuh.
and, and they're really quite, uh, arrogant about it all.
They, they believe that they, they belong there and they've belonged there forever, and, the Palestinians and the Arabs are, uh, more or less, they, they consider them second class.
Uhhuh.
So, they're really quite arrogant about it.
I don't, uh, I don't know if that contributes to the problem.
Well how did they feel about the, uh, the United States interven, intervening with Patriot missiles, did, did they,
Oh, uh, I'm, I'm sure this is the one time that the Israelis are really happy to have their big brothers, the Americans,
Uhhuh
but, I didn't really talk about that with her.
She, um, um, my sisterinlaw now lives in, um, Switzerland.
Oh.
But, um, when they were living in Israel, it was, it was, the, the Palestinians, they, they come in an, and they're, they're nothing but really servants for them, and they really treat them like second class citizens.
They, they don't really want them around but they like them around because they do all the menial labor and such.
Uhhuh.
But they, they really do, they look down on them.
And, I don't know, being, I, I live in, uh, Vermont and being up here we pretty much treat everybody, you know, as someone that has merit, even if they're poor, or if they're Hispanic or if they're black.
We give everybody pretty much the benefit of a doubt because we don't see all the crime and, all the hurt in the big cities, you know.
Uhhuh.
I, if I lived in Washington, D C I think I'd have a different attitude about Black people because I've heard that it, it, the, they're terrible, you know, it's just like it's a dog eat dog world.
And here, you know, all, all my black friends are professionals and they're, they don't, you know, they don't go out and abuse drugs and they, they send their kids to school and they, they, they uh, you know really encourage them to go to college and stuff.
Uhhuh.
So it's just a different world.
Well I live in San Antonio and fifty percent of the population is minority.
Oh, um, I talked to someone about San Antonio,
Uhhuh.
and, um, they said that they, they have, you have quite the problem with, uh, the ghettos, I don't know, do they call it the barrio down there.
That's the barrios but i, it's, it's I don't think it's any different of a problem than any other major city.
It's just Hispanics here instead of Blacks.
Yeah, but I heard that sa, San Antonio, unlike like, like a city like San Diego it se, it just has a really bad problem.
I grew up outside of Houston and I don't think, uh, as far as gang violence and things, I don't think it's any worse here than in Houston.
Yeah, like say Houston.
Now I would, now me not even knowing anything about Houston, I would think that it's a pretty calm city.
Houston is not at all.
No, huh, there's a lot of crime?
Yes there's quite a bit of crime.
Oh, my, um, yeah, like I, wer, we're so protected up here, it's, it's really strange.
I mean our red light district, I mean, uh, you could go walking around down there and pretty much not fear for your life, you know,
Uhhuh.
and we're just so protected.
But, it's, it's, over in the Mid East, especially Israel, it's just like Israelis have a like a totalitarian system, when it comes to the Palestinians.
You know, the Israelis can do anything they want but when it comes to Palestinians, if they're out in the street at night, it's, it's really looked on as odd.
Um, usually they're, they're bussed in to the, the, um, Jewish neighborhoods, and the Jewish cities and then at night they're bussed out to the occupied territories.
Huh.
So they don't have that.
But, uh, what do you think about the mess that's, we've created in Iraq?
I think it's unfortunate, uh, as far as the Kurds are concerned, it, I thi,
It's just what do you do for them, you want to do something for them, but you don't want to get so directly involved that you're occupying the, the country.
Yeah, yeah, we can't get involved in their civil war, um, unfortunately, but we've kind of driven these people out.
To do it, yeah, but you see President Bush is telling them rebel, you know, uh, uprise.
And that's what they did and now they're like asking him for help and he's like, no we can't get involved.
What my husband had very strong feelings, he, uh, agreed with, um, the General Schwartzkopf, he said, um, he should have let, Bush should have let him finish his job.
Sure.
He should, he should have let them, um, corner the Republican Guards,
Well I think the war ended too soon.
Yeah, exactly, that's what everyone says.
Yeah.
E, everyone I talk to, they says, you know, it's real easy to say that.
We, we didn't damage enough of their arsenal.
We damaged most of it but we, we should have gotten, made sure we got everything.
Yeah, I don't think the higher ups were thinking about wh, what this guy's going to do with the rest of his war machine.
They're going, oh, well it's not going to hurt us so we're just going to let them go, but really we didn't think about the people that he was going, tr, and I mean, he, he's just,
Unfortunately though, the, the original goal of the mission was to drive them out of Kuwait.
And once that was accomplished it,
They, yeah, they, they did, they stuck right to their goals,
Yeah.
and right, what they were going to say.
And the American people, when this first started, they were even reluctant to let them do that.
Yeah.
So they were, they were playing it very safe, but, you know, it, an ounce what do they say, an ounce of hind sight is worth, whatever.
Yeah.
Th, they, I don't know, they, it, Schwartz, Schwartzkopf knew what had to be done and it's too bad that he just didn't have the ability just to do it, to you know, the, uh, the go ahead to do it.
Yeah.
Because he had the fu, he knew what was going to happen, more than any of us.
Because I didn't realize that, um, it was going to make such a mess.
I mean I feel really sorry for these people, these people are middle class people, just like us.
Can you imagine if someone started bombing your neighborhood,
Yeah.
and you knew this, these people are going to come and if you were in your house they were going to take you and beat you.
Of course, you're going, just going pick everything up that you can carry and you're going to run.
Uhhuh.
And it, it's just too bad that we couldn't see that.
I just have a feeling that the military involvement isn't over yet.
That I, I still feel like there's more to come.
I don't think this whole issue is settled as far as we're concerned.
Well you know what I was hoping? I was hoping Iran was going to take a very, um, dramatic stand and invade, you know, and then like Iran's the big bad guy, you know, but, really, if, if they were going to save people's lives,
They've got sixty or so of Iraq's planes.
Yeah, I know, it's like they were using them as friends when we were having the conflict but, I, I, you know, I almost swear, I'm kind of disappointed with the Iranians, why they didn't go save, I mean, I don't know if the Kurdish, I know the Shiites are their people.
Uhhuh.
But, I don't know, I think they have a bond with the, the Kurds.
There are some Kurds living in Iran.
Yeah, I, I think they should have just done more, uh, and maybe if the world could have given them some type of aid.
It's, it's just so complicated.
I was real surprised that Israel stayed out of it as, as much as they did.
Oh, yeah, well, you, knowing them, they're very, um, oh, I don't know, almost compare them to a very egotistical man.
Uhhuh.
You're damn right, I'm going to protect my family, you know, so, I, I was amazed too.
I was really, I was really, um, proud of them, though, that they stayed out of it.
But,
Yeah, it and from, from what I can tell if they had gotten into it, it would have started a whole new war.
Oh yeah, I was, I that part scared me.
That, that, um, the Egyptians would pull out and I just saw atomic bomb,
Go ahead.
Okay, do I still can, still can feel that the Soviet Union, as such, is still a threat to the civilized western world? Absolutely.
And my reasons are based upon not only from what I read in the newspapers, what I see on the newspapers, but up against some of the, fun and exciting things I ran into during my six years as a soldier in the Fifth Special Forces Group.
Um.
Okay.
I guess I don't see them as much of a threat as they used to be, but I think just the instability of the country right now is, sort of scary.
Well, that's what makes it a powder keg.
The, um, I'll go back in time a little bit, to about eightyone,
Uhhuh.
when my first real involvement with the military started.
Um, naturally we were at the time, the Soviet Union was considered to be the big military power and the big threat.
So we got lots, quite a bit of information as well as indoctrination on Soviet tactics and weapons.
Uhhuh.
I went to Lebanon in eightythree, before the marines ever got there, with the U N Peace Keeping Force.
And with the training I received prior to going there, with captured weapons we kept running up against.
These weren't, these weren't Chinese made copies.
These were Soviet made, top of the line, fresh out of the box, A K fortysevens.
Um, uhhuh.
As well as a lot of the explosives we were running into.
In Granada, in October, twentyfifth, eightythree, we invaded the place.
Sure there were Cuban soldiers there, but there was also a bunch of Russian advisors that were damn good shots.
The team I was with, we jumped in on the western tip of, of the island down on Point Salinas.
And for every Cuban there was at least five Russian advisors.
Huh.
And they were all shooting state of the art Soviet weapons.
In eightyfour, I was down in Central America, as an advisor to the Honduran Army.
Again we were running up against Cubans quite a bit, plus Soviet advisors.
And the equipment we were capturing and taking from the Nicaraguans, was brand new, out of the crate, Soviet made material.
Do I consider them a threat? Absolutely.
They have a university in Moscow called the Patrice de Lamumba University.
About like A and M or U T, where they're teachings subjects like that, they're teaching terrorism.
Some of the people we went up against in Lebanon were graduates from that place.
And let me tell you, they are nothing nice to go up against.
Huh.
I'm surprised during this Iraqi crisis we didn't have more incidents than they did.
These guys are top of the line.
When they, when they graduate from there, they can pull terrorist actions anywhere in the free world.
And they are very, very good at what they do.
So until I see the entire, quote, old guard of the Soviet military, of the Soviet government completely roll over and disappear, preferably buried, I still consider them a threat.
Uhhuh.
Their military is different from ours, to where there are extremist gen, generals that actually control tens and thousands of troops.
That irregardless of what Soviet policy is, they're going to do what the general tells them.
Yeah.
I guess that's what concerns me the most.
Is they're, they're so unstable that somebody like that could make, uh, decisions that would jeopardize a lot of people.
Well, it's in, interesting watching the different Soviet states, Albania, Lithuania, doing their little revolts down there.
Uhhuh.
Each one of those sectors has got a Soviet general over the troops that are there.
So far they haven't run into the real psychos yet.
There's probably five or six, which would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs, that are in positions over some of these Soviet states.
If uprisings hap, happen in their sectors, it is, it's going to be a total blood bath.
Yeah, it looks like it's come close to that as it is.
Actually, they're showing remarkable restraint.
They get real nasty, the hyundee helicopters come out and they, would level entire areas.
Okay, you're from the Dallas area, right?
Uhhuh.
Okay, you know, basically the size of, uh, the area around Richardson?
Yeah.
You put five Soviet hyundee helicopters in the air, they can level the entire area and there won't be anything left alive.
And they can do that in about four minutes.
Huh.
And they've got entire squadrons of those just standing by.
They used them in Afghanistan, did re, remarkably well considering the terrain they were flying in.
But on a highly populated area, like some of the Soviet cities would be, with the weaponry that's attached on those things, there is no place to hide.
If the bombs don't get you, if the bullets don't get you, then, then the nerve gas definitely will get you.
The only drawback on that little piece of machinery is they only got five minutes of air time.
They drink that much fuel.
Uhhuh.
Were you, have you, I take it you haven't spent any time in the military?
No, I haven't.
As a civilian that's never been attached to any form of the military, I know a lot of this stuff that I was involved in, never did make the newspapers.
Uhhuh.
But, during that same time frame, didn't you get some feeling, that, I mean, they're getting all these weapons and stuff? Didn't it bug you a little bit why they kept coming up with all this stuff?
You mean in the, in the most recent conflict?
In any of them since eightyone.
Oh.
Yeah, definitely.
I, I'm, I'm a little bit shocked to what the U S has done in terms of selling to Iraq in the past ten to fifteen years.
Yeah, I think we, we kind of shoot ourselves in the foot that way too.
It's bad enough that the Soviets do it.
It all boils down to, whether it's our side, their side, it's a matter of money,
Um.
to a certain extent.
Uhhuh.
The deal the Iraqi's have with the Russians was for oil.
Yeah.
It's scary to know that they're supplying that many people with weapons.
Especially when it's to the south of us.
Uh, the ones to the south are more regional conflict.
They're not really that worried about invading north.
They're more interested in, they've got a screwed up situation, I'll give them that.
From Mexico all the way down into Cen, Central and South America.
The situation down there is weird and it's very screwed up.
Uhhuh.
Inflation is out of this world and the governments, which our government has technically supported for years, are corrupt as all get out.
And generally the people,
are getting screwed, and they're tired of it, and they're willing to try anything to get out from under it, even if that means going to communism.
Yeah.
Well, I think Russia is getting to the point where they're, they're about to do something to get out of communism.
I guess I'd would like to see somebody like Yeltsin to get more power.
I think Gorbachev has about had his day.
Unfortunately, Yeltsin's got too many connections with the old guard.
That's the only drawback that I see with the entire thing.
Yeah.
Gorbachev has made his attempt and he's had his problems with some of the old guard himself.
Uhhuh.
Yeltsin's in tight with the old guard.
So it may be trying to choose between the lesser of two evils,
Uhhuh.
at this point.
True pause>>.
I don't know, I sure wouldn't turn my back on them.
You mean, I understand when they pulled the troops out of, uh, or they reduced the number of troops in Europe after the Berlin Wall went down, I thought that was great.
But by no means do I endorse or approve pulling everybody out.
Uhhuh.
It may be a much reduced force than what we used to have over there.
But you still better have the key players in place, if something does go down.
Even if it's a regional conflict.
If United States is going to flex its muscle and be the super power that it is, not only does it, it can talk the talk, but it's got to be able to walk the walk.
It's got to have the stuff to back it, back up what it's saying.
If you've only got a token force there, you can't hold your ground.
At least they're learning a little bit from history.
I mean, uh,
Okay, what kind of puppy you got?
Well, uh, I think she's mostly German Shepherd.
Uh, she was, uh, uh, a person lives across the street from me, uh, brought her home from work because a coworker of hers, uh, had this dog appear on its front doorstep,
Uh.
somebody, somebody abandoned her and,
Uhhuh.
she's only about, oh, si, between six and eight, six to eight weeks old and,
Oh.
uh, uh, I can't understand why anyone would abandon this dog, though.
She's, o, I mean she's that, this young and she's almost housebroken.
Wow.
I mean she actually asks to go out.
That's great.
And, uh, yeah I was amazed.
Really good temperament and very playful and affectionate, good personality.
I don't know, I can't imagine what, uh, would have been wrong with this dog, so.
Yeah, well I, I have a dog that God gave us too,
Uhhuh.
Yeah, she just appeared.
Oh, really.
Yeah, my husband calls her street dog, but we've had her now for about three years,
Uhhuh.
and I just, you get so attached to them.
Oh, yeah.
I had a, uh, last year I had ano, I had another German Shepherd, now this one was purebred and, uh, he, when he was about seven months old got a gastrointestinal virus and was just about on death's door but, uh, managed to get him to a veterinarian in time,
Uhhuh.
and, uh, and on huge doses of antibiotics,
Um.
and he actually got over it with, y, seven hundred dollars in vet bills,
Wow.
um, but he had actually was able to get him over that.
Uhhuh.
And then he was gaining weight again, was just getting healthy, and, uh, he put on about fifteen to twenty pounds after the thing and then he got hit by a Cadillac.
Oh no.
So, I couldn't believe it.
That was, that was really hard.
Oh, gee.
And that was even harder for, I was on a business trip at the time and the dog was being house sit, or dog sit, whatever, by some friends of mine down the street,
Uhhuh.
so they just felt absolutely awful.
Oh, I bet.
And I felt, felt probably worse for them than, than for me because, oh gosh they, the, uh, this fellow's wife who was, uh, watching the dog, pro, she, I think she loved that dog more than I did and, uh.
Oh gosh.
She was jus, really attached to it, but, uh, it's unfortunate, but now, I've got another one, so.
Yeah, yeah.
How long has it been since the first one?
Uh, see, he, it, it was just over a year.
Uh, yeah,
Uh, it was in March of last year.
So, uh, yeah, it'd been, didn't, didn't have one for a whole year.
Yeah.
Well I had, I had a German Shepherd before this one and when she died it just, it just absolutely destroyed me.
I mean I was just, you know,
Yeah.
I couldn't even talk about it for months and so I decided well that's it, I'm not going to do this anymore
Right.
And then God gave me this dog, so
My dad's like that, he, uh, he had a beagle that he loved and, uh, when that beagle passed away, uh, he didn't want, he wasn't going to have another dog, there's no way,
Uhhuh.
no how, and then, uh, the, he the beagle died in I guess about October and by Christmas time we went down to the pound and got him, uh, I or, I gue, Humane Society and got, uh, got another one, a stray.
Yeah.
And she, she turned out to be a great dog and we had her for six years until she just passed away recently and again dad went through the whole thing, but,
Okay, yeah.
mom went an,
Well you just do,
Yeah.
you can't help i, it's like, it's like a kid.
Yeah, it is.
Well hopefully this one here, Cocoa will live a full life
Yeah, well when, uh, my, my doggie, uh, that we have now, uh, she's, she's mostly Golden Retriever.
Uhhuh.
The vet called her, uh, a golden mix
Yeah.
like who knows, you know.
Right.
But she's, uh, she's that sort of strawberry blonde reddish color, you know.
Oh.
And, uh, and her nose is that pink, you know,
Uhhuh.
she doesn't have a brown nose, and her ey, she's sort of unicolor, you know,
Yeah.
eyes are the same color and everything, so.
I named her Rosebud,
and, uh, a friend of mine said, th, she, that she gre, this friend of mine grew up on a farm and said that she had, uh, a pet cow named Rosebud and she said there's a lot of longevity in that name, said my cow lived seventeen years
That's not too bad.
Golly the Golden Retriever's are good dogs too, they're kind of like, get that permanent smile to them,
Yeah, right.
they're always, always happy.
I don't think I've ever seen them not look happy.
And she's so easy going and so sociable,
Yeah.
You know, she loves everybody.
And little kids can just, you know, maul all over her,
Right.
and she just, you know, thinks it's great.
This, this friend of mine has, th, well it's the same guy that was watching, uh, my German Shepherd when he got hit, but, uh, went fishing with him on Friday and took, he's got a full, a pure bred Golden Retriever and then I had, uh, the puppy, a little tiny puppy and we went and took the two dogs up fishing.
And this, they just, they had a ball romping around,
Uhhuh.
and, you know, you can't get a Golden Retriever near water without it jumping in.
Getting in, yeah.
And, uh, this Golden Retriever jumped in the, the, really fast moving, uh, river current, and, uh.
Oh, no.
Well no, actually he had no trouble at all.
He first jumped in and I, he's, he's just about a year old himself and never had really, I don't think he'd swum before.
Really.
But he jumped in, in the, the river.
Did puppy go to?
Well the puppy jumped in the, into some of the pools but not into the, I was careful to keep her away from the,
Oh, that's good, yeah.
the fast moving water, 'cause if she fell in then I'd of been, had to go in after her.
And up here the waters probably about forty degrees right now.
Ugh, ugh.
And I would not have been fun trying to retrieve her, but, uh, this dog, Dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do I do now, as he's floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and, uh, actually paddled up against the current and, uh, made it back to the shore and climbed up and then,
he, he jumped in again, and he was swimming for quite a bit, all afternoon.
He loved it.
Yeah,
Cocoa didn't think too much of it, though.
She jumped in and then started screaming and made me pull her back out.
I pulled her out and, uh, then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad,
Yeah.
and so, but, uh, she got over it, so.
Well the German Shepherd that I had before, we, we had a little pool,
Uhhuh.
and, uh, she was, she did not want any part of swimming but she liked to, to get in the pool on the first step.
She'd just get on the first step and lay down.
Uhhuh.
You know in the summertime when it's really, really hot.
Yeah.
And she'd just lay there on that step and just, you know, cool off
Yeah, I've, I live right across the street from a, a big lake here, um, it's on Oneida lake and I'm wondering if, uh, if she'll want to go out there and go swimming next year.
I mean, I've got, the yards all fenced in so she doesn't run loose, but, uh,
Uhhuh.
she could go in sometime when, if I'm watching her, so.
Yeah
Well the one that we had just didn't want any part of that.
Oh really.
Yeah, and she, oh baths.
Oh gee, she hated baths worse than anything.
It was, it was just really a fight to, you know, get her clean.
Yeah.
Have you seen, uh, CANINE.
No, no.
The movie, oh, you've got to see it.
Especially since you have a German, it is so cute.
Oh really.
Yeah, and, uh, an part of the, the movie is where he's trying to clean this dog up and it's, it's just hysterical.
Oh, okay, my my dog, last German Shepherd, it was a real chore trying to give him a bath too.
And that was the thing I couldn't figure out because he would go in the lake, it wasn't like he didn't
Uhhuh.
i, normally, I mean he didn't seem to have a problem with getting wet, but if you wanted to get him wet, forget it.
Yeah, well that's how Cleo, w, you know, she'd lay on her step,
Yeah.
but that was, that was the only time she wanted to get wet and she didn't want you getting her wet
Right, right, obstinate, obstinate.
Yeah, but you really need to see that movie.
I, I w, we bought the movie and I don, I don't know how many times I've seen it.
Uhhuh.
And it came on T V the other night and I was watching it again, and my husband heard me laughing and he said I can't believe that you're still getting such a kick out of that movie
I'll have to check it out.
I saw the, the, uh, previews for it and all and it did look like it'd be a good mo, movie, but,
It is great.
uh, really haven't had a whole lot of time to get out to see the movies lately.
Yeah.
But, I got to do more, more fun things.
Well we always wait until we can rent them, you know
Yeah, yeah.
Well I'm, uh, I'm a second lieutenant in the Air Force and so I travel a lot.
Oh really.
And yeah, I'm a engineer at, uh at the laboratory, Rolm Laboratory, Griffis Air Force Base, up here, so.
Oh.
That's how I got into, uh, into the switchboard project and all that, so.
Uhhuh.
But it's nice having a dog here, uh, the,
Oh, yeah, there's just,
Un, un, uh, what's the, unrequir, what's the word I'm looking for, uh, lots of affection, no co,
Right,
unconditional affection from the, from the dog.
that's it.
Yeah, yeah.
Really, not critical at all.
No, no.
Yeah, they're really wonderful.
Yeah, well, it's been nice talking to you, we seem to be degenerating here, so
Well, did you get a chance to watch any of the games?
Uh, no, I, I just kind of, I, I kind of watch them on the news and that's about it.
Oh, okay
Uh, the, Michael Jordan's on Chicago Bulls isn't he.
Yeah.
What, did he get hurt last night or,
No, I don't think so because, uh, I saw just a little bit of the game today and he was out there playing.
Oh, okay.
Although, uh, I, what I saw was at the end of the first quarter, I think he only had like eightch, eight points
Uhhuh.
at the end of the first quarter, they thought that was big news.
Oh, yeah.
So, I don't know, but I don't know who won, and, uh, I don't know, who do you normally pull for, the, the Mavericks or,
No, I kind of feel like the, about the Mavericks the way I do about the Cowboys now.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Uh, just all this Roy Tarpley stuff and, and, uh, what is it their, you know, he got, he's in trouble again down in Houston and, and, uh, they said the other night his contract is so big that if anything happens to him, you know, if they don't trade him, they'll have to pay him off, you know.
So they're rather have him, except that he gets in trouble all the time and falls off the wagon, and, and, and have some chance of him playing, you know, earning his money.
Oh, jeez.
Yeah, because that's just dollars right out of the franchise.
Sure is.
Oh, man.
Now I, uh, I, I've always been pulling for the Lakers for a long time.
Oh, yeah.
And, uh,
They're consistent.
not just, not just because they always win, but, uh, when they had, uh, Akeem
Uhhuh.
anybody who was old as that playing that well, you know, I just kind of had to go with them.
Now they kind of got caught up with a lot of the other players and, uh, course, uh, all the people that follow the Lakers and everything out there in, in California.
Uh, and it also helps when they were winning
Yeah.
Well, they play better as a team than anybody else, seems like.
I was, uh, I always wondered that, you know, I, I will take a look at the individual score, you know, in the individual stance in the N B A
Uhhuh.
and, you know, they, they have in the paper, you know, like fifteen different categories and they'll have, like, a individuals, uh, they'll have the, the highest scorer, the top rebounders, uh, assists, foul shooting percentages and all that, and you go down through and virtually every one of the categories there isn't, uh, a Laker in the top ten usually hardly any, any, anybody in the top twenty except for, like, Magic
Uhhuh.
and, uh, yet the Lakers continue to win.
So, you're right, I think they do really play much better as a team than they do, uh, uh, each one, you know, individually at their spot
But, uh,
Yeah, year in and year out, it's not like they have, you know, a lot of teams will, will, will win in the playoffs and then the next year they'll be all
Yeah.
they'll be too busy doing their endorsements and stuff, to, to concentrate on the game.
Well, I understand that, uh, I guess Boston's really, uh, giving, uh, are, aren't they playing Detroit? I think Boston's playing Detroit and I think they're really giving them a run for their money.
Yeah, except Larry Bird's hurt.
Did he get hurt again?
He, his back is bad all the time now, I think.
Yeah, yeah.
I tell you what, I guess it's tough to play that many games and still stay healthy.
Yeah, they play two or three times a week.
Like, you know, and then they go on road trips and they do the same thing and, and then they, and then they stay out for two or three weeks at a time.
So, it really gets, you know, I mean they're sleeping in different bed every night and
Yeah, yeah.
and I imagine that really helps his back.
He ought to have his own bed come along with him, you know
Uhhuh.
Yeah, he said, he said the other night on the news that he hadn't done any extra shooting for six weeks, so, you know, and he's the one that's always winning the, uh, the, the outside, the three point shot and
Oh, yeah, yeah.
he does that every year.
Yeah, matter of fact, I watched him, uh, on T V, you know, sink, I don't know a, jeez, it was like, uh, uh, thirty five baskets in thirty seconds or something like that from three point range.
Uhhuh.
Unbelievable.
Yeah.
Oh, I don't know, did you ever play much basketball?
Not much.
Just, uh, just, just playing horse and stuff like that.
Yeah.
Yeah, because it's, it kind of a violent game.
It really is for a noncontact sport,
And they d,
quote, unquote.
Yeah, and they don't wear any pads .
Yeah, really
I figured,
Some of those guys got pretty funny looking, uh, eye wear.
Yeah.
They have to wear goggles because they get hit in the, in the face with elbows all the time.
Man.
Well, it's h, it's, I was looking in the paper for something on it and here's the top N B A draft prospects and, uh, I mean they're all the size of football players, you know, except they're just taller.
Yeah.
Several years ago when I was up in, uh, Cleveland, I was staying at the Marriott and the Cavaliers were playing somebody.
I think it was like Utah or somebody like that and, uh, I was down by the pool and there was all these guys standing around about chest deep in water.
Now I wear, uh, contacts, and I, I had my glasses on and I went down there and, and just jumped into the water where they were and it went right up over my head and I came up spittering and sputtering for air and they were all the basketball players there to play the Cavaliers
Uhhuh.
they were all like, uh, like six eight and, uh, you know, six ten, and they were standing in water that was like six foot,
Six foot, yeah.
you know, and it was, uh, it was funny, I tell you.
I saw, I saw a guy, I don't remember what his name was, but he got on the elevator and he had his swimsuit on and, uh, he was just skin and bones, you know, it looked like something out of Africa
Uhhuh.
and, uh, I made some comment and, uh, he says, yeah, he says I weigh about, uh, uh, two hundred and forty pounds
Yeah.
but he says it's not much when you stretch it over seven foot one.
Yeah, really.
So, you're right, those guys really, you know, the, the big ones, I don't even know how much Ewing weighs.
But, uh, he's got to be way up there.
Oh, yeah.
Well, here's a, here's a guy from L S U, Stanley Roberts, he's seven feet tall and he weighs two hundred and eighty pounds.
So,
God.
That's a, that's a lot
Yeah.
That's a lot of, a lot of guy coming down on you.
Uhhuh.
Jeez.
I didn't even see, who's, who's supposed to have the, the, uh, the best, uh, draft picks?
papers>>.
It doesn't even say.
It doesn't say, here it says, uh, it says the under, this is for underclassmen for June twentysix
Yeah.
and, uh, I guess, I guess they don't, they have, they, they, uh, have a lottery on it.
They pick numbers and that's how they take them in order.
Oh, yeah?
It must not be according to their, how they did during the year.
I used to go down to Reunion Arena, uh, went down there a couple years on the day of the draft
Uhuh.
and that was really pretty interesting.
They usually have, uh, uh, you know, a video, uh, highlights of the season, you know, and basically kind of walks you through what happened to the Mavs and who they traded for and how they did and a lot of good footage, both the good and the bad
Uhhuh.
I, I don't know, I haven't, I didn't go down there last year, but, uh, it, it was only like a couple dollars to get in and it was really kind of interesting
But, uh, so who do you thinks going to win the playoffs?
I don't know, who's going, is it Chicago and,
Chicago, uh, and, let's see, uh, Golden State and the Lakers and, Chicago and Philadelphia, think Chicago's playing Philadelphia and then the, uh, shoot, I can't remember them all now.
Utah, Portland, Boston and Detroit.
Right.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay.
That's the N B A?
N B A playoffs, Philadelphia was, uh, favored by one point over Chicago and the Lakers one point over Golden State, and Detroit by five over, uh, Boston
Jeez.
I think Boston, Boston will win.
Think so?
Yeah.
I tell you what, those guys really hang tough.
Uhhuh.
Now, I, I'd like to see them back up there again.
They really, uh, they really gave some, some really good years of, uh, uh, of enjoyment and fun and everything.
Have you ever been up there to Boston Garden?
Oh, no, uh,
Well, I don't know is that in, I, I haven't really gone to a lot of games live, but boy I'd sure like to.
Basketball's gotten to be a lot of fun.
Uhhuh.
H, well, Myrna, how do you get your news, news?
Uh, most of it is from the radio, uh,
Uhhuh.
and also from the news programs that we watch in the afternoon.
Yeah.
We usually watch the local news and the, the, uh, national news both.
Uhhuh, yeah, I'm pretty much the same.
I, uh, I find that, uh, I'm a graduate student and I, I read a lot for school and I find I have no patience to really read a newspaper because I just, I'm reading so much all the time.
And I really enjoy just sitting down and watching a news broadcast.
Well you can always get up and leave that
Uhhuh, tha, tha, yeah, that's true.
Uh, I d, I just don't seem to have time to sit down and read the paper.
Either by the time I get home from work,
Uhhuh.
it's already, you know, time for the news to come on.
That's right, yeah.
So, it's so much easier to sit there and besides, I can be doing other things and still listen to the news.
Yeah, that's right, I, I agree.
That's, a lot of times I eat while I'm uh, watching the news.
Yeah.
Yeah, the same thing.
Is there any, uh, what did you think about the coverage like over in the, uh, Persian Gulf?
I think they did a great job.
Yeah, I thought so too, it was, it, you know, for a while when we were really interested, uh, we saw it all the time.
Some of the stations I guess carried it for twentyfour hours for a couple of days there and then, you know, the special reports and the extended news coverage I thought was really good.
Uhhuh
Yeah.
And you could always find some channel that had something on but you didn't necessarily have to watch the same thing all the time.
Yeah, right, yeah, just news, that's right, yeah.
Yeah, I noticed that one thing that, that T I did, you know, they had, uh, uh, they used to have, well they do have television monitors stationed throughout our buildings,
Uhhuh.
and they used to have a program called T News, and just updates of, of different things that were going on within T I.
Well when all the, the mess with, uh, uh, in the Persian Gulf came about they started carrying C N N.
Oh, yeah.
Well now, they have had so much good response from this,
Uhhuh.
that T I now has C N N on all the time.
Huh, well that's great.
So, we can always run upstairs and, you know,
Uhhuh.
ca, get a quickie update on what's going on, if we really want to.
Yeah, or if yo, you have a break in the middle of the day, you take a coffee break you can always stay informed.
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, that's really good.
That's, um, I've found that when I, I don't have cable television anymore, uh, when I moved, went back to graduate school I just didn't have the money to buy, ge, rent a cable T V line, or whatever, you know.
So I don't get C N N, uh, which was a big disappointment.
I used to watch, that was my, if I wasn't home, I'm a college teacher and sometimes I teach in the evening so I'll miss the evening news.
And uh, you could always catch a good news program at eight o'clock or nine o'clock on C N N.
I think that's,
Yes
that really has changed the way, uh, I look at the news.
Yeah, we don't get it either, we live out in the country,
Uhhuh.
and we just don't have it available out there where we are.
But when we did have it, uh, we, that's what we usually watched,
Uhhuh.
was C N N and sometimes we'd watch the weather stations.
Yeah, that's, uh, same, yeah, that's, when I had it, I, I watched it, you know, religiously for half an hour and then you could go on, you know, to do what else you wanted to do.
Yeah.
Yeah I find I, I read very little, I don't even get a regular newspaper and, uh, because, uh, I, I don't drive that much, I only live about a mile from where I go to school and work, I, uh, I find I spend so little time in the ra, in the car that I don't really listen to the radio, you know, I don't, so.
So television is my main new source.
Oh, I get that too, because I, I'm in a van pool,
Uhhuh.
and I'm in the van, you know, uh, two hours a day an.
Oh really, to commute to work?
Yes, yes.
Oh.
And in the, in the morning I try to sleep because it's, it's dark thirty.
But in, but in the afternoon, uh, I try to read so I can, can, uh, not pay attention to what our driver is doing
Yeah, I can, the van pools I know that, and I'm in the Baltimore, Washington area, and I know they do van pool a lot here from some of the outer areas, but if you want a nicer home, you know, beyond the suburbs, you know, I, that's necessary.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Are, are you in Baltimore itself?
I am, I am right outside Baltimore.
I am less than a mile from the Baltimore line.
Um.
And I go to a br, a campus of the University of Maryland that is just, less than a mile from my house.
So I, I'm actually in Baltimore, yeah, you could say I'm in Baltimore.
Yeah, I have two kids over there.
Oh really, in Baltimore?
U, well no, in, in D C area.
Uhhuh.
Yeah one works for the State Department and, uh, uh, the other one is, uh, uh, her husband is in the m, Navy and he's stationed at Bethesda an.
Uhhuh, oh that's, that's, that's a really nice area, Bethesda area.
Uhhuh.
Uhhuh, it's, um, it's funny, there's a big difference between Baltimore and Washington, even though they're so close.
There's only an hour, less than that between the two but there is a big difference in things like property values and, um, the closer you get to Washingt, D C the more expensive it is.
Uhhuh.
And, um, the, the, uh, different slant.
Washington, it really is a, uh, uh, an international city, where Baltimore is hometown Baltimore.
You know, it, there's really, uh, most people have relocated to the Washington area, you know.
Oh no, I'd, I'd rather have Baltimore with the home town atmosphere.
Yeah, that's, I, I like it, I like it a little bit better, too.
It's interesting though, um, to meet different populations.
I, I'm just now being, uh, from Pittsburgh originally, I'm just now meeting different populations like Chinese students and things and I find that really interesting, you know, to imagine, here is somebody that was in China, le, two years ago when all that was going on in, in, uh, Beijing.
You know, that, that's an interesting, uh, interesting perspective.
But I, I really much, much like the hometown area, yeah.
And I think that also goes, it's funny, you, you can watch different news.
I can watch Washington news or Baltimore news and I really do watch Baltimore news.
You know, that really makes, I don't really bother with the Washington station because I just, it's so far removed from what I'm interested in.
Well most of what they're talking about in Washington is, is the crime problems that they're having there.
Uhhuh, yeah they, in fact they just, it was just a big thing recently they've had some terrible problems with Hispanics, um, they had to impose a curfew that, uh, in two of the areas in, uh, in the Washington suburbs.
The mayor, they've gotten rid of that really bad mayor and then, uh, brought in,
Uhhuh, I heard about that.
Yeah, and then came a woman that's um, she's big in the Democratic party so that's good, so she has good national ties, but she also was, um, something like a, t, uh, state auditor or something like that before this position.
She was a state auditor, I guess she was an auditor general or something like that for the District of Columbia, at Washington.
And then she left that to get a position with the Democratic party and now she ran for mayor, so she's uh, fiscally she's pretty tight, and, uh, she's cleaning house an, and it looks like hopefully she'll do a nice job, uh, for Washington, you know, which is, you sort of feel sorry for a lot of the people there.
You know, from what I pick up on the news, uh, it's a difficult process, you know, to get rid of a, a bad mayor.
Yeah, well I know both of my kids didn't want to live anywhere around the, the downtown areas,
Right.
they both moved way out.
Uhhuh, yeah.
I think one of them lives in Germantown and I can't remember where the other one lives.
Yeah, but those are ni, Germantown is a nice area.
Uhhuh, yeah.
It's a nice area
It's, means they have to drive a little bit, but,
Yeah, well they might be car pooling too.
Do they car pool in? Are they driven by themselves.
Uh, well now, I, I think he carpools,
Uhhuh.
Because he's got fairly regular hours since he came back, but, uh, now my daughter ha, they have probably been carpooling together, in fact, because she had been called back up, active duty.
Uhhuh, yeah.
And then she was supposed to have gotten out of active duty as of last Friday.
So, I haven't talked to them this weekend, I don't know what the situation is, but she was,
Uhhuh.
They didn't call you for Mother's Day?
We were gone
You weren't home?
Uh, d, no, we weren't home but she had, she had le, called and left a message on our recorder but I had that from all my kids except for one.
Yeah, oh, that's good.
So.
Well I guess we should stop now.
Well I thank you for calling, I have enjoyed it.
Uhhuh, oh good.
I really do like this program because I get to talk to people from all over the United States, yeah.
Uh, uh, so do I, I've become very aware of different political views because some of the things we have to discuss are very politically motivated or whatever, I, I really enjoyed it.
It's, it's so funny when you live in one part of the country you only see that perspective.
It's interesting to see the, the wider world, so I enjoy it.
Hey, thanks a lot, and, and bye.
Thank you, bye, bye.
in background>> Okay.
Okay.
I guess we're set.
Um,
Current events.
I get my current events basically from news, uh, just because I watch,
Television news?
pretty much a lot of television, um,
Is it, uh, C N N or HEADLINE NEWS or just local,
Uh,
news or,
I watch a little bit of everything.
I like to tune into, to C N N because, uh, you know, you can tune in like any time of day and pretty much get the update on,
Right.
everything,
Right.
in about five or ten minutes.
I think news today, um, it's kind of losing its importance.
Like on, in, on radio, if you hear any news at all, it's like two seconds.
Right.
You know, really quickly,
Well,
on regular stations.
on commercial radio, I guess, I, I tend to get more of my news from national public radio of the morning on the way to work,
Yeah, that's good, too, uhhuh.
or evening on the way to school so,
I like K R L D.
So, I don't, uh,
Uhhuh.
I don't see much T V mostly when I'm in school, but I do here.
Yeah, where do you go to school?
Uh, University of Texas at Dallas.
Oh, Okay.
I went to U T at Austin.
Right.
But, uh, I'm a news reporter so I, I should get all I can , my news from the new, from the T V.
Really.
But, um,
I do tend to throw on HEADLINE NEWS when I'm doing things around the house and just let it play,
Yeah,
and listen, but, uh,
I usually don't intentionally.
Although I should, I don't intentionally turn on the television to watch news.
Right.
Or I don't intentionally turn on the radio to listen to the news.
If it comes on, I just happen to hear it.
Now, I will intentionally buy a newspaper to wa, to, in background>> to look at the news.
But other,
Yeah, all I ever get out of the paper is a Sunday paper so,
Yeah, that's true.
I read the comics.
That's about it.
That's about it, yeah.
The Sunday paper, it's so full of stuff, but you pick your favorite section, and the rest,
Right.
you throw away.
Right.
Although you paid, what, almost two dollars now to get it but,
I like to listen to, uh, national public radio on the way to work because it's, I don't know, it's variety, and now,
Uhhuh.
they're throwing in a little news and a little bit of other stuff.
It
Yeah.
tends to get like HEADLINE NEWS if you listen to it for an hour .
Is it, is it pretty good coverage on there?
Yeah, it usually is.
They throw in a lot of, you know, a lot of interviews and commentaries.
It's kind of like getting a newspaper.
There's a lot of
Yeah, yeah.
sections to it and
Um.
they, they present different sides of things.
Because I find like on K R L D, I like to listen to that, but each story is like no more than two or three lines, you know.
Oh, well they spend a little more time, you know, they cover the headlines,
Yeah.
and then they go into a lot of the issues and
Uhhuh.
things where they, they spend five or ten minutes discussing something and,
Yeah, that would probably be better.
interviewing people.
And it's,
Especially when you look for the, like, popular radio stations like mostly the music stations, news is, is pretty much nonexistent.
Yeah.
They have little, little, teenyweeny news,
breaks, you know.
Yeah, and only in the morning, I guess, there's a little bit.
Yeah, yeah, basically.
I haven't listened to a top forty radio station in so long I wouldn't know.
Yeah.
So,
So let's see, um,
And I guess I get some kinds of other, you know, business related news through trade journals and things but,
Uhhuh.
Uh,
The only reason I get trade journals is like if I'm looking for a job or something
Right
Which is what I'm doing now.
Yeah,
But, um,
a lot of people are.
Yeah, trying to get out of wherever they are but, um, I think, I think news is, I'm wondering where it's going.
You know how, I think it will be nonex, pretty much nonexistent except maybe through the paper.
I know the newspaper used to be kind of the only source for news.
And now, it's, it's kind of your final choice.
You watch, first you go to C N N, then you go to radio or something like that.
Yeah, where nobody wants,
And I think it,
to sit down and read.
Yeah, yeah.
It's, it takes a lot more time to read something,
Yeah.
and you've got news,
So much more effort.
bombarding you from everywhere now.
Yeah.
You know you,
Yeah.
turn on the T V, turn on the radio.
But I think that soon the paper may be kind of the only source again.
Why is that?
I don't, well, just because I'm, I'm thinking that it, it's getting so short on radio.
You still, you have two or three, I know in Dallas you can probably get two, two all news radio stations out of I don't how many popular radio stations.
And then on television, you have just the news at six and ten.
Yeah, I just,
And I just, I just see that dwindling in, in,
I find it hard to believe that people will go back to reading over television, I mean, just given the way society is.
And I enjoy reading, but most
True, yeah.
people would rather turn on the tube and, and, and,
True.
That's true, too, yeah.
flip through the channels, you know, and get the headline news at thirty minutes of,
Than sit down and take the effort to read
Right.
the paper.
And they don't have to go get one, you know.
One thing I like about the paper, um, as opposed in background>> to television is that, uh, when I, like when I report, because I'm in television, I have to get the basic, the main facts and that's it.
That's all you have time for.
Right.
Right.
Whereas in the paper, I like to read the articles because they get every side, every single side, and, and every point they make, you know.
Right.
And, and it's all there.
Well, that's why I like, uh, national public radio
Uhhuh.
because they get on one of these little things, they give you headlines that are brief, just, they touch on what's going on.
And then they'll get into something and really explore it.
Uhhuh, uhhuh.
And it's, it's informative.
It's a lot more informative than, you know, quick, half hour news shows that
Yeah.
they tell you what they want you to hear.
Yeah, because that's what we do.
I mean it's like each story is thirty seconds, you know.
Right.
So it's like you really have to tell as much as you can which is not much in that amount of time.
So, and it will probably get shorter and shorter as the years go by I think.
I don't know.
Yeah, there's so much going on in the world.
Uhhuh.
Communication, you know, expands the world now.
Oh, yeah.
There's too much going on.
You can't afford to give more than a couple of seconds here and there.
I think that is one good thing, one great thing, about news, and we saw it during the war just now, is that we got all the information within minutes, you know.
Yeah.
Whatever happened, we knew about it about the same time that they knew about it.
And the question is, how much of it or how, some of it, I guess, there's a lot of debate about censorship and
Yeah, yeah.
and what we're really seeing.
Uhhuh.
Is it, is it the true story or is it a
Yeah.
little bit biased.
Because even though we do get the story right away, they were censored as to what they
Right.
could tell us.
So all we had to sit here and, and ask is well, what aren't they telling us, you know.
So that, that was pretty scary.
But we, I talked to one woman, and she said that she didn't want to know what was going on because if she had a son over in Saudi Arabia, she wouldn't want to know, you know, that they're bombing or, or this and that's going on.
And at the same time, I talked to another woman, and she was so happy to know because she lived through Vietnam.
And she didn't know what was happening at that time.
Right.
And she was so happy to get the information, you know.
So there's just a lot of different opinions on that.
But,
I, I, you know, I like to, to know what's going on.
Sometimes I think there's just a little bit too much.
Yeah.
You know you get in the habit of, like I say, turn on Headline News and it will play over and over
and you just tune it out because it's the same thing but,
And then, too, a lot of times I think, uh, especially on television they blow things completely out of proportion.
Yeah, they tend to,
Like,
dramatize things.
You know, like this Kennedy thing.
Yeah.
like a keyboard>> It's just, I mean, everywhere you turn.
Kennedy, Kennedy, Kennedy.
You know, what kind of shoes did he wear on the night? And you know, it's just like, okay, this is ridiculous.
Like who cares? Really.
So,
Well,
But what are you doing? Sitting on a computer?
Yeah.
I heard the little clicking.
Trying to do some C programming.
Oh, okay.
Well, it was nice talking to you.
Okay
Okay.
Take care.
Take care.
Byebye.
Uhhuh, bye.
What kind of painting are you planning to do?
Well I have wallpaper in both of my bathrooms right now which is really pretty disgusting.
Uhhuh.
And, um, it's a rent house and I decided it's too expensive to rewallpaper so I decided I'm going to paint.
Uhhuh.
And I've been buying some magazines and stuff and looking at different ways to paint.
And I'm thinking about maybe sponge painting them.
Oh, what would be interesting.
Either that or maybe rag rolling.
Uhhuh.
To give it kind of a country look.
Yeah, I've never done any of those fancy kinds of paint treatments, but phone>> they look very interesting and you get some beautiful effects with them.
Yeah.
Uh, one of the books that I bought, where it's d, describing the sponge painting, said you can like layer different colors and,
Yes, yeah, I've seen that done, where there's uh, oh, I saw one that was kind on an ecru undercoat and then it had, a little bit darker sort of peachy color,
Uhhuh.
and in between there was a sort of a rust, uh, put on very sparingly.
Ugh.
And it gave the impression of very old weathered stucco.
Yeah.
Um, what I, what I'm trying to do is I've got yellow tile in both the bathrooms
Uhhuh.
so I want something that's going to tie that together and I'm changing the, like the towel racks and stuff, the, the fixtures out to make them wood, I'm going to put wood in there.
Oh, yeah, that should be nice.
So it's going to have kind of a country look.
Uhhuh.
Um, and I haven't even decided as far as, um, what kind of paint to buy.
I don't have an actual instruction book so I'm really in kind of the beginning stages right now.
Well, uh.
Um, it's going to be a big experiment.
Yeah, I was about to say, you ought to experiment on at least a small part of it before you just tackle the whole thing
Yeah.
Because you might find that it's beyond, uh, what you're willing to put into it.
Yeah, yeah.
Although I think it could turn out really nice.
Yeah, I've,
I haven't ever done fancy painting but I sure did my share of just regular painting.
Uh, I've painted several houses, inside.
No, I,
Uhhuh, inside.
never painted the outside.
What, what kind of, what kind of paint do you normally use?
Well, uh, we used a latex, uh, wall paint and then a semigloss enamel for the woodwork and my job was mostly the woodwork.
Okay, uhhuh.
My husband would paint the walls and ceilings with the rollers and I got to do all of the masking tape and then all of the little fine, uh, trim work,
Uhhuh.
where I'd use a small brush and, uh, try to keep the paint from dripping on the windows and things like that
Uhhuh.
Well we only have on, only one of our bathroom has a window in it so I'm hoping that, um, it won't be too much of a, a problem.
Uhhuh.
Um, I'm wondering if my bigger problem is getting the wallpaper taken down first.
Because I, I think,
Well I was going to ask if you planned to paint over it or try to strip it.
No, I'm, I'm planning on taking it off.
I have heard that they've got these steamers you can rent now, which make it much easier to get wallpaper off.
Um.
Um, I tried to get wallpaper off once twenty years ago, oh, with a just a scraper and wet sponge and it took forever.
I would not recommend that method.
Okay.
Uh, if
Well that's something that, that's worthwhile checking into then.
'Cause I,
if you can rent a steamer, if it's modern wallpaper it should come off without too much trouble.
If it's really old, you don't know what it's put on with.
It, it's hard to tell, it's, the patterns look like they're nineteen sixties style.
Yeah.
And I know the house, um, was built around the mid fifties.
Uhhuh.
So it may be the original wallpaper
Could be, yeah.
Um, if it's vinyl it should be easier to strip too.
If it's paper it will probably shred.
Um, in one bathroom it's, um, it's probably paper, uh, it's silver, silver and yellow,
Um, uhhuh
and white.
Well the wallpaper that I was trying to remove was black, i, this was in a bathroom too.
And the, the tiles were sort of a mottled grey and had a little trim strip of maroon and white and the, the wallpaper in that bathroom had a black background and then it had vivid, uh, almost neon colors of hot pink and turquoise, and lime green and silver, and, uh, a little bit of yellow that looked like coral sands and sea horses and things like that
Um, that's kind of an odd color for a bathroom.
Oh it was awful, it was absolutely hideous and, and we had a dinner party before we started renovating it and a, a guest went in there and he said it's a good thing I went to the bathroom before dinner because if I had had something to drink and went in there I would think I was having hallucinations laughingly>>.
Really.
Well I, I've also been thinking about, after looking at all these magazines, um, these design magazines and stuff, I'm thinking about maybe painting the bedroom walls too, in a color that will kind of, um, tie in our, um, our, um, our, uh, comforter,
Uhhuh.
with a color that's kind of a, um, burgundy and green and yellow and blue and beige floral design.
Uhhuh.
Um, and I'm not really quite sure, I don't know if maybe I'm biting off more than I can chew.
Well I'd say tackle one project first and see how it goes and if you discover you like it then you can always upscale.
Yeah, well the bedroom would probably be the easier of the two because it would be just plain painting.
Sure.
It wouldn't be any kind of special, um, special effects type thing.
Yeah.
It would be just plain paint.
Well it's not hard to do if you get everything prepared ahead of time.
Because if you, uh, use drop cloths to cover everything and you use masking tape to trim out, uh, all the parts that you don't want to slop over onto, you don't have to be quite as precise about how you do it and it can be done a whole lot faster.
Um, okay.
And with rollers and, uh, modern latex paints, you can wash up easily because they're water soluble.
Uhhuh.
And they dry fast so you really don't have to be disrupted for more than about a weekend.
If you have some help.
Um.
And then if that, if you discover the little tricks and tips about, you know, how you get through corners and how you do trim and, uh, how long to leave the masking tape down, because if you leave it too long and it dries it can flake when it, when you pull it up.
It, it peels the paint off when you take it off, yeah.
Well, not, i, if you leave it on for weeks, it will do that.
If you take it up the next day it should be fine.
You want it to get dry, but not, uh, just real hard.
Yeah, okay.
You don't want the gum on the back of the masking tape to get dried to hard.
That's the problem.
Yeah.
It will come up a lot easier if you don't wait too long.
And I've, I was told, I always used the nice wide masking tape, but I've heard from people who tried to get by and skimp on narrow masking tape that it was more trouble than it was worth.
Oh really, okay.
Because it, it rips as you pull it off for one thing and then you end up tediously scraping these tiny little shreds of masking tape
Um.
And the whole point of using it is to save yourself work.
You can do a little faster painting and much easier clean up if you use the masking tape.
But use, use good, uh, stuff and buy it at a paint store where they have the right brands,
Okay.
that will go down and come up easily.
Well I really appreciate all the helpful tips, I think you are, just made my project a lot easier
Well I wish you very good luck with it and I will tell you that I have retired from the painting business.
The last time I had something done was my kitchen cabinets and I decided that was too much to tackle, I'd hire a professional.
If you were, if you were closer I'd, I'd, I'd tell you you could come over and supervise
Well if I were closer I might.
Oh, well I hope your project turns out great and I, really think that it's exciting that you're going to try the sponge painting.
I think that could give it a really a,
Well, we'll see how it goes, I may just be flat painting over it.
Well, of course that's the other advantage of paint.
If you don't like it all you do is put on another coat.
Yeah.
I guess we'd better go because our time looks like it's about up.
Yeah, I, I need to go to the dentist, so.
Okay, byebye.
It's was nice talking to you Kathleen.
Thank you.
Byebye.
Where are you from Tina?
Um, I'm from Maryland and, um, I have one son who's almost sixteen months old.
Are, are you married, or .
Yeah, uhhuh.
You are.
I have, I have two children, I have a seven year old and a three year old.
Oh.
And, uh, so I try to spend as much time as possible with them.
That's good.
Uh, what kind of things do you do?
Well, um, w, we do a lot of things with them, you know, Ta, Taylor my youngest is, or my oldest is in school and so she has a lot of school programs and things like that.
Oh.
Ho, was it a big change in your life, to, uh
Oh yeah
have a child.
Um, yeah, it's really nice, uh, my husband, uh, is working mo, you know, most of the time.
He's working long hours, but, uh,
Uhhuh.
I'm staying home.
Uhhuh.
Uh, I'm just working a couple days a month, and, um .
Oh, uhhuh.
What do you do during those, those days?
Um, we spend a lot of time at the playground and we go to the zoo, and we go and we wa, .
Well you said, you said you worked a couple days a month, though,
Yeah, yeah.
what do, what do you do?
I'm a nurse.
Oh, are you?
So, yeah, so it's, it's, it's real easy to work out my schedule,
Uhhuh.
you know, to, uh, get in, to, to still stay in with that,
Yeah.
an, and to have enough time to spend with Matthew.
Yeah.
He, he's, uh, just now really starting to, to get interested in a lot of things, so, um,
Yeah, I understand that, yeah.
They really grow up quick.
Especially at that early age.
Yeah
But my, my wife was, uh, she worked parttime when my oldest was, was little and now she's staying home all the time, but, uh, that worked out really well because it's a big transition I think to have children.
Oh, yeah.
You know, to go from, you know, nothing, you know, if you want to do something every night that's fine, but when you have children it doesn't work that way anymore, so.
That's right, and I think a lot of people are, um, are turning to, well, I think, I think a lot of people are realizing that but still there are so many people that are, you know, have their careers first and,
Yeah, yeah.
it's, uh, I think it's really hurting, uh, the kids, you know, but.
Yeah, I agree with you, I, I, I think that my wife leaned that way and I'm really glad she did and, you know, I'm glad she's staying home, but, you know, I know there are some days when she wi,
I know,
she wishes she was back at work.
That's why I like to to, to work a couple days, I think it's, uh,
Yeah.
it gives me a break.
Yeah, well t, see that's, that's why I'm glad my wife did too, 'cause she worked either two to thre, three days a week and that got her out of the house and yet she'd get to spend, you know, three or four days with .
Most of the time at home, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, and so.
Uh, we had started out like that and, um, I think that was really ideal, uh.
Yeah, I do to, I agree, but then when you start having two of them, it's, you know, a little bit tougher,
It's, yeah.
because you've got to make a little more money, to make that payoff and stuff.
Yeah, yeah, it's difficult, but.
Are, are you from the Maryland area?
Uhhuh, I'm, I've, I've lived here forever, so.
Really.
Yeah, I me, I live in Germantown, and, uh.
Are you, where are you from?
Um, uh, I'm in Dallas, Texas.
In Dallas, oh.
Yeah, so, uh, I'm, I've lived here like eight years or so, my wife's from Fort Worth.
Oh, yea.
But, yeah, I work for Texas Instruments.
Okay, oh, so that explains.
Yeah, that explains it doesn't it.
Well, um, I don't know, I, uh, we, we do a lot of things on the weekends together, the family,
Yeah, yeah.
but, uh, as far as during the week, it's, it's usually, uh, you know, just my son and I, and we're .
Yeah, what's your husband do?
Uh, he, he works for Coca Cola.
Uhhuh.
So he, uh, he manages a plant out here,
Oh.
an, and it takes a lot of time.
Oh, yeah, I'm sure it does.
But, um, it, you know, we take walks,
Uhhuh.
and go to the library,
Yeah.
and try to fill our day with things like that, but, um.
Yeah, what, uh, my wife did some teaching at like, uh, like a private tutoring place.
Oh.
A Sylvan Learning Center this year and so that, that got me to sp, to be able to spend more time with the kids at night and stuff,
Oh.
you know, 'cause normally if, if they need something they just go to mom.
Yeah
No matter what it is, I mean, I cou, I'm perfectly capable of doing it for them, but,
Right.
it's so much easier to go to mom, I guess they get used to it.
So, but, you know, we'd go to the library and do things like that, yeah, but
That's good, that's good.
I know my husband was real, uh, in the beginning when he, uh, he was transferred to a, a larger plant and he, uh, he works about an hour and a half away from here, from our home,
Uhhuh.
and, uh, so it takes him a little bit of time.
Oh, yeah.
And I'm not able to work during the week, uh, because of that.
He was, I was working in the evening,
Uhhuh.
and he was coming home and I, I could go to work, but, uh,
Yeah.
their relationship, uh, when I was able to work in the evenings, uh, really grew.
Uhhuh.
He, you know, just the time that they were spending together,
Yeah.
I think it, it really, it really helped to have that time together.
Uhhuh, it really does because I think yu, you know, you grow closer.
Was your, uh, was your husband, I mean naturally a child, I mean ha, had he been around children, or .
Uh, oh yeah, he has, uh, he has seven other brothers and sisters,
Oh.
and they have, we have thirteen grand, well his parents have thirteen grandchildren.
Uhhuh.
So it's, uh, you know, there's a lot of kids in the family and, and he really enjoys it.
Yeah, yeah.
But, uh, right now it's kind of a difficult time, but .
Yeah.
And, and the cost of living here is just so tremendously, you know, outrageous
Yeah, yeah.
Um, it's difficult, uh, to do it any other way.
Yeah, I understand.
Yeah.
I'm, I, you know it's, it's hard because, you know, then you're not getting to spend as much time with, at home, I mean your husband is not getting to spend as much time at home as he'd want to.
That's right.
So, yeah, that that's a tough situation, but then, then again, you know, some, you got to do what you got to do,
Yeah.
you know to get along, too, so.
Yeah, yeah, at least, I, I just consider myself blessed that I can stay home
It, uh,
Uhhuh, we, well like I said my wife normally feels that way, there are days when, uh, I come home and she says here take these kids, I'm getting out.
I know
So she's, she's had about enough during those days, but.
I know.
But, for the most part, I, you know, I've really feel like that's led, the way that, you know, we, jus, like what you said with the cost of living and everything, I think a lot of people can't afford to get by on just one salary an
Yeah.
and won't.
Yeah.
And so I think that's le, tended to lead to a decline in, in families and family values especially.
Oh yeah, it has.
And I really think that that's one of the problems the nation's facing that, you know, we need to do something about, but I don't know what.
I believe that too, and I think, uh, the kids are where they need to, you know,
Yeah.
they need to really focus on the children in the wor, in this country.
Yeah.
Would, would you have said that a couple of years ago, do you think?
No, I didn't, I didn't even really think about it that much, I mean, you know,
Uhhuh.
I, I was aware, vaguely aware of it, but, um, I didn't it wasn't really that important to me, and, uh, .
Uhhuh, it's amazing how your whole focus on life changes after you've had a child.
Oh, it, it really does, I, just the whole, uh, you know, seeing how you really are cre, are, are forming this,
Uhhuh.
you know, the mind
Well, you know, in the next year or so, you'll see so many instances where, you know, he'll mimic something that you've done, and you see, you know, everything I'm doing, he's learning from.
That's right.
And, and, you think, if I wasn't here he'd be learning that from a babysitter or from a day care.
Yeah.
You know, th, that's how they're developing their patterns.
And I think a lot of people either, don't care, or don't realize it, you know.
That's,
Or, or they just put it in the back of their mind and let it slide.
Yeah.
I, I've seen a lot of people just say well, you know, he'll learn everything when he gets into,
Yeah eventually.
uh, you know,
Yeah, it's true.
but it, um, I, I know, even just this first year, that I've been with, uh, my son, h, here, um, he's, I can just see how much,
Uhhuh,
of, of a difference it makes staying home with him,
Yeah.
instead of, uh,
Yeah, plus, plus I think it becomes part of y, part of you too, I mean, you get to stay home, I mean it's not just for him, but it's also for you, because you're both kind of bonding together there too, I think, so.
Yeah, that's true.
Well it's been nice talking to you.
Well it's nice talking to you, too.
Okay good luck.
Okay.
Okay, goodbye.
Okay.
Well, I do not know.
How big a city is Rome? I mean, you have heard about Dallas, and th, the crime here is pretty bad
Well, Rome is pretty small
But, uh,
Yeah.
I was going to say.
we hear a lot about, uh, New York City.
Uhhuh.
There is a lot of crime down there.
And I am, I am afraid to go down there because, you know, I mean, you hear about people getting mugged.
You leave your car for ten minutes and it is stripped when you come back.
Yeah.
Have you ever been there?
No, I have not.
Only to the airport.
That is, uh, probably enough to see
Um, are you in college right now?
No.
I am, I work at, for the Air Force.
Oh, okay.
So, there is a base up here.
And,
Are base, that's inter, interesting concept.
Are bases safe, you know?
Bases are pretty safe because they check your I D on your way in.
And,
Yeah.
The, they, uh, minimize the access.
Right.
But even so we had a, uh, uh, at New Years,
Uhhuh.
we had some people come in and, uh, like attack one of the planes.
Because they were protesting, uh,
Oh, no.
the presence over in the Persian Gulf.
Sure.
Oh, great.
That
So,
is wonderful.
Yeah.
Well, Dallas, uh, we lived in Minneapolis.
Uh, we moved here about ten months ago.
And Dallas is pretty, uh, well, we live in north Tex, north Dallas which is like a suburb, near a suburb called Plano.
So we are out of the city, but it is, uh, it is bad everywhere in terms of, uh, you know, the handgun situation, um, the number of rapes, the number of muggings.
Just, it is, it is, I would not say it is not as bad as New York, but it is pretty scary.
Yeah.
You know, people put bars on their windows in certain neighborhoods and,
Yeah.
you know.
They call them ornamental grates.
But they are still bars
That makes it bad for getting out during a fire.
Yeah.
It really does.
And if you are a little bit claustrophobic but, uh.
I do not know, I mean the jails are crowded.
I, I, I am not a criminal justice specialist, so I do not know what, you know, what can be done.
I am,
I do not,
you know,
I do not know, it seems to, I think it is getting worse.
Because I keep hearing things like I, when I was h, I went home, my parents live in Boston.
Uhhuh.
But I went home, and
Yeah.
we were watching T V, and this thing came on where these, a group of like five or six guys went and filmed themselves beating up people in the street and, and robbing
Oh.
them.
And it was really disgusting.
And my mom was like, "They should just be all shot right now.
And I mean, you he,
Were they teenagers or?
Uh,
Like that girl in New York that got beat up by, you know, when she was jogging
Yeah.
in Central Park,
Yeah.
Um,
a couple of years ago?
They were not, I think they were early twenties.
Yeah.
They were young men.
Yeah.
But they, so they weren't, you know.
And were they, uh, were they, were they obviously poor or depri, you know? That is really stra.
Like I say, s,
I know it.
How s, deprived could they be if they had a camcorder? Those are a thousand bucks.
Yeah.
Unless they stole it.
And I mean, that is one big thing down here.
I mean, they have like, uh, and they are not all young.
I mean, they are eighteen to twentyfour, some of the young men and women.
But, I mean, you can, you can see the Crime Stoppers ads on television.
And they are, sometimes it is the same people that have been, that have been observed and they still can't catch them
Yeah.
And you are wondering how, you know.
Um, we lived in Minneapolis and Wisconsin.
I mean, there was all kind of, I, I, know, I, I, I know it is getting worse.
I do not know what the world is or is not.
Uh, the dimi, in a small town in Wisconsin, near Madison, um, a young boy somehow got a hold of a shotgun.
Uhhuh.
And killed his parents and his three brothers and sisters.
And the child had, and he, they said that he was twelve years old, and he had, uh, he had not, uh, displayed any tendencies deviant or disturbed or whatever, you know.
Yeah.
And you are thinking to yourself, um.
I wonder where,
I know.
I do not know.
I wonder where he gets it? You know, you must, I think T V is bad.
Because they, uh, show all sorts of violence on,
That and I do not think a lot of parents, I mean, I do not, I do not know how it is in the Air Force base.
But, uh, I just do not think a lot of people, because of the economy, both need to work, you know.
I just do not think a lot of parents are that involved any more.
Yeah.
They do not, they do not talk to their kids and take them out.
And, and
Uh,
are not there all the time so the kids are off to their own devices a lot.
Right.
And discipline.
I do not know how your folks were, but I mean I sure knew as heck when I was growing up that, uh, my parents were the superior and I was the subordinate.
And, you know.
Oh, definitely.
It was sort of like there were boundaries.
And I do not think, I do not know, I think today a lot of parents, um, are ruled by their kids.
I, I,
I think so definitely.
When you go to a restaurant, and like kids are running all over the place.
They,
Yeah.
Right.
I mean, they are not learning how to, uh, well, like boundaries.
I mean, I do not, I see it in work place too, sometimes.
I do not know how old you are, but you sound a little bit younger than me.
But, I am in my thirties, and I, uh, I see, uh, even people that work with me that are ten years younger.
That, you know, they kind of have an attitude that I ha, I hate to to say it, but it's, that's just what it is.
It is an attitude
Yep.
But,
like
they,
the world owes them something.
Right, I, I see that too in the Air Force.
Espec,
Do you?
Oh, yeah.
A lot of, uh, especially since a lot of us are engineers where I work.
Are you in the Air Force?
I am in the Air Force.
Yes.
Okay.
And so, uh, people outside the Air Force doing engineering get paid a lot more than we do.
Sure.
And so all the young engineers are like, well, I am just, going, you know,
Huh.
get it for all it is worth.
And that,
Right.
you know, and I am like, you are the one who signed up.
If you did not want to do it.
And,
Right, right.
And the Air Force is one of the bitter, better military, supposedly m, m, military experiences.
Yep, it is.
I mean,
I like it a lot
Pardon me?
I like it so far.
I mean, that is, are you going to be a career person? I'm digressing, but,
I do not talk to many people in the
Oh.
military.
So I am,
Probably not.
But, uh, they pay for my college.
So,
That is the way to do it.
I mean, and that's, you know, at least the Air Force is, I do not know, I just, uh, I am nervous in Dallas.
I mean, I, you know, I mean, I go to like an aerobics class or something.
And, I, you know, uh, seventy women in a Jazzercise class in a public, uh, parks and rec building.
And you are supposed to feel safe, but then there are all these, it does not matter race, but, you know, it is an inter racial mix.
And you see these guys standing there watching you jump around in your leotards.
Yeah.
And I do not even think that way, but I mean, you just think to yourself, you, you just, I mean, nobody can think that, that it can't happen to them.
It,
No matter who they are or where they are at, you know.
Yeah.
And you never know who is watching, either.
I mean, did you, I do not know, I was in the grocery store this morning.
We, uh, went to New Orleans for four days and came back late last night, driving.
And it is about seven hours.
Huhuh.
Um, and that is a very, we had never been there.
That is a very, very neat town to visit.
Uhhuh.
Uh, in terms of the French Quarter and all of the things
Right.
you hear about.
But the crime is so bad there.
I mean, in all the tourist brochures you read about what you should or should not do.
How to carry
Uhhuh.
your wallet, uh.
This is New Orleans?
New Orleans, yeah.
Oh, I would hate to be there during Mardi Gras.
Let me tell,
I would never, yeah.
You just do not.
Do not even bother.
It is not worth it.
Uh, the, when we came back, I do not know if you have seen.
I was in the super market this morning and on the cover of TIME magazine, there is a girl, she is in Boston? She is on the east coast somewhere.
Real attractive young girl.
College freshman, I, college coed.
I think she is a freshman.
She had been dating a fellow for several
Uhhuh.
weeks.
They went back to her dorm room
Uhhuh.
and date rape.
I mean, and it just, sh, she looked anguished.
I mean, it was really just sad.
I mean, did not pick it up and read it, but I should have.
But I just looked at the picture and thought, what a world.
I know
I mean, I do not, yeah,
You can't trust anybody.
I do not have any, uh, cure,
It is, it is really scary.
No, you really can't.
I mean, I, they, we lease out a really nice two story town home in north Dallas.
And they have a real big thing here.
People, I mean, even dry cleaners knock on the door and are soliciting, you know.
They, everybody wants your business kind of thing.
Right.
And my husband is the kind of guy, he's, he's sometime, he was raised on a farm in southern Ohio, near Dayton.
And I think sometimes it is just, he and I are very different in terms of that.
I, I mean, I basically have started not to trust
Right.
anybody in general street smarts.
We,
And, uh, he opened the door.
I came downstairs and I was real upset and I probably got more nasty than I should have.
But I just said, Howard,
Uhhuh.
you know,
oh, my God.
I would not, I mean,
Well, you, you,
hear about people opening the door and getting blown away.
Or people, you know,
Oh, yeah.
And it does, I mean, it is, it is not a reason.
I mean, I have been to New York.
You should not deny yourself going to visit
Uhhuh.
and all that.
Uhhuh.
Uh, but it is not any worse.
I used to work for a mortgage company that was owned by, uh, are you from Boston?
Yeah.
Home Owners Savings and Loan in Boston.
Uhhuh.
And I know I never felt, I mean, I have been to downtown New York City and I have been to downtown Boston.
And I never felt any safer on Milk Street in Boston, staying at the Meridian,
I did not pay for.
But, I mean, I never felt any safer there than I did in any other city
Right.
I have been in, you know.
Right.
So I would say one thing.
Do not deny yourself the New York exper, bu, experience, but go with people that you know.
Yeah.
I would not want to go by myself.
No, uh.
But I mean, it, yeah, I do not know.
I mean, I, I guess I could go on and on about what to do about criminals.
Uh, I think the handgun, I am not real big on guns
Uhhuh.
myself.
So,
I think our
I mean,
justice system needs to be stricter.
I mean, because everyone, they do it and then they get out in a couple of years it seems like.
Are the New York, uh, are the New York, I do not know how the New York state prison system
They are
is but,
booked up
Yeah.
Are they booked up? That is a way to put it, they are booked up.
Are they paroling, uh, like murderers and, I mean, here it is just a real big deal.
They parole people that have killed police officers and then they are out doing it again.
Right, um, I do not, I do not know.
Because I am not real up on
Uhhuh.
a lot of news things.
But, you know, you just
Uhhuh.
hear about that, that, you know, it is a lot of repeat crime.
And you are like, why are they repeating? They should have been in there longer.
Or,
I know.
And then you think, I mean, I ha, I mean, I can remember, I have not been out of school that long, but it has been at least ten years.
And you think to yourself, was it that bad back then? Or is it just, I think that, like you said, television? Is it just that more people think there is like excitement in it, you know? I mean, people that may have been close to the edge just go over because they see something or read something.
It seems like a lot of, i, that it is more, like in Boston, there was a case of, uh, a couple of kids, fifteen year olds.
They wanted to see what it was like to kill someone.
Uhhuh.
So they, they picked on this
Uhhuh.
kid who was like new in town.
And they were like, well, no one was going to miss him anyway, you know, and it like,
Oh, god.
ugh, that is horrible.
How can you even think like that?
I, i, it is, yeah, isn't it something? I mean, I, I have a, I am originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and I have a niece and nephew.
And I just, uh, I mean my ten year old nephew says things that he is aware of that I am just going, Michael,
how did you hear about that? You know, it is just, I think kids get too
Yeah.
much too fast.
Yeah.
And all those sort of things.
In Atlanta, where my inlaws live, uh, they had that thing, you know, the high top sneakers,
Right.
the Air Jordans, et cetera.
Right.
Kids killing each other and beating their brains out.
Oh, for the sneakers.
Right.
Or the, or the jackets, the team like the Raiders
Yeah.
and the caps.
Yeah.
You know, stealing the hundred dollar jackets.
Uh, I mean, it is I guess, it goes from the most petty like that to like what you were saying that they, in Boston.
That is crime where they videoed.
That is probably one of the most
Yeah.
bizarre I have heard of.
Where they videotape themselves.
Yeah.
It seems like crime is turning into a pastime instead of like, you know, be .
Okay.
Yes.
Uh, well, right now we have one dog inside.
Uhhuh.
She goes out but I mean she's an indoor dog.
Yes.
And two outside cats.
Oh, gosh.
Male and female.
And how long have you had them?
The ma, the dog is probably about, about thirteen, fourteen years old.
Yes.
And the cats are, they might be as old.
I'm not sure
Kind of lose track
Yeah.
Well, that's interesting because we have a simi, we don't have cats but we do have a dog,
Uhhuh.
who is an indoor dog,
Uhhuh.
and she is going to be thirteen this summer so,
Oh, is that right?
Yes, uhhuh.
What kind of dog do you have?
Um, she's, um, a mix of Cockapoo, Cock, Cocker Spaniel and Poodle.
Oh, that's what ours is
Is that right?
Yes.
Isn't that interesting
What color is your dog?
White.
Oh, well, ours is black, so
Oh, uhhuh.
definitely different
I'll be darned.
Yes, she's a female and she's, um, been, she's been a really, a really good companion for me.
Um,
Uhhuh.
she's like a little shadow, you know, kind of,
Oh.
follows me around all the time,
Yeah.
and, and, um, she's slowing down considerably.
She doesn't hear very well and,
Uhhuh.
she doesn't see very well but she's,
Well, that's to be expected at,
Yeah,
their age.
at this age, I guess so.
Yeah.
But, um, she's been a good dog to have, and I don't know, once she's gone, I'm not sure if I'll get another animal or not
Well, everybody always says no more
Yeah, yeah.
But I, I think animals are really important in the family.
I,
I agree, yes.
Um, did you get yours as a pet for your chil, do you have children?
Uh, yeah, we,
Uhhuh.
have five.
Uhhuh.
Oh.
Well, I was wondering if you got your dog originally as a pet for them or just because you'd had dogs before or,
Well, we have had, we had had, a, a dog before.
She was fifteen when she died.
My goodness.
And, uh, this one, we bought by accident,
Uh.
a farmer called us and wanted us to call the animal shelter to co, or the dog catcher or somebody to come and get this puppy that,
Uhhuh.
somebody, people drop things like that off,
Yeah.
up there,
Uhhuh.
and I said, "Gee, she sounds like a cute little dog.
I told the kids, "Let's go look at her"
Oh, yeah.
Go get her.
So that's how we got her,
Isn't that,
quite by accident.
Yes.
So that often happens that way.
Well, we had, um, intentionally, um, planned to get a dog.
We had just moved into this house and, um, decided to wait about a year and then went,
Uhhuh.
then we went out then, and found one, she was in the litter,
Uhhuh, uhhuh.
and, um, she was so cute because all the other little puppies in that litter were just crazy.
I mean, they were all over the place,
and she was real docile and,
Oh.
came over and just kind of sat next to us, and I thought,
Oh.
that's the dog for me
She picked us
Yeah, so she, and it, what was funny was that, um, our daughter must have been, let's see, she must have been about eight at the time, I guess,
Uhhuh.
and, um, she just loved this little dog,
Oh.
to pieces but I think she loved her too much because the dog has never been real comfortable with her.
I think,
Oh.
she was always a little bit leery of her.
Uhhuh.
Our son, on the other hand, who was about eleven at the time, was, um, not very interested in pets, but as it turned out, he and this dog have gotten to be really good pals.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
So you just never know how that works out
No.
But they say it's real important for children to have pets because, uh, well, they can go and talk to them any time,
Uhhuh, yes.
they want to and tell them anything they want to and,
Yeah.
nobody is going to, you know, reprimand them or,
That's right.
know their secrets or
That, yes, they're very,
Yeah.
unjudgmental
Yes
Oh, dear
And the nursing homes now, they're finding that it's real important to take a pet into a nursing home.
Yes, I have been, I have been reading and seeing about that on television.
Uhhuh.
Uhhuh, and how,
Our one, our one nursing home in has one.
Uhhuh.
Permanent
Is that right?
He, he kind of has free run of the place, and there is some, or somebody takes care of him.
Isn't that amazing?
But he goes out people, and real nice dog, uh, and, uh,
Uhhuh, yes.
It's funny how, um, how pets can kind of, um, oh, take on a certain status in certain areas.
Uhhuh.
I mean, um, that made me think of, uh, when our daughter was looking at colleges, we visited a campus in, um, Saint Louis and,
Uhhuh.
um, there were several dogs on the campus and,
Oh, really?
and, the, what was interesting about it was that they were very friendly, but they didn't appear to belong to anyone.
And, um,
Oh.
I'm sure someone, you know, fed them.
They were healthy,
Yeah.
looking dogs.
But, um, our guide that day said that the la , one woman many, many years ago had given a huge sum of money to, to the university, on the condition that there be, um, dogs just kind of left to roam aro, around the campus.
Is that right?
Which is the strangest thing I had ever heard
Yeah because most campuses don't allow pets,
I know.
you know, they just do not allow them.
Yes, I know.
That's, that's kind of great.
Yes, it really was.
It was just a nice touch,
Yeah.
and it kind of made it seem more homey too
Yes, yeah.
But, um, th, I thought that was most unique.
And it just, you know, kind of goes along with what you were saying,
Uhhuh.
about the dog having sort of free run of the, the nursing home.
Uhhuh.
So, um, but, uh, I, this is the only pet we've had sin,
Um.
you know, in all our years of marriage, um, and it's been, uh, sort of a, a change for my husband because as a, a, a boy growing up, his father had dogs but they were always hunting dogs,
Oh, uhhuh.
and so they were never allowed in the house, you know,
Uhhuh, uhhuh.
they were always kind of,
Yeah, we've ruined them
Yeah, right.
That's what he said.
They say ruined them
Yes.
So having a pet was a little bit different for him.
Well, we've had a lot of different pets.
We had, the kids had rabbits for pets,
Uhhuh.
and we also raised them for food,
Yeah,
at one time.
Oh, yes.
And we've had it .
We've had a skunk for a pet.
Oh, my golly.
For more years than I want to think about
She was in the house
Oh, gosh.
Isn't that interesting? I don't think I've ever talked to anyone who's actually had a skunk for a pet.
Well, do, don't ever get one for a pet.
Oh.
They're okay, but like she, uh, they don't ever learn their name.
Oh.
Uh, you can't, you could never call her and she would come to you,
Yeah.
you had to go chase her down.
I'll be darned.
How interesting.
And, uh, their eyesight, they can't see very far either.
But,
Uhhuh.
I guess I've heard that, uhhuh.
They, be, before we got her, everybody said, "Oh, they're just like a cat," you know.
Uhhuh.
And, uh, they're not
I mean, they use the litter box.
That's about it .
Isn't that interesting? That's, that's really something.
Um, how long did you have that?
Oh, my, how, how long? Probably seven or eight years.
Goodness sake.
And finally, my children are the ones who said, "Mom, you've put up with that skunk long enough," so,
we moved her to the basement, and I don't think she was there a week till the men moved her, buil, built her a pen outside
Oh, my gosh.
Isn't that funny?
And I thought, I put up with that all those years
Yes, and this is what it took finally
And,
That is,
we've had, we've had cats,
Uhhuh.
stay in the house.
Yeah.
We had, we had two Siamese cats.
Uhhuh.
Different times.
Right.
Uh, one of them ran off.
She ran off once, or he, I guess it was a male, he ran off twice, and the second time he never came back.
My goodness.
And we would see him, uh, several miles from our house,
Uhhuh.
he kind of moved into a woods down there.
I'll be.
And he got huge down there.
My goodness.
He really grew but he,
That's in,
he never came back.
That's interesting.
I, I wouldn't picture a Siamese as being an outdoor cat.
Well, he wasn't a whole lot.
Uhhuh.
He was in the house most the time,
Yeah.
but, uh, he did go out sometimes and, uh, they ma, it makes a much nicer cat if they're outside.
Is that right?
Yeah.
The, the cats, my son has a cat, and the vet had told us they get strange,
Uhhuh.
if they're kept in the house all the time.
And their cat was not a friendly cat, it was,
Well.
it was not a good, I don't know, it got, it was just, did get strange
Yeah, so that that was right.
And since they've moved to where they are, they let the cat out.
Uhhuh.
And it has improved the personality.
Okay, do you, uh, think we should go metric?
Well, I, I, oh, I don't know.
It's kind of a tricky question, because I think it's, it's a practical system,
Yeah.
obviously, if it's all compatible and it, you know, tens and things make sense.
Um, it's, it's a switch.
The problem would just be the switch over.
Yeah.
I think that the, I think what, I mean, I don't know what happened last time.
I remember they tried it in the seventies at one point or something and,
Right.
That's when I was in the elementary school years and we all,
Yeah, me too.
We all learned that metric and they were ready, we were going to be metric and,
Right, and, and I don't quite know why it failed.
Um, I would bet the push, I, it, I bet the push just wasn't big enough.
Right.
You know, they didn't sort of encourage, I mean businesses and things to use it, so, you know, what, what I think they'd have to do would be to have both things on there for a while, and then, and then start phasing things out so,
So I think that's what they did at first,
Yeah.
was that they had metric and, and I mean, and there's things that we've gone metric.
We have metric cola now,
Right, I was just thinking,
you can buy that and you can,
two liter bottles are what you buy and one liter bottles.
You don't buy quarts and gallons anymore of soda.
So that, you know, so that, we have little things that are metric, but no one talks about, you know, uh, you buy nine by twelve frames, you don't buy centimeter length frames,
Right.
and cooking pans.
And, and, and even though the car says miles and kilometers, you don't say, I went,
Uhhuh .
a hundred kilometers.
Right,
You know.
fiftynine kilometers per gallon.
Yeah.
I would, I would be total loss.
Yeah.
That's,
I think, I think, though, if there were some, you know, sort of government incentive program or something
Right.
people would begin to switch over, you know, and I think there would be the hard core older people who would get really pissed and, pardon my expression there, but, uh,
Uhhuh.
who would get really, you know, upset and start to complain and get all cranky and stuff.
But I think in the end it would make life a lot easier for
Yeah, it really would.
people coming up.
It's, I, I, it's, because I think they had a good try there when they started with us in the elementary schools, trying to, you know, get that in our minds, so that we could ch, I mean because I think our generation could make a change.
Yeah.
It would be difficult, but it would not be as difficult for people, say, fifty years old now who are, have never been exposed to the metric system other than, you know, buying a two liter Coke.
Right.
That's
Well, what I think, I think the difference between now and then might be, this is just a might, is we were the first generation that was in elementary school.
Right.
And if they kept it up, so let's say, imagine they had kept going, you'd have, you know, two or three more generations that all now are, are familiar with the metric system.
Right.
Not like could use it comfortably right now, but I could convert, you know, I could carry around a little conversion card or something and,
Right
I could handle it for a while, and then, and then eventually I'd learn, and I think that before, it was just, you know, just a bunch of little kids using it.
Right.
And now I think there are enough people, you know, sort of as we get older, I think others that will bring more generations in on it, eventually they'll be able to make the switch, and we're not going to start going crazy and yelling and saying,
what are you, crazy, we can't understand you.
We'll say oh, it's a pain in the neck, but it's for the better and we'll sort of deal with it, I think.
That's true.
That makes sense.
I don't know.
I, I, I would hope it would, uh, it seems like it's a reasonable system.
I mean, everything seems to be based on the same thing.
Well, I was trying to think of what kind of things you'd have to change, and you'd have to change your height on your driver's license.
Right
When you wouldn't be five foot eight anymore, uh, you'd be a hundred and seventy centimeters,
Centimeters.
and then you'd be lighter in kilograms than you were in
Yeah.
in pounds.
But I wonder if, if,
So all the dieters would be happy
But yeah right
I only weigh sixteen today.
That's,
Yeah.
But I wonder if that's even something that, you know, they, they have to change immediately.
They could just, you know, sort of phase that in, so start, you know, from now, like from now on all licenses would have that,
Right.
rather than going back and changing everything, you know, all new licenses as of nineteen ninetytwo would have it or something.
And they'd have to change that little ruler that's on the door of the seven eleven that,
tells you how tall the robbers are when they,
That's right.
to hold it up.
I know the, and, oh, yeah, I know, though, at the, uh, at the amusement parks, they say if you're under fortytwo,
inches or something.
Right.
You can't walk in here.
You have to be under.
Well, I guess what, what, I bet what they do in that case, they, uh, see, what some of them is like, you know, they say if you're not taller than this line.
Right.
this line, which is seventythree centimeters.
That's right.
Just so you'll know, but that would be good.
That, I don't know.
It would be a neat case where like, where kids taught the parents, I think, you know.
Right.
Because isn't it pretty much everywhere in the world? I know England is not metric.
But I don't know.
I,
Eng, Eng, England is not?
I don't think they are, because our, um, our measurements started in England,
Oh.
all that began back there, and I think they're the only part of the continent that hasn't changed over to metric.
Yeah, but I mean, but, but virtually the rest of the world is.
I mean, it seems like
Right.
like, like, like sort of stupid.
I mean, we are, of course, we are Americans and we're supposed to be, you know,
We're the trend setters in the world.
I don't know why we,
That's right, and, and now we're backwards.
We haven't changed to the sensible system.
I don't know.
No, I, I, I would think, I mean, a, a, a base ten system as compared to a base twelve system
Right.
makes a lot more sense.
Well, and it's not even base twelve for everything, is it? It,
No, actually, no.
Um, let's see, it's,
Well, pounds, I don't even know what that,
I don't know.
Oh, yeah, I, I always forget.
I don't even know how many ounces are in a pound.
I just sort of make it up.
See, and I don't understand liquid ounces and fluid ounces.
It's, I mean, I don't know that I have that much concrete knowledge in the current measuring system that would
Right
prevent me from,
Those, those wouldn't be a problem.
It's not like it's really entrenched other, you know.
A lot of stuff,
Let's see, how many cups equal that?
I, I have no idea.
I just, uh, I know things like, you know, a pint is a pound the world around or something.
Right
I don't,
That's all I know.
I didn't even know that
I, I learned that because, uh, a friend of mine, I, I had two friends, and, I had more friends than that, but two friends of mine in college,
I had a lot more than two, I promise.
Well, that's good.
Um, we opened a jelly bean business.
Oh.
And we sold jelly beans, and we had, uh, no idea how many, you know, we, we didn't bo, we didn't bother buying a scale.
Right.
We'd go out and just buy, you know, five pound bags of sixteen different flavors, put it in plastic shoe boxes and, and, and then sell them for x amount per pound or quarter pound or something.
Right.
And we, we didn't bother buying a scale, and one of my friends was a physics, one of these guys was a physics major and he said, well, just remember a pint is a pound the world around, and he got the measuring cup and just measured, I think a cup or two cup, whatever is a pint.
Did you ever check it to see if it really was,
Gee, I think, wh,
a pint?
I think he the calculation at home, and it turns out that he was actually pretty close.
Um.
If anything, we were actually in favor of the consumer.
Right.
So, so we were giving them a little too much, but that was our general tendency anyway.
Well, that's, you all are nice business
Yeah, well, we were, you know, we were in, it was, it was almost like we did it for the hell of it in school, we really didn't,
Right.
make, you know, I think we were only making seventyfive dollars each profit at the end of the year.
Right
You know, after, after an entire semester, but we had a hell of a lot of fun doing it.
Probably ate all your merchandise too.
Yeah, we, we, we tended to eat a lot, and our friends would just sort of walk by and just put their hands in it, and we had another friend, um, the physics major again, he wasn't
Uhhuh.
he wasn't aware of jelly bean physiology, I guess, and he got into a snowball fight,
with the jelly beans nearby, and he just, and, and some snow fell into one of the cartons.
Oh.
So he brought them into the bathroom to wash them off
And basically what we had, sort of non coated beans at that point.
Yeah, it's a little problem.
What's inside the jelly bean?
Uh, it's just, uh, it's just the, the same, they're like an outer coating, and there's just sort of th, this stuff you see, you know, it's sort of like glorified sugar.
I don't know.
Uh, oh.
But when you rinse them off, all you get is, uh, is, uh, the coating,
Yeah.
Yes, I talked with, um, I talked with people from Richardson and Plano and, uh, the first three days, and then yesterday I talked with someone with, from Pennsylvania, so,
Yeah, because,
it's the,
I've only made, this is only my third call.
Oh.
I, I tried to make calls two different days and I couldn't get through.
Oh, I know.
Sometimes I just I'm, in, it just takes a very long time so,
Does it? Yeah, I've been trying to, you know, do that, and, and sometimes I just can't wait that long,
Yeah, I know.
so I just hang up.
Well.
Because it keeps going through the thing over and over again.
This is hilarious
But I knew as soon as I heard your voice, I thought, Kathy's, it's Kathy Kester
Oh.
Well, tell me, what books have you read lately?
Well, let's see, I, um, gosh, I can't even think.
I haven't read any, and you're such a reader, I know that and I,
Well, I don't read all that much for enjoyment.
I mean, I read a lot for school, but gee, I just don't have much time for enjoyment reading
Yeah.
The, the last book I picked up was a book by Judy Bloom,
Uhhuh.
and it was, um, it was called, um, SMART WOMEN, I think.
Um.
Um, or something like that.
Yeah.
And it was, it was kind of, I really didn't like it at all.
Huh.
It was, it was written back in the early eighties.
Oh, yeah.
And it was all this, this, um, divorced woman syndrome
Oh, yeah.
of the, um, it was almost like a, a preAIDS scare kind of thing.
Interesting.
It was really an interesting, because I, I right away looked at when it was copyrighted.
Uhhuh.
Because I could tell by the theme of almost when it was written.
Yes, yes, yeah.
And it was all about women searching for themselves.
Uhhuh.
And, um, you know, a lot of hankypanky,
Yeah.
going on.
Yeah.
That kind of was, um, kind of a pop psychology time for wh, when a lot of books like that were coming out, I think.
That's right.
And so that makes real sense, that that's, um, when it was written.
Yeah, yeah.
Um, I haven't, wasn't really aware that she had written anything for, um, adults.
I was always,
Uhhuh.
just more aware of her jer, you know, for her young people, her books.
Yeah, and she's more famous for that,
Uhhuh.
but she has been writing for adults also,
I'll be darned.
and so I thought hey, I'll just try this, you know,
Yeah.
and see what it was like.
It was very, um, the style was very conversational.
Uhhuh.
You would have lots of conversations between people
Yeah.
rather than any description.
Right, yeah, yeah.
You know how that is, and um,
Yeah.
I wonder if she's written anything really recently, if she's got anything printed, in print.
Yeah, she has, because I, I remember seeing a new book by her
Uhhuh.
that was out, and I think it was a, it was an adult book.
I'll be darned.
So anyway,
Yeah.
but that's the last thing I, I've read,
Yeah.
and, um,
Well, it's, I'm trying to think the last actual book I read that wasn't, let's see, I think I read, oh, when I was on vacation, um, between semester break and summer, you know, on semester break between spring and summer
Yeah.
and I went to my mother's, I read a book that I have, should have read when I was probably in high school.
I read, um, JANE EYRE.
I,
No, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
JANE EYRE? No, no, no, no, it wasn't JANE EYRE.
WUTHERING HEIGHTS?
No, it was, um, uh, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE,
Oh, yeah,
by Jane Austen.
by Jane Austen, yes.
That's what it was, yes.
Yes.
And, um, you know, I, I didn't know what to expect, except I had heard that, that Jane Austen was such a wonderful novelist, and she really was good.
I mean, I was, was very much impressed with the way her plot was put together so,
Uhhuh.
intricately and, um, and, you know, I just, but I, as I say, I was pretty much ashamed that I hadn't read something before then.
Yeah.
Because I, I think I was, I think I read it in college,
Uhhuh.
or had to write it, read it in high school or college, but I don't remember it.
Yeah, yeah.
And then when Jennie had to read it at Gettysburg
Uhhuh.
and I got her the, I got her someone, I think it was, um, oh, some actress reading it.
Oh, how interesting.
You know, they had an abridged version of it on tape.
Yeah.
And so I got that for her, and she loved doing that.
Oh, I'll bet, yeah.
But I remember that was the book.
Yeah.
And now I, I mean, I think it's around here somewhere,
Right I wouldn't be,
I'm just going to have to put it,
surprised, yeah.
in the car sometimes and listen to it.
Sure.
Oh, yeah.
But, um,
Well, I read that, and then I'm trying to think, um, usually I try to, to find something long that,
Uhhuh.
I'm going to, when if, if I have long periods of time, like Christmas vacation, or, you know, when I know I'm not going to be doing anything for a while, um,
Yeah.
Oh, that's what I do too.
Yeah, and that's about it, because otherwise I'm reading so much for school.
I'm, um, I have just started reading a book.
Actually, it's for school, but it's for, um, there's a, a literary jour, well, not a literary journal, it's a, it's kind of a journal of, of the history of ideas that's, that's starting to be published, um, from U T D.
The first issue doesn't come out until next year, but, um,
Oh, yeah.
I'm doing some reviews of books, just to, what, to sort of recommend to wh, whether or not a fullscale review should be done for the journal,
Oh, how neat.
and I've, yeah, it's really neat because these are brand new books and I,
Oh, great.
just got a, I got a, th, this one, um, most of the stuff is on, uh, literary criticism and philosophy,
Uhhuh.
and religion and all that.
Uhhuh.
This one is on Johann Sebastian Bach, and it's a, a, a biography,
Oh, great.
that is really interesting,
Oh, that's fascinating.
I mean, it, it's fascinating, it really is.
Oh.
Um, but it's so long, I, I don't really have the time to read the whole thing, but I think,
Yeah.
eventually I'll go back to it.
But it's,
Yeah.
it was written, I mean the, the copyright is nineteen ninetyone, so it's a brand new book.
Oh, it's a brand new book.
Yeah, uhhuh.
Oh, that, that would be wonderful
Yeah,
to read something like that.
and he really, this man really shed some light on, um, some,
Yeah.
aspects of of Bach's genius and, and, and, you know, the, and more sociological things, you know, like the, the idea that, um, that music, to be a musician was as much, um, of a family occupation as anything.
I mean, you know, that was
Yes.
it was families had just loads of musicians
Yeah, and they just went from generation,
Yeah.
probably to generation,
that's right.
just with these, with these all passing it from one to the other.
Yes, uhhuh, and, um,
Yeah, that's the way it was, I'm sure back then.
Yeah.
So, uh,
Yeah.
Oh, that's interesting.
it was just really interesting, if that's, you know, that's kind of what, but I have to not only am, am I re, reading it to decide whether or not it should be reviewed, but also, um, because the board of advisers for this, um, journal doesn't have, right now doesn't have a really respected name, um, who's a, uh, a scholar on, on music,
Uhhuh.
um, and I'm supposed to decide whether I think this man might be a worthy person to be a, you know, in that position on the board so,
Oh, yeah.
I don't know if I want to take that responsibility or not, but
Wow, that's rough.
But at least I,
That's real rough.
can tell them what I think, so, um,
Yeah.
it's real interesting.
Well, that's a neat thing to be involved in.
Yeah, it is.
Because I think our, I think my alma mater, um, Gettysburg, I think they were just starting a magazine
Uhhuh.
that was similar to that.
Yeah, yeah.
I think that's probably a, sort of a thing to do
Yes
in small colleges,
Yeah,
but, um,
that it, you know, you see, you see a lot of small colleges doing things,
Uhhuh.
like that, right, uhhuh,
Yeah.
because it attracts really a, a lot people's interest.
That's one way, it's really good public relations for small schools,
Oh, yeah.
I think so
Yeah.
But, uh, another one of my projects this summer is, actually it's part of my research assistantship, is, um, it's helping a professor, uh, compile a bunch of translations of, of various poems for a book that he's writing, and
Oh.
so I'm learning the names, if not the actual contents, of a lot of different poems and a lot of French people.
Now, translations, what do you mean, translations of, of,
Um, well, where, where, for instance, um, a Baudelaire poem that was written,
Yeah.
in the French and then has been translated into English by,
Uhhuh.
various people.
Oh, I see.
And the translations are all so different from one another.
All different.
Uhhuh.
Oh, that's interesting.
So it's multiple translations of single works and, and that's right now, right now pretty much what I'm doing as far as, um, my work, is just kind of compiling,
Gosh.
all that for him.
So,
That's great.
It's real interesting.
Boy, you really lift me up to a different,
I mean, here I, I'm dealing with, uh,
cleaning the stove and,
Oh, well, let me tell you,
You know, I'm
There are days when I would be prefer ,
I wish I were dealing with Baudelaire.
really doing that
That would be nice.
I don't know if I've told you, but, um, this is not on the subject,
I guess we are just to discuss trials and, and punishment.
If it's to be given by the judge or not.
Did you, did you catch your explanation of that?
Yes, I did.
It's, it's, uh,
Okay.
The, uh, maybe I'm a hard liner but I think that there should be some preset penalties in criminal cases.
Rather than, uh, degrees of sentencing.
You mean the crimes or the punishment should fit the crime?
Right.
Right.
Okay
Uh, again, having participated in jury duty myself, I know
Yes, I did also.
I know how such a diverse group of people get together, the different backgrounds, different ideas, that
Right.
sometimes you can have one person or two,
a telephone buzzer>>.
that can hold up what I consider the proper sentencing,
of the p, person.
Could you hang on one minute Jim?
Yes ma'am.
Thank you pause>>.
I am so sorry to keep you on hold.
No problem.
Are you at work?
Yes.
Okay, I am too.
Um,
Yeah.
Um, I think what you have is, the way the, the justice system works is they bend over backwards trying to protect the guilty.
Oh, it's insane.
So many things in their back, pardon?
It's insane.
Yes.
I know,
sounds>>.
my wife participated in a jury trial several years back
Yes.
wherein the individual after it was over and they,
had came up with the maximum sentence
Yes.
in the jury form they found out that, uh, the gentleman involved had a long history of the same type offense
Right.
which was theft of
Uhhuh.
uh, property.
Oh yes.
And yet, the as, the attorney,
for the prosecution could not enter these, uh, the good man's background into it.
It was like,
this was a first time offender.
Yes.
Whereas, uh,
I think that's,
It seems like ,
Those that should be in jail should be in jail
That's correct and there's too much leniency, there's too much, uh, um, underhanded, uh, things going on that the public are not aware of.
Yeah faintly>>.
And it seems as though we are, uh, giving the criminal the benefit, more than the victim.
The victim has been victimized twice, not only by the perpetrator of the crime but also,
the courts that try to do the justice.
Well, I think this is one of the reasons that also that attorneys have such a, a, unsavory reputation, shall we say?
I do not have any, I don't have an ounce in my body of credibility toward the, the judicial system in
Yeah faintly>>.
the United States.
Well, what you got is the situation wherein, uh, if you ever get in trouble, you want to hire the smartest, crookedest, lawyer you can find.
Isn't that terrible?
And, uh, that's not the idea.
It's, the idea is not to get the guy off of the crime,
that he committed, but to punish him for the crime he committed.
Well, to punish him for the crime but also to try and reeducate the man's thinking.
Yeah.
To get him out of that, uh, uh, criminal mind that he has and to direct,
him into a more productive life.
Yeah
Well we have, uh, a situation again that I am familiar with where, uh, the son of an acquaintance of mine
Uhhuh.
was killed
Oh faintly>>.
while trying to stop a robbery.
Yes, how sad.
And the person that killed him was a young woman who had left the house with full intent to commit crimes, carrying a gun in her purse.
Uhhuh.
And, anyway it'd get to the, she was sentenced to jail but then due to technicalities, she was going to be out of jail within eighteen months after she was sentenced.
Oh.
Of course it took eighteen months for the thing, the trial to happen.
Right.
So, then, uh,
there was a letter writing campaign that went in, and the Parole Board received approximately a thousand letters protesting putting this person back on the street within eighteen months after killing someone.
And, uh, fortunately it worked.
They, uh, elimi, they corrected the technicality.
Well if,
And the person now will have to serve three to four years of the seven or eight they were sentenced to.
Yes.
If enough of the public,
responded to, uh, the dir, the, uh, parties that are involved, and if enough, they will listen to the voice of the people.
I have found that out.
That if enough people respond and rise up against the injustices being done, something is going to change.
Right.
People have to be involved.
sipping through a straw>> This is it
Yeah.
and most people don't take the time.
That's right.
Again the only reason I took the time is because I was personally acquainted
That's right.
with these people.
I'm just
You were,
as guilty as the rest in that respect.
Yes.
Uh, but, and I'm not making an excuse but we, our priorities are a bit backward.
Oh yes.
Well, they, again the, and I'm not knocking the civil rights program or anything like that, but we've gone,
overboard to, uh, protect persons from being, having their civil rights,
violated to the point where the person that is damaged,
is not protected.
It's again the victim gets worse punishment then the person,
that commits the crimes.
That's correct.
Yeah
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
I think we're both in agreement on this subject.
Well, I am too.
I mean I, I just can't.
I, you know, I served on a jury for a lady that was having a mental problem and we found her not guilty because the lady obviously was not in their right mind.
So if the person is not in the right mind, I mean they had to, uh, put her away.
Yeah.
But for her own safety and for, because she didn't know what she was doing.
And we couldn't, we just dismissed the case.
Yeah.
You know, and, and, she was, uh, taken care of by the proper facility.
Yeah.
Well another side of the coin that with our justice system there are a lot of frivolous cases that go to court.
There are a lot of things that could be settled out of court
Yes, that's true.
which, uh, or should never have gone to court.
And then the amazing thing, of course, is how, uh, some cases can come to trial in thirty days, and others it takes eighteen months
Okay, so what were you saying?
Do you work with, do you work around children when you work?
No, no, not at all.
I work with computers.
With computers.
Yep, they what,
Okay, do you ha,
one thing I,
but you have friends that have children.
I have some friends that have children, uh, not that many actually.
Uhhuh.
Uh.
What is child care like in New York? What is,
I do not really know, excuse me, too much about child care in New York
Does the company you work for have,
child care on premises for,
Excuse me one second.
employees?
Huhuh
No, not at all, in fact my situation is a little bit strange, I was, uh, a student for many years, and then graduated and went and worked in France for awhile.
And, I,
Oh.
have just come back and was doing consulting work.
Oh, my.
So I am just taking a little bit of time off right now.
A sabbatical
Uh, and, and I might,
Well I hope you can stay as long as possible with it.
Yeah, well hopefully I can do some consulting work at home.
And, if I can do that it will, Yeah,
Oh yeah, that would be wonderful.
I'll be able to spend the time with my daughter, and
Right.
not have to worry too much about child care.
But,
Right.
uh, I might start to go crazy with it too.
It is a little, I miss the intellectual stimulation.
Right.
But at the same time I really, it would break my heart to give her to a stranger right now.
And,
I think it does when, when they are real little and they are changing every day,
Oh, yes.
there's, and you just miss the little things,
Yeah.
and, and, uh,
Well, I think for me, the important concerns, I do not think I would put her in day care for joint ,
Uhhuh.
situation right now, unless it was like one other child with a, with a person.
Uhhuh.
I would not want her to be into a, in a large day care situation so young.
Uhhuh.
Because I think a little infant just does not get the stimulation they need.
That's right.
Maybe if I needed to work part time, like four hours a day, I might do that, cause like, you should get enough stimulation from you the rest of the time.
But, uh, I just think that, you know, when there's two year olds running around, the, whoever is taking care of, the care givers are going to pay attention to the two year olds.
That's right.
And only when the infant screams,
That's right.
are they going to go there, and if not, the infant is going to lay in the crib all day, and maybe have a mobile above it to play with.
Right.
And, you know, I play with her most of the time she is awake and I think that is so important.
Right.
Well that, it is important for the bonding that they do it,
Yeah.
with the mother.
Well, such as things for learning gives the child stimulation I think is important.
Right.
And, uh,
Our oldest grandson, when he was eighteen months old went into a, a Montessori,
Uhhuh.
day care system.
And they took infants starting at six weeks, and they have a program, uh, in, that was devised by this montessori person and, uh, and a certain type of stimulations and there's times of day that even when the child is awake that they, that they lay quietly and look at certain things they keep, deliberately keep the room not real bright.
Uhhuh.
And, and, uh, they have different things they will, they will put them down on the floor, and of course, they never have more than like five, and, and they will put them down on the floor and they will have on, I think one of them was a little mirror and some were just different objects that have, had a definite purpose
Uhhuh.
for kids, you know, and there's something about their eyes.
Yeah,
Uh,
well she's, she's just been doing all kinds of stuff where she's, you know ,
How old is she?
She's two months now, nine weeks.
Oh, yeah.
And she's just drastically moving her eyes from one side to another and things like that.
Uhhuh.
And she's just started that like yesterday or the day before,
Uhhuh, uhhuh.
and so every days are different.
Uhhuh.
And I think that, you know, I think child care for infants is much harder than when they are older, and I will probably be going back to work around January,
Um.
whereas she will be about,
A little older .
eight or nine months old.
And so I think, you know, she will be at a, I have heard it's a rough age to put them into a,
It is because that's when they are clinging to mama,
Yeah.
so you might have a real problem with that.
I think it,
But, but I think it,
it hurts the parents to leave when the child is crying, so it, you know, it would be ideal if you could get somebody in so you are not really leaving the child in a strange place.
Yeah.
We are just going to have,
But that's unusual.
to see how things work out.
Uh, but I am trying to, you know, leave her a fair amount, even at this young age, with her grandparents, just to,
Uhhuh.
go to a movie and things like that.
So that she is used to other people taking care of her.
Is it your parents or your husband's parents?
My parents, my husband's parents are in France.
So, it's a little bit harder but during, you know, sh, sh, she's met them already.
Oh.
Not that she will remember them, but she's met them.
Right, right.
That's nice when, uh, I, my, I have three grandchildren, another one coming in September, and I, it would, if they were where I could not get my hands on them, I am afraid I would probably go crazy.
Uhhuh.
You know, I, I like that,
Are they all nearby?
but if, it you do not have to put them in child care, that's, that's an ideal situation for you, is to stay with them as, or you can set up your work program and your husband's so that one of you is there all the time.
Yeah.
That's, that's wonderful for the child.
But,
Well, if I work part time that might be doable.
Right
And you need to look at, when you, if you do decide to go with child care, you really need to, to look at what your options are and, and look at the, what they offer, drop in at times that are unexpected.
Yeah, well,
The,
right now the situation is so tight at many places,
Uh.
that it's even hard to have a choice.
Uh.
Incredible, but you know, since this is, people before they get pregnant are finding child care for the kids
Uhhuh, uhhuh.
And, you know, I just find that incredible.
And my sisterinlaw is going to have a baby very, very soon and she is intending to stay home with the baby.
Oh.
And, you know, maybe do some free lance type work at home.
And so, if I go back to work on a part time basis, I am hoping I can leave my daughter with her.
Oh, that would be wonderful.
Because, her daughter again will be a couple of months, my daughter will be about six months older than hers.
And,
Uhhuh, uhhuh.
it will be a little rough when she is a very, very little infant,
Uhhuh, uhhuh.
but like when she is a month or so, my sisterinlaw has had lots and lots of experience dealing with babysitting for large families.
Oh.
And so, uh, she might be able to do it a couple of hours a day and we cou, might even be able to do it on a trade off basis.
That I watch,
Right.
their baby when they want to go out to dinner or to movies or whatever,
Right.
or if she wants an afternoon off.
Right.
Even if she wants an afternoon just to work.
Uhhuh, uhhuh.
Uh, and not be bothered, we might be able to exchange that way.
Uhhuh.
And so we will just have to see how things work out.
But I think the whole, you know, ideally I think, uh, business should have the,
I do too.
day care centers there, whether it's the parents who take turns watching the kids, or whether they hire a couple of people and, uh, you know, parents come down to supervise or,
Really well trained people.
whatever.
Right,
Yeah.
and have, have some kind of real good program,
Yeah.
set up so that you, when you go you can be assured that if there's an emergency that person in charge knows C P R or first aid or,
Oh, yeah.
and have some kind of program set up, like you say, to stimulate the kids, or educate them in some manner.
And have the, you know, the right toys and the right setting and, uh, have, a, an organized type of program set up so that the kids have a schedule, you know, that's real important to little kids.
Yeah, well she's, my daughter does not seem to be on a real schedule yet, and it's probably my fault, because I do not have a real schedule now.
Uhhuh.
But,
They, they adjust to what the parents
Yeah, well she's been staying up late at night and, you know,
Uhhuh.
sleeping late in the mornings and things is just fine by me
We, you know that works until they start school.
Right.
And that's a problem, society is geared to a, a day person and it's, I have another friend who's brother and his wife have done this, they stay up until all hours of the night.
Okay, well I guess I enjoy eating out, um, uh, here and there, or it's, it's a good change and, a good change from cooking and eating at home and I guess I like a variety of, a variety of restaurants.
Uhhuh.
Uh, sometimes it's fun to go out and just have a hamburger and french fries and, and sort of a hamburger and french fry meal, and sometimes it's, I enjoy it's, I enjoy going out having a formal meal.
Yes.
And, uh, sometimes it's nice to go out and have a salad.
Uhhuh.
Something, you know,
Do you usually go out, uh, with the children or without them?
Well, a variety.
I, I like to go sometimes without them and,
sometimes I, sometimes it's okay to take them along.
So
Right
Sometimes I think we pay the babysitter as much as paying for their dinner
Yes.
or lunches so, uh, it just, you know, it just varies, we do a mix.
Sometimes it's really nice to be able to go out and eat with just my husband and it wouldn't even really matter which restaurant it was, just to, you know, have a moment of peace and quiet without
Yes.
little ones at the table.
Yes.
So, uh, I guess
Well,
I guess actually on those, those times, uh, we even, there are times I even say, oh, please don't sit us next to a table with other children,
this is our night out.
So but, uh, anyway, where do you like to eat?
Uh, well, uh, we don't have any children so, uh, we tend to,
like to try all sorts of different things.
And, uh, we're very attracted to exotic food.
Uhhuh.
And, uh, we like Indian food, and Thai cuisine and, uh, sort of gourmet Mexican and, uh, things like that, as well as TexMex and Italian and, uh, Chinese and things, and, and things of that sort.
Now, yes, of course, we like to occasionally go out and get down and dirty with barbecue or hamburgers
Right.
or something like that, too.
And, uh, we probably go out one to two times a week.
Right.
And, uh, uh, we're pretty much regulars at an Italian, local Italian restaurant.
Oh, which one do you like?
Momo's.
Oh, okay.
Well, it's been a long time since we've been in there but, uh, but it's good.
There's an Italian restaurant over, over by the mall, over by, uh, Plano Parkway there, pas faintly>>
Uhhuh.
Oh, is it Campari's or something?
I've heard about it, I haven't been in there.
Well, it's good.
I haven't, my husband had been in there several times and we went in there, actually we went in there for lunch one day.
Uhhuh.
And, uh, their pastas were great.
Tha, that's one of the things, a good pasta means a lot to me.
I, I like different kinds of food.
So, when we go out, I'm always looking for something other than the standard menu, even if,
it's a Mexican Restaurant, like something other than, uh, you know the standard tacos, enchiladas, tamales and
You're brave
fajitas now.
Yes, yes and once in a while things backfire.
I mean, we've gone for Romanian food and Lebanese food, and things like that
Oh, God.
And I'm not fond of some of those things but we'll try, we'll try anything.
Right.
Ethiopian, we've had Ethiopian.
And, uh, not in Plano of course
No, I don't think so
But, we really, we really do enjoy going out and uh, and, um, I'm pretty adventurous in cooking, too, which also occasionally backfires.
Oh, well.
Even though traditional it can backfire.
Yeah.
I think we're supposed to say what will bring us back to a restaurant or, or what attracts us to a restaurant.
How do you usually find a, a new restaurant?
Uh, well my husband's kind of the eth, he, he's the ethnic fan.
So he's, I don't know.
You know what, we read, we read the, uh, D MAGAZINE
Uhhuh.
So do we.
we, we check that and, uh, the Friday section in the newspaper
Uhhuh.
the pull out section there.
They often do ratings of restaurants, so
Right.
uh, we've, uh, we've usually, we often save those and ventured out on, from there, uh, just for something that had a high rating.
Uhhuh.
We have found, uh, a number of restaurants either through D and the,
Friday paper and sometimes the, the OBSERVER.
Which my husband usually picks up.
Okay.
And also through coupons.
When a new restaurant opens up, they usually send out coupons.
That's,
And you know, when they say, you know, buy one get one free.
That's right.
It's hard to resist,
so we'll go in.
And very often we'll,
find a place that we like and we'll stick with it once they, give, they no longer give coupons.
We'll, we'll, uh, we'll stay there.
Oh good.
Oh, good.
But we've found probably half of our sort of regular restaurants through coupons,
and the other half through the, through the newspaper reviews.
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
We, I guess we, we use the coupons, too.
That's true.
That's true.
I mean it's wonderful, particularly if you have more than two people and you've got say four or something like that.
It's very expensive to go out to eat.
Oh right.
Right.
So, yeah that, that is really one of our, it's almost a hobby with us.
Well I think that it's just, that's ex,
sometimes I think going out to eat it's, it's sort of a recreation.
Yes.
So, uh, just a, just a change of pace
Yes.
from, uh, eating at home.
So, uh
Yeah.
anyway.
I guess, uh, as far as, as far as service when we go out
Uhhuh.
gosh, it's nice, it's nice to have someone come and wait the table.
Oh, absolutely.
And clear the table and,
And do the dishes
Yeah, and do the dishes.
And, uh, actually it's kind of nice to, you know, I always, uh, a waitress or waiter that waits the table, it's nice that they're attentive but it's not nice when they're too attentive.
Oh, yes.
So, uh, we've had experience with that, too.
So,
M, m, m, my sister, who also lives here in Dallas, uh, tends to, uh, chat with waiters and waitresses and become their best friends during the course of dinner, which drives me absolutely batty.
Oh, yeah.
Well, how we
but ,
it may, it may help their tip, may not, huh.
What's your favorite restaurant?
Gosh, I guess just in Plano, I, Plano I like to go to Souper Salads.
Uhhuh.
Uh, Chili's, Chili's is always fine.
Sure.
I guess if we go to Dallas, into Dallas, we like, uh, the Routh, is it Routh Street Cafe.
You know, we've never been there.
Well
And that's supposed to be wonderful.
well, you would like it.
Um.
You'd like it especially it you're adventuresome.
Uhhuh.
It just, we've, we've taken people there several times and, uh, they have a good, they have a good choice of things that are very different sounding.
I guess, it's, whether you call it Southwestern but, uh, oh we had venison
Ooh.
venison chili one time.
Which was absolutely wonderful.
And then I guess it must be seasonal and we've been back, oh, I guess it's in the winter season well they've never had it
Uhhuh.
when we've been back, so.
But, uh, well you ought to try that.
It's, it's, it's very good.
I would probably like that.
One or two times in my life I've ever had venison, I've loved it.
But, you know, just, it's just not, I don't know people who hunt so
uh
No.
That's, that's supposed to be a wonderful place.
W, uh, uh, uh, here in Plano, well, we tend to go to Momo's a, l, fairly often.
And, uh, sometimes we'll go, you know, we, we also go to Chili's and, uh, Colter's Bar B Q, and, and uh, we go to, lil, there is a little Thai place that's over on Park that, we go to.
My husband particularly likes that.
We go into Dallas,
a lot and, because we're both were from the Richardson, North Dallas area, up until fairly recently.
And, uh, we'll go down to, uh, Blue Mesa Grill, Mexican food, and
Oh, that's good.
Yes, I've been there.
Okay.
Hi, Nancy.
H,
Well, do you do a lot of dining out?
No, um, we don't although we enjoy it.
Um, we do it more when we have company come.
Uhhuh.
Um, what about you?
Well, we do s, some dining out.
Um, I, I do a lot of cooking so, um, mostly like when we go out, you know, it's my husband and I, I, we don't go out too often as a family, um, unless it's like a fastfood kind of thing.
But, um, but we do enjoy dining out.
One of our favorite places here in, in the Dallas area is Atlantic Cafe.
I don't know if you, have you ever been there?
I've heard of that but I haven't been there.
Um, where,
about is that?
Um, well actually there's the Atlantic Cafe and Cafe Pacific, and, uh,
Oh, okay.
I, I've been to Cafe Pacific.
Have you? Th, now that's down in, uh, Highland Park.
Right.
It's Highland Park Village.
Did you like it?
Yes.
Uh
Oh, I love it
Before we moved to,
the area, my brother, uh, lived in Dallas for a number of years and we came up one time when my father was visiting and
Uhhuh.
we all ate there and, oh, their seafood was wonderful.
Oh, it is, it's fabulous.
It really is a great place.
Now where is the Atlantic Cafe?
Atlantic Cafe is down on, I believe it's on McKinney.
Oh, okay.
Um, and o, originally the two, the, the guy who owns the Cafe Pacific and th, the guy who owns the Atlantic Cafe, were partners in the Atlantic Cafe.
And then they, they separated and the guy started Cafe Pacific.
And, I loved them both.
I really do.
I think they're wonderful.
That's our favorite.
You know what we'd really like, if, if we just have a, a casual evening is Houston's.
Have you been there?
No, um, but I've heard that's really good, too, and,
It's wonderful.
The only thing is you have to wait.
You have, you have to expect to wait at least an hour.
Oh.
So you have to go knowing you're going to be sitting there there for an hour waiting to get in.
And, a, as long as you know that it's okay.
But they have, I think, one, just about the best prime rib
Oh.
um, anywhere
Oh, okay.
in the area.
I love it.
Uhhuh.
And, my husband really likes their ribs.
So it's hysterical.
We go in and we sit there for an hour waiting to get in and then we get there and we don't even look at the menu .
You know right away what you want
I know right away what we, what we want.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, we really enjoy prime rib, too, and, uh, actually the, the Steak And Ale out here,
uh, we've gone to, uh, my inlaws also enjoy prime rib, when they've
Uhhuh.
had some of their specials on Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday night
Uhhuh.
and, uh, the time we went the prime rib was really good.
Was it? Really? I've nev, I've, I've been there for like, you know, lunch
Uhhuh.
but, I've never been there for dinner.
And, it was good, yeah.
Yeah, yeah faintly>>.
Oh, that's great.
That's,
great.
Another nice place for, for prime rib is Baby Doe's
Oh, I've heard about that, too
Maxwell's nice, have you been there?
but no.
We've, uh, I guess we eat out even less than I realize
And I didn't think we ate out very often
See! Baby Doe's is nice.
Oh faintly>>.
And, one place I'd never been that I would really like to go to, uh, is Lawry's.
I've heard that's real good,
Yeah.
Lawry's Prime Rib?
Yes, I'd, I had heard that, too.
Um,
I've, I've never been there but I've heard it's real good.
Have you been to the little, uh, not for prime rib but the Cafe De France, um, right here
Yes.
on Central Expressway?
Yes, actually they have one in Richardson that I've been to.
Oh, okay.
Uh, they have real nice lunches.
Have you, have you been there for lunch? Or,
Yes, uh
Yeah.
primarily lunch, well, and breakfast sometimes but, uh, during the week they often have, a, a limited menu choice but, uh, very reasonable complete dinners for six ninetynine that included
Really?
the soup an, or salad
Really?
entrees and accompaniments and dessert and, uh, the, my husband and I like veal, uh
Uhhuh.
a lot and their veal dishes have been good.
We've tried different ones when they've had them as one of the
The specials.
Uhhuh.
Have you ever been to Biffin's?
Huh,
I keep hearing about it.
I keep hearing the advertisements of it
I, yes, no,
and, and they keep saying, you know, oh, it's wonderful, it's wonderful.
I have not been over there and I was thinking, you know, it's supposed to be a family place over near Plano Super Bowl.
Right.
And,
And, uh, I've, I've not been there.
I haven't either, uh, one place, and I've only been there for lunch, but, uh, I went with a friend, and we met her husband, um, down on Greenville, down near the Highway Twelve area, is Gershwin's,
I've been there.
Oh, I, we just we,
That was nice
It was and we had the,
uh, we both enjoy mushroom soup and Linda had told me they had the best mushroom soup and they did.
It was wonderful but, uh, and we just had soup and salad so we could make room for the dessert
which was a chocolate sack.
I don't know if you tried but
Oh
or s,
I've heard of it.
Where, where it's made, it's like, it's like a, it's all chocolate, like made like a paper bag
Yes!
and it's filled with what, whip cream
It, yes
and, and strawberries and something?
it had a sponge cake
Yeah.
and whip cream and it had strawberries, kiwis, and raspberries
Oh.
in a raspberry, uh, puree and,
Oh.
and we shared one, the three of us and it was plenty because it was very rich but, uh
Oh.
I wished I'd had a camera.
It was beautiful
Oh, I bet it was.
I bet it was.
Uh faintly>>.
The last time we went to Cafe Pacific, it was Father's Day, and
Oh.
we took another friend with us and, uh, for dessert we thought we had just stuffed ourselves
And so we had, they had, uh, like a berry assortment.
It was, it was raspberries
Oh.
and blueberries and, and strawberries on a plate with like a custard on the bottom.
And, you know, they did, like the raspberry puree, just kind of like in a, in a decoration on the, you know, how they do the plates real fancy with the decorations and then
Yes.
Yeah faintly>>.
piled the berries and shaved chocolate on top of it
Oh.
and it was outstanding.
It sounds wonderful.
It was really, really relatively simple but, oh, it was good.
It was really good.
Well, that's, uh, one of the things th, that I do enjoy when you get a good restaurant.
Uh, I love fresh berries.
And, their, their fruits are always exceptional.
I don't, I'm, know they must have a special source for getting them because even at the Farmer's Market, uh,
You can't find them.
you can't find them
Yeah.
like that and,
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, i, I'm originally from Connecticut and, uh, I was home a few years ago and my sister and brotherinlaw were going to take us out for dinner and, uh, I was really amazed, you know, the, the restaurants up there were kind of quaint.
You know, they were real, real pretty but they lacked, the service and they lacked the at, the, just the, I don't know.
The restaurants down here seem like they have, uh, I guess there's so much competition that they, really have to be good.
Uhhuh.
And, I thought I would really miss that.
I would, too, because,
well, because we don't go out very often.
When we do go out, um, in a way it's like a little mini vacation I guess, and, uh, it is, it's a whole experience.
Of course you want the food to be good but the atmosphere and service I think, are important, uh
Uhhuh.
too.
And, you know, in order to survive in this area I think they have to be good.
Yeah.
Because the ones that aren't so good don't, just don't make it.
Um, that reminded me of a place for lunch that's a little off the beaten track but it is wonderful.
It's called Cafe Max and it's at Plano Road and Campbell.
They have the most wonderful salads.
They do what they call a salad sampler which easily could feed two or three.
Oh, really?
Is, uh, kind of fun.
It's best done when you have leisure time and I had more of that in my childhood days than I have now
And I grew up in an area that, uh, was just a few feet from a rather large lake, and a few more miles from that was a even larger lake and we had a variety of boats at our disposal
Uh, I worked for a camp for a number of years.
My father was on staff there, and we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats, sailboats, speedboats, you name it, they had it and we did a lot of watering, water sports.
But I think, uh, the thing I liked the best was, uh, we spent about a summer couple of guys, uh, restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the midthirties and got a new canvas sail for it and had a real h, big old four foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves, or the wind came from the side and we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it.
If you ever got it dumped over, though, it was a mess to get back up.
It wasn't like the newer ones that have nice chambers that keep it afloat or keep it, uh, upright again.
This one you had to work with.
You get out of the water again and get it upright.
And, uh, sailing was, was kind of nice to learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the, the wind, as it were, tacking back and forth and, uh, more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day and, uh, the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing and as soon as the front came over, it was calm.
So you're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle and you paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away.
And that didn't always work.
We oftentimes got wet,
But, uh, it's, it's a nice, nice hobby to have.
Nowadays I don't think I could afford the boat or the time, nor do we live that close to a lake anymore, so things change, I guess.
What are your memories of boating, or current,
Uh, about the only memories that I have of boating, uh, my husband's family had a, a motor boat, uh, when we got engaged and they took us out on the lake several times.
And, uh, I really did enjoy that.
I, I don't know that I ever learned to drive it or anything, but, uh, we did some water skiing, of course, and, and, uh, driving around the lake in the boat and, and just the basic safety rules and things I found real interesting.
Uh, you know, they, they just didn't patrol you like they did with the automobile or whatever.
The, the laws were there and if you didn't obey them, uh
Right.
you know, there were a lot of accidents, I guess.
That's true.
But, uh, I found the motor boating was real fun.
Yeah, I remember learning how to ski, oh, I guess I was seven or eight years old and the lake that we learned on was the smaller of the two that we had access to and it was maybe fifteen, twenty acres and it was, uh it had a lot of, uh, turtles in it.
And I got all ready to go and I was down in the water and, and set to go and, uh, and just as that boat took off, a turtle bit me in the middle of the back.
Oh
It didn't hurt too much, but it bit enough to where I let go.
And the boat went off without me and I reached back there and s, pushed him away and got out of the water a, a while and, and, uh, it didn't even leave a mark.
It was just a little nibble and so I told everybody what happened and they go, oh, yeah, sure, you know.
And so I get back down in there and, and I'll be if he didn't do it again.
This time a little earlier and, and I had let go before then and, before they took off this time and, and swatted him away.
So I moved over a, a few feet in the water and got out of his little realm where he was living underneath the dock and, uh, managed to get up.
Didn't go very far, but I got up.
And it, it was a nice, uh, nice long skiing career, but now I've gotten to where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill me.
I've, I've, uh, done about all I dare do on skis.
You know, skiing on one and jumping around here and there and I, I, I know how you can get injured doing much more than that and I just can't risk it right now being a head of the family and the breadwinner and all that.
Just, uh, can't take the risk I did as a dumb teenager, I guess
So life just changes a little bit in that respect
I'd kind of like, someday, to maybe end up on a pair of skis that, that doesn't have a, uh, well, what they call trick skis.
They'll allow you to ski backwards.
I haven't cr, managed to get a hold on that, uh, craft yet, but, uh,
That sounds like a real challenge.
Yeah, it, it would be kind of nice.
I hadn't quite figured out, I don't have anybody to teach me either.
That's another little thing.
You need somebody to kind of tell you what to do, but, just from what I've seen, you just kind of work your way up to it and turn around real quick you know.
Grab the rope behind you and then just let go real quick and let it whip you around.
Uhhuh.
But, uh, I don't know, maybe someday I'll I'll get back to that as, after the kids are up and grown and the monies are there to get away for times on end, weekend or something.
Well, my son,
What is it about, nursing homes?
Uh, well, about nursing homes,
Yeah.
and, and older people.
Uh, my husband has a grandmother that lives with his mother
Uhhuh.
and they're just really close here.
And his mother has bad health too and so I go over sometimes in the day when he's at work and I, um, help with her and bathe her and feed her.
Right.
And, uh, and I, that's hard to be a caretaker I really believe.
It's really difficult to be a caretaker twentyfour hours a day.
Oh, it's very difficult I know.
Uh, i, she has Alzheimer's and does not remember, uh, a lot
Uhhuh.
if anything.
Uhhuh.
And so she asks the same questions over and over again.
Which is not un, you know, unrealistic.
Right.
Um, and so you just have to try and be patient and answer them again or just answer another question.
Yeah.
Uh, I, uh, some nights his mother calls me and says can your family, and just bring the kids in the family and just come over and, and visit grandma because she gets very disoriented.
Yeah, how old is she?
She's ninetytwo.
Uh, my, see my father is ninetytwo and still, uh, he and mother still live at the house and drive and
Oh, I think that's wonderful.
and do the whole thing, but you know if something would, uh, whenever something happens to one of them then,
Well,
I don't know what I'll do up there.
Uhhuh.
I, I just know that too many horror stories about nursing homes and so,
Yeah.
I was just going to say.
They're in Missouri and I could, I, I know, I know stories for sure that they just, they, they just, well, they can't take the proper care of them.
Yeah.
Most of them.
Um,
And, uh, it's, it's tragic that, you know, when people live so long that they, uh, don't have a pla, really don't have a place to go.
Yes.
So,
Uh, I think it's wonderful these, these places that aren't nursing homes necessarily but they can go and reside there like little apartments,
Right.
places in between places.
And I like that idea if they can handle it themselves.
Um,
Yeah, there's one very close to where my parents are but, uh, I think it would be nice but my dad's the type he wouldn't want to spend the money on anything.
Yeah, yeah
So, uh, I mean, he's from that old depression era and, uh, you know, it's, oh, it's just blissfull that they're both,
faint>> Yeah.
able to do everything for themselves.
I would imagine that I'll, uh, if something happens, I'll move one of them or bot, you know, in, in with me.
Uhhuh.
So, uh,
Yeah.
But I know a lot of people have said that and then find out how tough it is and, but I think you'd have to really, they also wanted us to talk about you'd have to really check on the, uh
Nursing homes.
on this homes.
But I just don't know how much you can see when you go for a,
Visit.
I think you just have to drop in all unexpectedly a lot.
Uhhuh.
And so many people when they put people in the nurses home, they never see them.
They don't go and see them.
That's right.
They never go to see them.
That's right.
I've talked to many, uh, owners of places and say that nobody even, maybe, maybe Christmas.
You know, um, I, I think nursing homes are, are, um, some are good
Uhhuh.
I have to say that.
Right.
But for the most part I truly believe that the parents would be better if they were with the children.
Oh, I do too.
Um,
Or if, i, if they could be real, real nearby where they could see them everyday or so.
Right, right.
Uh, because I know Governor Richards is really upset about what she's finding in the nursing ho, homes, uh, regulation in Texas so maybe we'll get it improved.
Uhhuh.
So.
I hope so.
Anyway.
You know, it's, I think it's very difficult in the first place to make that choice
Right.
to have them go there.
Oh, it's tough I'm sure.
And then if you find out that they are not having good care, you know, I'm sure that it is just,
Oh.
you know, you'd pull them out of there so fast.
Right, that would be devastating I'm sure so.
And, uh, and yet if you didn't feel like you could be a good caretaker I don't, uh, it's a very, very hard decision I think.
It is a tough decision and it's one that needs a great deal of thought,
faint>> Uhhuh.
and prior probably.
I think that's right,
Yeah.
and especially if you're not a person that is like a medical person maybe or something that the person needs medical treatment.
Right.
Now I know a friend of mine who had a father, uh, she brought to her home, uh, to live there, but he needed the medical treatment and she had a nursing person come in like three times a week to, to help him out.
Uhhuh.
And that might be a partial solution,
Right.
or something.
But, um, I personally am for the trying it at home caretaker part before I think I'd ever,
I would hope we could do that,
Yeah.
and then go from there.
faint>> Yeah.
Well, anyway,
Well, I, I think we kind of are along the same lines.
We've covered a little bit and, uh, it's good to hear from you and,
Good to hear from you.
Have a good,
Have a lovely day.
Have a good lif,
Well, I almost forgot the topic, I was waiting so long for, uh, for it to find somebody.
Um,
It's on your favorite T V shows and why.
Right, well, so what is your favorite T V show?
Uh, MAJOR DAD.
Oh, you like that one?
I, I love it, I think it promotes good family values, and it's funny.
Uhhuh.
Uh, I've never really watched that one.
You know, it's funny how you can just get in a mode where you only watch certain shows
That's ri, yeah.
and, uh, you know, there's, so there's only a few that I, that I like to watch routinely.
What kind do you like to watch?
Probably my favorite is, um, oh, well, I like shows like GROWING PAINS and, uh, what's the other one now, they moved from Tuesday night to Wednesday night, so I don't get to watch it very much.
WONDER YEARS?
WONDER YEARS, yeah, that's my favorite.
Uh,
I like both of those real much also.
I, I think basically, they pr, same thing, they promote family values.
Yeah.
WONDER YEARS, I, I guess that is supposed to be put out at a time when I was growing up or whatever.
I guess I can really relate to it, and, uh, it's just a real cute show
Uh, I, I guess I like the shows that really have a real sense of, uh, I don't know, honesty or sort of a purity value, I guess.
I do, too.
I, I don't like it, uh, lot of the shows that, that I've liked in the past, like, uh, oh, GOLDEN GIRLS and, some of them tend to get so risque, and when you
Uhhuh.
have children
Yeah,
uh, watching it, that sometimes really starts to bother me
Right, right.
and, uh, that's one of the reasons, I mean, if you want to go all time favorite show, probably one of them was LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE
Uhhuh, yeah, my wife really likes that show,
yeah, which I just, I was, I always felt was wonderful
Uhhuh.
uh, and so many of them nowadays, like I said, I think are just, um
Yeah.
uh, they, they go after, well, they, like I said, the risque stuff, just I guess they think that's what people want to watch.
Yeah, well, there was, but there's a sense of ho, I guess, purity in the show, like one of my favorite shows used to be HAPPY DAYS
Yes.
but, uh, you know, Richie always used to be so, you know, just so honest and pure
Yeah.
I guess, and when he left the show, you know, that, it seemed to be missing that part of it
Uhhuh.
and I never did like it after that
Uhhuh.
so, I don't know, I, I say, see the same thing in like WONDER YEARS and a lot of the shows that I like to watch.
There always seems to be that kind of value in there somewhere.
Yeah, I, I agree.
Uh, do you like the sports programming?
Yeah, uhhuh.
Um, I, I enjoy those also, almost as, as much to a certain extent.
I'm, our whole house is baseball fans
Uhhuh.
and, uh, we enjoy that, and, uh
So you're going to watch a game tonight?
oh yeah, oh, yeah
So do you, do you have a favorite for the series or anything?
Uh, probably the Pirates, but only because of Steve Bushel, I guess
Oh, uhhuh.
otherwise I really don't care that much, but, uh, you know, I'm, I'm annoyed that the Rangers got rid of him, and, uh, I'd like to see him do well, like all the way to the bank
Yes.
I guess
Yeah, he's a nice guy.
I take it you live in the Dallas area.
Pardon?
Do you live in the Dallas area?
Live in, live in Plano.
Uhhuh, yeah, I live in Garland, and, yeah, I, I like Steve Bushel, but I don't really like the Pirates.
I'm a big Saint Louis Cardinals fan
Uhhuh.
so, uh, I'm kind of, I'm kind of pulling for the Braves over all, they, you know, they
Uhhuh.
they've come from so far down, I really would like to see them do well.
Well, yeah, yeah, it's, uh, so I keep hoping the Rangers are going to do
Yeah, one, one year they, maybe they'll make it, I don't know
Right.
so, but, uh, yeah, I like sports programming quite a bit, but, uh, I guess my, my favorite shows are the, and, you know, that getting back to the point that you made, that's really true, we were watching ROSEANNE, I guess, couple of weeks ago, and her daughter was talking about birth control, you know
Uhhuh.
and my daughter was kind of walking in during that time, and, you know, she's only seven years old, so,
Well, it's, so many of them now, um, you know, it just seems like they feel like they have to stick that stuff in, and
Yeah.
and, uh, you know, I'm, you know, I'm, I'm an adult
Yeah.
and I have adult tastes now, but I don't need that
Yeah, yeah.
uh, I, I like things that, uh, are, are wholesome, I guess.
Yeah, well that, that seems to be more our values, too, like the WONDER YEARS, I, I mean, it's kind of risque stuff for, maybe for teenagers, you know, or, and you can kind of relate to it
Uhhuh.
you know, I don't know, that's, I enjoy that a lot
Yes, yes.
but, uh, you know, I agree with you, the, and it's funny because the shows, like a lot of them that used to be considered risque, like THREE'S COMPANY and stuff, I think they, they maintained, people would watch them because there was that, uh, you know, there was really the period that was going on there, I mean, he really wasn't messing around with the girls, but everybody perceived him that way, and stuff
Uhhuh.
but as soon as, you know, he went to move in with another girl, the show just died
Yeah.
and it's, it's interesting that a lot of the shows are that way,
Okay, well, um,
What kind of music do you like?
I, um, I was thinking about it for a long time, and I like basically almost every form of music and type of music.
Um, I don't have a whole lot of dislikes.
I, um, like jazz, um, especially the blues, and, uh, I like, uh, a lot of the, uh, of course the classics, um, everything back from Bach and, and Beethoven and Chopin and, um, just in general everything.
Uhhuh.
Um, I enjoy, uh, a lot of the, the modern forms, um, uh,
Do you like, like rock and those kind of things
Right, right.
punk even.
Uh, well,
that gets, some of the punk, um, when I was in high school, that was, uh, one of the big things, was punk music, and, uh, a lot of it is, has a lot to say, or some of it has a lot to say, the music does, the lyrics do, but the, the actual,
I don't think they have a whole lot to say, even
Uh, well, it, it's, it's, it really expresses some of the opinions of, of the people who enjoy the music
Yeah, I guess.
um, but as far as a musical art form, I just don't see a whole lot of art to it
Uhhuh.
Um.
Do you like rap?
Um, some of it, um, it depends.
I like, uh, the rap, the two types of rap I like, or I enjoy to listen to, and one is the, the rap that is just funny, um, and they usually do a lot of satire
Yeah
um.
that kind I kind of like.
Right.
Some of it is kind of
Right, the monotonous
pointless, yeah.
the monotonous, no that's not, I don't enjoy that at all
Uhhuh.
when they're just talking about, well, I'm better than you, and blah, blah, blah.
I don't like
Yeah, yeah.
that.
I like the funny, satire, and then some of it is, some of it actually gets into some serious discussions of problems in our, in
Yeah.
urban society.
It really does.
It talks about, um, race relations and police relations and, um, that, that
I guess I don't really care to listen to rap that much except for once in a while some of the funny
Uhhuh.
more satire kind some times.
Um, I'm, with you though, I like classical
Uhhuh.
um, I don't like to listen to it all the time, but, um, some of the time, anyway.
I like easy listening, just kind of, you know, I guess I don't care much for rock and roll any more.
I used to like it all right, but I don't really care to listen to it any more for some reason.
Um, let's see.
Country western, uh, I'm not quite as big on that.
Some of it's okay, uh
Yeah, that's, that's about my opinion of that
yeah
It's, it's okay, um,
Some of it kind of falls in the rap category I guess, so
Um.
The thing about country western that I don't enjoy is is, doesn't seem to be any imagination behind it
Yeah.
the, one country and western song sounds like every other,
a lot of them,
country and western
sound, uh, really similar, yeah.
and so the, the musicians don't get to really get into their music.
They just play a certain number of chords
Yeah.
the drummer plays a certain beat, and you have a country and western song
Um.
and,
Well, that's kind of the way I feel about rock and roll sometimes, too, I guess.
They don't really, has kind of the same sound over and over, and the other thing I don't like about it is they have a tendency to play the instrumental so loud that you can't understand what the lyrics are
Um.
you can't understand what they're saying on some of those songs
Right.
which probably is just as well on some of them, too.
Yeah.
And I can't say that I like a lot of the modern, the very, very
Yeah.
modern, uh, rock and roll, but I, I definitely, I really enjoy the fifties, the sixties and a lot, some of the seventies
Yeah
rock and roll
earlier things.
and, uh, I really enjoy, especially the sixties .
All right, so, we started recording already?
Uh, I guess, I don't know.
It's the first time I've made a phone call on it.
Oh, so you pressed one?
Right.
Okay.
So, I guess we're supposed to start talking.
Uh what kind of books do you read?
I read, uh, a lot of Steven King, Dean R Koontz, uh
Uhhuh.
some Danielle Steel.
My aunt got me hooked on those
Uhhuh.
So I,
So it's mostly all novels?
Yeah, they're all novels.
Okay.
I'll read some, uh, classic, too.
Oh, like what?
Uh, like THE GRADUATE by Steinbeck.
I'll, uh,
Yeah, I like that.
I like Steinbeck a lot.
A, A ROSE FAMILY by Faulkner.
That's one of my favorites.
I have never read a lot of Faulkner.
Oh, and this, this is more of a play or something that, that it was from, that, that I saw and I read the book from that.
Oh, cool
And, by the way, my name's Bill.
I'm from North Carolina
I'm Doug, I'm from Pennsylvania.
Uh, I, let's see.
What kind of books do you like to read?
Uh, well, a bunch of stuff, I guess, uh, fair number of novels, but mostly shorter ones.
And, like, I don't really like the, you know, six hundred page long Stephen King novels and all that.
I really have to be in the mood.
Right?
I, I read one, like maybe once a year.
Uhhuh.
I'm not as,
No, like, I like, say, uh, Richard Broudigan a lot.
Uh,
I've never read anything by him.
Okay.
He's, uh, he's dead now, but he was really a pretty amazing writer.
He wrote books that were, like, pretty short and pretty easy to read, you know, like written at a third grade level or whatever.
Yeah.
But they were still very heavy and philosophical, also very funny.
Like, He wrote TROUT FISHING IN AMERICA.
Okay.
So that's, anyway, and, uh, I read a lot of non fiction books, too.
Uh, let's see,
I like to read a lot of non fiction history when
Uhhuh.
Civil War era and, and that kind of thing.
Uhhuh.
I found that real interesting.
I'm reading THE LION AND THE WIND right now.
And that was on T V.
Now what's that?
It was, uh, during Teddy Roosevelt's time.
Uhhuh.
And, uh, about a American woman that got kidnapped in, uh, Morocco.
Yeah.
Uh, this is when they were having their revolution
Uhhuh.
or whatever and Teddy Roosevelt sent troops over and really portrays him as a, kind of a crazy man, you know.
Yeah
Surprised me.
I had no idea that he was like that.
Uhhuh.
What, how crazy?
Well, just like s, some, one quote that he had was that he thought the America's emblem was stupid because it was an eagle,
and it should be a grizzly bear because
Oh, sh,
you, you know, like the t, t, grizzly and stuff like that.
So it's, I saw the movie and that's what made me want to read the book.
Uhhuh.
Candice Bergen was in the movie.
I'm a real big fan of hers so,
Yeah.
Cool, see, I also read a lot of books about music because I'm interested in that and fair number of stuff about science and also philosophy things.
Uhhuh.
I like, I like to read
Like,
some of the philosophy stuff.
Uhhuh.
Like, let's see, and even like reading some new age things, things that I don't quite believe in, like here on my shelf I have a book called JOURNEYS OUT OF THE BODY.
Yeah, I think that,
It's all about
I'm fascinated by that.
how to have out of body experiences and all that.
Yeah, I'm fascinated by that.
Uhhuh, yep.
That, and, and, uh, even stuff about, not like ghost stories, but real encounters with ghosts and
Uhhuh.
supposedly haunted houses.
I like, I'm kind of a doubting Thomas and I like to read stuff like that.
Some of it really
Yeah.
freaks me out
Uhhuh
Right, definitely
Uh,
And I like to read, uh, I like to read some self help books like, uh, I read DIANETICS once, once I got past all the gibberish on it.
Uh, did you like it?
It was okay.
It, it, it, it took me a while to really get into it.
It, it didn't help me that much
Uhhuh.
I see.
But, uh, I think once you're set in your ways, you're set in your ways.
Yeah
Uh, then I, one in, real interesting book I read recently was, when I was looking for a job, I read, HOW TO GET THE JOB THAT YOU WANTED and, it, it had real good tips and it, and
Uhhuh.
I got the job that I wanted by applying the, the methods that, that,
I guess we're be, recorded.
Okay.
What, do you have any hobbies that you like to do?
Oh, yes.
Cycling, computers, uh, backpacking, just about everything.
Oh
Oh, I generically have, you know, millions of hobbies.
All right, that's an interesting assortment.
My husband is into cycling.
In fact, he's out there right now
Uhhuh.
before it gets dark trying to get in his miles for the, the time.
I'm not quite that bad.
I'm just a weekend cyclist.
Uh, do you have any, do you do any handicraft type things, I think was the question.
Handicraft type things.
Yeah, whittling or
Yeah, just whittle away my life.
Uh, no, no, I c,
Nothing like that.
Uh, uh,
I, I do some things.
I've gotten into, uh, oh, I, I like to decorate things and I do sweatshirts and Tshirts and I've gotten to where I start, have started selling them at craft shows and things.
Oh, that's pretty good.
Uh, and I have, have done fairly well at them.
I've had a, a few of my little hobby projects have totally bombed, but most
of them have worked out pretty good
Yeah, they, my only craft work is kind of like computers and, you know, go off to the little computer club meetings, and, it's kind of nice because I've made money at it, too.
Considering I, I work for it a living, but I, you know, I, I've got a couple of articles published.
Oh!
It's kind of, kind of neat.
Yeah, what, what does a computer club do.
I didn't know there were such things.
Oh, yeah, just all over the place.
They just get around and, and talk techy or, or else, uh, uh, you know, like half the members are really expert and the other half are like really not.
Uhhuh.
And, uh, we kind of help out the people who are really not
You don't, uh, you're not in,
into hacking or whatever
Oh, I, I think I'm, I think I'm a hacker, but I'm not, not kind, not the, uh, the, you know, dial around randomly trying to break into computers type
Uhhuh.
hackers, no, that's one of those sports I don't go for.
Well, that's kind of interesting hobby.
What else, did you, you said you did cycling?
Yeah.
What was the other thing?
Backpacking.
Backpacking.
We,
Yeah, I belong to a, a Boy Scout troop.
It beats paying United Way.
I just, you know
Uhhuh.
donate a whole bunch of my time to the Boy Scouts and have fun.
Well, that's, we have done that.
Uh, our two older boys were in Boy Scouts and my daughter was in Girl Scouts until just about a year ago
Uhhuh.
so we've uh, done a fair amount of that in our spare time, also
But, it, I, that's a great thing to do, you know, really.
Have you been backpacking anyplace exciting?
Uh, well, just last weekend went to Davy Crockett forest
Oh.
which is kind of out in east Texas.
Uhhuh.
And we go to, uh, places out in, uh, uh, let's see what's that, what's that state north of us, that state
Oh, that one.
yeah.
Yeah, that one.
That one.
Okay
Yeah, yeah.
And,
To the, uh, oh, by Fort Sill there?
Uh, no, to another f, a, uh, old Indian fort that's out there.
Trying to think of the name of it.
Durn.
Well, yeah, no, sorry, no memory.
Uhhuh.
Have you gone, like to Fillmont with the Boy Scouts?
No, I missed out this last year.
I wasn't able to get the time off, but maybe next year.
It's a good possibility.
I've always thought that would be a real fun thing to do.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
When I was a kid, uh, we'd do the equivalent thing in the High Sierras.
That was loads of fun.
Uhhuh.
Does, does your whole family like to do it, like you, you know, for a vacation you'd go backpacking?
Uh, no, not quite because I'm not a whole family.
I'm just me
Oh, okay.
You just, oh, and, and you volunteer for the Boy Scouts, huh?
Oh, yeah, I rent my kids
Uhhuh
Well, s, sometimes, uh,
It's better than, you know, owning on them and making payments on them,
and, you know, things like that.
Sometimes I think that might not be a bad idea
Have, uh, you said you did it in the High Sierras.
Uh, do you ever, you know, just vacation someplace where you strictly backpack?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Uh, not recently because, you know, like the Boy Scouts makes it so that I go like once a month, you know.
Uhhuh.
Someplace.
But, uh, there's, uh, some, some stuff that I want to do with like Sierra Club and go down to Grand Canyon or something like that.
So, you know, they have lots of tours where they get a bunch of people together and
Uhhuh.
off you go.
Which seems kind of reasonable because that means you don't have to take twenty thirteen year olds with you, which seems a, a, just a tad more relaxing
Well, I, probably, probably.
That's, uh, well, my, my other things that I like to do in my spare time, I'm, I like swimming.
Uhhuh.
Which is in now.
I've done that and I, I also, when I like something, I usually try to figure out how to make money off of it.
Well, do you do any recycling?
Uh, we do here.
Uh, see, what do we recycle? We, they recycle, they have bins
Yeah.
and they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and, uh, plastic bottles and I think that's all they have.
Oh.
What about you guys?
Well, we, uh, there is a lot of things that you can recycle down here, although the only thing I guess I wind up recycling religiously is, uh, aluminum cans.
Uhhuh.
But, uh, we've got a, we've got a couple of different things, uh, places, uh, they're like unattended aluminum can smashers
And you can go up there and, and, uh, redeem, we've got one that gives you like a penny a can, so if you,
Really?
Yeah
For smashed cans?
Well, actually, you have to give, put them in there unsmashed.
Uhhuh.
And, uh, when you do that it, it basically crushes them and then drops a penny down a little shoot.
Oh, can you, can you hold on for just a minute?
Sure.
I'm going to try pressing one again to make sure
Okay.
that I pressed it hard enough because, okay, just succeed
Okay?
Oh, okay, well, I guess, I guess,
Well, I heard it that, I heard it that time
Yeah
Okay, well, anyways, you guys only get a penny a can.
Well, when you buy like, uh, canned drinks and stuff like that, do they charge you for the deposit?
Uh, no, you probably get charged like a nickel
Yeah.
or something like that.
Exactly and so it's like they charge you for the deposit, so when you turn in the cans unsmashed, you're just, like, reimbursed.
Oh, okay.
Type of thing.
Okay, no, they don't charge us that extra nickel.
That's sort of nice, though
Yeah, it, it really is.
Really what happens is we just get a penny a can back off the, off the price, if you want to think of it that way.
Uhhuh.
So when we get like, uh, uh, a twelve pack, then that's like twelve cents back.
Yeah, so you guys can actually get ahead
Yeah
But, uh, they have sort of like, uh, things that you c, you're not like reimbursed for or paid for.
Like we can recycle, uh, clear glass, brown glass, green glass.
Yeah.
Uh, and milk jugs and, uh, newspapers, you know, everyone does newspapers.
Yeah, yeah, everybody does newspapers.
But, that, that kind of stuff.
Yeah.
But they, they said they can't be smashed or else, uh, it doesn't fit in their little containers and they're not reimbursed by the, the people who are over them or something.
Well, shoot, maybe what we ought to do is start sending unsmashed, uh, Pepsi cans and whatever
Yeah
up there
Exactly, yeah, send it to this address, no
But, uh, let's see, they said that, how, ways, can encourage recycling, uh,
I, I, I tell you what, what really works, uh, at least down here is, if there is, if there is some, e, even some money basically to take care of the gas to recycle it, you know what I mean, then people tend to do it.
Uh,
Yeah, that's,
In other words, taking care of the environment is, is all well and good
Uhhuh.
but if it's going to cost you to take care of the environment, they're not quite as, uh
As likely to do it.
likely to do it
Yeah.
as if, uh, if you get something back for it.
You know.
Yeah, that's true.
And, uh, so, you know, if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings, anything that they can pass on to the consumer, you know, it kind of reminds me of using an A T M card, you know, to get money
Uhhuh.
or doing your banking.
Yeah.
You know, if it's free, people will use it, if it costs them something, then they're not as likely to use it.
Yeah, exactly.
You know.
But, uh, I know we had a problem down here with, uh, oil, people taking oil out of their cars
Uhhuh.
and just putting it down the d, you know, the s, the drain sewer.
Yeah.
And, uh, all that, because there was, apparently a lot of people, you know, every time they change the oil, they just dump all the res, their old oil down there.
Uhhuh.
Now they're starting to recycle that stuff.
Oh, that's good.
Uh, another thing I thought of, I guess, to recycle would be like clothes, because I mean everybody gets rid of their clothes sometime or other.
And one way that we do it sort of in, in Iowa is that we can take some of our clothes to the consignment shops.
Yeah.
And that way, you know, you don't get near enough as, as much as you bought it for, but you, you got the use out of it and what you're going to basically donate to a Goodwill or whatever, anyways, you can get a little bit of money for.
Yeah.
And so
Yeah.
that's something that I've never, I, we're, we're new to Iowa so that's something that I hadn't, you know, looked into before.
But that's one way to sort of get money and still recycle, I guess.
Yeah, I know a lot of places, they, uh, uh,
What do you think?
Well, uh, this is, this is about drug testing right?
Right.
Well, uh, I'm, I'm certainly under the, uh, uh, the influence of the idea that, that the government needs to have less control on what, uh, what the citizens do, although I do see this as a, uh, something that definitely needs to be taken care of.
Whether that, whether that should be put in the hands of the corporation or the, the hands of the, hands of the government is a, you know, a, a different question I think, as far as I'm concerned.
I, in, in other words, I am fa, in favor of drug contro, or, or, or drug testing.
Uh, I was drug tested when I came to my job here at T I.
Yet
Uhhuh.
but, but at the same time, I don't think, uh, that should be governed by by the government, uh, per se.
I think it should be more by the private institution.
How about you?
Yeah, I think that the corporations should, uh, do all that.
They should, uh, have drug screening before they hire
Uhhuh.
an employee and, uh, any time that an employee, like if they're coming to late work all the time and, uh
Uhhuh.
if they, if they're, especially if there's they're on the line or any kind of sensitive job where, you know, if they can, if they made a mistake, it would cost a lot of money or
Yeah.
or people's lives.
Sure.
Then they need to be watched carefully so,
Uhhuh.
Yeah, I, I agree with you.
I, you know, I would even think that, uh, uh, I could, in theory take that a l, a, you know, a step further and say anybody in any job, you know, if the corporation felt like, uh, b, b, and this is why, I mean, uh, drugs are the biggest problem, I think to face America today.
I mean i, th, it's what drives crime, it's what drives, uh, uh, any sort of, of, uh, uh, pain and discomfort in the world, or in America I think is some, is somewhat, uh, uh, driven by drugs and I think that, uh, were corporations and, uh, private industry to take, uh, take command in this situation, that maybe, maybe we might have some, some control over that.
We, you know, if you can't work, then you can't be a little bit harder to take, take drugs or whatever, I don't know.
Right.
Course, that might up crime, you know, when, uh, people go in and steal your television and ste, and sell it just because they can't, they can't work anymore, you know.
Yeah, yeah, but you got to have a, a safe work place.
That's all there is to it.
Definitely, you, you're definitely right.
That, uh, you can't, you can't have it any other way.
Uhhuh.
Uh, you know, whether whether in, in the case that you brought up, you know, whether, uh, you know, w, if it's a policeman and he's working with, uh, the public and he has a, and has a gun in his holster or, or even, you know, if it's a guy at McDonald's cooking a burger, I think, they're dangerous in either situation.
Uhhuh.
Uh, I, what, what do you think, uh, what percentage of, of corporations and, uh, private industry do you think use, uh, drug testing?
I think it's, it's more frequent now.
It's probably like forty, fifty percent.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
Uhhuh.
Because, uh, all the jobs that I've applied for have, uh, mentioned some type of drug screening.
Right.
You know.
What kind of work are you in?
Uh, I work at Sears.
Uhhuh.
And I just do warehouse work.
Uhhuh, and did they give you drug testing?
Uh, not, they hired me in nineteen eightyfour so,
Oh.
Yeah.
Okay.
But now they, they, uh, they issued a statement
Uhhuh.
about that, about three months ago.
Oh, so are they going to, uh, begin spontaneous, uh, drug testing?
Uh, not that I know of.
It was more about, uh, all the people's problems.
Like
Uhhuh.
they've been laying off a lot of people.
Oh, yeah.
And, uh, and, uh, they sent out the employee assistance cards for anyone that had any sort of drug problem or work related problem.
Sure.
Family problems, you know.
Uhhuh.
They kind of covered everything.
Uhhuh.
But I know they have a lot of drug problems so,
Yeah.
What do you think about, uh, you know, something that kind of concerns me is, uh, y, you know, you and I are tested for, for whatever work we happen to do.
Do you think there should be drug testing for political officials?
Yes, I do.
Yeah, I do, too.
Because, because a lot of them are, you know, they're hypocritical.
They, they talk against drugs
Yeah.
and then they get caught, you know.
Uhhuh.
In stings in Washington.
Yeah.
Whether it's drugs or any other kind of, uh, like the, the money laundering scams.
All that was drug related.
Oh, yeah.
So, and that cost us, the country, you know, billions of dollars.
Sure, sure, yeah.
So,
I would agree with you.
I, I can't see, I can't see how we can expect the, you know, uh, uh, people working in the, in, in America to, uh, to put any trust into our political officials if they don't, you know, uh, just doesn't make sense to have them i, to, to worry about legislation unless they're doing that themselves.
tell me what you think about the Vietnam war.
Okay.
Well, I'm a Vietnam era veteran, and, uh, I was, uh, fortunate not to have to serve in the theater, however, my support roll in the service was to support those in the theater of operation.
Uh, I'm of the old school that believes that, uh, the, uh, uh, contracts that we made back years ago needed to be honored.
However, uh, I think we could have executed the war and gotten it over a whole lot quicker.
Uh, but those are my personal thoughts, and I think that if we'd let the generals run the war like we let the generals run World War Two we'd had got it over a whole lot quicker and lost a lot fewer people.
But as it was, the politicians ran the, the Korean conflict and ultimately the Vietnam thing, and we managed to come out, uh, losers all the way around.
And so this is what trigger, ultimately triggered us, uh, United States, uh, per se, being, uh, deciding to get out of the role of world policeman.
Your views,
Uh, as I understand it, and I, uh, don't know a lot about it, uh, we got in there because of France
Well.
uh, France was there first.
They had,
We got into it because of SEATO agreement, back just right after World War Two that, uh, we pledged a mutual, uh, uh, defense of, of the South Vietnamese, and as it turned out they were in a civil war one with another, and really we I, I question us, you know, now, of course hindsight is all too clear.
Sure.
Uh, so, we're, we, we have to, have to deal with, with the, uh, situation as, as we played it.
Jerry, what did you think of people like, uh, Jane Fonda, another war an, antiwar activist.
I, don't get me started on those people.
You know, before she, before Jane Fonda did, did what she did, I thought she was a wonderful person, but after, uh, uh, well, I, I just don't have anything, want anything to do with her any more, because you support, uh, you support your government.
Right or wrong?
Uh, okay, right or wrong, I don't think is, is, we can determine whether we were right or wrong, because, you're, you're having to deal with, again, uh, I think we could have made a different agreement
Uhhuh.
back in for, the for, the late forties era that would have kept of there.
Uh, you know, I, I didn't realize that we'd signed some type of deal like that.
I thought we came in as first advisors to the French, and then they decided to pull out and,
Can you hold just a second, Terry?
Sure.
One moment please.
Sure
to someone else or himself.
> Wonder what happens to this little beastie on call waiting or something.
Huh, fascinating.
Well that's not,
Sorry for the delay.
That's okay.
Uh, yeah, this is, the, uh, the, the, uh, mutual defense thing was, uh, we, we, it was complicated, and I don't think everybody knows the whole situation.
I don't.
But from what I can gather, is we went and said yeah, we will help the South Vietnamese, uh, should they ask.
Well, the French went in and tried their old style warfare, and, uh, got soundly thrashed.
And we didn't do a whole lot better.
Um.
No, I had thought that they had, uh, colonies there, or something.
Well, yeah, that was the old French colony, but see, the French, the French were our, uh, allies in NATO
Right.
and they're also our allies in SEATO, which was the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, which has since been, uh, disbanded as far as I know, you know, NATO is, is on the way of being disbanded.
Uh, but, uh, the, you know, the French, yeah we go in as an ally to the French and says yeah, we'll, we'll help you out, if you get in a bind.
Well, they got in a bind and says we don't want to, you know, play any more
Uhhuh.
so, uh, we, we kind of, we kind of got, got the ball rolling ourselves versus a bunch of top secret silly organi, uh, um, oh, operations and then the full scale, you know, full scale troops, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
Yeah, I'm thirtytwo, so, uh, I bar, well, I missed it.
Seventyfour is when they quit sending troops.
Uh, yeah, yeah roughly.
Yeah.
I was just probably three or four years,
Okay, um, do you have any pets now?
Well, we don't right now, no.
We've, uh, I grew up
with, uh, with pets.
My folks and I always had a dog and a cat,
some,
Yeah.
birds, but, uh, right now we don't have anything.
Oh, okay.
Um, that,
What about you?
a matter of choice, or compulsion?
Well, we've just, uh, it seems like,
we've always been at a place where we'd have to go away for the summer or something and, uh, it was,
Yeah.
never convenient to have anything.
we were thinking about getting a dog if we get into a house.
Yeah.
Uh, someplace where there, you know, we can take care of it and everything.
We've got,
Yeah.
some children who would just really, uh, enjoy having an animal, you know, a dog, I think and,
Yeah.
What about you all?
Well, right now I'm a student, and campus housing does not even allow thinking about that
Oh, no.
No, we almost got chased out of here for feeding a stray cat.
Is that right?
Yeah.
They're very strict about it.
But you like, uh, you like pets and things?
Oh, I love animals.
Oh, yeah .
I was raised, our house when I, when I was growing up there was almost never, uh, at least one cat in the house.
Uhhuh.
It was al, almost always at least one cat, sometimes, you know, like fifteen or twenty.
But, uh, always cats in the house.
Oh, yeah.
We, we,
Oh.
enjoyed them.
We like, we like pets, but, uh, you know, you've got to deal with, uh, taking care of them and, and feeding them and everything like that.
Yeah.
And our kids are, we've got some children and they're not, not used to it, you know, on a daily basis.
They, they, uh,
How old are your kids?
Oh, from fourteen down to seven.
Okay.
You sound like you've got some small ones in the background.
One.
Is that right?
Our first.
He's about te, eleven weeks now.
Oh, great.
Yeah.
Congratulations.
Yeah.
Where are you from?
Uh, originally?
Uhhuh.
West Virginia.
Okay.
Um, I don't know how familiar you are with that area of the country but,
I've been to Charleston.
Charleston, West Virginia?
Yes, uhhuh.
Okay, that's pretty much the south end of the state, or the southern quarter of the state, anyway?
Uhhuh.
Okay, in the north end of the state, you've got that little narrow strip of West Virginia going up between Ohio and Pennsylvania
Uhhuh.
Right at the base of that northern peninsula
Uhhuh
is my hometown.
Well, that's, yeah, that's interesting.
So it's really up north in the country, really, .
Yeah,
I guess so.
yeah.
It's, well, um, my parents' house is like three miles south of where the MasonDixon Line would have hit the Ohio River had it
Gosh.
continued that far.
I see.
So,
It's pretty nice country up there?
Oh, it's beautiful.
Hills, or what?
Uh, well, from my neck of the woods, it's hilly.
Uhhuh.
Um, you know, uh, maybe three hundred, four hundred feet elevation, uh,
Uhhuh
type variations from the valleys up to the hills, the hilltops.
Is it farmland?
Um, not a lot of farmland there.
Mostly it's, uh, I mean, you know, there's, you know, individuals with their own, own f, uh, growing their own food.
Uh, most of the agriculture, it's more in the way of, uh, sheep and cattle.
Oh, yes.
And even that's, you know, small time mostly.
Sure.
Uh, the biggest chunk of what's going on there is, is, uh, industry.
Uhhuh.
It's coal mines and chemical plants and power plants.
Okay.
Uh, aluminum plants.
There's like two aluminum plants .
What are you, what are you studying there at Heidelberg ?
Computer engineering.
Oh, yeah.
What year?
Uh, just finished up my fourth semester.
Well, great.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I hope that works out well.
Yeah, it's a big change.
Yeah.
I spent,
What's,
twenty years as a mechanic so,
Oh, did you?
Yeah.
Well, you've got some experience behind you in the work force.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Are you, uh, shooting for a bachelor's now, or a master's, or what?
I'm working on a bachelor's degree.
Oh, okay, good.
I'm working on a bachelor's degree.
It'll be compu,
Hope it's a good program there.
Pardon?
Hope it's a good program there.
Uh, it seems to me, from what I've been able to find out.
Yeah, good.
That's considered a pretty good program.
It's nice and small, which means, you know, if you don't get the class this semester, then you've got to wait or three or four s, you know, anywhere from two to four semesters to get,
Huh
it again.
But, uh, i, it's worth it once you get it.
Well, yes, that's good.
And probably a good, uh, student teacher ratio and things.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah
Most the class are pretty small.
Good.
That works out real well.
Well, I, I was wondering what, if you all were to get a pet, like if you were to move into an apartment or a house somewhere, what would you get?
Uh, well, um, first off we'd probably wind up with a, a cat or maybe a puppy.
Uhhuh.
I, I, I'm partial towards the larger dogs.
Uhhuh.
Um, our last, we've, we've had a couple of cats before we moved on campus.
Uhhuh.
Uh, had a hamster or two, and they, they got,
A hamster.
to be a lot of fun.
Oh, yeah.
Uh, it's amazing how much character,
They're talking about, uh, federal government, aren't they?
I'm sure, well, actually probably any government, but
Yeah.
the federal one's the big one
So, uh, so what do you, what do you think in the short term we should be doing to, to improve it?
Well, I saw a program on, uh, recently, and, and it said every time they cut, you know, like fiftyfive million dollars on a certain thing, then they brag about how much money they cut, and then they go and spend that money somewhere else
Right.
and that's why the budget is never balanced.
Right.
The Gramm Rudman Act didn't solve the problem.
They just take all the money that they say they cut and they spend it somewhere else
Yeah.
or they, you know, they pad out their staff, or, you know, spend it in bounced checks at the,
commissary, or.
Uh, yeah, I'm getting pretty, kind of disgusted with the, uh, uh, you know, the fact that they're counting a reduced deficit as being some big step.
Right.
I mean, first of all, we were, we've already hit the largest deficit, this proposed budget has the largest deficit ever, and, two, a deficit is, I mean, the deficit is only, uh, is, is as far from a balanced budget, you reduce the deficit, you, you're still not, you're still not, you're still overspending.
Uhhuh.
Right.
I mean, it's just the amount that you're overspending, and this is, you know, for some reason, the way that the reporting is going on now, it seems like, like the goal is to reduce the deficit to some, you know, still outrageous amount, um,
Yeah, I, I, I think in the long term something is going to have to be done with, uh, sort of the, the, uh, well I mean, it seems to be kind of inherent in the political process, right, that you've got, uh, people, you know, trying to, trying to corner money for their state or for their constituents so that they can get reelected.
Uhhuh.
And, uh, there isn't any sort of overall accountability, and, and, uh, I don't know, I, I suppose that, that, that the only kind of solution ultimately that we're going to have, is, is, is exposure and information.
And I don't know that in general the American people are that interested, you know, to listen to, to as much, uh, uh, you know, I mean, you're going to have to know what people are doing, and, uh, you know, and how, and how, how partisan and how and how selfinterested their, their motives are
Uhhuh.
and, and take it to task for it, because it's not going to get solved, you know, if people are still trying, you know, like you were saying you say, you know, hey, we just, you know, we just cut defense, let me grab some of this money for my state now, and then we can throw in some highway bill, or you can throw in some, you know, some other kind of thing, and, uh, it's a pretty vicious, uh, vicious cycle.
I don't know.
Well, I think they should, they should limit the Senate to one term, one six year term.
That's, yeah, that's being batted around.
I, uh, my, my dad was always a pro, proponent of that.
He, uh
Uhhuh.
he felt that that would get people involved who were, who were interested in being public servants as opposed to personal servants.
Right, and, and don't let them come back, and, and, uh, keep Congress to, um, two terms of two years a piece
Uhhuh.
and then it'll be overturning and they won't have the same people there all the time
Right.
and then, all the special interest groups will have to renegotiate all of their
Right.
their payoffs and kickbacks and that'll keep them busy enough so that they won't have as much influence.
Uhhuh.
Because that's one of the things, one of the biggest things is that, uh, the fact that they're always trying to lean somebody toward one way or another, whether it's the oil companies, or the automotive companies, and like the air bag thing.
The air bag came out, what, twenty years ago.
Right
And only now they're getting that put in cars.
Uhhuh, yeah.
And the oil companies are, really aren't responsible, you know.
The Valdez proved that, and then the government doesn't jump on them hard enough to make them do anything.
Right.
It should have been done immediately.
Yeah, yeah, I think, I think that that's probably right, because in terms of long term, you just got to get people, um, I mean, uh, at one point, at least on a local level, um, going into politics is, you know, what you're doing is, is really trying to serve the community
Uhhuh.
right, I mean, you don't expect to make any money out of it.
You know, maybe you gain a little bit of local fame, but, but it's, uh, you put in a lot of work in exchange for that.
Right.
And I don't have the feeling that national level politicians are, are at all like that.
No.
They listen to wherever the money is.
Yeah.
And, uh, you know, I think that, that, that the problem with having, you know, junior people coming in all the time is that you end up kind of wasting a lot of time with, uh, you know, with in, inept politicians
Right.
or people who don't know how to deal with it.
Yeah, they're not as efficient, that's for sure.
But on the other hand, maybe that's,
All right.
Um, serious problems in the public education and what can be done about it.
Uh,
Well, what do you think?
Well, I, that's funny because I just, um, quit my job to stay home with my kids.
Oh.
And, um, I was a teacher for seven years in the public schools, so I know a little bit about it not,
a whole great deal.
Well, tell me about it.
What are,
what are the problems with public education?
Well, um, there, there's some.
There's several
It's such a, a broad, you know, topic that y, you need to boil it down.
Uhhuh.
But, um, one that, um, I thought was a problem that , I thought it was a serious problem, that I'm not sure it's being taken care of right now, uh, was like bilingual education
Uhhuh.
for, um, different,
um, minority groups and like Asians and, um, uh, Mexican Americans and, and just people in general that speak other languages that sometimes come from other countries or coming from different areas and they and in this area, and, um, as the school district, I'm not sure how to go about it, because it's hard to get one teacher that speaks all these languages
Right.
and so most of these children are put in, um, either special ed or a bilingual program, and then for just a small amount of time, and then they're into their regular classrooms the remaining of the, part of the day, and so the teachers are not sure how to teach them math when they don't read or speak English.
Uhhuh.
And so, um, a lot of the money isn't put into that, and so these children are just kind of sat in the corner and, um, you know, there's only so long you can do that and,
Right.
to me that seemed like a big problem in the school districts.
And a lot of the teachers, it n, it was not the teacher's fault.
A lot of the teachers were just not getting the backbone or support that they needed or the materials or the extra help that they needed for these specific children .
Do you find that those parents, um, I've seen the same thing and heard the same things, and at the same time I've heard that it's even harder when both parents are required to work and can't spend, you know, that, that time, you know
Yeah.
typically the mother was at home with, uh, the children and,
Yeah.
and at least could kind of keep up on what's going on, and really society sort of dictates that, uh, you know, both the parents work.
Yeah.
And, um, I know I've heard some people talk about just the fact that even as far back as the, you know, the second and third grade, uh, if the kids had, you know, proper reading skills or learned proper reading skills that, that would make a lot of difference.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, definitely, definitely.
And it, and it teaches language too.
Yeah.
Which is really good.
Um,
Well, I work at a university, and, and it's really tough when we're, uh, uh, I, I, uh, work at the University of Texas at Dallas and,
Uhhuh.
uh, we have, uh, some pretty selective admissions requirements for incoming freshmen.
Uhhuh.
And, you know, there are some students who are in the top ten percent of their class, even some who are maybe, you know, in the top ten o, of their class, and their S A T scores are very low, and a lot of it has to do with their, uh, their reading ability, you know,
Yeah.
their, their language and,
Oh, definitely, yeah.
It, uh, makes it tough because you know when they come in with scores that low, they may be, uh, good students, but they just haven't achieved to their fullest potential and they're going,
Yeah.
to fail unless some sort of remedial, uh, education is given to them so,
Right, right.
And then it, then it comes into, well, who's supposed to give it to them, the colleges and universities or,
Yeah.
are they supposed to get that back in the high schools and,
Yeah.
the junior highs.
Well, I know Richardson school district has a, has a wonderful program in the remedial reading, um, where, you know,
of course, all the children are tested in some,
time portion of the year and, and, uh, some children who need extra help are put into this, um, reading program, and it is just excellent.
It is,
Yeah
I wish that all the children could be exposed to that program, you know.
And I kn, I know that there are some parents that say how do I get my kids in that, and yet they don't qualify, but it's unfortunate that they don't qualify, because I think everybody would benefit from these programs.
Yeah, it sounds like it.
It is excellent so,
So how many children do you have at home?
I have two little ones and,
Oh.
that's why I, I quit my job.
Uh, you know, I've been teaching since they were, gosh, newborns and and it just wasn't adding up and, you know, being a teacher, and you see all these parents who are working and working and working and just, you know, don't have the time, time, time, time.
Yeah.
It was kind of getting to me, where, where I'm doing the same thing
And so, um, you know, my children are getting older and I was missing out on a lot, so I just decided to stay home for a while, I don't know how long
Well, that's good.
Why don't you tell me about your choir.
Oh.
Okay, well, we, uh, are a group of, uh, musicians that just kind of have, you know, formed out of a desire to sing and many of the people in the group are very professional in the sense that they, or just real talented I should say.
Uhhuh.
Lot of them are former music teachers or currently teaching.
Uh, others have, there's one gal that's in the, uh, Plano Community Orchestra.
Uh, just, you know, different backgrounds.
It's been really kind of interesting.
Great.
So,
Uh, I play the piano
Um.
and, uh, I have a four year old who, who has started to play the piano.
He does that, uh, musically, listens and then he can play, which is kind of interesting.
Oh, yeah.
I think it's because he's always heard music in our home all the, since he was a baby.
Uhhuh.
Uh, my husband and my other son, who's eleven just got through singing in a musical here, in, in the community at Music Man.
Oh, they did?
Yeah, and that's
How did,
lots of fun.
How did they get involved in that?
Uh, basically they read in the newspaper that there were open auditions.
It was the Plano Repertory Theatre.
Uhhuh.
And so they went and tried out and my husband played Harold Hill from the Music Man and my son played one of the children in a band.
Oh, how fun.
So, yeah, it was really fun, and, uh, my son plays the clarinet in his band at school, and my daughter takes piano lessons, too.
Uhhuh.
But, uh, we just really like music.
It's a, I, I especially like it as an outlet when the T V goes off, we
Um, uhhuh, um.
get the T V off and just have some nice quiet music.
Yeah, yeah, that's nice.
You say have your four year old taking lessons already?
Uhhuh.
And, uh, who do you have her, or him, take it from?
Uh, I have him take from a friend of mine who teaches Suzuki.
Uhhuh.
Which is an auditory type learning experience.
You listen to the music and then learn to play it by lear, by hearing the intervals and things like that.
Uhhuh.
I teach, uh, like what is traditionally taught, you know, you look at the note on the page and you play what's on the piano, but he can't learn like that.
He's a delayed child.
He's only about, I guess he's about two and a half in his real understanding of things.
Oh.
And, uh, so when my friend played something on the piano and he played it, uh, with his right hand, we went, wow
Uhhuh.
we better have him do s, do something.
Yeah.
You know, educationally.
Yeah.
So that was really fun.
Well, because my,
My husband and I love to go to the musicals downtown, though.
Pardon me?
So, my husband and I love to go to the musicals when they come into town
Uhhuh.
into Dallas.
Uhhuh.
Well, I have an eight and a half year old daughter who's taking piano lessons and started out at the age of just turning five
Um.
because she wanted, you know, she just seemed to enjoy it so much and now my, my four year old, four and a half year old daughter is, is trying to imitate her older sister and wanting to play and she actually does some very nice chording just naturally.
She just,
Oh, I think that's great.
So I wasn't sure when to start her.
I didn't want to push her too early, either, but, uh, kind of had a mixed feelings about that scene.
That's really hard I think, because, especially if you start them and then they get pretty good and then they get close, ten, you know, eleven or something, they go, I don't want to do this anymore and you're like
Uhhuh
God, I really want you to do it.
Yeah.
You know.
Yeah.
So sometimes it's hard to, to know exactly when, but, I don't know, if she acts like she wants to or says she wants to maybe you could have her take some for a while and see how she likes it.
Uhhuh, uhhuh.
Yeah, I think she'd like to, I just don't know if it's really, knowing from what my daughter has gone through, she's, she learned a lot and, of course, it was something she had to keep relearning if she ever got away from it.
Uhhuh.
It was something easily forgotten.
So, uh, I don't know if she's any farther ahead than those kids who started when they were eight or, or should I say seven.
I mean, she's not a gifted pianist in the sense that she's going to excel just naturally.
She does have to really work at it, but, uh, so,
That's like me.
Yeah, but, so I'm kind of, you know, just playing with it, but at this point we're going to kind of wait, I think just more for the financial reasons of it anyway but,
Well, it can get expensive
Yeah.
that's for sure.
Yeah.
I, my friend is, is very generous in, in letting us have my children, uh, do the Suzuki method
Uhhuh.
without paying a lot out.
Oh, that's good.
Yeah, so it's been good for our family.
Well, as a piano teacher, do you have any feelings for kids who come from a Suzuki method, have you had any former Suzuki students?
I don't have any Suzuki students.
Uh,
I was wondering how,
Something happening to me at Christmas time that, that verified to me that I will al,
Okay, Martin, do you do any exercise?
Yes, I do.
Uh, I like to, uh, play basketball and weight lifting.
Those are probably the two main things I like to do.
Uhhuh.
Um, so those are more or less indoor sports.
How's the
Yeah.
weather out there in Georgia?
Um, in, in, in the winter, you, typically it's, it's probably too cold to go out and do things like tennis.
Um, I like to play tennis in the
Uhhuh.
summer time or in the spring, fall, but in the winter it gets pretty cold.
Oh.
Um, yeah, so it's mostly indoor sports, I think, in the winter.
Uhhuh.
Um, how about yourself?
Well, yeah, I'm on a exercise program.
I'm riding my Aerodyne bike, um
Uhhuh.
half an hour every morning, and I'm just about ready to up it to up to fortyfive minutes a morning, and I feel like that's been a real nice exercise in the winter time.
It's
Uhhuh.
it's kind of kept me from getting cabin fever and, um, has seemed to be a real nice aerobic exercise.
Right.
Do you do, uh, any anaerobic type, weight lifting or weight training type exercise?
No, huhuh.
I, first of all I'd like to get my weight off.
I'm about fifty pounds overweight, and so I'd like to get the weight off, and then I'd really like to get into that.
Uhhuh.
And, uh, we have a, my husband and I have a, a, aerobic video that's called The Firm.
I don't know if you've heard of it, but it's a, an aerobic video with, not necessarily bouncing around and jumping up and down, but you're using weights, and that is the most incredible aerobic workout I have ever done.
It's
Huh.
it's really fun.
Yes, it's, it's, it's aero, it's similar to aerobics with weights
Yes, uhhuh.
but it's like low impact aerobics, just
Uhhuh.
with weights.
Yes.
Okay, are you familiar with, um, step or bench aerobics?
Um, no, I mean, yes, I am, but I have never done it myself.
Have you done that?
Uh, yes, I have.
In, in Atlanta that's, um, most of the health clubs
Oh.
are all, that's the, that's the in thing.
That's the big thing, huh?
At first it was just regular aerobics, but now bench or step aerobics have
Oh.
kind of taken over.
So how is that?
Um, it, they call it a low impact aerobics, and it's supposed to burn off more calories
Oh.
at the same time.
And from when I've done it, it does give you a good, a real good workout.
But only thing I'm concerned about is potential for injury to your knees
Oh.
you know, that and movement of going up on the step
Uhhuh.
you know, that could create a problem.
Yeah.
They, they seem to think that it, it won't, but you never know.
Now, if, um, playing basketball, are you knees, do you have healthy knees?
Yeah, I, I think my ankles probably are my main weak point.
Oh, dear
But, I've, I've kind of taken care of that.
I wear high tops and then also an an, a support ankle brace which is very stiff
Uhhuh.
and, um, we, wearing that I haven't had any problems in the past year or so.
Oh, that's good.
Well that sounds, you sound just like my husband.
He
Yeah.
he injured his ankle about seven months ago playing volleyball, and, oh, he's just had a heck of a time getting that ankle healthy.
Yeah, I.
So that's what he does, he wears his, his brace and his high tops and,
Uhhuh.
Yeah, I did, I injured mine so many times that
Oh.
rehabilitating became quite easy.
Oh, .
I mean, it would only take three or four days and I could play again on it
Wow
because after a while you just learn how to rehabilitate yourself
Uhhuh.
to play that way.
Oh, dear.
Oh.
But, um, so how, how successful is your exercise video?
It is amazing how fast you take off the inches
Uhhuh.
and I would, once I start my forty, I'd like to do the fortyfive minutes a day on the bike for a week, and then, every other day I'd like to incorporate the video, and then the bike on the other day.
Uhhuh.
But, it is really amazing how fast the inches come off, and the muscle builds
Uhhuh.
real fast.
Um, you can start, they recommend doing the video without weights for the first month and then after that you can just start with your five pound dumbbells, and then build up to your, uh, twentyfive pound dumbbells
Uhhuh.
and then you're just doing repetitious exercises throughout the whole video and it's a hour long video, so.
So it's a good workout.
It is, yeah, I really enjoy that, so I'm looking forward to losing this weight and
Uhhuh.
being firm and healthy
So, in the winter, I guess, there's a lot of, it's quite cold and
Yes.
snow.
Yes.
Now this one has been quite mild.
Um, we could have been out walking throughout the whole winter, because really we only had about three weeks of snow on the ground.
It was quite chilly but not,
I think that, uh, one, uh, advantage of having, uh, the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't, uh, convict someone who, uh, really shouldn't be convicted.
Definitely.
Um, and I think that, you know, a unanimous verdict, uh, helps to ensure that.
I guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way, that, uh, you, uh, would have a problem, uh, you know, that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted.
Uhhuh.
Have you ever served on a jury before?
Uh, I have twice.
Oh, okay.
It was a pretty wild experience.
Uh, what sorts of cases were they?
They were just, you know, small time cases where, uh, trailers and banks were involved, you know.
So were they criminal or civil?
They were civil.
They weren't
Oh, okay.
they weren't any criminal.
What, uh, what was the verdict? Did the, did the jury have trouble reaching a decision?
Uh, the jury, it was, uh, let me see, I think it was ten to one on the jury, because they only had to have eleven people
Yeah.
so it was, they, and, uh, the one changed his vote at the end.
So did it become?
So it became unanimous, you know, after they turned it in
Yeah.
and then he changed his mind after they turned it in
Uh.
but it then became unanimous.
Uh.
But since it was a civil case it really didn't matter, right? You just needed a majority?
Right.
What was, what was the other case? That was also civil?
The, the other case was just traffic, the, and, you know, it was seat belt law
Yeah.
and it, it didn't even hardly
Oh, didn't really even count.
go through, so.
Yeah.
I'm, I'm a college student so I haven't been, you know, a jury eligible age for very long
Yeah.
um, and, uh, I did get one summons actually at one point, but I declined it which I'm able to do because I'm a student, because it was, uh, a very bad time.
Yeah.
Well, you learn a lot going to the juries like that though.
Yeah, I mean, I, I really, I would like to, uh, to do at some point, um, but, I, I haven't.
Uh, one, one thing that I, I think is, um, you know, maybe is a problem is, uh, I, I think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now, but I wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well.
Especially sort of.
I wouldn't think that it does
How, wha,
I mean, from, from my, from what I experienced in them, it didn't, you know, it didn't turn out the way I planned it, I mean, the way that I would think that it would go.
Uh, you thought it turned out pretty well?
Yeah, but it was, you know, it was, jury was unorganized and it was, it was just wasn't organized enough for me.
Yeah.
I'm not used to it not being organized, and I just assumed that it would have been.
Oh, so it was just kind of a zoo and the jurors just sort of, someone had to figure out what was going on?
That's about what it was.
Um.
That's interesting.
Did it, did it work out pretty well in the end? I mean, did a couple of people sort of gradually, sort of assume, uh, sort of a moderator role in the trial or,
Yeah, they, well they picked one person, and then he finally, you know, moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have.
So it work, it did end up working out pretty well?
Yeah, it ended up working all right.
The one thing I sometimes wonder about, um, in civil cases is, uh, whether, especially sort of in, uh, maybe like pro, product liability, or medical malpractice, where there's, um, sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes
Yes.
you know, it's not just a matter of, um, of, you know, did this guy rip off this guy, and it's just a matter of interpreting a contract, it's sort of a matter of, um, you know, sometimes getting into very technical issues, and I wonder if, uh, if there's really, um, if the system works adequately in, in educating the jurors about, uh, whatever, um, you know, issue is under discussion.
I, I don't think that they, they, they educate them enough to, to really know what's going on.
In, in the case you were involved in, you said it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind.
So.
Yeah, the, the bank was suing them for, uh, because they went to get the, the trailer
Yeah.
that, which was, uh, seemingly their property.
Uh.
It was on his property.
Oh, so the deal was that he had, uh, borrowed money from the bank to buy it, and
Right.
he hadn't made the payments.
So they came to get it.
Yeah.
And then when they came to get it, well, it was on the landlord's property and he wouldn't let them take it off.
Uh, so they were suing to get it back.
So, and they are, it was a double wide, so they'd already taken it apart.
Uh.
So they left it there
Yeah.
and then when they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it.
Uh.
So they were suing him for the money, and, you know, there's no way they could because it, it was the moving company,
Okay.
Thanks.
Huh.
Do you all have a budget?
Well, uh, yeah, we, we do.
Um, we've been married for twentythree years
Uhhuh.
and we have, uh, three teenage daughters and, you know, they're very expensive.
So, uh, uh, we, yeah, we have somewhat of, uh, a system.
Uh, it's, it's kind of, uh, you know, it's kind of hard to explain.
Yeah.
We've actually gone, uh, just recently, to you know having, having two checking accounts.
We always had just one.
Uhhuh.
And now we are having two.
Uh, it's kind of hard to talk about this because to me it's very personal.
Yeah.
It's, uh,
So, I have to be.
That's that's kind of the way I feel about it.
Yeah.
I usually, uh, my wife handles a lot of the day to day finances and of course, we're ju, like ther, like a lot of people.
We just scramble through month to month, you know.
Yes.
And, uh,
Do you have a two income family or one income?
Uh, we have a two income
Yeah.
uh family.
She also works
Yeah.
and, uh, but she, she enjoys it and she's good at it.
Uh, if it's, if it's, I am kind of, uh, uh, I'm pretty bad about procrastinating
Uhhuh.
and one of these days I am going to do something about that believe))
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know how that goes, but, uh, uh, if, she, she handles it pretty well.
She, uh
So your wife,
she writes all the checks, you know, once a month.
Yes.
It that what her, is her career, uh, related to, to finance or accounting?
Uh, sort of on a peripheral.
She's, uh, uh, an annuity administrator
Oh.
and so she, uh, she works for an insurance company.
Uhhuh.
But, but she enjoys it.
She likes keeping track of all that stuff and, uh,
Yeah, so that's sort of related to her field a little bit.
Yeah sort of.
Yeah.
And we, you know, we've experimented with, with, uh, budgets, you know from time to time, uh, but, if, you know, you have to keep up with them.
So a lot of times, we just, uh, just kind of play it by ear.
We try to keep our, uh, our retirement and our savings kind of automated
Yeah.
so we never see that money.
Just like taken directly.
It's just taking it out, right.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We do the same thing.
And that, that's kind of handy.
Yeah, because if you don't see it, you don't miss it
Yeah, if
You don't spend it.
you have something to take it out.
That's exactly what we've always done
Yeah.
and we've had, uh, they've always had, uh, where they match your funds, you know, sometimes
Uhhuh.
if you, if you save so much, then they will match it.
Uh, that, you know, we've done that too.
But, my husband works for an insurance company
Uhhuh.
and he, he has now for about, oh gosh, how long has it been, ten years I guess.
But he was with another company before that, but we have, we have, I, I work also, but I only have a part time job
Uhhuh.
and I get paid very little but, uh, you know, I try to use that money for food mo, Jim gives me a certain amount money.
You know, we just transfer it
Yeah.
Uhhuh.
into my account and then I use that for food, household expenses, and then I add my own check to that and then with that I try and handle, you know, some of the clothes that the girls need
Yeah.
and things like that, but the expenses that we need and have around the house.
Yeah.
It
So.
sounds like you all pretty much do it the same we do.
Just kind of
Yeah.
play it by ear, but keep the, the deductions
Yeah, we
you know
well Jim has, Jim has a budget.
I mean he works it out every month
Uhhuh.
and breaks it all down.
Uh, you know.
I am given so much mon, money a month, so I am suppose to kind of get the food out of that.
Uhhuh.
So, I try not to, you know, we don't, you know, I don't ask for more.
I mean I just try and make it on that.
Uhhuh.
Yeah faint>>.
Because I think when you go to the grocery store, you can just, you can go crazy
Yeah.
with all the choices that you have
Uhhuh.
and, uh, you can, you can really waste a lot of money that way.
Yeah.
So, uh, well how long have you been married?
Uh, about five years.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
So you're just really getting started
So do you have a family too?
Uh, I've got one little girl.
She's like, uh, nineteen months.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
So, uh, she's, she's not, uh,
She hasn't effected your budget yet really.
Not, not really.
Not too bad.
Uh.
No.
Not like she will later on.
Yeah.
You will see that
Yeah when,
all of a sudden you're paying, you're trying to decide whether you are going to do, you know, soccer and piano and all these choices that they have of activities to do
Uhhuh.
and then you really have to start saying okay, now what can we afford
Yeah.
you know, what can we do here and then you have to really sit down and plan some more and, uh, but I think when we were back at your age, we didn't have much of a budget
Yeah.
and then as the girls got older, I think we, we did more and more of that.
You know, more budgeting as as they got older.
Uhhuh.
Uh, but uh, but what do you do? Do you,
I'm uh, I, I work for, I'm an electronic technician.
Oh, okay.
I work at a, for a university.
Uh, Georgia Tech, uh, research
Oh.
Well good.
and, uh,
Good.
So I just, uh,
Well, we just have, you know, we have a good friend that's about to move to Atlanta.
I guess we're not suppose to talk about those things.
I'd better get back to the subject.
Oh, well
But, uh, budgeting.
I found, you know, I feel a lot better.
You know, we use to work out of one check book
Uhhuh.
and it would be very hard for me because I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have any idea how much money I was spending in one month.
Yeah.
Now, I have, know exactly what I'm spending and it's so much easier,
Okay.
What is your, uh, community, uh, currently doing with regard to recycling?
Uh, basically, they're just, uh, having various recycling, uh, bins, uh, located for, uh, trash pickup.
Uhhuh
Well that's more than we have up here in Massachusetts.
Some, some local communities are very active in that, uh, in that respect and they do have bins set up.
But I live in a, a metropolitan area and, uh, they're not, uh, too inclined to do something as aggressive as that
Well, here they and, uh, live in an apartment complex.
Uhhuh.
And they only have one set of recycling bins, one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters.
So a lot of the people who live up front don't bother to recycle because, you know, it's too far to carry the stuff to the other bins.
I, I know a lot, I think a lot of, uh, the, the issues with regard to recycling are that, uh, people have to be motivated to do, to do something like that because it does take extra effort.
Whether and, and I think that, and I know Massachusetts has, a bottle bill was passed and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now, and the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably, believe it or not, is just to get the extra nickel at the, uh, the store and not, uh, that's the majority of people that I know of anyways.
Where people aren't really, you know, eco conscious.
It's just the fact that it's something they have to do.
And I'm not going to throw a bottle away, it's like throwing a nickel away.
That type of thing.
Right.
They,
But, uh, people need to be more conscious of it.
Th, here they're trying to push through a bill and a lot of people are against it.
And it's going to create a lot more work for the, uh, the stores that sell, you know, sodas and stuff.
Because they want to implement a refund on cans and on plastic bottles and everything.
Yeah
It didn't, it, it took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans.
Uh, and, and matter of fact, I think it took like three tries t, for it to go through.
But, and it's been pretty successful and people notice it as far as, uh, highways being, uh, you know, people would dr, have a drink of soda, instead of throwing out the window, they, they keep the bottle so it's, it's been a ecologically sound policy and, you know, as, as far as recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth.
But more importantly, it's recycling reusable materials back into, uh, manufacturing.
And that's the big thing, I think, that th, they try to promote.
Right.
I think here if they, uh, instead of just, you know, requiring that you put, put out the trash and stuff, if they could get some kind of rebate, those people who do put the stuff out, uh, you know, and separate it, have lower collection fee or something may
Yeah, that's a good idea.
encourage
Yeah.
people to separate.
Th, there definitely has to be a motivation factor and I know that, at w, where I work, I work for a defense contractor.
And there's a big push on for recycling, uh, paper materials, you know, computer output paper and also to decrease the amount of, uh, Styrofoam usage because of the, uh, the process involved in Styrofoam and, and the whole eco issue and that.
And, and they're very proactive and, uh, matter of fact, they give you discounts if you use, uh, china wear rather than, uh, Styrofoam stuff, so.
So, i, i, it's incentives like that that get people people more conscious of it.
I think that's, that's what they need to do.
Be more like that.
Uh, I know, uh, I believe it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books.
Uh, usually have them come from you know, projects to collect old ones.
Usually just get dumped out with the trash.
And phone books are a large volume of annual trash.
Yeah.
They, they just, matter of fact, that, that reminded me of an article I saw in the pa, the local schools, you could send your phone book to your, uh, to, with your kid to school and what they'll do is they'll recycle it.
Because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that, uh, trash, uh, the telephone books are the type of thing that don't break down over a long period of time.
A guy went to a d, a landfill, dug down five feet and, and pulled up a phone book from like nineteen sixty because they don't, they don't degrade over such a period of time.
Well, part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made with a clay based paper.
Yeah.
They contain the glue and stuff and they used to have to take out all the, uh, pages and then cut the spine off to be able to recycle them.
Yeah.
Now I think they've come up with some way of, uh, pulling the glue out.
Yeah.
Okay
Okay.
Go ahead.
Uh, well, you know, uh, I think public service is a worthy thing and as a matter of fact there are a lot of programs, uh, such as Peace Corps that promote that.
Uhhuh
Probably the most popular one but, uh, one that is not typically recognized as such is the Boy Scouts.
Huh
Uh, I know that f, because my son is a, a scout now and, uh, is thinking about his Eagle and, uh, in order to get Eagle, you have to have merit badges in, uh, citizenship in the community
Right .
citizenship in the nation, citizenship in the world and you have to do a public service project.
Uhhuh.
Uh, in which leadership is the key element.
I, uh, I think the question is posed somewhat strangely because, uh, it's talking about a requirement for
Uhhuh faint>>.
public service and, of course, Pe, the Peace Corps, the Boy Scouts is a, o, is a voluntary activity.
Right.
Uh,
I, I think that might be talking, referring to, uh, something, kind of, uh, alternative to the draft, you know.
Either you have, uh, military service or some sort of alternative, nonmilitary service for a few years.
Right, of course, uh, uh, military service falls under the category, uh, of a public service.
Right, right.
And, so, uh, one of the things that would fulfill the, at least the nominal, uh, qualifications set forth in the charge is military service or draft.
Huh .
Right, right.
Uh, but I agree with you, that probably is not what was comprehended.
There are other
Well, i,
things such as civil service
Uhhuh.
uh, which many people, uh, are lifelong employees of
Right.
but I suspect that was not what they had in mind either.
More
Yeah.
of a voluntary kind of thing or, uh,
Yeah, yeah i, i, for, for years there has been an idea batted around of having some sort of alternative, uh, public service for, uh, young people to go into, uh, after high school.
Uhhuh.
Uh, kind of in lieu of the draft for, for people who don't, uh, who, you know, are conscientious objectors or don't otherwise want e, e, to be in the military, you know.
Say, okay, well you can go into the military or you can do this other thing for one or two years to kind of serve the community and, and learn about things.
And i, it's interesting because I, I'm not a particular fan of the military but I have seen a lot of people, a lot of young guys go in that don't have really a clue as to what they want to do with their lives and aren't terribly disciplined, you know, even just personal discipline about what they want to do and they come out and they, they at least have, now they have at least some marginally marketable skills and more discipline.
And they have, uh, you know, in, in some cases they have a greater selfesteem because they can say, they can see that, you know, if I do something or sub, submit my own will to the will of the sargent or whatever, at least for a short period of time, I can accomplish a lot and it, it's a good lesson for a lot of young men to learn.
That they don't need to be, you know, cowboys.
They don't need to be out there and, uh, you know, constantly flaunting their ego to get things accomplished.
And, you know, for some, for some young men, that's good.
For me, it would have been lousy i, idea, uh, because
Why?
I, I did have th, the personal discipline.
And I went
Why is that?
to college for four years and got out, you know, so.
But, uh, you know, for some people that's good.
I, I don't particular like the fact that it's the military, you know, and the whole point of the military is to kill people essentially.
As, as an instrument of U S policy.
Oh, no, no, no.
It's to defend the nation against external evils.
Well, that's one view
And, and, you know, and that, that's another debate.
But, uh, it's, uh,
Well, it depends on whether you, whether we figure that we have that we have a defense oriented military or
Uhhuh.
an aggressive, aggression oriented military.
Right, right and, well, it's, it, it seems pretty aggre, aggressive oriented, I mean, you, you look at the last mis, military action which was in the Persian Gulf and wasn't anywhere near the United States and it was, uh, you know, it was definitely a projection of U S power on the other side of the globe, so, at, at any rate, this is getting off the topic but i, my, my point was that there is, for people who don't want to do the military service, there, it would be neat if there were an alternative that could instill the same sort of personal discipline and sense of purpose and, uh, sense of community that the Boy Scouts,
Wha, what sort of company do you work for? Do you work for a big or a little place?
Uh, I work for Georgia Tech.
Yes sir.
I work for the research facility.
Uh, and it's, it's kind of small in a sense but it, it does have, about, uh, I guess, two thousand civil employees.
Uhhuh.
And, on a, a scale, I guess it's still considered small.
It just have a lot of different laboratories.
Uhhuh.
The area I work in, it, it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so.
Uhhuh.
So that's make up most of the laboratory so from, from that standpoint, it's pretty small
Uhhuh.
it's pretty small.
What about yourself?
Huh.
Well, I, I work for, uh, actually probably similar kind of place.
I work for, uh, Lincoln Laboratory.
Oh, okay.
Uh, yeah.
We actually do some work with some people down at Georgia Tech.
Oh, okay.
I see.
Uh, and, uh, so we're, we're part, we're actually part of M I T.
So it's very much the same kind of place and, uh
Oh, okay.
the technical institution.
Right.
Uh,
Uh, while I was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to, trying to think of what, uh, uh, what things were important, uh, besides salary and a, and a job.
I guess, uh, list I had scribbled down was the people you worked with and maybe the, uh, the challenge of the work and, uh
Uhhuh.
the working conditions, things like that.
Right.
I don't know.
What are your, uh, what sorts of things would you consider important?
Well those and probably the security aspect of it.
Uhhuh.
Because a lot of time nowadays, even though you're working, uh, you're treated, and it may not be true in every place.
In a lot of cases I think you're treated more like a number instead of a, a person.
Uhhuh.
Because when it come down to layoff, they don't really consider people and, and, you know, their well being as far as, you know, how they going, their next dollar going to come in.
How they going to pay their bills.
They just lay them off.
Yeah.
And I was reading this book one time about this guy that had, uh, I think the company still exists.
What they use to do is, they used to cut the number of hours for everybody as opposed to just laying people off
Uhhuh.
you know.
That way that, you know, one person wouldn't get one big blunt blow at one time.
Uhhuh.
And, uh, you know, I think if they had programs that set up to subsidize people that do get laid off a little bit better, you know, other than s, you know, something like, unemployment is good but I mean the company as a whole because you as an employee, even the company is making money, they paying you a salary but you are responsible for that company growth.
You're responsible also for helping that company get to the par, point that it's at at making profits.
So there should be something in there or some kind of clause that will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than, you know, uh, neglect or something like that.
Uhhuh.
You know.
Because it's not a person's fault that, you know, people not buying or businesses are, are not on the up and up all the time, you know.
I don't see how one or two people, maybe more one or two, but, you know, a number of people can, can be the downfall of com, a company situation.
Now how do you mean that? I know it,
Well in a sense that say, how do you make a, a conclusion that you're going to lay off these ten people.
Uhhuh.
Uh, for the bad times of the company.
What about the, the work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well.
Uhhuh.
You know.
In that standpoint.
Well, you, you think it's better than to, to try to spread the, the effort equally among all the employees of the company or,
Ye, yes, I do.
Uhhuh.
I really do.
I think it'd be better that way and even at that, it would at least give the person time to look for another job because
Uhhuh.
they know that that there are problems and, you know, there are reason to look for another job
Yeah.
instead of just dumping it on them all at one time.
Uhhuh.
You know.
That's just, that's my views, you know.
Yeah.
I've heard of a couple of companies that have done that.
I think, uh, back about, a few years ago when things were tough, HewlettPackard did that for awhile.
They went to a, uh, a, a four and a half day work week rather
Right.
than cut, yeah, just cut everybody back ten percent.
Right.
And, uh, have to, give everybody a half day a week off.
Right.
And I think you can do that for a little while but I'm,
Well at least that would give a person a chance to look
Yeah.
you know.
Because the way it is, a person really don't have a chance
Not very good it's not been a good day
I went,
I turned mine in about twelve hours early at noon.
I don't know.
I finished mine up about eleven and left it here with Carolyn so I hope she's turned it in.
Are you eating?
Uh, I ju, go ahead, I'll stop eating.
I just barely got
No it's,
home from the university.
Say what?
I just barely got home from the university.
Tell you what we can do is, uh, I can punch the, uh, one,
and then w, after five minutes when the, uh, uh, voice comes on, we can talk all night if we want
Okay, go ahead, fire away.
Uh, I love the irony of, uh, talking about this subject on April the,
fifteenth
But, uh, I'm afraid I'm, I'm probably in the minority.
I, I actually don't think that we, uh, pay too much in this country.
Uh
I agree with you
uh, particularly, uh, in this part of the country w, uh, I guess I do have a, a bone to pick with, uh, uh, the way taxes are distributed
Uh, I just finished fuming at the fact that we pay an eight and a half percent sales tax and no income tax when the income tax could have been deducted from the federal form
Huh.
and the sales tax can't.
I think that's regressive and, uh, uh, it's kind of dumb.
I hate the eight and a half percent sales tax.
But, on the other hand, I don't mind that it's only on, you know, things that aren't like groceries and that, it's not on that.
Well, I mean, nobody taxes groceries.
Oh, yeah, they do.
Where?
In Arizona.
Is that right?
Uhhuh.
But we have a pretty low income ta, I mean pretty low tax rate here.
Oh, I think the, the sales tax, they just got to do something about it.
Right.
But that's the politicalness of trying to not create any new taxes.
Right
But I guess when I hear, when I see the comparison between the United States and, uh, any other western country, uh, their, their rates are like, uh, fortyone, fortytwo and ours are like thirtysix, thirtyseven, you know, if you compute as a percentage of total income, all taxes lumped together, we actually do pretty well.
T, th, there's no other country that's, that is taxed as low as we are.
Well and I still think that, having lived in Europe for awhile, you know, difference in living conditions
Yeah.
are certainly well worth, uh, what we pay for it.
Uhhuh.
I'm, I'm not sure I understand what you mean.
Well, I mean, I think, I was in Germany, you know, for several years
Right.
and I'd a lot rather pay taxes here and have what we have, then have to live there.
Oh, you mean, lowest end of living in spite of lower, higher taxes.
Yeah.
Higher taxes.
Yeah.
I suppose that's true, yeah.
Uh, probably m, less so now than it was ten years ago or whatever but,
Still's that way to some extent.
Yeah.
I think the other problem is, you know, it, it's easy to complain about taxes because there's something you, theoretically, can do something about.
Right.
But I look, for example, and you're not quite in the same situation but like school taxes for me
Right.
biggest bargain in the world.
I wish I didn't have to pay any more fo, to my physicians in a year
Right.
than I had to pay for all of my school taxes.
Yeah.
Yeah, since, uh, I send my kids to parochial school, that .
Yeah, that, that's probably a little tougher on you
It's not, it's not quite the bargain that .
But, I mean, I pay them gladly.
That's a decision, I think it's a dumb decision on our part because countries like Canada and England and Germany do perfectly well with a, uh, two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools f, with the same tax money.
But, uh, I mean, that's, that's the way Americans want to interpret it, I guess that's all right
But, yeah.
I,
and if I were, uh, when I was single and again when I'm retired,
I will not mind paying, uh, what it takes to keep the schools good.
That's always been a high priority
No, I think that's just you though.
I do, yeah, that's true.
I think in places,
I think in places like California, people are beginning to find that in, in areas that are fairly well off, if you add the, uh, uh, people of various sexual persuasions and those who never intend to marry and those who are retired and those are, uh, just looking for fun, th people with families turn out to be such a small minority that they can't get a tax bill passed no matter what happens.
Yeah.
And, uh,
there are big sections of the country where people with children of school age are such a small minority that they can't get anything done.
That seems a, a, like a cultural lapse.
I mean, people always used to be willing to ante up for the schools.
They,
Of course, I think with the graying of America, we're going to see that problem in lots of places.
Right.
Yeah.
People would rather, uh, increase the fire department and cut down the schools because it means more to them.
But I think it's sad
Or build roads.
selfish and shortsighted.
Yeah.
Well,
Uh, I think, uh, actually I'm fairly pleased with the benefits that we have at the, uh, working for a large corporation.
And, for me, there's absolutely no question what's the most important benefit
Right.
I think it's health care.
It's what, I think everybody would say that.
Oh, and if you try to get it outside of your corporation, you're going to pay an arm and a leg.
Right.
Belonging to a group is the, belonging to a health group is probably the most important protection you can have after you,
Right.
Uh, so, the, uh, sometimes I think it's more important than salary.
Uh, do you also get dental?
Yes.
And, uh, I don't know if I would rank that second but, uh, since I have three boys, uh, it, it can turn out to be important.
Yeah, you know
Oh, I know.
in a, in a given year, dental ca, dental expenses can really kill you.
Now my husband is with, uh, Northwest Airlines and he gets, uh, you know, the full health and dental and, uh, we have four children and what you pay just to have teeth cleaned is outrageous.
Right.
And I don't know how people that don't have it can afford it.
Right.
It's, uh,
Or maybe they don't
Right, uh, and then, uh, uh, if the cleaning doesn't get you, the orthodony will.
That's right
That's right
Uh, I guess that would be up there.
Uh, I'm not sure if I would rank, uh, how I would rank that next to, say compared to retirement or, uh, uh, uh, pretax savings was another thing that I think is a
Uhhuh.
a great, a great benefit .
Right.
And I, I think it's really something that the, uh, the government ought to encourage more because, uh, there are all these complaints about how we're not a saving country
Right.
and where the average savings rate is something like four percent in this country and fifteen percent in, uh, Germany and Japan.
Uh ,
Well, it's a lot easier to, to save it when you don't get your hands on it first
Right.
When you have the, when you have the, uh, the economy to scale and everything that a large corporation has, and you can, uh, offer some incentive and if the government goes along by not taxing it when you put it aside
Right.
you can really build up, uh, the savings and the, that you wouldn't otherwise do and ,
Uh, what about, what about, uh, lesser, uh, benefits perhaps for you but for, for the women in the, in the corporation.
For example, uh, oh,
Leave?
Yeah.
Do they e, even, do they have father leaves or anything like that?
You know, I, I don't think so yet.
They may have, uh, just plain parental leave, which either one can take.
Uhhuh.
Uh, I, their, uh, I know their maternity leave is on the order of six weeks which I think is too short.
Uh
Oh, I do too.
uh, uh, I really think that we need to get into the mold where we talk about years rather than months or weeks.
Oh, I think, I think it's just a crying shame, uh,
for a mother to have to go back to work at six weeks.
Right, and, uh,
She isn't recovered
And, uh
There ,
the infant needs her desperately,
at that point and time.
There ought to be, uh, uh, some compromise that could, where, uh, where the person would be guaranteed a, uh, career type position but not necessarily a continuation of exactly the same position
Uhhuh.
uh, in exchange for a longer period of time.
Right, I agree.
It's, uh, it's so important to families then and, uh, and yet anybody who's gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up.
Oh, sure.
Uh,
Especially in this day and age.
That,
You don't want to start over again anywhere.
Yeah, you're right.
I think you've put your finger on the one benefit that I, that I would most like to see, uh, changed
Uh, the, uh, parental leave.
Well, I think they're at, they're com, they've come a long way.
Right.
Uh, at least some companies.
Some of them, uh, my girlfriend, in particular, that works for a, a rental car agency and, uh, as manager and, uh, they have a very, very poor leave policy and, uh, I just don't know how, how women do it.
Particularly, single parents who don't have the support at the other end.
Uh,
Right
They do it by shortchanging their kids.
There's no other way.
I mean
That's right.
That's exactly right.
uh, unless they're part of some extended family which is unlikely.
Uh
Right.
people moving as much
And, uh, they just, it's just a terrible choice, you shouldn't have to make it.
Uhhuh.
Uh you're right.
And, uh
One of the benefits we get, of course, is travel
Oh, right.
Boy, would I like to have that.
It's wonderful
Yeah.
The only trouble is that you can afford to go anywhere but you can't afford to stay once you get there
Oh, listen I have friends in a lot of different cities.
If you just fly me there, I'll take care of that
That's right.
You have to have an awful lot of fun just, just getting there, is, has to be half the fun.
Right.
So and, uh, I guess the,
I don't know what you drive now.
I mean, what do you drive now?
Uh, I have a Ford pickup and, uh, the family car is a, uh, a Dodge Caravan.
Oh, okay.
And, uh, because we have three kids and they're under thirteen so, uh
Throw them in the back.
they sort of fit our requirement.
Yeah, I have a, one of those, uh, pickups with the, uh, seat
Cab.
with a seat in the back.
Oh, yeah?
And so they just fit in there.
When they get to be teenagers with long legs, it may not work.
Yeah
Right now, I can, right now, I can throw them all in the back when we have room and, uh
There you go.
and since I do a lot of projects, I throw things in the back and I kind of like having a pickup truck.
Yeah, yo,
Actually, I think of it as a as a car that'll last
Right, yeah, I know.
I like the way trucks are built and I don't care about comfort.
So, I'm pretty happy.
Yeah, you're looking at, I got a Toyota Four Runner.
I wanted a truck that I, I wanted something that I could throw people in the back too, so I got a Four Runner.
So I wouldn't hesitate to get another one.
I, I never buy new so I wouldn't hesitate to get another used truck.
You're just like me.
I've never bought a new vehicle in my life.
And, uh, yeah, I don't, I don't need to pay for the glitz.
I'll
No.
let somebody else, uh, have the showroom shine and I'll pay for the rest of it.
Let somebody else break it in, right
Right.
And, uh, the van we're sor, we might go again on a, on a van.
We, we could probably do with a, a, something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time.
I'm not sure.
Yeah.
We have to, we, we'll have to face it in a couple of years but, uh,
I, I guess, we had a small Toyota wagon
Right.
and we were real happy with that because, uh, my, my second requirement after price is, uh, low maintenance.
Right.
And, uh, th, it certainly had that.
We didn't do much to it at all.
Yeah.
So.
Yeah, my, my, pretty much the same.
I, I got a, like I say I got one of those Toyota Four Runners
Uhhuh.
and, uh, it pretty much does everything I need it to.
I mean, it, it'll tow three thousand pounds so I can tow everything and it, I can throw, I've had eleven people in it before
Uhhuh.
Believe it or not.
And, uh, it's real reliable, belie, I, I mean I've had it for almost four years now and up until, oh, say two weeks ago, it had never had anything wrong with it.
Uhhuh.
And then, of course, two weeks ago,
it decided, I don't know, it's the strangest, weirdest thing in the world, but it blew a head gasket.
Uhoh.
Didn't do any damage to it.
Uh, I caught
How, at how
it real early.
at how many miles?
Uh, oh ninetyseven
Huh.
thousand.
So it's not real early
You didn't overheat it?
No.
Never overheated it.
I smell, I smelled the, uh, I smelled the coolant
Uhhuh.
Went out and looked.
Saw it was, saw where it was coming from.
Drove it right to the shop and left it off.
Huh.
Well that was, ,
And that was it because I, d, I have that and then I have a, a Kawasaki motorcycle.
Uhhuh.
Which is, actually, the, usually my preferred mode of transportation if I can take it and it's not raining.
Yeah.
I mean that's, that's sort of my,
hobby though more than a vehicle.
It, it's a I don't know, people who buy motorcycles for transportation I think are kidding themselves
I have one colleague that, uh, commutes to work on one when it's not raining and, uh, uh, he's a, it's, he's pretty conservative guy.
I don't think it's much of a sport for him.
I guess, uh,
I know but I bet you he really enjoys riding it.
I'm sure he does, yeah.
Yeah.
So, you know, yo,
h, when was the last time you took out, took your truck out just to, just to go driving?
Yeah.
No
And I go out twice a week on the bike, so.
Yeah.
At least.
Just for
Uh .
the enjoyment.
Yeah
But, yeah, I, I mean, the only thing I think I might get, a new car or, not necessarily a new car but, a, another car, uh, I would consider going to a, a non, to a normal pickup rather than a, a covered pickup like the one I've got.
Just because there's a lot of times I wished I had, ju, just an open bed to throw stuff in.
Right.
I'm sure, I'm sure that that's very, I mean you got one.
It's, that's really convenient to be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back and,
If I only had some place that I could store the, uh, camper top, I would have it off most of the time.
Right.
I really leave it on there just for, just to have it out of the way because you put it on the ground it gets dirty.
To have it out of the way.
Right.
But, uh, they're solid.
Uh, trucks are built, uh, I mean,
I think they last a lot longer than anything else.
They're the only things Americans still know how to build and, uh
Yeah, yeah, the trucks do.
Uh, even though, you know, the Jap, the little Jap trucks are, are good there too.
But so are the, though I think the Chevies, I don't think the Che, I don't like the Chevies as much as I like the Fords.
Yeah.
I think they, I think the Fords tend to last a little longer.
Right.
I
At least until recently
I kind of like mine, yeah, so, mine's a Ford
A friend of mine just bought , bought like a year ago.
It, it's a really nice truck.
I mean, I don't like Dodges at all but one of the Dodges they have out now has a, uh, the Cummins turbo diesel on it.
Oh, I heard about that, yes.
Oh, it's beautiful.
Yeah.
That thing, that thing will last forever I mean ,
That, that's a serious truck.
Oh, yeah, that thing's, uh, it's got a boat engine in it
Right, this, uh, I, I know a contractor who just got one of those.
Uhhuh.
He's pleased with it.
Okay, uh, well, we just got our income tax return and I'm perfectly happy.
What about you
Well, let's see.
I haven't got mine yet because my parents are getting all that stuff at, uh, at home
Uhhuh.
in the Bay area.
Uhhuh.
So, I'm not sure how much I'm getting back but I'm pretty sure I should get back a little bit since student, so
Yeah.
It's not too much.
Yeah.
Not too bad though
But as far as writing checks out and paying taxes, I think it's pretty high.
But I, I'm, you know, I, I guess it's where we have to be, where it, we have to keep raising them for to keep some of the things that, that we have and
Yeah.
It, it's one of those necessities of life that we all have to, you know , pay taxes but, although it is kind of a pain sometimes though.
It's just scary though about, you know.
How high are the taxes going to be when my children are my age?
Uhhuh.
You know, that, that's, that's scary too.
Uhhuh.
Because it's not anything like the way it was when I was young and small and a child.
So, you know, that, that's a scary part too, that you have to think about.
Yeah.
And, and
like, as time goes on, you know, things get more expensive and because we were increasingly complex society that
Uhhuh.
day by day things get more, uh, things get more expensive as well as more complex.
Yeah.
And, you know, taxes are one of the ways to help pay for a lot of the things that are needed in this society.
Yeah.
I mean, everything from, you know, from medicare to, uh, to social security to, uh, to feeding the h, to, uh, to, you know, feeding the homeless, to maintaining prisons, to maintaining polices or fire departments and things like that.
And it's, now there's more and more things that need attending to and that sort of thing.
And, you know
Uhhuh
it's, it's becoming a larger responsibility but someone has to pay for it and that's us.
Yeah and then you find out about all these things about are your taxes, you know, taxpayers, are, is your money going to where you want it to go and.
There's going to a special this week.
I, I can't, I can't if it's TWENTY TWENTY or one of those things where, uh, I think it's one of the local news.
I think they're having a documentary.
Something about that.
About their trying to catch some people that not spending your tax monies right and fraud and that kind of thing, you know and that's kind of scary too
Uhhuh
And, uh, so that would be interesting to see
I wanted to see that program.
Yeah.
And, and, even, even today it's like the amount of taxes that, you know, we're paying for.
But you'd think that we're still in , that this, this, uh, deficit state that we're still not able to pay off things just because
Oh, I know
the budget's not big enough as it is.
Yeah.
And,
makes you wonder when there's, you know, countries out there that have, you know, tax rates of like close to fifty percent or higher.
You know, it's like fifty percent of everything you make is already gone before you even get it.
Uhhuh.
And that, that's kind of a scary thought.
I hope it doesn't come down to that.
Yeah
But, on the other hand, they also, while those countries that have high taxes, also have things like, uh, socialized medicine, things like that too, which are nice fringe benefits of it.
So everyone has, everyone has the access to medical facilities as well as the doctors.
That sort of thing.
Uhhuh.
And it's good but it's, it's the price they pay
Yeah.
I mean it can be argued one way or another whether economically it's actually good for the country or good for any given country to have that because those countries tend to be, uh, as far as cash flow, a lot, uh, have be, tend to have a much slower cash flow
Uhhuh.
and don't generate a larger a, a large amount of revenue because there's so little, uh, currency flow through out the economic system
Huh.
Well you sure do know a l, a lot
Well, just keeping up with the times, that's all.
Yeah yeah.
As, as it turns out, you know, it's one of those, one of those interests , you know, I kind of like to keep up on.
Because, well it's nice to know that when I'm actually, you know, I do start working that, I like to know where my tax dollars are going too.
Uhhuh.
work hard to get, you know.
I like to know where it's going to.
Yeah, yeah.
That's true.
Uhhuh.
What do you think about these items that are going to be, uh, taxed even more.
Like, uh, tobacco and that kind of thing
I think in a, in a way it's good, in a way it's not.
Uh, but I think in general it's probably good.
I mean, a lot of things like tobacco and alcohol and things like that have been, have been, in the past, uh, have been not taxed because there's been such a large lobby against them, against
Uhhuh.
the taxes for them.
Sponsored by the alcohol and tobacco companies.
Uhhuh.
And it's things like tobacco are, uh, they're, they're a proven health hazard to smokers
Yeah.
as well as nonsmokers
Right.
And it's, as far as the safety thing, in, like in San Luis Obispo, for example, there's an ordnance which states that, uh, there's no smoking in any public areas.
And so if you walk into any restaurant or any hotel there's no smoking allowed anywhere.
Oh, really
Okay
Okay Carol.
So, air quality.
Yeah.
Is it, like water running and she is doing dishes>> I know in here, uh, downtown Dallas, it's, you, I mean you drive by and you can just, you can see it.
Uhhuh.
But, then again I originally was from California and, uh, there is a big difference between Texas and California.
And, uh
Surely.
they'd have their smog alerts and where you'd have to stay indoors for so many hours with an air conditioner.
And, of course, they don't have that here in Texas so, there's .
You mean they don't have the, uh, the smog alerts?
No, not in, not in Te, well not in Dallas, that is.
Right.
I, I,
yeah, I spent a summer i, i, in Tyler so I know, just east of Dallas there.
Yeah.
We're going there tomorrow.
Oh, really
Uhhuh
We're
Yeah.
packing and getting ready to go to .
Actually, I'm a California born person.
Uhhuh.
I was born in L A so I know what you're talking about.
In L A, it's pretty bad.
Yeah.
Oh, okay.
Yeah, you do then.
Uh, the worst city in the, in the world is actually, uh, Mexico City.
Is it really?
Yes.
I would not imagine that.
The worst one for smog is Mexico City.
Huh.
The most polluted city in the world
Huh.
You learn
something every day.
Yeah.
I know that they've, they're looking at, uh, uh, you know, uh, you know, better running automobiles.
Uhhuh.
Yeah, I've seen that.
Uh, some things they do, w, w, one of them is they're using corn in fuel.
Huh.
You ever heard of that?
Huhuh.
Yeah.
Methanol?
Huh.
No
Yeah.
Well that's big up here because of the, they grow a lot of corn
Oh, yeah
Yeah.
Uh, that's one thing that they do.
At that, it's pretty easy to do.
Uhhuh.
And the, uh, unfortunately, it still contributes to global warming cause, you have to, you know, wipe out forests to grow corn and things like that.
Yeah, that's true.
It doesn't make sense.
Uh, but it's, you know, one of the most, uh, productive crop in the world
Right.
is corn.
Huh.
And, of course, I doubt if there's any, you can buy regular anymore.
You buy unleaded.
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Huh.
Drive cars with catalytic converters,
and all that.
It's interesting.
They're, they're looking at, there's some work being done on, uh, automobiles that are electrical powered
Uhhuh.
And, uh,
they're looking at where you have a battery operated car basically, but it has a, a engine in the back
Uhhuh.
that charges it.
So the engine kicks on when the batteries need power and it turns off.
Uhhuh.
Interesting thing about gas is when, I mean, about battery powered cars is when you're at a stop light, you're not using any any energy
Huh
That is good.
Unlike a car where it's running.
Yeah.
A electric car it's on demand.
I mean it's either on or off.
Yeah.
Basically.
Huh.
You don't have to shift
So you, cars become very simple all
Oh.
of a sudden too.
Very interesting.
That would be nice.
I think I saw that on T V one time.
They, maybe it was C N N where they were demonstrating that.
Yeah.
Or something similar to that.
There's, there's a race in Australia with solar powered cars.
Huh.
And Ford and General Motors and all those compete.
But what, w, w, I think that was a, a, a setback.
That they, I don't know, they went, I don't know, how many miles an hour.
I think like twen, was that something
Right.
Yeah faint>>.
maybe it was.
I don't know.
G M, uh, Chrysler announced that they're going to, they're, well they actually have an electric minivan.
Huh?
Yeah.
Their, their Caravan.
Huh.
But it costs, uh, fifty thousand dollars right now.
Yeah, and they're, they're very expensive too.
To operate, yeah.
But, you know, people are buying them.
You know whose buying them? The power company.
Free, you know, free for them.
Well, yeah.
Yeah.
Kind of interesting so see.
Well, it doesn't make sense.
Because if they want people to convert, you know.
Uhhuh.
They should make it worthwhile.
Yeah
It's top speed is something like eighty miles an hour.
So it's
Yeah.
a good, good
Yeah.
vehicle.
Um.
Well I'll tell you.
Sometimes it's, it's pretty bad here.
Like today I think it was pretty bad.
I don't know if it was, if it's just, uh, the allergies or what but
Uhhuh
some days it's r, very nice here downtown and other days it's just really bad, so, I don't know.
So what, what kinds of things did you experience in L A when you were there? Or can you remember? Were you there at a?
Oh, I wasn't there too long ago.
Uh.
Cause I haven't been there probably .
Well, you know, yo, going over the hills, you know, coming into the valley?
Yeah.
You can see that horrible, horrible brown haze.
Well, we were there when they had a
