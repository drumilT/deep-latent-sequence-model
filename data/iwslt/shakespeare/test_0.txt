like, like, in the beginning
Sure, sure,
and then that happens a lot, the people that, how do I tell you, think they are better than the rest and don't take care of their clients
already, they don't receive the people like before.
yes,
they have the luxury sometimes of picking their clientele
yes you have to know how to be humble, in a word
exactly I mean like they say, go back to basics yes, if a situation if a system, made you succeed right in your business
well then that system must be used, well at least once a year, that means, go back to the basics, at least once a year.
And say well, my business is like faltering, well, I'm going to do what
aha
what I did at the beginning that gave me good results, I mean, there's nothing to lose. But, no, they don't want to because they feel, ah, how can I tell you.
humiliated
yes, yes there are people that have like too much ego.
mm exactly, because look, for example there's a, there's a person well this, that, got me for master of ceremony in the inauguration of a branch of his business
aha
then since I know the history of this person since his start I know that he started his business with five hundred dollars in the pocket
hello Vanesa's speaking from San Diego
Hello Leticia's speaking from Philadelphia
ah how are you?
hello
is cold over there, right?
yes very cold very very cold the truth is that today, is one of the coldest days this winter, well of autumn but
ah it's already snowing?
yes yes it already snowed last week
ah I lived near Philadelphia a long time ago in New Town Square very nice
ah really
yes I liked it a lot
ah yes the truth is that's is nice, is nice but they say that San Diego is very nice too
mm is beautiful and here is let's say for now at night in the sixties degrees and in the day it's wonderful and it's always
ah what envy how nice I really want to go to San Diego the truth is that it must be really nice, they say it has one of the most privileged climates
ah is incredible and especially the closer one lives to the beach, the cooler it is already when on is closer to the mountain
it's hotter but where I am is always wonderful
ah how nice
and so I would like to stay here, let's see if I can
why what do you do there in San Diego?
eh my husband is in the navy and in
In the, uh, in the navy, uh
Yeah, so when the contract ends we will probably have to move
Yeah, oh, that's a shame, i mean for the same reason you were here too
No, it's not that, i was here already when i was in college, before i finished college i was a nanny taking care of some children
Oh, oh, that's right, where are you from originally?, oh, from Puerto Rico
from Puerto Rico, are you from Spain or Argentina?
What's that?
and where are you from, Spain or Argentina?
From Argentina, the Argentinian accent is very different from the Spanish one
Well, maybe you know more about that than me, but i knew it had to be one of those
yeah, very different incidentally, but yeah, no, from Argentina
you don't have
Oh, yes, i was, i mean, i still hadn't taken the risk but Puerto Rico was one of the options
well, talking about technology, the computer is something i can barely live without, i do most of my work through the computer with virtual companies, that are people with which
i have never been in person, and i do all and they
Yeah, i mean, it's part of how you earn money, lets say, using the computer
Exactly
sure, but yeah, me too, partially, but aside from being a work tool, it's completely, i mean, i am completely dependent on it for my everyday life, right?
Oh yeah?
More than just for work, i mean, particularly since the internet, right?
yes
that is anything that I need to look for if I want to make a trip if I want to look for information on anything eh I go directly to the internet I mean no no
It doesn't occur to me to look somewhere other than the internet
no is true I basically do it too all my shopping for example Christmas shopping and all that I do it on the internet
and well that is that's like part of life already beyond what is work I get the impression
in the computer already passed from being just a work tool to being something well I communicate with my family through the computer
ah well yes true all the e-mail and all that
yes we even see each other through the video camera, we talk on the phone through the computer I mean is is like
ah wow
the most important element of the house for me
incredible yes I know
is incredible yes
and we, our computer got damaged and it's like one is all disoriented, you don't know what to do
yes yes the same happened to us we were some time without internet and we were super lost eh yes when you are far from your house you notice it even more right? because
eh the media is something that keeps you communicated with many people and well
yes I like it but it's also a shame because also at work in my full time job not the others I do in the computer also
we are so dependent of the computer that when we don't have computers practically we can't do the work because one already doesn't have the resources to do the things in
paper or in another way and it's a problem for the productivity also
yes yes I understand you yes that's also happened to me that is something that I mean the system is down, we all go home more or less
yes and
eh eh is incredible
yes and also it embarrasses me a lot because I have three kids
ah
fifteen and sixteen years old then they for example they have access to the internet in school sometimes, I get scared
sure, sure I do understand that when one has kids it must be different I don't have kids, I don't know but there's also a lot of information that sometimes is also dangerous right?
I mean is not only controlling what things they see also right? because there's everything on the internet
yes I don't know if you know what my space is
the what?
my space that is my space on the internet which is where one puts one's pictures and things you like to do
ah yes in the -messenger in the -hotmail is
no is a it's called I think that block a block of those that one goes and puts one's pictures anything you want then one later invites a
ah
to join this like let's say a pyramid but by the internet and one communicates like that
ah no I didn't know I really don't know what that site is
myspace dot com so then there a lot of teenagers
ah
pornographic pictures the girls are in clothes provocative poses then they put in what city they live what school they go to and me thinking
ah
anyone can be provoked by that and then it brings problems
yes no I don't understand yes yes yes that's true and it's also an issue with one's personal information yes the credit cards
all those things right? that sometimes one buys so many things by the internet and all and don't know up to what extent a person can take that information
that they use it in a bad way right? I mean there's a lot of fraud I figure through the internet also
oh yes of course
is something that you have to be careful but
but that with credit cards you have to be careful in the stores because they have stolen my identity and it's been people that when I go with my card in a
store then they get my number and start to make purchases and things
ah ah
but with the internet with that up to now I haven't had any problems thank God
no yes I mean me neither but the truth is that many people advise me to be careful that instead of putting the credit card to put there
pardon that instead of putting the debit one to put the credit one which is more controllable
that's true that's true
those things but for now I also haven't had any problems so
yes but
have you been living in the United States a long time?
since eighty five but I've returned to Puerto Rico for a few years in the nineties and yes since eighty five and you?
no me it's been seven months
ah don't tell me that directly from Argentina
ah what?
you came directly from Argentina
yes yes yes directly it's been seven months that we've been here because my husband is working in the university well now I'm also working but we came because he had found something and
and well so just arrived
ah, is it that he's a professor?
he's doing a post doc I mean he did a
ah
PhD in Argentina and here he came to do the post doc at the University of Pennsylvania
woo, in what, what topic?
so he's on the side of reproduction
ah
in teh so it's interesting he is, he is works with spermatozoids
oh how interesting
they always laugh that's why I laugh before when I say it
ah that's good well, are you thinking of staying or will you try?
and we'll see because our visa is for three years only so that is a bit it limits us but well we don't don't know all the same, we're just arriving
and and we don't know very well how everything works here either, no?
yes
but we'll see when we're closer to the three years maybe there we'll have to make a decision about about what we do
yes
but well now we're thinking it well what do I know the truth is that it's good it's a nice experience
if you like it compared with Argentina or is not the same, obviously
eh no it's very different but there are things that I like more and things that no that I miss a lot I mean the food I miss a lot
I can imagine
the food, i think that's one of the things i miss the most, but well, there are things that work better here, and well, there are more possibilities
That's true
People is different here too, i mean, the American is very different to the latino, right?
yes
And well, that, but well, you have to get used to it, get used to it, that you have to love them as they are, right?
Yes, yes, they're not so open and warm and as good people like we say in Puerto Rico, as the Latinos are
Sure, yes, yes, you can tell the difference a lot, and the truth is that's a shock,but, well, we're having a good time and it's a... i mean
I think it's a country where you can make a lot of progress, much more than on Latin American countries, right?
Oh, definitively
so, well, that's what brings you to live here
yes
that's it
definitively, and, is it easy with the english, are you having trouble or is everything fine?
And the english, i mean, i knew english, but coming here and listening to people is very different than the English i have studied my whole life, it's not
it's something different, i still have a hard time understanding some people, the pronunciation is the hardest for me, i mean i understand most of it, but there are some things that i can't understand yet
yes, yes, yes, a lot
i don't know, in Puerto Rico they usually have a very good English level, right, all the Puerto Ricans i know speak very good english
They teach it like that, they teach it plenty, like we are more or less from the United States, well, you grow up with the culture and watching television shows in English and
sure, sure, that is a big influence
Ingrid from Philadelphia, ah hi, how are you?
Aurelio from Washington DC very good Ingrid, how have you been, everything good?
yes everything very good
ah how nice I'm glad look and, which is the most important electrical device for you?
ah I think that it's the cellular, yes yes the cellular
the cellular right listen nowadays the cellular has become like I don't know like an indispensable thing
is an article of necessity
is an article of necessity but it's a staple, it's incredible right ten years ago almost nobody had cellulars, now everybody has a cellular
yes had none, there was none, there were no cellulars and they didn't need it
exactly
I mean how much time went by without needing it and now that we have them is like, as if we've had it all our life
exactly true, you're right, yes
yes yes eh um
what type, what type of cellular do you have?
eh, the telephone itself?
aha
ah listen I have a samsom with camera the one that opens up, yes and You?
ah those that open up, ah that well I have a samson also but is that one that has the computer included one of those that's called
pocket computer pocket pc
ah okay yes I've seen those, I like those
mm yes I have it because I really need it for work, I need a phone that I mean I need something where I can go on the Internet
also you understand me for work matters and that
sure ah yes
yes and to have the phone agenda, to also have the calendar you know that type of thing that nowadays are essential so
sure yes and that's another thing my my second electronic device would be the computer
ah of course
and then I imagine that with one of these phones like both things are included
exactly
and then it becomes much more indispensable
yes, exactly the computer is indispensable also, can you imagine nowadays to be or live without a computer
yes no like I couldn't, and I lived over there in Maryland
no sure aha
and then eh now I'm here in Philadelphia but then here I have my DSL, and my laptop when I go to Maryland is like, like after a day I already need to come back home because
because I don't have DSL and sometimes where I go is like like they only have dial up
ah imagine that
and then is so slow I mean is already like how the television was before, that one needs the
exactly true
that computer with the internet access
the fast access to the internet, by the way where in Maryland? because I live in Maryland
eh I lived in Silver Spring
ah imagine that you're very close to here I no
where?
I lived, I live towards mm towards the South towards Acopeach near Fort Washington
aha OK, OK
yes yes that is downwards that is downwards, you
and, how did you find out about this study?
about this study I found out through precissely speaking through the Internet
ah yes
eh I was looking for, I always look for things like that on the Internet
ahh
I found a site called Craig list
ah yes
and there I found and well I got in to see and I said listen theis sounds like interesting because I with I have eh two professions, I I have been a Spanish teacher
ah
graduated in Spanish literature
mm that's interesting
you are and that this study I I I liked it I say well let's get into it and see if to see what happens
ah what
and look until now everything very good I receive calls or I make calls and I speak with all sorts of people mhm
that's interesting, I by chance eh well I have to to make these calls all the same but what do you call it I am am in charge of this program in the University of Pennsylvania
ah really?
but then for reasons to check always that everything is running here in the platform, then I have to do my, also part then
ah you also have to do your, exactly your calls
eh and also at the same time eh I check where it's working eh eh the ads and and all that but but
ah
and I find it very interesting because I sometimes hear the conversations
aha
and and are very very interesting, I mean the people there are people that even become friends
ah imagine that
because like sometimes one gets sometimes the same person several times
aha
and then is like they already know each other and
ah
then after they even exchange phone numbers and
sure
I mean it makes eh
a connection so
exactly yes
yes you know that I- I was able to receive calls for a week because I was out of the country
ah
i was, uh, yeah, i had to go o Italy, and now that
Oh, that's good, for travel or for?
No, on work, because I'm an Opera singer, and so i had to go there to
Oh, really, oh, that's good
Yeah, i had to go there to give some concerts and that
Oh, that's intere-
anyway, talking about electrical devices you need
Uh huh
Well, the phone i brought there, i have Verizon, the company
Oh yeah
And that doesn't work internationally, do you know what i mean
It doesn't?
No, not the phone, this phone, how can i say it, the system from here doesn't work in Europe
Oh, but the Spring one does
I think Spring does and T-Mobile, i think it works and
Yeah, Spring's does work
Yes, but Verizon's doesn't, so, look, i was there
desperate
Well, yeah, a little desperate, because i needed to go on the internet, but this phone, i just bought it new like a week ago or two
Yes, right
on... or rather I bought it three days before leaving for Europe
yes
and then the computer, the side of the computer of the telephone
mhm
connects to the Internet also not only through the the telephone line but also
aha ah it has, it has wireless
exactly it has that wi-five
ah OK
so see I got connected over there in the hotels that have free service
yes
of of wi-five and look it was perfect
ah that's good
look and I was impressed talking of interfacto that like that one needs look at me
yes
this really was a marvel, a good investment
yes ah that's that's good
yes yes yes a good investment
that's good and what ah, so you teach Spanish over there in Maryland?
I used to, not anymore, I don't teach anymore eh I
eh no now you are only dedicated to opera
no I work in yes I have always been a singing teacher and I have always been a singer
ah
but you know sometimes you need more money those things and then
sure yes
you know you have to look for that what one needs well
exactly
at the end well I teach in a music school in Washington eh we have one very near Silver Spring by the way a site
mhm
in ahh in Strawthmore I don't know if you remember wher Strawthmore is.
estrat-yes there in Rockvill near White Flint
that's it, that's it yes it's called Vincle of Music
ah OK
there I teach singing lessons and all those kinds of things, everything good thank God I'm doing well there
ah that's good how interesting
yes yes eh and what else I don't know what else I can tell you
where are you from?
originally form Venezuela but I've been living in this country eleven years I have just turned in August
ah OK eleven, I have been ten, ten years living here, I'm from Guatemala
ah ah from Guatemala listen and eh mm
yes
oh, are you in charge of that research or are you directing it, how is it?
no, oh, I mean, we have lots of languages
aha
oh, oh, so, oh, what we do is that the linguistics department, we do some research in different languages and I'm in charge of Spanish, the Fisher Spanish
oh
I colle-, I collect information, I mean, practically about all of that, I mean, the study has already being designed so I take care of
finding people and supervising it so that everything goes on well, I have to transcribe the conversations
oh wow, it's a lot of work
yes, it's a lot but I like it, I'm happy, I like it
oh, that's nice, you are so happy Ingrid
really interesting
that's wonderful, that's good
so, you know, if you need anything you can find me in the Internet, in the website of the
yes yes mhm, well I did go to the website, several times
mhm
just to be sure that everything was legit
yes, yes, yes
and it worked fine because since my account was activated I don't know if you were the one that did it but that problem works
oh oh yes yes, the system, we always have some little problems but like I said, we are always checking if the platform is working fine
sure, m
and we always need more more people and
you will need?
you know, if you know here people who want to participate
you know I know a friend who, eh, we're, we're practically like siblings but she, she doesn't live here, she lives in New Hampshire, before I lived in New Hampshire
in some part of the United States and Canada
yes look, I called a person in Canada the other day
yes yes
I'll tell her to go to the website to enroll in the study
yes okay
she has, she has her degree in Spanish

and there's also for people that speak Chinese and Japanese and all those languages that
Aha, Carolina, from Los Angeles.
Hello, how is it going? I'm Mariano, from Philadelphia.
Hello, Mariano.  How are you? Mm.
I think I've talked with you.
yes, sure you have. We talked a while back. How have you been?
Ah, How are things?
very good, very good. And you? How are you, your post graduate?
No, fine, very cold here.
No, I can imagine. yes here is cold, and it's a tolerable cold. What will it leave? You, over there, must be
Look, by here, is
Well,
fourteen degrees below zero.
Ah, it can't be. Ah, no, no, no. I would die.
So imagine
No, no. Don't even say it, because I, there is true that I would've died frozen. I swear. Not me, I'm of warm weather, and, and, and
is a, well, if you could see me, I'm with a really exaggerated hat, and, and, and
No, yes, yes,
and is nothing. I mean, I'm talking about a completely normal temperature. Sure, a little bit low, but
But,
normal for the season.
but normal.
Oh, don't even say it, look, what are you now going to do, now that those dates are coming?
No, no, yes, the truth is that it had been in around minus four degrees and four degrees.
Oh, oh my God.
it was like that for some time but it's now colder, it's minus fourteen degrees, I was in my bike as I do everyday because I live close to it, five miles, sort of, from
Well, aha. Okay, okay
college and I take my bike, so, that, well
Oh.
I was in pain, my legs were hurting because of the cold weather.
Sure, sure.
It's too much, we are not used to that.
No,
So, I'm going to have to take the bus tomorrow because
To go to
it seems to me, right?
so that you keep yourself warm, well, it is cold in Argentina, isn't it?
In Argentina, it depends on the place.
Okay.
Argentina is pretty big, it's a big country,
That's correct.
For example, in the south, you have colds like these, or more
Ok, like over there in the Patagonia, right
In the part of, the Patagonia, lets say. Uh, in Buenos Aires, which is in the middle, it's warm
Ok, OK
It was, in the winter, it doesn't, it doesn't go below zero degrees, almost never
OK
And, in the north, it's hot, i mean, it's similar to Brazil in some
Oh, ok, OK
I, i mean that, we can choose
Exactly, but never something like this, right?, minus fourteen
No, no, no, at least not in Buenos Aires, on the south, yeah
Sure, sure, sure, but
In, in Usuaia, places like that
Oh, my god, but, and, and, well, you're gonna have to equip yourself, right?, like find some good sweaters, some
Yes, no, we, we have bought ourselves... well, we didn't have any clothes
Some things for, sure, sure, it isn't
It was, i don't know, the cold weather clothes in Argentina, wasn't good
Exactly, exactly, look, and what... what plans do you have for the holidays now?
Well, I'm actually going to California
Is it true?
really.l I'm moving to San Francisco.
Oh, that's good.
Lets say, not San Francisco, I'm going to San Francisco to visit but I'm going to Davis, it's there
that's good.
it's kind of close.
Oh, to the university?
Sure, two of my friends work there, so, we are, we are going there,
Oh, that's nice.
So, we are going to go visit. Where should I go?
Look, if you go there, to San Francisco, well, no, I believe that you are going to be in a pretty good location. Really, San Francisco is so beautiful, you can visit all of it, you can visit, the, the the,
the Fisher, what's the name? The, like the, the, where the fisherman work
Oh, the port, yes.
The, the, oh, the pier. What's the name? The port, like a port, that's right. It's well, the same, isn't it?
Oh, yes, like a port.
There are lots of theaters and I like the theaters, they are very bohemians and the people is bohemian too you know, they are artists. They also have the Alcatraz prison, the the Alcatraz prison, right?
Oh, it's pretty famous.
Oh no, there are lots of nice and interesting things to see. I think that basically, it's like a theater world, I believe that it's going to be, well, I don't know, I believe that if you like it, I think we once talked about the
fact that you like the independent theater, independent movies.
Exactly, yes yes.
Mhm, correct. So,
Yes
Well, yes, i think it's going to be very interesting, because you'll be there, how long?, a week?
Uh, yes, from, between, between Christmas and New Year, lets say, so, the whole week
Perfect, excellent
They have told me that Carmel, Monterey, it's very nice around there, right?
Carlmel, yeah, that's the most gorgeous, of course it is. Carmel, no, you're gonna love that, it really looks like, well
Oh
i was there for a summer, it's really different. I don't know how it is in the winter, but it's very beautiful, but it's like a ghost town, something like that.
Very curious. Monterey, Monterey is very nice. But, there's no better thing there in Monterey, i think, than Carmel
Sure
Yes, Monterey is like three, two streets, that's it
Sure, sure, sure
Uh, well, right?, or maybe i just visited a little. I can't lie either, but i visited very little. But, very nice, very nice because it has like a Spanish style
Uh, you know, everything from the colonial era, very, very, very nice
Sure
Uh, you're gonna love it
I'm gonna love it, rigt?
Yes, yes, uh, Carmel
And again, I'll have to go through Los Angeles
Oh, no, you have to come around here some day, so you can visit around here. Here it's, well, there are many, did you know there's a lot of live here too?, night life, and the theaters too, the
Sure. Yes, what didn't attract me so much of Los Angeles, as it happens with others when they are such big cities,
museums. Sure.
and, I like them, there, a little smaller, and I like nature a lot. Then,
Sure. Ah, no, sure. But you will love it, then. Here there are many nice places, what happens is that, sure, precisely because of how big it is, they are a little far, Right?
Sure.
But, there are some very beautiful places really. And, and especially, like places like that, eh, mm, like, Universal Studios, City Walk Cafe.
No, I'm dying for that. yes, yes, yes.
Aha, those types of places, right. Very, very pleasant. What a shame that, well, that, that, because I'm leaving tomorrow to Venezuela.
Ah, how nice.
if not, I would tell you, pass by here, well, I'll give you a small tour, but no, I'm leaving tomorrow, God willing. yes, I'm going to spend Christmas over there. Ah, I can't wait, yes, yes, yes.
how nice, you return with the whole family, Right?
I'm crazy, now I'm like crazy. Well, doing last minute shopping
I can imagine.
yes, yes.
You are alone, Right? Here, Or, or you have family?
No, I'm. yes, I'm here with my husband.
Ah, good.
But, he, now, he's now in Venezuela. He left first, now I'm leaving. Then, well, we are in that, in that process. Well, you know that we want to go back.
You don't say.
yes, we want to go back. Then, now we are doing all like seeing the, the possibility of, of, of already settling down there, so.
Sure.
yes.
And do you have chances, like that, to work?
Well, we're trying, precisely. That is what we're doing, that's why he left first.
Sure. yes, because to go back to our countries is hard.
Because, sometimes, I mean, And are you thinking of staying?
No. I intend to go back.
Ah. Sure.
In principle, I intend to go back. Eh, as long as I can have a job, in life
Sure. Sure. Sure.
more or less decent, No?
But, don't you believe, one thing, look, and I will tell you something, sometimes, sure, well, it's an experience that each one has, and, and I think that it's good to live it
E- sometimes the, the e- that economic responsibility, certainly you can find here. But, the, that emotional, that
yes.
sentimental, that you will not find here.
No, that,
And, if you are that kind of person, look, i- it will affect you.
that's true. That's true.
It will affect you very much.
yes.
It will affect you, i
They're very different, they're
They're very different, very different. And that's something i can't stand, i can't... it bothers me
yeah, it's the same to me
that they're so indifferent, yes, yes, that indifference, they saw you like they saw you today, they don't say hi, i don't understand how they can't say hi to a person they just saw, that
yes, yes, bt sure, right, and besides, i, i can tell that i was, uh, it's my eight or ninth month here in the United States and
almost all of my friends are foreigners
Sure
i mean, right?, and not, not necessarily, i mean, most of them are Latinos or Spaniards
right
or mexicans, or italians, or even french, or, or venezuelan, or Colombians
Right, right, oh yes?, oh, that's good
But, but, yeah, pleny, the truth is
Uh huh
Very varied, but, even so, uh, uh, uh, German guys, or, but not, not the americans, it's like they're stuck
emotionally, i say, there's something with them, because
Yes, yes
They have some, some, it's, i can't believe, understand that i get invited to a house from six to eight p.m., i mean
Oh, exactly
What?, that doesn't exist in Argentina
That, except in Venezuela, what's that?
But of course
Why would you limit yourself that way?, my god, let the thing flow, if, if you want to leave early, you leave, and if you want to stay because the thing is cool, you stay
But, logically, and no one is kicking anyone out
Exactly, look, i go to sleep, i lie down at seven thirty five, what's that?
Sure
That's a very strange thing, look, they see you, they're with you every day, they don't say hi, uh, no, it's a thing that, sometimes i feel sorry for them, because i say, wow
Poor guys, they really have it all, and they don't, they don't know how to enjoy it, everything is buying, buying, buying, and, and i don't know, uh, oh no, it's something that, really, i swear, look, i prefer to have less
Exact, exact
Have less and be happy
But totally, i completely agree
Yes, yes, of
I completely agree, and to, and, and, and it happens that, things are worthless here, right?, i mean, a gift has no, it 's priceless here because, i mean, it's priceless because
Uh huh
Everything's so easy that they, i watched the birthday of a
yes
niece of us that lives in Pittsburgh
OK
And so many gifts and so many things, and everything's so easy, they don't value it. I remember when
Exactly
when I was little, give, that they give me a gift was exciting.
Sure. You waited the whole year for that.
But here, not here, is like everything is so easy.
No, here yes, because, look here, is rather, the law of punishment, instead of the prize, for, for having done something good. I mean, here is that, aha, I'm going to take away the Nintendo, I'm going to take away, this, this, because is that they have everything.
yes, everything.
Then, How are they, how are they going to reward you? I mean, what they have to do is punish you, because, eh, the prize doesn't exist.
Sure.
I mean, you have to be a very well placed parent. and, and not have been born here, to start by there. Because, if you were born here, well, you have another culture, you are in the culture of consumption.
And, you are permanently, buying, buying, buying, buying. I mean,
Sure.
there's not a balance between things. Right? And I'm going to tell you, really, really, very pleasant, everything, suddenly here you have a lot of options, you have a lot of possibilities
but we are searching where we feel happy.
yes.
Where you in the morning, well, suddenly you have nothing to eat, and, no, man, look, God prepares. I don't know? Let's see what comes out of there.
Sure.
Or, or today you have a little, and you enjoy it, your neighbor comes, look, man, that here you have this, take this here, eat this little bit of this. I mean,
But, yes.
Oh, well, oh at least, that is now, what we feel that will make us feel completely happy.
And, that the people look in your eyes and you feel that sincere look, right,
Exactly.
They don't look at you with mean eyes.
Oh, yes. Or, or, if one bumps into you he says "I'm sorry"
yes, yes.

oh, I  oh, yes
aha aha
oh, well I had understood that basically one has to talk about the topic that they are given
no, ah, ah, According to what several people have told me whom I've spoken to that is not necessary but is to have something to talk about
oh,
where you have
Well
aha
Okay,
yes
oh right
but we can talk, we can talk about the technical things also
Which is the most important technical device for you in your life?
Well I don't know if you consider a car Because a car has a lot of technology
yes, well
and
It's very
And that for me is
it's very important
yes, aha
It's, In what place in Texas are you?
In the area of and Dallas
Oh Sure, sure, sure, sure
yes, daughter
So, sure, eh, eh The car is well for every area, but there are areas eh, areas in the that public transportation is better than others
We, well
But generally public transportation Is not good in any place
almost, here in the United States I don't know No, that, that
how is it in in Texas?
Ah, well we have the buses and eh, in train that goes from eh, from Dallas But just arriving there one has to have
Transportation for for where you want to go alrady, here
Eh,
And they, they
Exactly
if it's long distance it takes a long time, ah, ah Around the city
OK
but like in New York Like I think it would be better ah, go by ah, the bus Oh the, ah, the train
yes
Or the subway which they call Ah,
Well Talking of, of technical devices that are important that nobody can live without is the car is very important
yes, ah
the car is terribly important to transport us everywhere, What about speaking of other devices, Is there something eh, some technical device that you
use a lot in your house, for example, eh, what, what is the computer for you?
Well for
Is important
Is important at work, in the house I don't use it much, just for email and something like that but At work I do use it a lot
Ah, but there are some people that spend all their time on the computer and and I don't know, there are see, there are situations that that it is bad and others that it is good.
Like everything can be, like, aha
Exactly, exactly
in
Exactly, sure, I mean
the phone is very important also
what?
The phone
Oh
is very important
The phone is
yes,
is terribly important the phone is
yes
very, very, very, very important
yes
the interesting thing is that sure, for you the computer Eh, is not very important apparently, you don't use it for many things like other people, for example to
to pay your eh, your, your bills. There are people that use the computer to buy, to shop
yes
there are people that use it a lot, a lot for a lot of things Today I was talking with someone who says that, that the computer is, I was talking with this man
in another place and he said that his wife told him you have to choose, or the computer or me? I couldn't believe it because he says that
the computer, he's basically the whole day on the computer he
yes
works, this man does commerce
aha
and then he does his sales
yes
through the computer
aha
when he has to eh, eh Order merchandise he does it through the computer when he has to pay his bills he does it through the computer in other words that the computer
But they are all different, isn't it
I know that many people uses it to chat, in chat rooms
Exactly
and and there's lost of people that play games ah, that they can join with other people from any part of the world and, and
That's incredible
yes that's what
Ouch, ouch
ah, well my youngest son he Met his wife through the computer and that, yes,
Check that out! check that out, it's incredible
yes, mm
You are saying so yourself
yes
You youngest son met his wife through the computer
yes, ah, talking
look, incredible
aha, talking through a chat room and I have oh, look, he she I don't know how to say it in Spanish the step son
Ah, his step yeah step son
He
yes, yes, yes, I understand
my brother's he also also met his girlfriend that, and they will get married in March
It means that sometimes something good can come from the chat rooms
yes, well, sometimes, but, there are time that many situations don't, eh
Of course, you have to be careful as with everything else
yes, yes
But look, it's very interesting what you say about two members of your family
yes
meeting their partner, eh, talking with him, him, through the computer. Very interesting Of course that's the mo, first step
yes
And then people have to go out and get to know each other, of course, talk to each other. But it's very interesting, incredible how
yes
eh, eh, computers, eh, nowadays are being used for almost everything, for many things
there's almost, almost no area where you can't do anything with
Exactly, exactly
yes
Exactly. Do you use the computer a lot in your job, Yolanda?
ah, yes, because I'm an assistant ah, and I, I do a lot of research
Oh, I get it, sure, sure, then for research there's nothing better than the computer, it's incredible, incredible
yes, yes yes, a lot of information
It's incredible, sometimes I start thinking, like today I was talking to this man, how our lives have changed since we have computers
Like when we didn't have, no
In a big way, in a big way
A lot of things
yes
we nowadays do with the computers and
yes
sometimes I tell myself, how can it be that our lives have changed so much! We used to do a lot of things, the same things or even more things
aha
when we didn't have them and now we are oh. We are kind of getting addicted to computers.
yes, a lot, yes, yes, a lot, like I said, I know people that leaves work, they get home and they turn on the computer and use it until they go to sleep.
They do this everyday.
Oh, well that's a bit much
And that's a big problem, I think, oh, because they are not living a real life, they are living
No, exactly. No, no,
yes
You are so right about that. The computer is replacing people, other communication means that are also important, isn't it?
yes
Because
yes
yes, well, yes, it is a fast communication mean and and useful, you know, oh. It's a bit, oh
lonely, isn't it.
yes, I see, it was for me, aha
There's people, there's people but the world is totally apart
mhm
I'm not, you know, I don't agree with the electronic games
yes yes, there are a lot of them, no, no, I don't think it's right, mhm
No, I don't like them
yes
I don't really like them at all, I've watched them and I don't like them, I don't like them
oh, the kids spend, if you let them, they spend the whole day in the computer
yes
in the computer
James from New York
Oh
James from New York
yes, I'm from New York
Who's this?
José
Oh, José, how are you?
What's your name?
James
What?
James, my name is James
James, oh, OK
What's up Jose?, how are you?
fine, thank you
What part of New York do you live in?
Queens
Oh, Queens, very good
You live in New York
Uh, yes, i live in New York, almost at the last part of New York, uh, i think on the border with the Bronx
Ok, ok, OK
The last stop, the, lats stop, yes
West Chester, over there, OK
Well, what do you think of the subject?
Oh, technological devices, the e-mail is the device i most frequently use
Right, the computer
And that i also think it's important, because i work at a school and i study too
Oh
So, the device, the, the e-mail system, uh, helps me get mail from work, and also things like the professor that we also have classes of
Where the professor sends emails to us and we have to get into the university's system and
Right
To search for information inside that system
The device, the technological device you use the most is the computer, so to speak, that makes, makes your life easier
To me, yeah, exactly, it also makes communication between friends easier
Oh
Uh, that live very far apart, and i can chat with them
Yeah
uh, via a system like instant messenger
Right
Where i can communicate with them, i don't have to make a long distance call, i can talk to friends
Yes, yes, over the phone, from the phone to the internet, right
well, I use my phone to use my phone to connect to the internet
aha
that also if, if it wasn't for the phone it would be something else but eh that already they have eh eh wireless they have systems that if you already need eh
eh, yes a port you don't need a port it already has it
aha
you can already be in a place that has free internet
mm
and or if not in the same road already,
aha mm
it makes our life easier, as far as the technology right now it has advanced so much, for example the directions, I'm always in the car, the whole day in the car, the phone for me is a big advantage
mm mm
eh the faxes
mm, mm
the email like you say eh also that device of, I don't know how you can say it in Spanish but is the communication that is with
by the internet and the satellite receives, it receives your location and it guides you to the place where you want to go
ah ah yes, yes, yes like, like, what is that called? is like mapquest but is, is a program that you can with your, your
yes, it has a device
through the cellular or
aha
through a -PDA
aha, PVA then
oh, you can connect it and they will give you information on where you want to go
aha, exactly, there are some now that you place in the car and
mhm
through a satellite it guides you to where you want to go
mhm mhm, are you a taxi driver?
so, it tells you where to go, no, no, I'm not
oh
I work in the streets taking merchandise to several places
mhm okay
yeah so, a lot of times I've had to travel far and that makes it so much easier, it helps me get to places without having to look for the addresses and that's the most
mhm
and yes, technology makes our life easier.
mhm
technological artifacts are advanced
mhm mhm
no, we depend on them too
also
we depend on them every day more and the day in which we have no power, no Internet, no
I mhm mhm
we are not going to How do you say it? to tribulation, no we are going to be, really, really bad.
mm, mm, the only thing missing is that they turn us, that they turn us into robots
mm for example the day of the blackout here in New York, that there was no electricity, there was no phone, there was nothing.
mm mm
the elevators weren't working, almost all the technological devices operate with electricity, and there was nothing then the
mm
the um the the
it got complicated
it got complicated, the matter got complicated there
mm mm
mm ah even the bridge that that well I didn't hear of any deaths but that everybody
no but we are so dependent of it that we forget how and how much we use
ah
we depend - depend on the technology
yes, and that and exactly then we have no other way out because
mm
like you say the internet as far as the classes and all that
mm,mm
there's no other there's no other unless you meet with the teacher and he can give you information
mm well that ah, up to now on the part of the computer you can take classes on the internet and you don't have to go to class
aha, also
you don't have, no there's a little of an advantage and a little of disadvantage also of the advantages of, of the internet is that
also everything is getting so modernized
yes
that we are also losing a little bit of contact which is essential and necessary
aha, exactly
to to be more effective also
yes
you notice that you call a credit card to talk with a person to help you with a problem that you have with that credit card
the most unpleasant and the most annoying is having a computer talk to you
and, and wait also
when you need a direct help and, and
a person
a direct person and a person who in reality understands the situation and that you can manage with that person to help you and to correct that problem.
because a computer when I press one and two and three will not solve the problem, sometimes it directs me to the person
that knows the most about that case, but well many many times eh sometimes is, is very confusing and
yes I understand because I've gone through that - through there
and the only thing it does is that it makes you madder and
mm
and you don't get to resolve the problem I went through that recently
There, yeah, uh, when, what you're saying is that you get mad when the, technology only does... like makes the world smaller with it
after, after instantly communicating a person that's distant, you can get pictures from that person at once, in your camera, in your
uh, in your phone, on the computer, uh, you can get information about, i don't know, inventory of merchandise,  i sell through the internet up to Japan
uh, i have sent merchandise to Brazil
wow
that's only take a picture to the merchandise, measure it, have the contact and the person sends you the money through the internet too
Uh huh
And then i go to FedEx express on the internet, to sign... the website
Uh huh
I pick the tracking, a tracking number and send it to her, knowing that track number will get to the box she's going to get
Uh huh
And if this box doesn't arrive the day it was supposed to get there, i take this number and search for it on the computer and it tells you exactly where it is
Uh huh
standing, the package, you know, so, the world gets smaller, the technology
uh huh
makes our life easier and the moment when
uh huh
that the thin doesn't work like we expect, we get mad because really
uh
depend, we become very dependent on it
hmm
but it is something that sincerely, there is not, you cannot escape, you cannot escape because
hmm well  and because of that am, by, from television and radio the internet we are also well informed sometimes of things
yes, yes, yes
eh sometimes very, very informed but it is good to know eh what is happening, it can be a
the world
a catastrophe, a natural one I know that this time eh, foreseeing in advance for one to take, to take precautions.
aha
by the technology, television, radio, whatever it is something positive too
yes, yes, yes, so I cannot have a bad opinion of technology it is something that if we had it it would affect the sixth sense for example
eh, it is said that cell phones are harmful that the radioactivity, the radiation you have to take care of your body
hmm
it is something that is  inevitable, it cannot, like, how can you avoid it if you must have it in your pocket. Do you understand me?
hmm
oh it is in the pocket of your pant or in the pocket of you shirt or in the jacket but it will always be with you, then, how could you avoid it.
hmm
and I see as an example
hmm
really, the easy pass right now too
hmm yes technology
technology before was the line to wait and to
and pay everything in cash
the toll in cash, exactly
throw the - have change
aha, the bother of having change, exactly
to be able to throw- mm, mm
before the, they did it faster, to have change to throw in a basket
mm
a, a bucket, a, I don't know how you say bucket
mm, mm
then you would put the change there and the machine would read it and it
mm and you had to, hello
and you had to have the exact change
yes exactly
not now, the monthly easy pass
mm
collects the money that you have used and it refills it again
is aha
and and that already, that, How can you escape it? if it really makes our life easier, you can't, you can't
yes is a little also if you look at it right how the technology is it has two sides right like two sides of the coin and the other side of that is that
the technology has changed like the metrocard or the system of getting on the, in, in
aha
on the buses in the public trains eh then now you lose the worker, the job
aha, yes, yes, yes
because by having the computer accessible how they've done here in, in, in New Yo-
no
Tamara
yes, Tamara what's going on? My name is Eliana, How are you, good?
Good, you?
Fine, everything fine. Well, the day's topic is marriage. What do you think of interracial marriage?
I agree with the interracial marriages, you?
Eh, yes, yes, the truth is that for me, the topic of race on one hand I know that is hard, eh mm
because, of the cultures, more than anything, right? Because of the things that can come up between the two people, but I don't think that is bad that there are interracial marriages
Look, me, my mom always told me that, eh, is quite hard for one be getting along well with a partner - a person that is not eh
of your same eh mm, social background so to speak, right?
Sure, I honestly still don't know, because I'm not married, but well, many, for example, I also know on the part of my parents
that, eh, they separated, let's say we are Jewish, us, and my parents separated and they remarried Jewish people and they always say that they feel like
eh, in family. right? in that way, but to me
well I'm, I'm married and I'm Jewish but my husband is not Jewish, so I'm, more or less, we get along quite well and we respect each other
Sure, but are you both Hispanics?
Eh, we both are, yes, we are both Argentinians and we met in another country, but
Both?
we get along quite well, in our great
Sure, well but Sure, that's why, then, the religion is another topic to talk about, but the topic of the race for me is super important, if you are Hispanic
Well, that's what I like about here, eh, the United States, in Europe there are many countries that one sees that there are, are interracial couples, and the truth is that I think that's good, I don't know how they get along, because I don't know
ah, no, today, I have one that is black eh, black color and the, her husband is Irish, and they get along fabulously.
Sure, yes, that's why, you'd have to see, for example, i, I'm single here in the United States, i always feel, yes, closer to people
uh, Latin people, right?, with whom i can speak spanish, maybe because my English is not good, so everytime, if they want to introduce me to someone that speaks spanish, i feel i can
can reach better, i can talk more, uh, about other subjects, about deeper subjects, and have a better
uh
relationship in the future, i really don't understand how two people with different languages can get along fine, with different culture
Yes
during their lifetimes, i don't, i don't imagine myself at, at that, at that point
Well, but, uh, it's not, it's not always, it can be, lets say, by being interracial it can be the same culture, right?, i imagine that two people that were born
in the United States, one of color and the other not, but were raised, both in the same country, or even in the same city
Sure, that's true, that's true, that's it, you have to differentiate culture, religion and race
And, and for the kids, yes, and for the kids, the children of that couple, i think they'll be pretty tolerant, which is good
for, lets say for the world, right?
Sure, yes, that's true
Because
Yes, that's true
Uh huh
To me, yeah, that, you're right, that's, that's good
Yes, but for example you
And more than anything if we're talking about a person of color, or a white one, that's really good, right?, that's gonna happen and
Yes, but what do you think of that, would you fall in love with a person of color?
yes, I think so, but I think I could fall in love with a colored person as long as he is from my own culture, eh, with who I can share even the same language, that's what I was
yes
I see it limits me,
And the people you go with, do you think you will ever find someone like that
oriental or, eh, colored, let's say
The thing is that in my country they are, I am Argentinean also, but in Argentina or in, what you call it? eh there are bot many Asians
who speak a perfect Spanish and have a Hispanic culture, that's the thing
Mhm, yes
yes, maybe, yes, mhm, it could be, probably
Mhm
and also another aspect is that, I don't know, I don't like Asians in a physical sense, for instance, but I may like one sometime
yes
so I won't say, no, no way, no way, on the contrary, I like and respect a lot the couples who are of i-, the interracial couples, let's say
yes. No, I also find them quite, I mean, I like them, I like them quite a lot that couple, but  I don't know either how they met or which are their
eh, the circumstances how, how they meet each other, because for instance, I think that the orientals are quite reserved, but yet, at least here in Brooklyn where I live, you can see many couples
of oriental women and American men, mm, I just can't figure where they met, right?
No, but here, eh, mm, in the United States there is mo-, everything is so cosmopolitan
yes
and, right? Let's say
yes, no, it's not where they met, but if they are open to such relations, you know what I mean?
Sure, yes, is true, in that sense is true yes, is good. And you think that for example
yes.
in that case, let's say, the marriages have do you think that an interracial marriage has more or less divorces?
Look, the truth is that at this stage of life where everyone gets divorces, I don't think that, an interracial marriage gets more divorced than others
eh of the same race I don't think so
Sure.
On the contrary, I think that in that case they will be
Sure
more interesting and yes, perhaps they have more arguments because eh of, I mean, of political things or that happens in reality and that one agrees and the other doesn't but
but I don't think that influences more than anything in the divorce.
Sure, and you that, that got married with a person that speaking right? of religion now
yes
that is not Jewish, did you have problems in your family?
yes. And, yes, honestly yes, there are, are
Ah, really?
And yes, yes, at the beginning, they didn't like him at all but well since I never went out with a person of, the same religion as me eh so to speak, is not that I changed
from a Jewish boyfriend to a non-Jewish boyfriend, I never had a Jewish boyfriend eh, so that, let's say, they were already used to that, only this time it was serious and
and well, and I got married but yes, he, he also was a little complicated when
Sure.
eh, when we got married, how the ceremony was going to be and that
Ah, and how did they do it?
And no, at last we got married without, by civil, that is a non religious marriage eh, and I think that in the future the problem could be the children but
but by religion, my children must be Jews, so, because women are the ones who give the but I don´t know, with, with people of color is different, because well, genes are those that pass , there is not
Of course, but if for example your son decides to be catholic and go to church
It is going to, the truth it is going to bother me, but I think I could not tell him not to do it
Of course.
but if, he learns something about the church it is going to be, hmm, eh, I don´t know, from the, from the friends
The school,from his friends
yes because we don´t, we never celebrate Catholic things in fact we celebrate more Jews things that Catholic ones
Of course, you see it.
but well I don´t know, I think that with people, color people and interracial marriages the issue is different, because the, the children don´t have to choose one or another religion
it is than, they born with a color or slanted eyes but they accept the way it comes, the hands, it is not a matter of choosing
Of course, you should distinguish between what is different, lets say you are from the same, for example that you two were born in the same city
yes.
and move in the same place and that you two are from different race, it looks to me not so terrible like eh, a person coming from
Africa and
Hmm.
right? and have a whole African culture and
yes, that is what, I thought that, so my mother told me, she told me because so, you can meet with people and say well it is, is from the same, from my religion but
eh, but maybe we don´t have a thing in common, right? you grew up eh, in a big city the other one in the middle of the jungle, there are not many things to see
let's say if, if today I, I would go to the jungle, to work there, perhaps
Sure.
it would be much nicer finding a person that lives there and that, to know his experiences of the place there, perhaps also, I will fall in love with that person, but not
eh is like living in a city one, I don't know if, if you can find and, and have many things in common with
with those people, right?
Sure, sure, sure.
But well, if they are in the same city, is, is already different.
Sure, I think the same, what happens is that in the place where of Argentina there aren't that many racial problems that I know of, they are rather more economic, then
yes, yes.
When, right? when one talks that if there's a problem or not on racial level, eh, I can't find the problem
Sure.
But I never saw them, saw a racial problem, yes perhaps a problem of religion or social economic.
yes, and have you traveled a lot around the world?
yes, yes, I traveled let's say, by Central America
Mm.
South America, and I was also in Thailand, in Asia let's say
And in Central America, eh also? Because in Central American there are also people of color.
No, well, in Central America that I was in Costa Rica, I did feel there were racial problems
Ah, really? The people of color don't mix so to speak with the, the white ones?
yes, No, because the same the color ones are more than anything in the Caribbean and the rest are in the Pacific.
Oh.
And you can see it in the map and see that the routes in the Caribbean are, they are destroyed if they don't get fixed and the Pacific zones are amazing.
Mm put they can get you straight to, lets say, or they work for tourism.
and they were yes no, what happened is that there used to be a port where all the slaves would arrive to
Aha.
so, they stayed there and and since they were slaves, that's what, that's what I learned about Costa Rica.
Mhm.
Oh but those are black people but they are kind of angry with the world, isn't it? they are angry at the white people.
yes.
so, when the whites think that the others, I don't know, and the blacks are angry at the whites, that's when the racial problems begin,  I think.
yes.
For example, I was in a taxi in Costa Ric and I asked the driver how the Caribbean was since I hadn't been there yet and he told me, oh there are lots of blacks over there.
And what color was he?
and and he was, Hispanic
Sure.
he wasn't white, he was Hispanic.
Mhm.
and well I was surprised because I had never in my whole life heard something so negative towards black people
and you listen to it in the television, all of that, but since there are almost no blacks in Argentina.
Sure.
To me, to me, it surprised me a lot, no, that it was like
Aha, good afternoon, is Carolina, from Los Angeles
Ah, good afternoon. My name is Blanca, from Arizona
Oh, Blanca, How are you?
Fine.
Ah, I'm glad.
Here,
What a topic, aha, this topic. Hot topic, certainly. Right?
ah, yes. yes
Are you married with some person of, of another natio-?
Of another nationality, not of another race.
Exactly, exactly, is, is what I, I also disagree with that term, that sounds like, like a horse, like a dog. That of race, well, especially. Right? I no, no, no,
Okay, is that, in my point of view, there's only one race which is the human being, there are several types of, of
exactly.
several types or forms of that race. But, no, there aren't many races, there's only one, the human race.
Exactly, exactly, I always, every time they say, no, but what race are you? And I, no, I'm not a dog nor a horse. I mean,
Yes.
is What nationality are you, from what part, from what other? because that of a white race, black race, that bothers me tremendously, and especially here.
Here I feel that there's like a problem, problem of colors,
It has always existed, I also think. Not only of colors, but of, of nationalities.
that, yes, yes, yes, correct, correct. Where are you from?
I'm from Colombia.
Aha, I was almost, almost, it seems to me
And you from Venezuela Right?
yes, exactly. the same.
Ah, no, that accent, I don't know. It doesn't change.
yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, look that, precisely, always when we talk about the topic, I know, I say, look, my family, on my dad's side are black.
no? I hadn't noticed
Hm.
that my family was black until I arrived here. When I started hearing that mess that is black, that African American, that I don't know what, then I would say, well, I'm African Venezuelan then, because,
my mom is white, white, white, and my father is dark skinned, well, but my grandmother is black.
yes.
Then, I would say, But what is this? I mean, I swear that I started to think about that now being here. In the little time that I've been here. And I say, wow, really,
sincerely, I had never detailed that. What's more, I always had, had more of a tendency towards my dad's family,
Hm
and I have cousins of all colors. Because, my uncles that are black, have gotten married to white women, and vice versa also,
Okay.
I mean that is not that a racial problem exist in Venezuela, so to speak, our problem is of classes, there.
yes, is like, is like in Colombia.
If you are rich, exactly.
Is exactly the same story. In Colombia, in Colombia it doesn't exist, eh, that issue of race is also not so  marked. Rather is more by groups, or by social classes. Right?
Right, right. That if you're rich, I mean if you're doing all right, or you're poor, well, definitely.
Yea.
So, e- people are more, we, look, I've got Asian friends, I have Italian friends, or children of Italians, better said, children of Arabs, and for me, they're Venezuelan. I don't see them as foreigners, not at all, on the contrary. And you talk with them,
and s- and the, above all the parents who weren't born in Venezuela, but they've been living there for more than fifty years. They feel more Venezuelan than even I do.
I'm telling you, they really love Venezuela, they speak very well of Venezue- it's more, and you all to, because
To Venezuela.
casually, I've got a friend who's Colombian, and she's Korean,
yea.
Can you imagine? She's Asian,
Colombian and Korean.
uh huh, so, you see her
Well, my children are according to the accounts, in keeping with the subject, they're Guatemalan and Colombian. With, with, with American customs, because they were born here. So, there there's
Ah.
three nationalities mixed together. But, they're not different from everyone else.
Ah, ah, ah. Right, right.
That's, that's absurd, well, the one,
Right, and de- and it really depends on you as a mother, or your husband, I mean, to instill that in them from children. Because, here, I'll tell you, it's a challenge to raise children.
ah, yea. Mm.
E- it's pretty tough, really, pretty tough, and above all because, because of the, how people here live their lives. It's something really different from our lives, no-
we can have problems of another kind, economic problems, all of a sudden,
Socials.
socials, that this, but, but this one, this so serious social problem that I see here, the indifference, the, the low How do I explain it to you? the low respect, for example from kids to adults. So, it is like,
Yeah.
listen, I, I remember that when we were young, see, no, mister, look, excuse me, so, say good night, greet, say bye,
Oh, no. My husband´s daughter is like that, and she is going to be twenty.
here
Oh, I can tell you, what a way, what a way to raise that girl, I don´t want to raise my kids like that
Of course.
It is, they don´t have any obligation with, their elders, is a total disrespect. No, is not like when you went out by car, you came home,
and if an old lady, the grandmother or the aunt were standing, you gave them the sit.
imagine that.
I think it is not a matter of, for example,those who have children grow them this or that way, is not a matter of race, is a matter of
like each couple do
Exactly.
their, their own raise, their own upbringing
Exactly. Exactly, because that does not have, is more, I, I, I have always make him that question, and I have American friends, and I ask them, they tell me, look, it is really part of our culture, it is not that we all are like that, like everything, right?
Hmm.
but, the majority, is like an indifference, like,
Yeah.
eh, so selfish so, but it is a so big, that, that, that practically they isolate themselves, is like
yes, totally.
yes they live in their own world, and I say, my God, what, what a big thing, really not, see, we think of coming back, God let us to do it soon, I think in one or two years, I do not want to spend more time.
Because, honestly, it is eh, I don´t know, I, okay, I adapt very all, I am a person
When Chavez leave from there, that is another issue.
What?
That when Chavez leave there, that is another issue.
Ah, see that not, see that not, I am totally in favor of him. yes, totally, totally, the truth is that what happens is that the image given to him is very
strong, it is an image
No, the one that he shows, the one that he shows
the one that he, the one that he shows, well, what happens is that, do you know what they do? is that they focus in him only that part. Then, how, then, the image that, they project on him is, is , is not the most appropriated. Then, all, we always fall into that topic, it is an unavoidable topic. Right?
Hmm. yes.
But, I am totally in favor, I am, so, a hundred percent agree with his policies, his strategy, and precisely, one of the things we want to do is to incorporate to that, because
we believe in that project, and
Aha.
and the true, I say, damn, I have only six years here,
yes.
and I am going to say, I lived all the process, and I have lived, an I have years over me, and, and I live the part of the, democracy of the parties, hmm
so, the politicians of the moment. And sincerely, it was too much. It is a very particular situation, sincerely. No, it does not looks like any other. It is a situation very, very particular
yes.
And when that man arrived, we thought, my God, at last someone who can stop so much, so much insolence, so much corruption, it was so much. But, so much. Then, precisely, so much people tel, us. But are you crazy, right now? Well, it is that many people doesn´t know. Right?
And they have an image of him, the one that he projects in the media that is evident, they are against him, so,
Sure
it's really complicated and difficult, also, I know one couple from Bogota
Mhm.
that well, it's a really nice couple and I really love them and when I was at their home a man from Bogota came to visit them and oh, he was their friend and he told me,
What's your opinion about that crazy President of yours? And oh my God, and I, what, oh, I was like, excuse me sir but
Aha.
he's not crazy to me, and he was like, I'm sorry, I didn't want to say that, it's just that, the man apologized to me but I told him, I would never talk that way about President Uribe but
I see.
sure, I know that everyone thinks he's crazy but, that's the image that they've projected of him
But, and and he has showed it too, because, that's what he, what he
he shows, he is real, he doesn't hide it
Sure, sure, sure. But the thing is that
he doesn't, he's like that, he's open and careless when he speaks and says things
exactly, exactly, he has no, he's not a demagog he doesn't, he's not a diplomat, he's not
Aha.
like that, and that angers people, it angers them because they are not used to that, so, the journalists try to hurt him but he answers, no? In the beginning I would say oh God, but
I didn't understand him either but then I started to realize the truth and I visit Venezuela often, by the way, I'm leaving tonight
Oh, that's great.
yes, and,
I would give anything to go visit Colombia right now.
ah, yes, I can imagine, really.
A year ago I spent a wonderful Christmas over there.
Ah, how exciting.
And I came back two months ago, so I can't go back now.
Ah, how nice, sure, sure.
It's too high up.
Cla-
And, money only goes so far.
Sure, sure, is true.
Look, okay, we started talking about interracial problems, and we're already on political problems. Ah? no, no,no.
Like good, like good Latin talkers
Well, one starts, and beats around the bush, until you get to the point.
yes, yes, is true
One goes up, and goes up, and goes up, and beats around the bush constantly.
yes, is true, yes is true. Well, my husband is Venezuelan, and with all and all, the same, sometimes we have our, that well, but we try to, you know, to find a better way, sometimes,
well, we get upset, I don't know? for anything. And, well, we try to find, right? the solution. right? Sometimes I tell you that,
You told me you lived in North Carolina?
no, I'm in Los Angeles.
Ah, in Los Angeles
In Los Angeles. You're in Arizona. Right?
yes. How is going, to, to, returning to revive the issue, how has it gone with all that over with the part
ok-
sire, that, that Los Angeles and Arizona are the same, they are cities where there are a lot of Hispanics, but I don't know how it's gone with that part.
yes.
eh, of, of, of, the racial aspect
Well, look here, precisely, that drives a lot around here. I think that it's a question of, social regression, eh, social, that there is, in the United States, in general
But, here, even though Los Angeles is a city that really, that has a lot of difference
Hi, I'm Olga, who are you?
Uh, my name is Blanca
Blanca, where are you from Blanca?
From Arizona
Arizona, well, I'm in Texas
Oh, very well, good
Hey, what do you think, what do you think about today's subject?, do you find it interesting?
I find it very interesting, it's just that, uh, that term is, to me, like it was picked from a long time ago, right?, because i think there aren't, uh
uh, they don't exist, it's, it's just one gender, the human gender
That's right
Um, there are several groups of that human gender, but, but the race is really, it's like, it's like someone else said, it sounds like, where's the cattle, where are the little animals?
Yes, i agree with you. That's right, are you married?
Although, yeah, I'm married and precisely
yes
With, with a person from another country
Right
I'm Colombian and my husband is Guatemalan
OK
But, but, we're latinos, and both of us are, uh, human beings
Right, right
Not the color, nor the style of, of your, your eyes, of your physical features, makes you look like another race. You are a human being.
eh, with, with different characteristics. I think.
That's it. yes, yes, yes you're right, I totally agree with you. Well for example.
um
Says that yes, that it's harder to live with another, with one race than another.
yes
Well like, well like you were saying, is that it also depends on, on the couple, because it also depends on both people. how much or how badly they want it.
want the marriage.
Exactly, I was reading a book last night.
right
About raising the kids.
mm
And is that the problem of raising the kids, is not made by society in itself. there are many factors that influence it, but basically the essence is in the couple
In how much they want to give their kids a good life.
sure
yes, like they say they belong to another race, the husband and the wife, well if they want to get ahead in life with their, family, with their home they will get ahead.
sure
Independently of what exist or not.
yes, yes, because the, the education, definitely, like our grandmothers used to say, the education is bred.
Exactly, yes.
Right.  So- So education starts at home in fact,
aha
yes it's, it's a really solid education.  yes, it's pretty strong.  Well, the exterior didn't affect them much, these kids, because their education was very,
very solid.  So, the fact that there are so many kids, on drugs and these things well, maybe it's due to negligence on the part of the parents,
or maybe they're teaching at home wasn't very solid, then.
Very solid, yes.
aha, exactly.
This is true, I think the same.
yes
Definitely.
yes
I think the same thing.
yes, including if you want, a, a good marriage, if you want to raise it well, you as an intelligent person, well you know how, right.
hmm
I, I think that, that, in the, in the couple.  Well, there must always be an agreement.  There must, like, I think that the relationship of a couple.
Is, is shows through its agreements.  The, the problems start when one of the two breaks the agreement.
yes
You know?
yes
So that's where, where the problems start, eh, in the couple and obviously start, start to involve the kids no, imagine.  with a couple with problems, imagine the poor kids, all traumatized.
Yes, there, it's true, that's where all the problems start, and, and many times the ones who pay the, the duck are the kids
Right
Any way, uh, no, it's not ingenuity, because i know many couples that have separated, and have had problems
Uh huh
but they have had very nice homes
Uh huh, yes, that's why, that's why I'm telling you, because
Uh
They used their intelligence in the right way, Do i make myself clear?
Exactly, yes
Because, because it's not so much that we're smart, i mean, but lets see how, it's, how we're using our intelligence
That, yeah, no, it's not so much that we're smart, or that we're white, black, blue or purple
Exactly
IT's the way we, we get a grasp on things, the way in which we  approach or life, at home, our family, our children
That's it, right
It's the, um, it's the love that each of us bring and the effort we put into
yes, yes
everything, everything
Yeah, sure, uh, well, uh, first of all, there's, love, right?, that feeling so, well, so incredible, it moves mountains
Uh huh
Right, and on the other hand, well, the responsibility, i mean, being responsible, and, well, give every thing it's name [place]
Right
Because, well, because many times human beings, for, to do things easier for ourselves, like we kinda disguise situations a little bit
Right
So, no, we're not quite seeing, uh, a hundred percent the point we should
Right
And well, that's also a problem, a terrible problem, because we're not, we're not giving it, paying the necessary interest to certain situations
Yes
That's right
That's true
That you think, yes, I'm sorry, what do you think it's the most important thing to get along?
Uh, trust, definitely, and dialogue
Yes
If there's no trust and dialogue, there's nothing. And with someone with whom you don't talk, you don't know, what are its thoughts, it's wishes and needs
What they think about one situation or the other
True
I don't know, that's what i think
You see, yeah, your... is very accurate, to, lets say, your way of thinking, and i totally agree with you, yeah, it's true, because one things leads to another
To another, yes
Well, because yeah, i, i can be talking a lot with my partner, but, if my partner doesn't trust me, or listens to me, i can assure it's not listening because
well, since it doesn't trust me, well, it's obviously not believing what I'm saying
mm.
So then, the, anyway, ah, from the other side it's the same, I mean, if the husband is, or the couple, let's say, is, trying to give a, to get to know something.
Well, good or not, well, not anymore, not hearing, because well, I don't have confidence, in how I'm going to, how I'm going to take his words seriously.
So then it's true, if it's true, one, one thing leads to another, the, the, let's say the
yes, that's true.
confidence brings dialogue.
mm.
and obviously the dialogue, well, the dialogue generates confidence. So then it's, it's well, it is very interesting, and also, well you need to see how, they say things, you see, because at times
At times we make many errors in meaning in that, at times we don't say things in an adequate format because many times it doesn't matter as much what you say but how you say it.
uh-huh
And so then, there are also, well, many
yes
many undoings, many complications after, then well
yes
It's not easy, since then, it's not easy this, to live with, with someone truly well, I say, obviously well, one not, one doesn't expect, as human beings well, we don't expect to be
eternally happy, of course, because there will be difficult situations and there are going to be problems, but also, the, eh, we need to use our intelligence to resolve these problems in some way,
successfully.
yes, that's true, there is, there is
That's what I believe.
You need to have a little bit of skill and intelligence and of, of malice, as we say in my country, native malice. When one does things and says them and the way in which they say them.
Because it is true, the way you face a matter, the way you answer, you express, even your gestures mean a lot
O yes, absolutely, absolutely, body language has a lot to do. For instance, if you tell a,  if a kid
tells his mother, or, if the mother shows a martyr face, then the son tells her, mom are you sad?
And she says, nodding, no son I am not sad. Her mouth says she is not sad, but her expression, her body language,
is showing that, yes exactly
Says she is
Indicates absolutely the opposite. And all those, ah, contradictory situations are what often traumatizes the children, it confuses them, because
Because they say, well, what's going on? Beacsue obviously the kid feels that his mother is sad, then why does she say she isn't sad when she is
So, there is where confusions start in a child's mind, and that's why there are so many problems with kids
yes
That's it
That is a part of the reality. Anyway, eh, we are out of the subject again. Right now, right now I was talking to another woman, I may be going out of the subject again
yes
the subject, we started talking about politics
Oh
Oh my goodness
Well, not, you see, there is no one hundred percent need to talk about the specified subject. But, well, it is interesting anyway
eh, to stick to it, to stick to it slightly. Because they are daily life subjects, aren't they?
yes, yes, they are subjects that help, they help anyway, they help quite a lot
Yes, because they are subjects that are always current, they never, they never get out of date because, well, for inatance couples will always need
And you see, we, I think you are from Mexico, right?
yes, I'm from Mexico.
Oh, we are from different countries.
yes
And we use, we use different words but, we are on the same line.
That's right, that's what I was saying, no no, there's no difference in the way we wanting and doing things
We all want to have a successful marriage but we here have
Hello?
Hello, yes. who's speaking?
yes. Manuel's speaking from Orlando, Florida, who's speaking?
Okay, I'm Olga, I'm in Texas.
Ah, how is it going Olga?
How are you?
Fine, thanks.
How nice.
Well, so look, eh, we already heard the topic of the day, so eh
yes,
if you want then start telling me what you think
yes, well, that well, I think I think that in reality no no, there's not reason to think that the interracial exist, right? or something like that.
I, I would say that, that
yes.
the different races if, if they get together, well I think that there's no problem because the basic thing is the love, so
is precisely, what will unite them. And that's how the, yes
So
each one is from a different race, well, so then as adults as responsible people as intelligent people well they will already work on their
on, on their partner to achieve the, the proper success. Don't you think?
Correct, well look I agree with you
Hmm.
and it seems to be that if a partner of a different race, well, eh, the two eh, match, and love each other and match and will
create a home and some kids together well this racial factor isn't so decisive, what counts are the values that they want to pass on.
Exact-
And, in fact, for example we, the Hispanics, in its majority, I myself, for example we're interracial, I have, eh, well a white component from the
Europeans, the Spanish component, indigenous from the natives too
yes.
from the blacks who came from that part of the world.
yes.
You know that we too, the Latinos, are interracial.
It's like this.
So I don't see, eh, this factor, this race factor, any problem, always and when they put their part and are consistent in what they're doing, that seems to me, really, a problem
that yeah, it's not racial, but it's cultural, for example, it's the religious factor, this can be a problem
Aha.
and, if they both practice different religions.
Yes.  Hmmm, yes.  so I, I well I also agree with you, I see more problems in this situation with the religions
than in the racial situation, yes
Correct.
yes, it's like this.  And besides, imagine, it's not, it's not as you imagine, and you imagine the kids get close to, eh
this religion
is this much, is not this much you imagine, and you imagine
I would say that there is like that you generate a, how would I say it? a ah
Well, contradictions, no, and
confusion, a confusion yes, is a contradiction and confusion with the kids
yes, yes.
that the kids get really confused because no, no
Of
they don't know
yes.
they don't know what to do.
Exactly, and although is not the topic of the day well that, we can't talk too much at length about that of religion but
Mm.
I've known of cases, I think that you too, of families that
Sure, yes.
that have been torn apart and almost destroyed because they start to practice different religions.
Ah, yes, like that yes, yes, the other day that it was precisely the topic was precisely that, the religion they were asking me that
Ah, I didn't get to that day
no, they were asking if religion ah, that if religions unite or separate, I would say it separates
many times, when it should but not, not always.
for well yes, well look that, that ah I, normally religions tear apart families because look, in one same family, sometimes each one
they have a different religion, I've met families like that.
That's right and then, going back to today's subject, it seems to me that about that, the races always, couples fail
because of external influences, whether her's or his' families.
Mhm.
or, or, the background, for, some kind of intrigue from people that surround them and not because of themselves.
Mm.
that
yes, yes, that's it.
lots of times people from the outside is the one that creates conflicts.
Mhm.
because if the couple got married is because of something, they are were in love, nobody was forcing them, so, sometimes, it's because of other people,
Mm.
other people from outside the couple, that start causing trouble.
yes, well, that's why I'm telling you, the couple should be smart enough and responsible enough as to succeed because, well, yes
as you say, there are lots of factors that are going to influence the case. So, that's where, there's
It's the
they have to be smart
Now, they were saying that the children, well, we do agree on it I don't think, I don't think it's because, if one, lets say that the couple, the couple is
he is black and she's white, it has happened before, one son is white and the other one is black.
Mhm.
so, these were conflicts.  If seems that if they two kids are given the same love, if you provide them the same attention and the, the same
eh, eh, if you give them the same necessities because you will, ah, have conflicts, first it's really nice that they learn to see that
they're the same, despite the, the different color.
Sure.  So, hmm.  Yes, well, I agree with you, because well, there's no reason to see them differently, if they're both kids
And while you treat them the same, they will see
so no
that they're equal, now if you try to treat them differently, there you will have a problem
Sure.  Well yes, yes, yes.
but, but I don't think well if they were conceived in the same marriage, well, why would you treat them differently?
Sure.
This is, eh
Unfortunately this gives a lot, eh, yes, from this, where, that the parents treat differently
that yes, I knew a case of a couple, but
and
the- the same thing happened, he and, the woman, she
Hmm.
was dark skinned and he, the husband was white
Hmm.
one of the kids came out dark, looking like her family, and the others white
yes.  yes.
so she, the treated her the same, and the dad really loved the little dark one too, but his family
Hmm.
loved, didn't love the little dark one as much, they loved the others more
Ah.
like, the grandmother, the aunts, and all that.  So it's, it has to do with what we said, the family is of one of the two starts to sow problems.
yes, man, what a shame, because yes, yes I also saw many, many situations like that and well the poor kids, what fault do they have?
Not at all.
Ah, ma-
Not at all, this, eh, no, eh
Ah, yes.
What else did they indicate in the introduction?  They talked about the couple, about the kids
And after, i- it was nothing more than, that that yes the ki-, that if there are interracial kids and that
ah, well, ah, the other was if you, well one
and that yes
would be disposed, would consider marrying with someone from another race, well in my case yes, I don't have problems with this
Ah, yes.  Well me neither, we- in fact in fact yes, like I told you, if you agree and feel attraction for this other person
well there's no reason to not move forward and try to well, to have something good together, no?  So
Right, yes, because every relationship founded in values doesn't have to bring pleasure, well because
it's like this.
if it were only this factor of couples breaking up then, how, how many of the same race don't get divorced?  But the would have to, to do it, so
Exactly.
yes is because the race factor is only about yes or no, I think.
That's how it is.
There are many, many interracial couples that, that look more solid than others of the same race.
yes, that's true, yes is true.
yes, that is true
yes, then well eh imagine, well like you say if, if the ones of the, the same race divorce then one would have to think why, right?
Exactly.
if, if they are from the same race
Eh, that yes, not always is of the same race, the same social condition, the same religion
but yes.
everything very similar, very coincident, however they can't stand each other and, and as we see now, couples that in six, six months are already getting divorced, or in, or in a year.
yes, yes, yes, that's how it is.
Incredible.
Goodness. And where were you born?
I'm from Colombia.
From Colombia, okay.
And where are you from?
From Mexico, from Chihuahua
From Mexi- And, and you've been a long time, here?
yes, I've been living in the United States for more than thirty years.
AH, no, well it's a lifetime
Ah, yes, it is.  Aha, so, ah, what is the, what's the name that you told me?
Manuel.
Sorry?  Your name, what is it?
Eh, yes, yes, yes, Manuel.
Manuel, Manuel, okay.  yes, well, eh, a little while ago I talked with a Colombian, exactly, and we totally agreed also on a lot of things, so
there we realized, well, you're Mexican, I'm Colombian, and nevertheless we agree on, on many things.  I think so.
And although, although it seemed to me that maybe Latinos, for the same that they said
Hmm.
we aren't all given to fixing on this issue of race, it's not so determinant because we're all mixed.
Well yes.
But, and unfortunately Latin America count more on the social status, you know, it's more the social condition, the social level that you belong to, this counts more sometimes.
yes.  Oh, yes.
But, the race, well, I don't see it as so det- obviously yes there are cases, but not so, it's more that there are prejudices in, in the races
a bit purer, let's say, the, it's unfortunate, well because it's not the idea
yes.  Hmm.  It's like that.
it's not the idea to see this.  And in Texas do you see a lot?
Well yes.
a lot of international couples or not?
Uh, yes, a lot, you see lots of couples, and they look happy, i mean, they don't look different to, i mean, you don't see a couple,
for example, lets say, an Asian person, with an american, for example, an asian man with an American woman
yes
it looks just like a Mexican man and a mexican woman, i mean
Yeah, exactly
right, i can't see a difference, absolutely
No, and look, sometimes geniuses are, for example, look at that famous golf player, Tiger Woods
Oh, yes
son of a, of a Chinese with a, yes, from a chinese with a black, a black woman, and look
Right
he's a genius at that sport. And there are many cases like that
Uh huh
And, and
Yes, it's that, i mean, fortunately, well, human beings have lots of virtues, even though we also have many defects
sure
But, well, that's the, the human being's ability, i mean, yeah like, as a human, well, we're always exposed to making mistakes, but well
but if we're smart we can correct those mistakes
Right, because what must count most for us is
And, right
the mental thing, intelligen-, you have to act with intelligence
Uh huh, exactly
That's what matters first
Yes, sure, yeah, well, yes
Wel-, yes, well
It's
Let's finish, uh, until they give us the ti, ti [beep]
Right, yes
Well, here, uh, I'm living in Florida now, but let's say, you do see interracial marriages, but mostly in the big cities, i lived in New York too
And it's very common there
Right
Here it's a relatively more... city
Um
small, the truth is i haven't seen too many interracial couples
Uh huh
I have seen, well, the, the, the, the, uh, Anglo against the hisp-
Hello, hello.
Hello. Yes. Who are you? I'm Olga.
I'm Alicia, how is it going.
Alicia. Very good, thank you very much. Where are you, Alicia?
I'm in Atlanta, Georgia. And you?
In Atlanta. I live in Texas.
Texas? Ah, how nice. Where in Texas?
In Keller, Texas
Where? Keller?
Keller, Texas. Is very near Fort Worth.
Ah, Keller, Texas.
Pardon?
Keller, Texas. Ah, is that I was trying to place it.
Yes.
Eh my. I was trying to place it because my my
Pardon? Oh, oh, okay. Yes yes yes. Well
my boyfriend
what happens is that eh is like Fort Worth but the area is called
Ah, okay
like I told you. But it really is. Even the zip code is of Fort Worth.
oh ready. everything is fine.
yes, how is the weather like over there?
there is no snow or anything like it.
yes
it is cold, there is wind, and it rains.
Mhm
so how is the weather in texas?
For god´s sake what do you think about today's topic?
It is fun I could be considered to be part of an interracial relationship because my boyfriend is white
In a way I am. But if one wants to Consider purely blacks and whites Between interracional Have done good too. So That We Also find this well say.
because Atlanta is a diverse city. There are many blacks, there are plenty of Asians, there are many Jews, Hispanics ect.
there is much diversity as it is inevitable to happen.
yeah that is truth. I agree with you , the same happens in Dallas in the Forth Worth Area.
Mhm
It is not too big and you can see it.
OK
You see a lot of couples Asians and Americans, Americans and Blacks
Of course.
you see  many  Arabic couples.
yes and many more.
Arabs with with Latin women.
Ah yes really?
Mm. Then well I also really don't see any problem with those unions. Because it's assumed that
Is true.
if a couple gets together, it doesn't matter what race they are. Well, it's assumed that that what unites them is the love, right?
Is true. Yes, is true. And and more than the love also a certain
Yes.
what is it called? ah a a coexistence with the other person. In other words getting along well so to speak, to agree with the same life values also.
Exactly. Sure, aha.
And in that sense
Yes.
sure one can say any race a good Christian, or or be a lunatic or or whatever, I mean.
Exactly.
Then
Yes, exactly, yes. I mean, to be a bad person. You don't have to be of a particular race. The same
Is true
to be a good person well neither. I mean is that there's
Is true.
of everything in all the races. There's
Yes, is true.
good people, there are bad people so then I really don't consider that is is a
problem.
a problematic situation.
Like bad. No, yes, is true. I mean the most complicated thing I think is the marriage with different cultures, more than race, different ethnicity. For example
That is more more complex.
or the religion for example, even money, also.
Also, that also
That one is poor and the other has a lot of money, is also complicated, so to speak.
Well, yes yes. Because the, how can I tell you? society is very, how can I tell you? very cruel.
Ah, sure.
the high society is very cruel right? Like it doesn't
They get him.
don't let just anyone in. Do I explain myself?
Ah, yes. Is also true.
So then that really is hard.
Yes, is true, On top of that the one used to the money is going to be more selfish so to speak and perhaps the other who has not had much money, will perhaps be
um will have bad education regarding the finances. I mean, perhaps would spend too much, for example, I don't know. Then there's a difference in values
complicated.
Yes, that's how it is, aha. Yes, also.
The selfishness.
You know also where I see a real problem?
Ah?
In in is in the academic difference.
Ah, that's true. That's very
Yes, uh, that's a terrible thing, especially when the person with more ah let's say that with more academic ability is the woman. Uh, is a real problem because
Mm. Ah.
the man feels terribly
Sure. Inferior.
rejected and inferior and well
Is true.
there is where. Mm.
I have a sister in Chile, for example that she has been with her boyfriend, let's say three years already, And she went back to the university this year
Hm. Mm.
and since she returned to the university they've had mere problems. He has gotten really unpleasant with her. He tells her unpleasant things because he feels insecure because she's now going to get a
a university title and he doesn't have one. I mean, he's also intelligent and makes good money and all but simply doesn't have a university title. But now that she's getting one
he is being like mean with her. Is like really strange the thing.
Yes, exactly. There there they are very difficult problems to solve because is a made situation. I mean
sure.
Is a situation that well, who's going to take her title away? Well nobody, right?
But of course, exactly.
what´s good is that people learned well.
there are many problems with lack of education, many people have no education.
of course a good education.
but you have to study real life?
of course, that is truth too.
life is a constant learning is a school.
one can be in the same house for forty years and it would be a different person for the nation
a person may or may not leave his room
yes
in forty years you learn things.
yes, it depends on what everyone likes, right? specially in this country. Here everybody can study.
there are economic problems here too,  but not too much as in Latin America.
yes
for instance there is no point of comparison with Europe
here in the united states  we have to overcome
Mhm
loans, scholarships and things like that because they simply have to pay 30 thousand dollars a year
yes
then
education is expensive but there are opportunities to acquire a grant.
oh that´s right the scholarships
Exactly, it is difficult because only those who persevere are successful
the worst is that there is people who do not have the necessary information
of course
they don´t even know where to start
it is good to have associations help, for example here in Atlanta is a Latin American asiciacion
they make all kinds of services, where they help speak English and help you find work
I guess in Texas there are also many of these associations
Mh, yes, there are many ways of help.there is information
there are many ways of information and many people cannot get to it
Mh. Yes, that´s right
it is because they do not have a guide or something to tell people where to get help
of course, people do not even know about these places
Exactly
Mh
YEs, Exactly. hay ignorancia por desconocer que existen estas cosas
of course, there is also some people who care about these places. There is people in the University that doesn´t care about learning they just want to finish the career and work.
they go to school and spend all the money because they are lazy and have no right to be in college
yes because they are occupying the position of other people who would be much better
yes that is the true
that is needed. Yes.
And that, that really is a shame.
Yes, because it's a drain of a drain of, yes. Pardon me?
Ah, they should ask whether you went to university.
Oh, well. Look I I did go but in Mexico.
Ah, good.
To the univers- Yes, I mean but even though what happens is that since I lived many years in El Paso, Texas.
Yeah.
So, El Paso is on the border with with Chihuahua.
Sure.
So I practically I, well I lived in both cities, no? En in both countries.
Sure, it's true.
Yes, then, I was going to university in Mexico but I also had to go school in in El Paso, so
Mhm.
as I tell you because
sure.
Well yes, because I really wanted to learn so well
That's true.
as the saying goes, where there's a will there's a way.
And and what did you study, let's say?
Ah well, I studied eh a business degree.
Ah, yeah, for business, okay
Yes, eh and in fact I had I had my own business in in in Chihuahua.
Oh, how good.
But unfortunately with the nine eleven events
Yes.
That affected us a lot, it looks like not but affected there too.
Yes, it is true, yes. Everything changed, a lot.
Eh Yes, then I had to close the business and I could do something else
Hmm. Of course.
Once I closed the business well I didn´t like to be there anymore and then I came here and I am very happy here in
And you don´t is education in Mexico  even better than in American universities?
in Forth Worth. What happens is than in Mexico it is more demanding.
That is what I found because me too. I had a year at the university in Chile and I have had three years at the university here and
Yes.
They demand  a lot, a lot more in Chile. And is like
Yes, and. Aha. And what happens is that simply simply the the the way of treating students is totally different.
And the way that students treat the teacher
Ah, that too.
here is very different completely.
Yes I know. There's that vibe of let's all be friends and that issue A a little
Mm. For example here in the United States the teacher cannot even speak loud to the student.
Hello.
yes, hello, good evening, How are you?
How is it going? Is Marcela
Marcela, How are you? My name is George, from New York.
Fine. Ah, I'm here in North Carolina.
Ah, okay.
And, is very interesting what they want, of what they want us to talk about because my husband is black and I'm white.
Ah, Really? You are an expert on the subject.
And, we have two kids.
yes.
yes, and we've been together thirty years, so, No, I don't see any problem.
Ah, well. So, it has worked, right?
I don't see any problem.
No
that's me, I don't know, maybe is because we are both. Right? We are both artists, I don't know, I don't see any problem.
yes.
I think that
Mm.
if one thinks that maybe there's a problem, then, one starts to look at everything through those lenses. Or, this happened, and it must be because
because I'm white and he is black. Or, this happened, it must be, understand? And then, you start looking,
yes.
the return.  Besides, this,
yes.
like, ah, so well, we've been living in North Carolina for seventeen  years, but before this, we lived in Los Angeles, in Hollywood.  And there,
yes.  Hmm.
we said there wasn't any prejudice, but yes, there's prejudice.
yes.
We didn't realize, you know?  We, we didn't have the experience of prejudice.
yes.  yes, suddenly, suddenly there are things, at the, the level of nationality, no?  Not only on the level of color.  No?
yes, this is true.
Because, it's true that I've read about many cases, eh, I'll tell you directly, eh, for example, Americans with Arabs, Americans with Chinese, and really, well, it's not so much the color but the, the difference in culture.  Hmm.
yes, I think that you're right, I think that the difference in culture, perhaps, brings more problems
yes.
than this, than color.
simply color.
yes, eh, my husband and I, we're both from the middle class,
yes.  Hmm.
so, we're both from, this,
What nationality is your husband?
Sorry?
Where, where is your husband from?
From Los Angeles
Was he born here?
Yes, yes, born here
But, and, uh, i mean, born, raised
Everything, everything, everything, everything
Oh, well, yeah, maybe that's why, isn't it?, and, are you, you're Chilean, right?
On the other hand, uh, i know, i know about people, i know about people... you have to dry them, I'm sorry, i'm setting the table, we're eating late
Sure, no problem
No, i know about people that has gotten married, whatever, with Arab people,
yes
And has had a lot of trouble
Yeah, i really
Because the culture is so different
Yes, the culture mostly, on the woman's side, well, the submission, that sort of stuff. For example, i had a case now, with a daughter
Uh huh
She's, she has a boyfriend, a, a thug that's, right?, he's not completely arab, well, but you can tell the differences. And i tell her, "keep those things in mind", right?
Uh huh
Because, the way they dress, the way they speak, uh, raise the children, all those things, those differences leave a mark, they live a mark for life, so
to have trouble, uh huh, and, and
yes. But, you know that they more you tell him that, that that will not work, the more he will hold on to her.
Ah, no, no,no. No, no, I don't say it in that way.
Ah, we-
I simply, I talk about it. yes, no, I really don't, I don't get involved in that matter, because, well, I have several marriages, to get myself into my, into my relationships. No?
Aha.
yes, no, really I don't, I don't intervene in that. That's her liberty. yes I don't the topic, hmm,
No, it's that, unfortunately, we're humans. You see? And, the more people are against it, the more we want it.
ah, no, no. No, and0 ah, no, sure, no, that is, no, that I, I know that very well. But, I, no, I have spoken to her, no, i haven't told her, no, don't do that no.
Mhm.
No, it's, it's her own decision. No? But, it's well because, well, maybe they don't know. No?
yes.
They don't know the, the situation. Mhm.
yes, no, it's that, sometimes, eh, also that, there are certain people that because of their culture, they have a lot of pressure from their family, or to be yes v-
if you look at Oriental cultures, the Japanese, specially, that they don't mix with anyone,
yes, they mix very little, no?
so, there was a Japanese person, of Japanese parents, born here,
Mhm.
and, she wants to marry with Westerner of any race.
yes. Mhm.
The Jap-eh, eh, that family, it will be very difficult to open up.
yes.
So, O- o- o- o-
Sure.
Um, so, this is the, this is the, the the the
yes, I think, in any case, that interracial marriages, or- there has to be a very good understanding on both parts, and, and both, talking clearly, well,
so, how the relationship will be managed, no?  if it's a marriages, what will be the parameters of the marriage.  Right?
the same as the people, hmm.
If they will be ruled by one law or another.
and the problem would also be if you have two people who are religious but who are from two different religions.
yes, this is really difficult, I think, to manage.
You know?  If you have people who aren't religious, or only one is religious and the other doesn't care,
Hmm.
so, this isn't a problem.  But, if you have two religious people,
yes.
so, and they are from different religions, ah, forget it.
yes, if they're from opposite poles, but I think that it's very difficult to carry on one of these relationships.
Hmm.  yes.
But, color, the truth, I don't see a big problem.  Today. . . it's true that you see many couples of different color.  Right?  Like you say.
yes, yes.
And, in all ways
yes, I don't think this is it. I think that is, um,
is not a myth.
it has to do with class, class, that's another difference, that also makes a lot of difference.
yes,the education, I think that is very important.
If you have two people of two totally different classes.
mm.
If you have someone of upper class, and someone of a class
Mm.
lower, there's
Mm.
there's a total conflict.
yes.
Because, I don't care what country one is, nor how open minded one is,
Mm.
we, unconsciously, are governed by the sense of class.
yes,
Understand? We are all trying to, maybe we don't have much money, but we are trying to dress, trying to appear
Mm.
like we have it.
Mm.
Do you understand me?
Uh huh
So, that's what i know, that it's important to society
Yes
Yes, and so there's, uh, the conflict, when you have
But you, let's see, i have a question for you, well, you have a real case
Uh huh
Lets say there wasn't, there were no religious matter in any of both sides
No, because
so, well, so rooted
no, because i, i was raised as a catholic, but I'm not a religious person that goes to church and all that
it's different, yeah, oh, OK
And he was raised as a protestant, but he's also not a [...] person
And, the children, how are you raising the children?
Well, it turns out that through our lives, we stumbled against Hindi philosophies
Um, yeah
And so, we followed those philosophies, even though we don't have a church or a place to go, or any of that, you see?
Um, yes
But we follow those, uh, philosophies and we pass them on to our children, we didn't raise them
Oh, ok, um
the, it just so happens that both kids are baptized
Yes
But, for
legal matters, uh
we did it for a question of tradition
yeah
And we did it for, uh, the benefit and happiness of our family
Um, yeah, yes
Do you understand?, but no
Yeah, but there was no disagreement or anything like that
No, no, now, if he would suddenly start telling me that he has to go to, he wants to go to, to the, to the church or something, then, i don't know
yes
i don't know, I'm not gonna stop him. But if he starts bringing certain jewish-christian philosophies to our house, about which i don't
i don't adhere to, do you understand?
yes
then, i don't know what would happen, but
Um, yeah, uh um
That's something i don't, i don't, i don't think that
Yeah
that is going to happen, you see?, none of us are suddenly going to
I mean, definitely, you opted for a third religion and the whole world is okay with that, and what about the?
yes, no? We are bohemians, I mean, that's our religion, we are bohemians.
oh I see, but how about food, the way you dress, the way you relate to other people, I mean, did you have lots of things in common at the beginning?
or were there lots of differences?
No, oh, you know what? What do I know, I mean, I'm from Argentina and and and, the Argentinian culture is very European.
Yes yes mhm.
Do you understand? So, there's no difference I don't know about other countries because I have never been to any other Latin American countries.
Mm, I see, yes.
but I realized that, when I first got here to the United States I was nine years old and we arrived to New York.
yes.
And they'd say as they do in Buenos Aires.
Mhm.
Why did we come here? Do you understand? This,
mm
so, oh, what do I  know? I think I've learned how to cook different dishes because his grandma raised him and she'd cook certain dishes, certain dishes
Mm
so, that he liked. So, I got worried and I started cooking because my dad likes to cook so I got worried and I tried to learn
Sure.
how to make those dishes.
Mm, I see, yes, of course.
But, mm, and I do it to, to give him a little taste of home. You understand me?
Sure, sure, yes.
Mm, but is not a, a big, a big change. I mean, he eats everything I cook him.
Mm. yes. There's no problem
yes. No,no
Ah, no, well I congratulate you both. Is interesting, right, is interesting. right? well, it gives you the chance to talk. Because, I've seen many couple
but really I've never talked with a couple about this topic. Right?
yes.
couples that, are couples that are different. Mm.
But, also, maybe, it has to do with the fact that we are both artists, we are both middle class.
yes,
you know? Perhaps, if we were working people, um, eh, people that, see? that worked in factories, that, that
Mm.
eh, perhaps there would be, I don't know? more difference. I don't know. But, we have um, the same education levels.
yes,
Then, we have many things in common.
yes, I think that, I think that in this the education is very important. I think that, more than the class and all that, well, the
the class goes hand in hand with the education, almost always. Right?
yes.
But, I think that the education is very important. It hurts me a lot seeing people that are racist, that, for example, I know someone who has a grandchild who is black. right? And, the man
Mm. yes,
doesn't accept for the girl to get near him. The guy is ignorant. Aha, how is it possible person for the color
yes.
doesn't let his granddaughter caress him and kiss him and fuss over him? No.
Mm.
It disgusts him, right? And, great lack, that is great
how are you what's up, and you fine, yes, yes, I live in New York
yes hello, how are you, my name's Maria, what's your name?  I didn't hear very well, hey, what's up, how are you, where are you from?
hey and where are you from, I live in New York, I'm from Panama.
hey I also live in New York but Mexican, yes, how long have you been here?  How long have you spent here?
oh, yes, what's up, how do you say, oh, I've been here for about fifteen, eighteen, sixteen years yeah
ah that's a lot, it's sorry, I'm in New York in
how do you like the topic?  and you what time, what time do you have?
two years but I lived in Boston before and so I've been about seven years in the United States in total, not so long
ahhh yes, I'm you're dad then
listen and what do you think about the topic
well I think it's a good topic, it's a really delicate topic but yes, when they told me marriage I said, well, it's an easy question
aha
because really marriage is something that's indicated by God and really all us human beings should look for the way to not only get together as a couple but really
to get to this commitment, I don't know how to say, to get to an extreme of compromise, ah, a couple you understand because lately what's happening is that a couple breaks up
and suddenly you don't lie him and you leave him and look for another, you know, and when there's marriage it's different, it's more serious, an issue
sure, sure, a compromise, no
like more biblical an issue more, you understand as a compromise, exactly, and ahh I think that when the first marriage between Adam and Eve because God blessed them I think that what happens when they get married, what a marriage does is
that the priest, the minister gives the benediction before all the witnesses and takes the couple and from there forward
hmm, interracial
you know and from there forward they're a couple well with interracial marriage, I tell you it's becoming a more delicate topic in the sen- wait a moment, in the sense that, that
there are races different from ours, for instance maybe not Hispanic and white or Hispanic and black, but Hispanic and
Arabic, you know, and it's not only the, the
aha, but maybe it is, I mean, the difficulty is more in the culture difference rather than in the race difference
aha, yes, that's why when they say different race it means also different culture, because actually if, for instance, a Mexican marries an Argentinean it's different, it's the same
right? it's the same race but different cultures, and that's where the shock is, you know, for instance if you tell me about
yes
and Arab with a Christian, then there is some, ahh, Arab with Hispanic that is a shock not only because of
yes
culture and race, but also because of the religion, the Arab is Muslim and the Hispanic is Catholic, Christian, so when sons come there is a conflict
when the Arab wants the sons to be Muslims and go to the Mosque
Of course
and Hispanic wants the sons to go to a Catholic church and be baptised as Catholics, then we enter a, a plane
different, because if you have experienced that of a relation with another race
different one, a very delicate situation, you know what I mean
have you had any relation with somebody of another race? I said, have you had any relation with somebody of another race?
what you say? yes, I had once a relation with a Jewish girl, so
aha
eh, there was this question about, ah, you know, not really, not really the race and habits are the same, but the
those people, yes, of course
but wait a minute, please, excuse, one second, but then, didn't you say you had a relation with a person
yes, no problem
of another race
yes, I had  a relation with a girl, and she was Jewish, and I
and, yes, it was different
yes, it was different, we had different habits also, let me tell you, not only that, actually I had two relations with
aha
but look, I had a relation with a girl who was a girl but her relation as far as religion is the same, the same catholic religion
and her habits were different, her culture was different, but there was not really a big big
aha aha
difference, the big difference is religion in my opinion, religion makes a very big difference
aha
you know, you get used to culture and so, one day, imagine you  married a, a, I don't know
one day you eat the food of his country and the other the food of your country, ehh, you learn the language
ehh, you can learn a lot of things, but, converting to his religion or him converting to yours,
aha
that's the problem, I think that in this sense, religion makes a, makes a, like I told you, makes a big
it is bridge hard to cross, because it is a question, a tie you don't want to break, that is the question, you just don't want to
I have never had a relation with somebody of another religion but I guess it must be very difficult
yes, yes, aha, for instance
because, yes, the believes are absolutely different
for example, to save your Saturday for that person, if you are free and you want to do and undo, if you want to do
aha
lots of things during the Saturday, do you understand, this person, she doesn't save the Saturday so they go out on Sundays but Sundays to you are to attend church and to here, it's not, so
yes, yes, yes.
I'm telling you, each activity in life can lead you to, you can stand it, really, the food, traditions
yes
but when it's something interracial or religious, I think that it's a huge problem, the same
the same racist, oh, the same, you know, the same subject about race that, I've seen a white person married to Hispanics and they get along fine because they share the same religion.
yes, yes
my same beliefs but I'm telling you, when they have a different religion, then it becomes much more stronger than religion itself, that
yes, m, yes
that the race, I've no experience with other races, have you had any experiences with other races? Have you had any experience with a different race than your own?
I'm sorry, no I haven't, I'm sorry, no, my relationships have always been with
yes, you haven't had any relationship with a different race, aha
with Catholic people, I'm white and white people, but I believe that's because I was raised around white or brunette people but for some reason
I don't know, I've always been attracted to white people so, I realized it when I had to talk to someone
it's true, oh yes, I
about I mean, about this same subject aha, I then realized that I've always dated white people, I don't know, I mean, I do have friends from other races, other countries and other races and all of that but I've only dated white people, aha
there are, there are, so if you saw me, I'm brunette so
my brother is a brunette, my mom is a brunette but I've always dated white people
yes, well, how old are you?
I am twenty-five, I'm still young
oh, you are young already, maybe you will change your
yes, I'm open to anything, the only thing I feel like could stop me would be, like you say, someone like
yes, actually
going with a Muslim who is very stuck in his religion I think it has to be very difficult, right? the same with a Jewish who is very Jewish, I don't know if I could
yes,eh, it is also related to
Good evening
Hi, my name is Ramón, from Los Angeles
Ramon, my name is Carlos, from Houston, Texas
From what?
yes, Texas
Oh, Houston, oh, very well. I have spoken with you, right?, or
Yes, i think so
Yes
And, what's today's subject?
Well, well, oh, the subject is marriage, yes
Yes, that's it
Oh
What do you think?
Well, I'm not, uh, married now, and, uh, uh, but i have lots of, uh, like eight and three years relationships, etc
But, uh, I've never been married
Where are you originally from?
Uh, los Angeles
Los Angeles?, uh, uh, your
Yes
Uh, your Hispanic nationality, from what country?
From from Mexico.
Mexico?
yes.
And, eh is, your relationships more with Hispanic people or people or ah or?
There's a eh a eh mix it depends what stage in my life. Ah, there isn't any particularly.
Okay and What do you think then of interracial marriage?
Well I think is ah yes ah I think is that ah here in this area in Los Angeles is that like fifty percent of the people that live here
weren't born here.
Really?
yes. And and there's a, there's interracial marriages and that um but there's social pressure that is not um eh is not like something good.
on behalf of the people here and like in
Well yes?
generally in the United States Uh. But perhaps when I um like was seventeen years old ah, is different, is very is not  uh
like uh is not something bad in relation to when I was seventeen years old, socially different.
How old are you now?
ah, fifty eight years old.
Okay Then, ah well for me. I think there's no for me, I don't  think is a big deal
Uh uh.
is that maybe it doesn't matter, we are already, at a point where society accepts that, probably accepts
Mm.
in a large extent the interracial marriage. Oh, of course it all depends of what place one is in eh there are some ah some places some
towns where well is more affected than others. That if one has a relationship eh that is well of Hispanic well
Mm.
I don't think that difference is that much.
yes, do you think there's a lot of uh
that if one person
There are a lot of marriages in Houston oh I lived in San Antonio once.
in other words is living in Houston, I mean the great majority of the population here is Hispanic
yes.
And, well is
So there are many interracial marriages between the blacks and the Asians, with the Hispanics?
eh well I mean mostly, mostly whites. But I don't know I don't know how much it is with blacks or Asians with the Hispanics.
yes.
Eh, obviously I mean blacks and Asians are a minority here in Houston in comparison to whites and eh
yes.
Hispanics
Mm.
Then, that it wouldn't be, is not that easy eh finding a relationship as far as that. But. Now if it's independently of that, whether is white and Hispanic, white
black white, Asian
Mm.
or any other combination here I have never seen that it is something bad
Oh.
Have you seen someone who has
Well it is eh
That has
yes it is interesting because here there are there are pressures, social limitations here in Los Angeles and a person with an interracial marriage um, maybe um
But eh it is more, it depends of the social situation, for example in my work when I work with a union eh, the union is like
the members are like a thirty five percent Hispanics . And, probably, forty percent are blacks and thirty or twenty are whites and the rest are Asians.
okay?
And in this situation, Um. When there are meetings there are problems, there is tension uh but there are but the marriages uh interracial for example in union there are
there is a like an attitude to free but there are people that do not have the attitude to free for the interracial marriages.
yes. well, according too, that it also depends a lot in so to me well
Hmm
I don´t. I do not find I do find that, The Hispanic have found themselves in a point of not being so much different in the fact that if a person wants to
eh, marry a person who is
Uh uh.
for example, there are there are other races for example that
Are you, are you married now?
No. I am single.
Oh
Oh, well then. To me, I mean, I've always been attracted to people, oh to white people.
Mm.
in a way that for me, ever since I was little I always was attracted to white people, oh, so
And then, I mean, there was never a problem with my family for that.
yes.
Oh, again, I mean, in Puerto Rico oh there are all types of races. Oh, in Puerto Rico, all the Puerto Ricans.  Puerto Ricans can have a
well, we have whites, Hispanics, black people.
Yes, but oh Puerto Rico and like, oh, there are all types of races and we have people that have oh, like a, oh
it's similar to Europe, since the
Exactly.
white skin is more in favor than the ones whose roots are from Africa.
I mean, we have all types not one is bigger than the other, so if you are attracted to whites, well, it has to be a difference too between
whites, whites Puerto Ricans and
yes.
so, Americans as is.
Mm.
It's just an idea I don't think that, oh, that's a huge difference for the worse, I mean, now that we are so Americanized.
No.
Oh., I now see that I find that other Latin American countries, oh
yes.
yes they have that discrimination to certain point.
yes.
the fact that someone that you cannot go out with that person because she is Anglophone. Is like it is not accepted.
yes.
Eh, even so I think that it is more uh more difficult for people from Asian origin.
Uh uh.
And it makes to certain point eh for blacks um. I don´t know how true is it.
Yes, Well, And do you think there is a racial problem in the society? Do you think there is prejudice for different groups?
Do you think there is a racial problem in the United States?
No. I don´t think so. It has changed a lot. In, I only
Hmm.
I moved here to Houston about five and a half year.
yes. And how old are you?
Eh and in this past. And in the time, pardon me?
How old are you?
twenty eight.
twenty eight.
And eh I have been here for five years, almost six years and the time I have been here never, I have never have problems in relationship with race so
but again so in in Houston the, I think that now, we are in the fifty one percent or something like that
That that there are more Hispanics.
yes.
in Houston compared to any other race.
Hmm. Aha.
Even the whites. So it is not difficult to find the fact that there is not so much discrimination. Um against Hispanic.
Hmm.
And, well so as I told you.
So Do you think that society in Houston in Houston area is uh there is not so much racism?
Uh. there is a little
Hmm.
But I don´t think that it is, no. When you come, To, to relationships. So
Oh.
in in everyday, you can go out.
Hmm.
and I have found a person. eh, white. Is going out with, is holding hands with an Hispanic or a black person and it is not a problem at all, so it is not.
Uh uh.
something like. here it is going to be seen. as something bad
yes, Hmm. Well here in Los Angeles, the neighborhoods are segregated here and most of the Hispanic live in the west of Los Angeles and the blacks on the south of central Los Angeles
uh, there are there are neighborhoods that are, ah, there is integration ah, but there are parts of Los Angeles that are ah, without a question segregated.
Well, is like here so Uh, many uh there are here many neighborhoods that
Yes?
most are Hispanic, most are blacks, most are Asians.
Yes.
But one like that so independently of the race segregation
Uh uh.
no the fact that a person could be in an intimate relationship with a person from another race
¡Hi!
¡Hi!, Aurelio here, from Washington DC
Hi, Mayra, ni-, uh, nice to meet you, I'm here in Philadelphia
Oh, what's up?, what' your name?
Close, Mayra
Mayra, great, nice to meet you.
Yeah, likewise
Hey, today's subject is a, uh, very profound subject, so, you  needs more than twelve minutes to discuss it
uh huh, yeah, about, yeah, the
Go figure
Right?, we're gonna run out of time right away
Yes
Yes
and, what do you think, what do you think about religion?
Oh, the truth is that
Hey, Mayra, Mayra, i can barely hear you, ¡Hello!
OK
Now
Ok, so, uh, but i have never liked too much what religions do, because otherwise, i think that it
gives good things, it gives moral, hope, whatever you want, but, yeah, i don't know, it marginalizes a lot of other people, for example, it excludes many others
Sure
people, and I don't understand why it has to be like that. And, I mean I think that the problem of religion has existed for many years and will probably continue
existing for a very long time.
Sure, unfortunately that will never end
Then yes, And I don't know And for example the Buddhist one is the one I like the most. Because it doesn't exclude any other, I mean it just
explains in terms of the Buddhist religion, how the others also are not good people, if that's what it's about. And is like that, like, well
Sure.
yes is very different to the Catholic one for example. That also if you are gay you are completely out, no, of the church
Sure, yes. They are very, how, how could we say it, like very Well yes, racist well because they exclude certain groups and those type of things
yes, they discriminate a lot.
yes, they discriminate, exactly. They are discriminatory. yes, unfortunately.
Uh
I tell you something, I've never believed in any of those in any religion. I consider myself totally without any type of of
eh of religiousness I think that the religions is always like they bring out the best and the worst in the individuals; each person
yes.
uh Eh and, well unfortunately the worst, is the worst of the, of the human being. The discrimination, the racism, murder,
Uh.
persecution that's a horrible thing. Just in the name of God and the worst thing of all is that in all those religions
none says that you should persecute another person. Because because that person is of another religion or of another way of thinking or another skin color. You understand me?
yes, they feel.
it is what is happening between Muslim and Jews. That is horrible How?
where are you from?
I was born in Venezuela
okay
where are you from?
I am from Mexico
You are from Mexico Okay.
Uhm, do the majority of people are catholic there?
the majority of people are Christians.
okay
the majority, are like that I imagine in Mexico is the same thing.
yes
I was raised catholic. My parents raised me to be catholic. I was baptized and everything butI don´t like  nothing of that sort of things
I think that religion is a thing is a fact of life, that people should have as an adult. understand?
really?
I think teaching a child religion is practically brainwashing him.
Uhm
It is simply nothing more to see what they have done throughout history, to see that it is simply brainwashing.
yes, of course.
Yes. that's one of the worst things that religion brings human models, the best thing is art, you understand this study and all literature.
it has inspired. But, I mean, it is like it is very difficult to get the middle point, you know what I mean? something where
people accept each other, you know what I mean? tolerance is difficult
yes, that's right. That's true, it is very extremist
It is hard
If they could
That's why right now all this that is happening with terrorism, they take the name of God
uhm
to commit murderers, you know what I mean? in the name of God, and that is terrible. Understand? if you name
eh, God, Allah as they call him. It is not said in the Islam or the Koran that they have to go kill other people
people, in the name of God, to sacrifice people, understand?
yes
it is a terrible thing. You know
But precisely
You know, how? Hello! Hello! Hello, hello, hello! Hello! Hello!
The communication cut off. Mary, I hardly hear you, actually I don't hear you at all. We will talk later, Bye
Hello?
Hello, Hello, how are you?, how are you?
Fine, who am i talking to?
You're talking to Vicente, in New York
New York, I'm Paulina
Yes, and you?
And i live in Athens, Georgia
In Athens, Georgia, right, originally, where are you from originally?
From Chile
From Chile, oh, i have a person, I'm originally from Panama
And, and you?, oh yes
From Panamaand i have a person that lives at mi house, here where i live, that is from Chile, i live in a building, uh, in a leasing building
What's that?
Uh, i, I'm saying i live in a building, in a big house of apartments, of apartments
Right, and you don't know any Chileans do you?
No, there's one, there's one that lives here, he's from Chile, a lady that's from Chile, i don't remember her name but I've spoken to her a lot of times
Oh
she, she, she's from Chile
right
but, i think that, uh, she's a little bit crazy
oh yes
yes yes, they are calling me from Chile and stuff, well like, like most of the Hispanics are always talking about something, that's something that I don't really understand of the Hispanics that come here to the United Stat4es, they speak as if they had already traveled
to a paradise, if they had arrived to paradise, the others do it too
Nostalgic yes
the blacks that come from the Caribbean do it too, they talk as if they had come to the United States' paradise.
yes oh yes
do you understand? and I most of the people that do that are quite poor, They want to, want to, they want to tell other people that they live here as kings, you know?
and and the most reasonable thing to do, for the educated ones, it's to not, not talk, don't say those things.
oh yes
No, it is different, yes because
How long have you been here in the United States?
I've lived here for over forty years, over forty years
How old were you? How old were you, do you remember?
I was about ten years old, twelve years old.
No, so you don't miss your country.
But it's like, no, I don't, I like my country but I know how the people talks
yes but ten, ten years, you don't really know what it's like
No, a few days, two three years, I don't know much but I cousins that are here,
what a country is
and when I was a child, right, when I was a child, three years, four, five seven years old I'd send him to Panama, to a Latin country, he likes it because they can run all over the place and they have a good, you know
Every thing, but when they reach the teenager age right the age of fifteen and thirteen and you make a request, they begin to complain of everything, this country is poor does not have this, does not have this and complain when they come back here instead of.
that that country does not have nothing, there, there there is not this, there is not, there is not hot water. The bathroom is not pretty and this, this, this they complain of all, see it
ah, yes
because, they see different Do you understand me?
Well it depends where you send them.
They ah, yes, yes
it depends from where you send them
yes, yes, yes, but when they come back to other country, they hmm much more poor that the United States, that is a reality. That is a reality, but we do not see it when we are
well
older, that pretending that all
Or, or, or you move like in my case to study. because you can pay an study here.
aha
And after that you stay here because you marry an American. no, not because you are in a bad situation in you own country.
Oh, not only, not only No,not only, but there are, there are more, more educated and the most refined you are the most you appreciate the United States.
The least refined you are, the least you know the difference between you country and , the United States the richest country in the world, see it
And nobody loose it, when I come back to panama, I come back to Panama and go to the Hospital to visit sick people.
waiting for their medication, sometimes waiting for medication sometimes given to them by the United States for free. That is a thing, I would not like to be in that situation, if I were in Panama, I don´t
I would not want to go to a hospital, I would come back to the United States immediately. because, because what they have there, what I see, the machines and all the life support
and all that stuff, it does not exist in countries in the
No, of course that not, but it does not means that those countries do not have its beauties
In the hospitals. Although it is somehow beautiful, but beauty is not enough, beauty is not, and when I say beauty I mean the region
you see, but I must pay attention, on how to live and live thebe st I acn, you know what I mean? that's why, that's why when
Well, every person has his own priorities
yes, yes, no, it's different, that's true. And the truth is that a lot of people don't want to face it, I have gone back to Panama, eh, I have gone to
I see the palms, but all those thing that people in general, specially the poor ones, they are fed with politics. And the rich people, the rich, the rich people, come to the United States, the rich ones come to the United States
No, no, I don't agree, because if you, if you are alright in your own country, first of all you just don't leave
No,no, the most rich and powerful come to the United States from everywhere
You don't leave the country
It is an international thing, rich people and powerful people. That's international, while poor people don't know a thing, they say such stupid things that sometimes you can't help laughing
well, they, well, they miss their culture
Or the, 'guineo', 'guineos' and bananas in Ecuador, The banasa and the plantains and all that, it's the same all over Central America
But that's life, you see, we shouldn't be talking about this, we should be talking about marriage, and, and religion, right?
yes
We are supposed to talk about religion
You are not religious, are you?
oh, I am religious, in, in, Christ, I am, I am religious, yes, I am very religious, I am
No, yes, yes, 'in my own way', I've heard that quite a lot, yes
no, no, but the lifestyle, the lifestyle, if you live
oh yes
if you live in a religious way, that, that's quite different from living, from going to church every Sunday, and acting, and acting bad afterwards, you know what I mean?
That is very different, my way of living, I live a way,
Ah yes, And how is your way of living?
logical and, and smart, look, I, I
Laughing at the people.
no, no, look, that, look, my grandfather, see, I the name of my grandfather and grandmother. My grandmother would go to church all the time see, and my grandfather never ever I have seen that he would go to church my grandfather never.
What church did they go to.
And if, and if God comes, God comes here right now right, who do you think that God will get to take to heaven before anyone else, my grandfather?
Because that man never says anything bad of any person he gives to eat to any other person he lives a life is a life that, that you, is a life, How do you say it? a correct life I don't know how you say the word in Spanish
But in English is the word one that lives right Is much more religious that a person that talks about it.
No, I don't agree it depends on the religion.
understand? There are, are people that talk about it but don't live it.
yes, yes
You understand me living living means that if I'm here see
No, there's of everything, there's of everything,
And you are a Muslim, you are a priest or whatever you are because I live right I respect you as a person and I say right things and
That makes me more powerful than one that only talks about their religion and talks it and practices bad things and say bad things about another person
No, no yes I agree, but a person that also listens to the rest also. that has religion or not.
like that, yes, yes I hear like that yes I also see it, because the thing is that here in New York right
aha
In New York, everybody in New York is something nice about New York, when I leave my house. I see from Peru, Ecuador, from all parts, see
And if I want to eat food from any other country, from Brazil, I want to eat meat the Argentinean way, I have it near, Ecuador, from wherever
and the thing is that when you can live with all the people, and get along, that's the most important, as well as religion
here in New York there are all kind of religions. And when you are, a person, right?
just, a just person, you say just?
just, just, whatever. Just, just, and not only just but a person who respects everybody, right? and goes, good morning how are you I don't mind what is your religion
right, just, that's the word
I won't say that's bad, it is good, living this way. That to me, is more religious
Than talking, I know of people who go to the church, and when they are in the church they start talking bad, and want to do bad things, and they go to the church every Sunday, you know what I mean?
Other people don't go to church but they live, uf, they live so honourably and so, and you can see it right now, a lot of parents and
how you call it? the people, the people of
the priests
The priests, who preach that living honourably is much more important than just the religion. There was one, that's all I know, one gringo in California
Shula, shula whate- Sholo
one, what?
Shuler, Shuler, that's the name, Shuler, he appears every Sunday on the TV, right? and that man never talks about God, no, no, he doesn't talk about God much, you know what I mean?
But he talks about living honourably. Inspiration, you know what I mean
Well, that's what it's all about, religion, excuse me
To me, to me
Let me speak a little bit also, I think that religion
yes aha
that teach to live correctly, it is a religion worth to follow, a religion that is based in preach and not practice, as you are saying, then it is worthless,but I do not agree that you should not be religious at all,
aha No, exactly, no, you don´t have to be religious because eh, for for
I am not telling that religion will help you if you live the principles taught by it.
yes,
if you don´t live it, it is worthless.
Well the it is a different kind of a religion, it is like when I remember once I was watching a movie and a man, a man was doing things
that he, he was acting like a priest or something like that, he was a priest but he was not. And then one of the priests a so priest a very priest and well and your religion, acts like a christian person.
or a person from a religion do you understand me.
hmm
they are telling people that he is corrupted, you don´t act like a person with a religion or a person of eh, eh, spiritual no then he is telling to me I don´t care what is your religion, but you are not acting like a moral person.
understand it
hmm
And he was correct, he was not a priest, he was acting like a priest to. steal and stuff like that, but the priest who were very intelligent told him that
I do not care which one is your religion, but you are not acting like a person of, spirit and a person that, lives correctly and you are talking and I don´t care which religion is your religion.
But I say that the way you act and stuff and I have always look that do you understand me. the religion as they said, they said in the question the assigned to us
that if religion separates, separates us or help us, I don´t know, that was what they told
yes something like that
Something like that, that if it separates, because many people has died because of religion
yes
many people, have killed for religion, I don´t know if you remember, when I went to school in Panama And I was talking when the conquers , the conquers come to
yes in the name of religion the people do atrocities
yes they were killing many people because they would ask you if you believed in God and the Indians believed in God a lot but, they called him a different name
and the, the Indians were more religious than the conquistadors. but the conquistadors, would kill them because if they didn't say it they wanted, the God of the Christian.
the Catholic, but the Indian didn't know that type of religion But they thought that a God existed and all that, but they had a name in, in the
language of theirs, you understand me, and the conquistadors
yes, I, I think that religion is good when one lives the principles it teaches.
exactly.
of how people see you, but I find that if there wasn't any religion at all, eh, it wouldn't be too good either, because the people wouldn't be afraid of anything and wouldn't be governed by any good principle, so.
Good morning. Hello, I'm Marco
yes hello I'm Mariza from Philadelphia
Hello I'm also in Philadelphia
well it's very very cold,
ah, yes, I mean, we are definitely in the same city,
ah, yes well, today's topic of religion
religion
and it asked it it was, I think that it was eh, that if it united or separated the people something like that
yes, eh, basically, eh, openly, and you, eh, practice?
well I'm from my family, I'm Spanish and in my family they are all Catholics and, although I, they baptized me and did the communion and got married by the church
but really I don't go to, I don't go to church nor do I practice, let's say that is eh I believe but I don't practice it, let's say
okay, and is there basically, is there any reason in particular why you don't, or simply, or eh, what's called life, there's no time?
well ah, first there's no time, because I have a little girl and then besides is that mm, I don't know, before I would go more often but there comes a moment in which everything is the same and I think that one to
that the belief that one carries inside and I like let's say, to do let's say that I don't know, that going to church is like for older people, for people that
that are more used- that are more traditional and
have time,
is, let's say is, a, is optional for me, I don't think that God is going to punish me because I don't go to church, I don't know I
is not necessary like to learn there, what it's about and that
okay
um
no is that is, eh, tends to always be the same, always
yes, I, eh, I grew up in, in Paraguay
aha
and, there also Catholic eh, I always got baptized there's - I was born in the United States, I got baptized here and over there I had my first communion
aha
it was something that I remember that the, the confession of the first communion eh was with a fantastic priest eh like that a- friend and I remember that what I had like that  simply confessed that
mm the truth is that I didn't believe so much and, the way in which he told me that is
mm
perfectly normal, there's no hurry, there's nobody who will tell you, nobody can correctly tell you you're wrong or that it's a mistake or
because is, is like that it is that it will come, it will come to you, if you are going to believe, you will believe so, is as simple as that,
to me it seems fantastic the systems the way he put it
mm
eh, I now live with, she's not yet my wife, we are, eh we are engaged
mm
eh, we live together and, eh, she has a five year old kid from a, from a previous marriage the famous marriage of someone who got pregnant, the family so Catholic
aha
then the obligation of getting married
yes like the same thing happened to my mom, yes
exactly, and mine too, eh, that now they
aha
they are not together anymore
and mine neither,yes, ah
eh, exactly, right? and, but they, my parents stayed together for, until, until, yes exactly
yes, for the kids, sure, yes, yes, yes
and, for obligation, and
aha
basically I'm now living, I'm according to the church this would be something terrible on all aspects, of her divorce, that she's living with me in a
in a house and we are not married and the baby also, we had tried we are moral people we are- that's one thing that to me seemed, eh
the church, I remember that, I saw myself in a religion that a friend in, in Paraguay was of the Bajai and the Bajai basically believes that the new, the nine religions - the nine
major religions of the world are in reality the same God
mm
because, eh, seeing correctly, if you see any religion, what do they teach? you have to be respectful, you have to respect life, you have to that the, the other people, you have to be good with yourself, not kill, not steal
mm
no, the rules are basically the same except sure, the appearance of God of each one has a different appearance depending of how, how one looks
and, that I think, I also think an, an interesting way of seeing things, eh we tried a couple of we saw that the, the church
yes, especially the Catholic church, the eh way that they treat the problems of the homosexuals, for example
aha
eh, we have a, regrettably a few months ago an uncle of my girlfriend died, eh he was homosexual but he was, he was always very religious, very religious
Roman Catholic also sure, which basically meant that he self condemned
mm
he was a homosexual and he hadn0t, he hadn't, he tried, we tried to do exercise and this and that
he tried to find a way to stop being homosexual, but, he just couldn't do it and it seems terrible to me, for some people and now for example, to listen to the church say things like
for example, to say, for example, the idea of, that no sex, no, no, one shouldn't have sex before getting married
aha
that never, never in past centuries did that happened in reality
exactly
it is not respected, so, everybody is, technically
living in sin, no?
we are sinners
aha, yes, yes, mhm
everyday, so, how is it that you can respect yourself? How can you respect the others? is it like
oh, we are all sinners, we are all going to hell,
yes, all of us, exactly, yes
the, I'd like to, I also remember when I used to go to church and to, did the
isn't the power to forgive others, something from God? Is it forgiveness something that we all should also be trying to achieve?
we should be able to forgive our enemies
mm
oh, but if one is a homosexual, lets say, or homosexual, or if his marriage didn't work, and nos, it seems to me, it seems to me
I believe that religion is something, it was necessary back in the day when there was the need of uniting people, it was very important then because there were lots of problems in the world
and it worked perfectly, of course, Catholics, Roman Catholics decided to go to war to try to eliminate other religions because, suddenly, each God
that, every God is different, eh omnipotent, eh but, no one recognize neither of them then, basically the Catholic,  for example, believe that, perhaps means that Catholics believe that
eh, how many how many in the world, most of this planet is condemned because they grew up in families who are not Roman Catholics in that case they are not baptized
then all the creatures that died in them in the tsunami perhaps all of them went to the limbo or to hell because they were not baptized?
eh, it looks to me something, it looks to me a, it looks to me something barbarian eh, something, something of, something of the barbarians, eh
hmm
to think that way
it is that religion should be something lets say of, of each person, something spiritual for each one, not to put a, some rules and tell you to do this or you cannot do this and that, and it is present between in, in
a part of life so important because, today, I know very few, very few people
yes
really nobody is perfect and no one has, broken a commandment or do not, live a perfect life to to, to go to heaven lets say, then
not only of, it is not that, it is not only that, that have not eh, eh committed a sin, but every day
exactly,
eh, it is eh, it is not a
it is impossible
it is not even,is not even, well I am not so, saint, no, no that, eh I am directly the, the devil in,  in person practically for
the kind of things I do that are things that all do, it looks to me as an example, this war against, the Middle East
hmm
a thing against Muslims I have known people, I knew people when I was young, eh, Muslims, eh, they are people, like any other people
hmm
eh, they believe in a God that now to me it looks like, a ridiculous god that to me it looks like our God, I say our because I am from a Catholic family
our God is also something ridiculous each one is, it looks like a fairy tale , of creatures
hmm
and if you see the way people act every day it is obvious to me that all truly believe that it is not more than a fairy tale
aha, yes
because it is, no one follows those rules, no one no one feels bad for not going on that day no one, except of course, the sister of my, of my girlfriend, eh
she is a, eh, eh, born, born, again I think I don´t know how to say it
ah, yes, yes, yes
eh, and then she is a fanatic
ah, aha
eh, before of, of, of drinking water from a water fountain she makes the cross sign and, and prays, really, literally
hmm,
things like that and she goes to the train station and the bus station to hand out papers, telling please save your soul
oh
etc, etc, that kind that, another thing, have you ever seen a Muslim trying to convince all to be Muslim? or maybe a, have you seen a Buddhist?
ah going everywhere with, with eh
exactly
eh with, with a big belly, with, without a T-shirt sitting on something orange trying to , to, convince people to convert to, Buddhism?
yes, no
no, only Catholics right, no, not even Catholics, Christians
yes, the Christians, because the Jehovah witness do the same too, they also go to
only the Christians exactly,
and, that's already imposing the religion, is not even that a person feels a believer or has for example, my daughter, well I,
exactly
am Catholic and, and, but I'm letting her let's say grow up and that she
at the same time I, at no time, nor intention at all of insulting in any way your beliefs eh I, absolutely believe, I believed, at one time I believed, and I believe that
Hello I'm Fernanda
hello Fernanda, Alvaro's speaking, how are you?
hello how are you?
everything good and you? I'm calling from Austin, Texas
good, where are you calling from? oh wow, we were in Houston not too long ago
ah yes where are you calling me from
aha, very good from Washington
oh from Washington
yes far
and why were you in Houston, for vacations?
eh yes my cousin lives there so we went to visit but very good, and where are you from?
aha, I'm from Uruguay
okay, and from Colombia
and where are you from, from Colombia
yes and in Uruguay let's say the people I know that for example in Mexico there are many religions, they are very religious
ah not so much, not so much eh ah the official religion in Uruguay is the Catholic one but like the people are in a way quite ah open
aha
I mean yes rather like the older people the people that are older are like more conservative but the youth are like more open and like are not very good into being religious and that
religion yes, in Colombia, in Colombia the truth is that there where I know they are quite religious I think that not so much as in Mexico but yes
the same that there also the Catholic one is the mos eh the most let's say that everybody is Catholic
sure
but let's say we, I for instance am not very much catholic but most of the people go to mass every Sunday
aha, ye, these traditions have
and here in the United States maybe you loose this a little bit, don't you? because here it is no that common, right? there it is
let's say, every family for instance go to mass together, things like this, you know what I mean?
sure, ure, sure
here, very few times you have the whole family together and you have to look for a church that is not only catholic, but I've heard there are a lot
that if the father is from whatever is better, so you have to search
aha
and it is moire difficult, right? and further, after September eleventh I think that there has been a great change against the Muslims, right?
yes,but it is also because for what I have observed, here there is  a lot of religious fanaticism, but it is a somehow passive fanaticism
that may be not like the Muslim one, eh, the extremist Muslims who demonstrate and burn flags and so, but
and are there many, there where you live?
where? no no no, but I man that here there are a lot of religious fanatics among the people that call themselves Christians
yes aha
because they are actually evangelist, protestants, and so on, but have a very closed mind, and intolerant I would say
yes yes yes I think so I think so and here if you are, let's say, catholic, then that's all you can believe, right? you can't accept anything else
nothing
except that
and the rest is useless
exactly and they go against that
yeah
but I and the other religions the truth is that I don't know much but I think that here in the United States it's more for uniting I think that it it distances us a lot more
that it that there is sorry distance
it distances it distances you more to be of another religion, to have a distinctly different religion that to have one of the same, right?
yeah, yes yes I doubt it that yes
or rather you see the Muslims lets say the truth, or rather that they are fanatics you never see them let's say well talking with people who are Catholics, things like that, right?
yeah
and, it's like a lot more extreme than anything else.
yes it's true yes this here I see that there are people that eh they've gotten to the point of saying that Muslims like they are the opposites of Christians
and they would kill them in that way just seems ridiculous to me
yes and the same we say with the Jews around here for example in New York that it's pretty clear
yeah
there's a lot of Jews, the majority of people are Jews and you begin to see like an attitude that's against the whole world, you know what I mean? or rather it's not
I don't know how they associate you if you are part of a certain religion like if you personally are of a specific faith, if you know what I mean
they are like against everyone else who is not Jewish
yeah for example here, yes I know exactly what I have heard for example here in New York is that you know if you're Jewish it's very difficult to get into you now
they are it, to do business in New York because everyone's Jewish, you know what I mean
yeah it's as if they're the dominate ones
it's incredible that something like religion
yes it is like a little mafia to call it somehow
more or less and I think that Christians the less ones, at least here, right? but it you look at the Muslims it is exactly the same, you know, like
and I don't know if it is the religion or the fact that they come from the same country, and they talk the same language, right? but they are what you say, like mafias that get together and
it is almost impossible to get in
because I think that religion sometimes, in some ways, is a way of manipulating people, creating certain fears, and in many religions imposing certain dogmas
for people to attack them and not do certain things, so they manipulate them this way
and here, let's say, because many students come, let's say, from Latin families, or Arabic for instance, which are united families
and come here to study, let's say, and they are on they own, and I think that yes, people take advantage of religion to, you saw all that of nine eleven, didn't you? it was a lot of people
students, for instance, who were not even fanatics, but they took them and changed them little by little, right? and you get trapped in religion, when I arrived here
I started studying in the university and I remember that people came to me, in the beginning, and told me about some party with free food and things like this, you know what I mean?
that's the typical
and you, in Colombia for instance, you never see that
sure
they were all christian, right? and it was like obliging you to join because it was better than the other, you know what I mean? like
I think because you are never so exposed in your own country, sometimes you don't know how to handle it
it was like a kind of imposition, like, eh
yes, yes, I mean, it is not like they say, I mean, it is like they start putting it in you, you know, through the eyes, telling you it's better because
I don't know, for many reasons, and they keep calling you, it was incredible, I mean, it is really a cult rather than a, you know what I mean?
and they call you
yes, it is like those sellers that try to sell you a product and always have a different argument
exactly and I don't know if they, it's just that I don't know, it seems to me like if they give them money just to see how many people, it's amazing, I used to say, how can they waste so much time calling people
and saying you have to do this, it's amazing, I couldn't believe that and then, suddenly you are in a country that is so open
and you never expect it to be so tough about those things, no?
yes, this country is very open and well some people believe what they want to believe but there are certain groups or certain communities that are
quite closed, closed and there's no way to make them change their minds
yes, lets say, in the University for example, I remember about the Jews and Palestine.
aha
they would put up posters, it was terrible, do you understand? of the Jews that had died, no?
yes
and I mean, I think that if you want to see that you can go in the Internet and find the most horrible pictures, do you understand?
yes
but they'd put them right outside, I don't know, to me that was something that was wrong, do you understand? To see a dead child, things like that
it was shocking
I was shocked, yes, yes, yes, I think that in the end they are trying to make people aware so that they join them
sure, because they would show oh their point of view but the other side must be facing similar things
exactly
but they weren't showing them.
but yes, the religion, you know, I've never, oh, my family has never been too religious so I think that now that they are here in the United States, they won't change, do you understand
sure
because I feel like there's no middle stance, either you are into that or not, you can see the churches here, lets say in Colombia, people
you go to any church, I mean you go to the one that is closer to your house
yes
and you see the same people in the church, here people make friends in the church, you know, and it is
and
that church, and everybody goes to that church, I mean it's very intense, like they are trying to hold people in
but here, you know, church is more a circus than another thing, because first of all a lot of people go there just to make their
I mean not for spiritual reasons or some kind of religious ritual, they go there more to talk and meet people
and all the churches I have gone to here that are the evangelic kind, they are all rock and roll churches
yes, they are like rock and roll
because they all have an orchestra with keyboards, battery, guitars and they sing, and a chorus, a great show actually
it is not like, for instance, when you go to a Catholic church, there a mass is a religious ritual, here I mean in these churches
yes
eh, protestant, it is a circus or a music show, whatever you want to call it
yes, you know what I mean?, I knew a woman who worked with me and she started going to a church, right?
and besides, I think that churches do it on purpose because they also help a lot, because she told me that they had helped her, and they gave her
money for a living, but of course, on return, she has no option but to go back to that church
sure, sure
and the same people called her, and they met on the weekends, I mean, just like I told you. In Colombia a church is a place where you go to, you pray
you ask for whatever you want, and you leave, you know what I mean?
to your house
you go home and that is all you can go with your relatives here they tied you to the church and if you go to other church, horrible if you understand me so is like you are
betraying
it is like changing from one bank to another
more or least yes yes incredible, then incredible because of that. I am not interested do you understand me to go to church or anything eh so
and nobody likes anyone to impose nor believes neither things of that style
exactly and and see so like when the movie the passion of Christ
aha
so many so the Jews did not wanted to see it and fought with people I told myself so do you understand me like if
hello
Hello.
yes Who is it?
Ah, Jose
well I'm Olga, How are you, Where are you Jose?
In Nebraska.
In Nebraska, well I'm in Texas
In what part?
in Forth Worth
Oh.
well at this moment I'm in Kansas, I'm visiting but in reality I live in Forth Worth
I lived there in Sherman.
oh really
yes.
ah was that a long time ago
Ah, four years ago
then and what happened why did you return somewhere else?
Um, problems with my ex.
mm, goodness
The farther the better.
Yes that's true. Is like that
Already when nothing, when nothing can, not even the strength
well no don't they say that by force not even the shoes go in
Not even the shoes go in.
like that is good
What do you think of religion?
yes well that topic we have already touched on it before. Have you gotten it already?
No.
no well I have already gotten it in reality I think that, that the religions divide, is a religion even in one single family
Aha.
sometimes there are different members of that family with different religions
Well, yes, like mine,
ah really
No, well, I, well I'm Catholic. I grew up with the Catholic belief, and my wife, she is, she's American, and she, for them is anything, they go to one, and go to another,
I think, they don't even know what they want.
mm
They don't even know How can I tell you? I don't know they don't even know what, not even what religion they are.
they don't identify with any
They don't identify with any. And, well, I believed
yes
I was raised a Catholic, but here, where I am, I'm the only Mexican, the only Hispanic person living in this small town, so, well, we don't have any in Spanish and
I rarely attend church now.
yes well, that's true that they are divided, there's this very special religion called Jehovah Witnesses
Aha
and I feel that oh, that religion it definitely brings families apart since it's so radical, I know that they are very strict
I was attending some of them, I went to that church in some occasions  because I like the sermons, so
Aha.
they are all really good speakers.
Aha.
So I attended some and besides that I really like the, I really like what the speaker said and besides that, they give good advice and all that.
Aha.
advice, advice for your daily life.
Aha
but, little by little, they kind of suck you in,  in a way, how to say it? In a very oh
they suck you in completely in a way in which you, you only work for your church, I mean, you leave everything else, even
Aha, yes.
sometimes people, well they don't agree with some things, right? So, to me, that creates a division between them because for example, if I become of that religion, well
my children, well, they'd turn their backs on me.
Are you Catholic?
well, I was raised as one as you just said.
Well, me too
Yes I grew up thinking or believing I am Catholic but actually I hardly go to church or anything, I am not excessively devote
I have, I have noticed, I don't know maybe I am wrong, but the Catholic here where I live right now,
mhm
mm, since I am not married to my girlfriend,
mhm yes
mm, I don't know, I notice like the father, like he, leaves us out. He leaves us out because, well, because we are not married, because it is a sin to them, right?
ok, but how, how does he know?
Well, we told him, because we baptized the girl
oh ok, mmm
We have a girl, and
mhm
well, I wanted to go to, I just forgot I was not married
mhm
I didn't forget, it's just that there was a different father before
mhm
and he was so kind, such a good person
mhm
But man, they brought a different one here
mhm
and, mm, no, this no, they don't want me to receive communion or anything
goodness gracios um
And I said, no, well, I don't know,
well there it is, there it is another
I don't know what to do.
sepparation is somthing like racism, it's similar to racism
Aha.
right then
And, the, the other priest that was, he was very, a very nice person, very kind. He understood that my wife was from another religion.
mhm
He understood us in everything. But, this one doesn't, this one yes, it's like, like like discrimination, because no,
mhm
the other one was very kind, the other one said, I understand that no, he says, I understand that, if my wife wanted to be catholic, he says, I agree in helping you
in anything.
mhm
And, the other new one, no, he says, no. It's a sin, he said, it's a sin what you're doing, and that shouldn't be. He didn't even want to baptize our daughter.
goodness gracious
Because, she wasn't catholic.
mhm
So, I said, well, so what future, What can one expect from the Catholic Church?
well besides like it is not for nothing, the catholic church is very discredited you see with so many things that that, have been published of the priests
The priests, aha
yes then so many abuses, so many degrading situations that is that confuses you at least I, I am very confused because I say how is possible that priests
believers right believers with so much faith in God do that kind of things
Well, other thing that I have. Right?
hmm
Maybe I am wrong too, well, I think that they should let priests to marry, they are beings
hmm
normal, like you.
and if I, look that I agree with you like the the how are they called in others religions they do not say priests, the, the
Pastor, or something like that.
ah the pastors, like the pastors who get married, and most of the, I think that in all the rest of the churches
Aha. Aha.
they can get married, but not in the Catholic.
And, I think that, well, also, no, I don´t be to sound rude, but, as you also have needs, I think. Do you understand me?
of course, yes of course, yes, yes yes well those are needs of the, of the human being then How could a person live without those things? How can I tell you? in an nice
way or consciously consciously I think that consciously no one  can
Aha
can live without that kind of situations, is like if you deny totally to go to the bathroom, to urinate for example
Aha.
well no, he can't, it's a physiological necessity
And here I've seen, I've, I work in construction, we've worked in several churches,
hmm
and I've seen the difference of the parents, because, from the other religions, they really like the priest, the kids go with him, to, to the church,
hmm
and in exchange, working with Catholics, I see the priest there alone all the time.
hmm
He leaves, leave the church sad, talks with someone for a little while,
hmm
and yeah, with the same he returns to putting and well, as if, as if he we-, well, he's alone.
well yes in reality yes
In reality he's alone.  And,
hmm
in the other churches I've seen that they're so happy, you see then, then, the happiness that the priest brings, because, well, he has family, he has,
sure
family with him.
hmm, yes it's true like, when your necessities are satisfied then, this, it's a situation that really
Aha.
that should be reconsidered, but, and and once he argued a lot about this, and he didn't come to any agreement, who knows that
Where are you from?
I'm from Chihuahua, from Mexico
From Chihuahua. Well, I'm from Durango.
oh really, from what part of Durango
From there where the air returns, from Nuevo Ideal.
Nuevo Ideal
Aha.
Nuevo Ideal, mm
Nuevo Ideal.
well I know that there I know for example Villocamopo that the snow, that
No, is, I think that is very remote there.
eh ah yes mm then mm
Well, I'm, I'm from there, but I was raised in Monterrey I came here when I was seventeen. But, often, not often, I go there like every ten years.
ah
I mean I already don't have people there.
ah well then
In Durango, since little we went to Monterrey.
mm
To study, but no.
Ah goodness God you didn't see
I went five years ago.
Uh huh
And, i asked him/her about that, because one day, i was in a fair
uh huh
And i looked at a boy, right?, pretty "square", like we say [square as in a lot of muscles]
yes
with his t-shirt pulled up, showing his biceps and all
right
and i said, what's with that Mr?, and that boy, he seemed familiar too, right?
Uh huh
And, uh, the next day, there was a mass at the ranch
Uh huh
And then, my fathers, they're old-fashioned catholics
Uh huh
"There's mass, come on, you have to go"
Uh huh
Well, just not to get into an argument with them, i never looked at them anymore, i said "ok, let's go", this priest is the beggar that was there
Oh
And, i was like why?
Uh huh
Well, if he was walking well, very muscly
mm
and it surprised me, right, I said, You know what, mom? I'm not, I'm not going to mass, I have things to do, and then they called me that I had to pick up a cousin.
mm mm
I said, I'll go, I'll go, then, then. But no, I was surprised. I said this was the priest that was at the fair last night. What does a priest have to be doing in the fair, and then dressed like that?
mm how
And no, no.
showing off as we say
Aha, like looking to see who what he could get.
ah that the song, no, no well is that like that no, well I I was also born in Durango eh but, but, since very little we went to
Oh, yes?
to Chihuahua to Juarez City
Chihuahua.
and then I already, I already lived in the two countries, I lived in El Paso and
Oh.
in Juarez, then so
Aha.
that's how our life was made.
That.
that's how it is goodness God, well, yes that, that topic of the religions is a very, very controversial topic, because there are so many, and many and many religions, and,
and there's another word for that, What do they call it? um, they are ah, instead of religion, there's another word, sects. There's a bunch of sects that
Aha.
Hello.
Hello.
Who is it?
How are you? Adrian's speaking from Toronto. Ontario, Canada.
I'm Olga.
How are you?
I live in but at this moment I'm in Kansas
In Kansas?
in Kansas, look only
In, in, in what state is Kansas? Where?
Olate Kansas
Okay.
Mm.
Ah, Kansas is the name of the state.
Ah. really? yes, yes.
And and where are you from? Where were you born?
I was born in Durango, Mexico.
And have you lived here long?
Oh, Well, yes, eh, I've been living here more than thirty years, by here in the border of
Ah.
El Paso and Chihuahua
You've lived here for awhile.
oh, yes, a long time, and they have three
Where were you born?
yes.
In Buenos Aires, in Argentina.
Ah, okay.  And you have the, you have the little speaking.
Eh?
You have the very special little speaking from the
The, the little speaking the, the accent?
accent, yes, in Chihuahua we say the, the little speaking so it's
I've never heard anyone say it like this, the little speaking.  But it sounds nice.
yes, it it sounds funny, no?
And, and
yes, well, eh, what, what do you think about, about the topic of today?
About religion?  I don't like them.
You don't like the, the topics or religions?
No, the religions, because they divide people and
Oh. yes.
there are wars because of religion and all this.
Mm.
I don't find it bad that the people eh, believe in what they want
Mm.
but for me religion is a structure of power and is the, the churches and the, the pastors and the popes and or, or whatever they are called the, the Muslim version of that
the Jewish version of that, the version of whatever of that
Mm.
the the religions as a structure eh mm I honestly don't like, any although although none really have a bad message or
eh mm that I already know well there's no religion that says, well you have to go harm people, or something
something along those lines, but
Mm.
And what do you think of the religions?
Well, eh, look, I also, I agree with you, I feel that the, the religion divides because I was already telling Jose, to a guy
whom I spoke with for a while yesterday, from Nebraska. I was telling him that I was in, in a family in the, the same members of the family
are, as far as brothers and, and all, and, and parents sometimes the parents are of one religion and, and each kid has their own religion
then there like I see, well a separation, because no, nobody has the same beliefs none of them, then because I, I eh know families like that
that don't get along because of that? that they have They have problems because they have different religions?
yes, well they have problems because they are different beliefs, I mean, oh and, and even different practices, yes, different ways of practicing the, the religion then
A-
well really yes, there is, is a tremendous conflict I would say that if that if all the religions if we were all of the same religion I think that
that we would be more united because obviously we would be talking the same language, right? Then, this
yes.
and yes, I think, that, that the religions would unite if we were all from the same
yes, no, I don't know, eh, this is why, if religions didn't exist, if each one believed what they wanted without bothering each other, no?
Eh, yes, what happens, what happens is that sometimes, yes, hmm, I say, they don't leave you in peace, or sometimes, they bother you, no?  the
those of other religions, this is the uncomfortable situation, well that everyone wants you to believe in what they believe, so
well this is a little difficult.
Well, we- but the religions that try to convert everyone to their side, but, but it's what I told you that, I don't think belief in itself is bad.
for people to believe in something
Hmm.
but being fanatic like this, religion tries to convert everyone to their religion and
Yeah, this too
this seems really bad to me
yes yes well, that is precisely where the conflicts are, because no- no one wa- no one wants to leave the other in peace, because
according to the religion they follow, that everyone is practicing now, well according to them it's the truth.
And the best
Exactly.  Because, and, and well, eh, we're really divided for this reason.  What do you think about homosexuality?
No, that it's good.  Everyone leads their life as they want, eh, while not bothering others, eh, for me no, it's not different from religion
eh, the, eh, it doesn't bother that other people can believe what they want
Hmm.
because the, ah, and eh, since I'm not homosexual, I wouldn't like someone to come to say to me, that, that it's good and that it's bad, or
Mm.
what is correct and what is incorrect.
mm.
whether with religion or whether with the sexuality.
mm.
That, that is something that I learned, after living a while here in Canada, that
Ah.
having the freedom or having the power of saying whatever one wants implies to eh hold in many things also or put up with things that you don't like too much but
you have to, have to put up with it only because is the, the price you have to pay for the freedom or, or whatever
or something like that.
yes, is true, is true that, what you think sometimes you have to pay a very high price. That is
Yes, that is one of the characteristics of the Canadians, eh
Mm.
of, of being very respectful of the, the traditions of, of anyone
Mm.
eh, whatever it might imply, eh mm Eh , have you ever seen, how the uniform of the Canadian mounted police is?
Mm.
That are red and with riding boots and a brown hat?
Mm.
Have you ever seen it in a movie or something?
yes.
Can you hear me?
yes, I've, I've seen them, but like you say, in movies
Hmm, well, imagine that, imagine that this was
oh, where is it
like twenty years back, there was a Sikh, do you know what the Sikhs are?  They use the turban on their head
Oh, yes, yes, yes.  Hmm.
Well, there was a Sikh, eh, who went and joined the, the mounted police because it was his dream to me a mounted police
Aha.
And well, he approved the course and everything, and when it came time to graduate he wanted to keep using his turban
Oh, hmm.
You know?
yes, aha.
And e-
yes, yes well
so if he used the turban, he couldn't use the hat
Well yes, exactly.
so, what?  he, it was a whole topic here in, in, in Canada with people saying if it was good or bad to modify the mounted police uniform
eh, it's sure, so sacred and only, only because, only for respect, you know?  The religion, the customs, of a person
yes, well it's
and
sometimes I don't know
and at the end at the end, they let him at the end they let him and, and, and and if he has to use the uniform, he has a, a brown color turban
like the same color as the hat..
Goodness.
The, eh, and that, that is something that, eh, is eh, is a small story, right? but the, is the price that you have to pay
yes
so that nobody comes and forces you to put on a hat
Exactly.
if you don't want to or
yes, that's how it is.
No, I don't imagine something like that in the United States or
Mm.
in, in in Argentina or in some other countries that I know a little
Aha.
Eh, I don't know how it is in Mexico exactly, but from what they've told me, something like that would be impossible or
Well, yes, in in Mexico is very is very hard, eh, how can I tell you? wanting to be yourself, is
Because is a difference or, as little as it may be, a small thing, right
Mm. No, they don't accept it, realize that if, and if you insist in, in using that, that the majority of society didn't approve
realize that they relegate you, they ostracize you Then that, that is very well, is very, is, is a lot of cruelty there, but, well that's how it is.
yes and where you live are there a lot Mexicans or all of them are american?
In the area where I live there are only a few like two or three
Latin people
Mm
But I have only lived here for a little, When I was living in Arlington there were many Mexicans and Colombians living there
and Venezuelans
Mm
there is black people as well, but when I lived in Arlington I didn´t see many black people
Dallas is full as well.
we as Latins do not have an open mind
about Latins
and things are different? right?
it is just that we are more quite and keep things to ourselves
our ancestors were like that, so then this in our culture
we do not have an open mind
we like to keep our privacy
Mm
So that this is how one believes it but do not exercise that right
the freedom of speech and things like that
yes, so what do you think about Homosexuals?
Look, I, I, I'm not in favor of but, well I'm also not against. I respect them the same as people, as human beings, as
as citizens eh, I don't criticize them, because I think that they eh, are like are their
Hello,
yes, good evening, this is , who is it?
This is Manuel from, I am talking from Orlando, Florida. Where are you?
Manuel, hello, I am in Wilmington, Delaware, where are you from Manuel?
I am from Colombia
I see, I am a neighbor of you, Panama
and you? Oh, my pleasure
Pleased to meet you, what do you think about religion, Manuel?
Oh, well, I'll give you my opinion, I think that, like they said in the introduction, unfortunately the religions have become way of dividing
Rather than joining people
Unfortunately, right?. Well, I think, Manuel
Unfortunately, rigth.
that in that sense, eh, the factions who have used religions with that purpose are a minority, the fanatics
yes
No, because not everybody is a fanatic, and those who are normal in quotation marks mind their own businesses and don't mess with the other people
but then there are these mads who become destructive or who push you to the religion, who want you to live their way like it or not
And that is out of place, right?
aha, you are pointing something very important, because actually we should be precise, it's not the religion that is bad, because as far as I know
Right
they are all good in the sense that they talk about peace, love, integration, that's alright. It's the leaders that are bad
This are those who, right, don't complete all these precepts and more seem like zisana, they seem like a division, they seem like hate
exactly, that their religion is the only, the best
And the start to compare themselves with others, to say that this is bad, that this won't take them to
Exactly.  And I'm not, I, like, same as you, I was raised Catholic
heaven
But now as an adult who has judgment and can choose, what fits with me best, and I've become a spiritual person, I've been reading metaphysics like for five, seven years
Right
ah, and it makes a lot o sense to me.  That it's the most important for me to think that organized religion and, forgive me the term, the
The, the word that I'm going to sue is a chuleria
yes
Because they tell you that God, if you don't do what they say, father God will get angry and the only way that father God will forgive you is if you come to my church and give me money
yes, they're always talking about God the punisher who
Exactly, and this doesn't exist, this isn't right
the implacable, exactly, and it's sadder because we can see now how many families, how many towns, how many nations, ah, disintegrated by religion, religious movements
Through history, my love
Always yes, through history because you want to preach over the other
Not that for, for how many people, how many people have died in the name of religion
In the name of God, exactly, how many people assassinated, in a series, in the name of God
This is totally wrong, this is totally out of order and wrong.  But we get back again to fanaticism, the Confused or ambitious leadership
This is, and, and
what do you think about religion and homosexuality
Well I think that this is out of context, instead, because
Sure it is, church does care about what you do,
yes, well, yes, exactly, but if God, if God is good, then all his creatures, the God's children
He doesn't care
They are God's children too and so I think that in this specific case, they are people that hadn't decided to be like that, most of them
Or they have impulses or natural things
Exactly, genetics or human physiology, human physiology, they don't have control over that.
So, them, them
And so, they don't chose it freely.
so, it's something that they are not hurting anybody with it and obviously if it's someone very
they change, it's none of our business.
Well, they could be indecent and well that's another thing, but if it were by choice, then it would be different but they can't chose.
Between two consenting adults, who has the right to get involved, they are not hurting anyone.
Exactly, so yes, why don't they try to do some research among their followers and for example, if they prohibit the entrance to the
thieves, white collar thieves, there are so many of them, people that
They don't because they would loose money, they would loose money
The hypocrites, so, this takes us to another issue, most of the so-called spiritual leaders, they are in it for the business
Sure they are,
It's just business
Of course yes, in the name of God
in the name of God
To me that is, that is a sin, a sin bigger than killing fifty persons. Swindle in the name of God, what bigger sin can there be?
It's true, and, and, to the extreme, as I read the other day, of a movement somewhere, where the lady, the leader, had
To start she obliged the parishioners to purify with a kit of products, soaps and things, that only she sells
Can you believe it?
And they could only bath with those products fro the rest of their life
No, no, no
That was the initial business, and there is more
Look, I was getting hair dressed in the house of a black girl near my house, and she told me that her sister goes to a church in Pennsylvania
right?
And th-, a small congregation, without a name
aha
And the minister told them one Sunday that all the parishioners had to give him one thousand dollars, because he and his wife wanted to go on vacations
mmm my God
Just figure, I would have stand up, given him a couple of slaps and leave right then
And I guess that the, I guess that more than a stupid did it
Oh, I'm sure, I have no doubt about it
Give him the one thousand dollars
I would have dared, I would have stood up, slap his face in front of everybody and would have gone to my house. Can you imagine that, Manuel?
No but is people, is, that's what they call alienation, is Alienated people, and look that perhaps you have lived that experience because many of us have lived it, if you tried to remove their blindfold
They get mad
Ah, no they get hysterical
And they say that you are sent by the devil To change their faith
Ah, yes yes, to each their own, right,
yes but is the, is very sad when they do that with people let's say of scarce resources, still
The elderly The elderly that are alone
oh, the, or in this country immigrants, people that are working hard and the
mm For example I'm, I'm sure that you see in Telemundo, for example here
they get
Here locally, telemundo, I don't know if it's Univision or Telemundo Every Sunday there's a commercial of a church, of a Brazilian man
That every Sunday that says that is free, no, then they have the blessed rosary,
Eh, the famous church
The water from Jerusalem That I don't know what crap
Universal prayer Those are absolute scammers, imagine that they there, from what I've read, they hire actors and actresses so that, eh they impress the parishioners with their famous miracles
They are actors
This is incredible
And the guy, their leader, the one who founded that movement five years ago who is a millionaire today he became a millionaire with that and laundering
Of course
money from drug trafficking
I don't believe you
They found him in Brazil and I don't know where it is right now.
Well kid, they're in Philadelphia so you can find out
In Philadelphia?
In Philadelphia this kid, every Sunday brings a new chicherito.  But they say it's free, no, you just go, but once you pass through that door
They'll get something from you, this is sure
I think that they say that they pass the basket three, four, five times, in one rhythm, five times
No, I believe you, no, I'm more than, it's been more than twenty years since I've set foot in a church.
So
Simply because I don't tolerate hypocrisy, and I don't know and I will get hysterical
And this is, well, since the Catholic church is massive, well, the priest can't really be in your life, because this is another strategy of these small movements
they know the lives of each one of the participants, because they are small nuclei, you know when they gather, what are the costs, the incomes
Incredible
And in this way they control life with the excess of money that they give them
Incredible, with such a face
To the point where my brother met in New York, because I also lived in New York for a while.  Two brothers from Central America, who found the check from
I don't believe you
The weekly pay of the pastor, and he returned what he
The entire check
What he wanted, what he thought he should spend in a week
Oh, not my
They get to that point
Look I, look it makes me feel sorry to hear these things but there are people that seeks it
Like this
What it is founded
And he is, he was one who happened what I told you now, he tried to open the eyes of one of those guys, he knew them at work
He tried to talk to him and The guy got angry, and told him that too, that he was an envoy of the devil oh, please
Well there is, thanks and bye and he disconnected
How?
I would tell him thanks, I am an envoy of hell, thank you very much, bye and get disconnected And keep you row, you row your boat as you think.
What is your opinion about this last outrage of the Catholic church, they say they are not going to permit ah, investigation of priests
To be sure they have not had homosexual relationships in the last three years
But you know what everybody say, well you know that To fire them all
No and what are they going to do with those they have inside
Because of that No, that is too much hypocrisy, like you, too much hypocrisy, I don´t know where they want to get with all that.
It is already the top, Manuel, it is the top No, but what I don´t, what I don´t understand is why people, because like you and me
We can understand that one plus one is not equal to chair Or it is that people don´t want to know, for example my mother´s cousins
There is one that goes to church Every Sunday and she firmly believes in this and she guides Your are going to, and she is not an uneducated woman, she is not ignorant, she is not
Dumb or whatever You are going to tell me that she does not see the differences So that is what they call "blind faith"
NO, because of that is that I say, they, that, that in other words it is alienation, alienated people are like that, they cannot reason, because they are dependent of their leader
In this case spiritual
aha
And everything they are going to do is consulted with the leader, see At a point That it is unfortunately, an old classmate from the university, in Colombia
Well he is there When I went there, a couple of years ago, I saw that he was in a movement x, I don´t know which one And he is a professional and I don´t know how he fell in that, and then
I was interested in some kind, some kind of business,some,  I was interested in some kind of business
Some weakness in some place
Hello, hi, good evening
Hi, good evening, who are you?
My name is Niki, and you?
Oh, my name is Olga
Hi Olga, how are you?
Fine, where are you at?
I'm calling from Florida, and you?
I, well, i live in Texas but I'm in Kansas City right now
Oh, well, i know it's cold there
Oh, it's terrible, terrible
Sadly
Yeah, that's it
Well, yeah, we're talking about religion tonight, what do you think?
Yeah, well, i think that, in fact, religions do divide
Yes
If we all were from exactly the same religion, we'd probably be more united, but since everyone has its own beliefs, that's a way to divide, and what do you
Yes, i agree, that's a tough question because i do believe that if we all were from the same religion, we would have less, well, less wars, but at the same time
I'm in favor of defending people's religions, and this is precisely why i really believe in my heart that every person has a right to their beliefs, but at the same time
i cannot deny that every war we have, the terrorists, unfortunately
That's true, well, it's precisely a part of, because we don't speak the same language, like they say, right?
Yes yes.
Then Well the situation is the reality, although many times one doesn't want to accept reality but
Yes.
well is what we are seeing very clearly. Is impossible to deny what is so obvious right?
Yes, it's been a topic for the ages. For the ages.
That's it. Yes, well is a topic that in reality
Because of that
is always current right? It never goes out of fashion so.
Yes.
There will always be people who are in favor and always there will be people that are in the the the unfortunate thing is that
Yes.
some in some religions eh they are so hung up on converting the rest.
Yes.
Then there like well um they are violating well the rights of the other person right? I think
Yes.
Because no no no, who are they to assure that their religion is is the real one and in that of
Yes, I agree.
Yes, to try to change the mind of other people then there I think that it's an abuse to the intimacy of, of the other people.
Yes, I don't like how they think that such religion is the only path. That always yes is not fair. But imagine a world of only one religion, one belief.
Yes there would be a lot of peace and all but at the same time perhaps it would be better more patience I mean more tolerance. They could tolerate more as far as the differences.
Yes, yes, that's true. Well, and what do you think about homosexuality?
There are, well, my parents are completely against it but I think that we are all God's children and of the divine holly spirit
and they are too. Even if I don't understand it, as I'm happily married, at the same time I think they have a right, I think, I think, like any couple
I mean, man and women, holding hands, kissing just like nothing matters, we are used to that but when we see two men doing it, we are not used to that but
at the same time, I think that they have a right to get close to, have healthcare right, insurance, just like they would if they were married, no?
That's why I think it's hard because my family is against it and they think, my family is Christian and
they think that's not part of God's plan, but I, I do think we are all His children, what about you?
Well, I have the same opinion. I feel that they have their reasons to live as they do, right? OH, I think they are people
Yes.
respectable, as long as they respect the others, yes, they are good workers,
Yes.
productive people, respectful, good citizens, so I don't see why they wouldn't
Yes.
why we shouldn't let them be, I mean. They have rights too, no?
Yes, I agree. Yes, oh, what you just said is the key, I mean, respect, I think there are also lots of beautiful things that the
homosexuals have. Lots of them are artists or painters, actors or singers, designers lots of them and well, we've benefited from that.
Sure, most of them are very talented.
Yes.
In fact, oh, we've known this for centuries and centuries, now
Yes.
it is like the society is embarrassed about that.
Yes.
Imagine that, Julio Cesar was homosexual.
Yes. Yes.
Also Charles the fifth. Then well many many many many important people were homosexual. Pilate, then
Yes, yes.
then well the truth is that these things have been always be seen but lately it is like like ah ah like there has been an explanation in that sense
Yes, it is it has been a great controversy in relationship with I know many Christian Churches now have that topic and Catholic church is against it but there are many
homosexual that are good Catholics - I think they have their believes  and I am not to Who am I to judge them?
Exactly, yes yes. Well we came again to the same. It is - yes. As I tell you, if if they respect the individual rights of the rest well
Yes.
they also deserve to be respected.
Yes.
as as human beings because as you say well in fact we are all children of God.
Yes.
I suppose that well God loves us all equal, then there is not a reason for all earthly people right?
Yes.
to love more certain group of human beings. That cannot be.
Yes, I feel so sorry because always you hear of cases. I have seen in television maybe a male friend a female friend maybe an homosexual couple the husband gets sick, a couple who have been together for
decades and one of them gets sick and the doctor don´t let the other one to come in until he is too sick and that makes me feel so bad.
Yes, it is
Not to be left, I think they don´t have the same rights and the situation is very sad.
It is like that, but in this moment it is like well, in the United States they are more open in this aspect. There is a little bit more respect to
Yes.
to those couples but but it is not the authentic respect that they should give to those
people right? Then it continues to be to be
Yes.
different. They are marginalized even when when it is said that that we all are free, that we have the right to express ourselves freely, that we can do whatever we want.
That that is only a word to say but the reality is They don´t have the sane right.
Yes, that is true.
Because well see it, for example Ah What is Diego Rivera´s wife name?
Ah yes yes Frida, of course.
then well a very talented woman and
Yes.
and very strong, she was a a
Yes.
very very strong really well eh we can learn a lot a lot of her strength.
Yes yes.
She was homosexual too and well
Yes.
That's what I'm telling you, right?, not really, they don't stop being persons because they are homosexual
That's true, she was strong, she's, she's my favorite painter. That woman suffered and in that time
Oh, it's true
being homosexual was even more difficult, i think it's even harder in Latin America than here
yes
But in that time it was hard anywhere
Yes, yes, that's it. It was something similar to those who had a different religion than
Yes
or lets say catholic
yes
There's always been wars about religion, always
It's true
Because even over there with the muslims, wars about
Sure
they don't agree with this, they don't agree with that
Yeah, since the inquisition, i mean, I'm always fascinated, i mean, a lot of last names in Latin America, even mine, uh, are names that originated... or thousands of years ago were Jewish names
and because of the inquisition, they left, they fled, i mean, the queen, right?, how does the story go?, queen Isabel voted and i mean, she forced many Jewish and Muslims to convert
Or else... you know the story
Yes, yes, yes, like forced
Yes
People is unhappy because
Yes
you could get to find happiness when you're free, make your own decisions in every aspect
Yes
Every aspect of our lives, so if anyone comes and we, well, like it doesn't fit with the whole purpose of the human being
Yeah, i think that many times the danger of someone being religious is when they're a religious leader and a political one too
Uh huh
Someone that has the power of both, there's always great danger there
Oh, yes, yes, yes, because many people make a bad use of their power
Yes
So, it's a terrible problem, and besides, many wars start like that, right?
Yeah, unfortunately
Uh huh, that's right, well, yeah man
Yes, uh huh, and, what country are you from?
I'm from Mexico
Oh, i met Mexico, well, several times now, but my brother got married to a Mexican in Mexico City in Mexico, and i loved it
Right, yeah, Mexico is beautiful
Yeah and they're
Yeah, and where are you from?, oh
I'm dominican, but since he got married, we all feel like we have a Mexican family, because every time he goes to
Yes, good evening, this is Patricia, who am i talking to?
Good evening, my name is Leticia
Hi Leticia, where are you, where are you from, what country are you from?
Uh, uh, lets see if you can guess
Are you argentininan?
yes
And, where, uh, where do you live right now?
In Philadelphia
Oh, look, you're close, I'm from Panama and i live in Wilmington, Delaware,
Oh, yes, Delaware is very near here
Yes, tell me Leticia, what do you think about religion
Well, they were giving options there and, yeah, i think it unites or separates, i think it mostly separates
I think that's something, for example, there are many religious people, but that are personal practitioners, right? , so there's this crazy fanatics
yes
who are the ones that, uh, make everyone's life bitter
Yes
Oh, but if everyone minded its own business, minding your own, quiet
yes
i don't, well, there's also, there also exists, uh, politics inside religions that want to impose, because everything that's money-related, Leticia, let's be honest, right?
Yeah, logically, religion moves a lot of money
All is money and then because of that is that they want, they want to superimpose on people and tell them well my  religion is better than others, so you must come here, of course in quotes, with your money
yes
right?Eh, I was commenting earlier to a guy whom I was talking with about Colombia,I was dyeing my hair dark brown, here in Wilmington.
Um, um
And this, we were talking about religion, no, and he, I don´t know, and he comes and tells me that his sister goes to a, denomination, to a, eh, church, no, without a denomination
tells that the pastor stood on a Sunday, see, hear this, for, are you sitting, right?
yes.
The Pastor tell the congregation that all of them must give a thousand dollars because he and his wife wanted to go on vacations.
No.
Can you believe that Leticia?
No,no, no, no, no, I don´t, so, shamelessly.
Is that I would have stood up, I would have stood up, shamelessly, I would have stood up, and would have gone, in, in front of everybody I would have gone home, by bold
yes, yes.
what is your opinion, about homosexuality, in, eh, and the church attitude?
I think it is part of the old fashioned the church is in everything, so, the church I don´t know in a lot of things, not only in homosexuality
Abortion, abortion
yes, abortion, the use of condoms, the, eh well, The Christian church also should let the priests to get married, for example, to me
I think the same, how could you give me, how could you give me
Eh
eh, instruction eh, about problems I have in my marriage, if you have never been married?
Sure.
if you have no idea of what it is to live a marriage?
Logical.
No matter how much you study
yes.
Because theory is one thing and the reality is another.
yes, yes, yes, logical. No that's why, I think that church is, has stayed in the past
exactly, and I don't see what the purpose is
And No, and throughout history ,
Because what they are doing is, what they are doing is driving away the
Sure, sure, is what they are achieving, yes, yes.
For example that foolishness that the church has come out with, I, same as you was raised Catholic
Um, um.
But now that I'm an adult, I've been reading a lot of metaphysics, I consider myself spiritual
Uh, uh
And I've been reading a lot of metaphysics these last five or seven years
yes.
and I've gotten that for me, eh, is very logical
Um, um.
no, and it doesn't have that stupidity that they want to put in your head, the organized religion
yes.
Um, and simple, I simply do my thing quietly I don't bother  anyone, I don't let anyone bother me, but it's, is a logical thing
yes, yes, yes. Is that I think that precisely what fails of religion is at a level, eh, no the
the leadership, I believe that it's the leadership
I don't think the personal belief, because each one can have their own belief and that's respectable, and the, and the people can have their need to have
Exactly.
a spiritual life, and that's respectable, what it's deformed is the organization, eh, and is the, sure, is all this structure that's behind of
the leadership
of the religion, from people that don't even care about the religion
that everything is related to money
and yes, what they less care about is that
For me this has already become a For me this has already become a vulgar business.
yes.
Forgive me but for me this is like a form of prostitution.
yes, yes, yes. No, is, and, and well, they are going to lose people, I mean, is
Then they hound the weaker ones
Sure.
The elderly, the sick ones for example I was talking, I'm sure because we see the same channel, you know Sundays on Tel-, I don't know if it's Telemundo or Univision
that this Brazilian guy comes out that if you go to the church, is on Broad Street, that they give you holy water from Jerusalem
Um.
that give you well, the blessed palm, the golden fleece, I don't know what's free, but you have a lot of security that once you go through those doors
yes.
they're going to take a lot of money from you and so this Colombian kid was telling me, casually, there's a Colom- eh, there's a Brazilian, and I don't know if it's
that it was the same thing, and what he were doing was money laundering
Um.
and he fled to Brazil because the police was behind him, the law, this is why I say that well, tell them that he's in Philadelphia.
Sure.  Sure.
Have you seen these commercials?
No, the truth is I don't watch much television.
You have to, you have to put it, you have to put it on one Sunday
yes.
I don't know if it's Telemundo or Univision, but every Sunday the kid is there, it's the blessed palm, it's the water of Jerusalem that the rosary of, pirtin-piritan, that everything's free, it just comes
Um. how embarrassing, how embarrassing
Embarrassing.
It's totally embarrassing, yes the truth, in your country there are, eh, they're very religions or like, the majority
All Cath-, ah, the great majority, I would say ninety percent are Catholics.
Um, um, sure.
Now, these Catholics who don't go to church these Catholics who go to church every Sunday but just, ah, in the same church they're talking about fulanito and menganito, and looking at what the other wore.
Sure.
Sinning in the same church, no?
Um, um
Judging others, what is this, please, let's stop being hypocrites here
yes, yes, yes, yes, no, no, is the the
Do you go to church? You don't sound to me like you go to church
No, I in fact am not Catholic either, I mean, eh, I wasn't raised under the Catholic religion, I wasn't raised under any religion,
Um. I see, they let you follow your own path, to choose when you were an adult.
They let me, sure, yes yes, yes, yes, basically, and, and I continue by the path of not choosing a religion
I found out when I was already an adult I found some old papers in my mom's house, my grandmother's will
Um, um
that my grandmother had left the Catholic church seventeen thousand dollars in her will, to help a seminarian.
Ah.
I almost had an attack.
My God.
That I'm already about to knock on their doors to tell them, Give me my money.
No, no, no, how they deceive the people.
Is something incre-, no, but what I don't understand, Leticia, for example I have some aunts, some cousins of my mom, my mom is already seventy eight years old.
Um, um
One in particular, a very good lady with, a heart of gold. She goes every Sunday to church, and she goes to do her novena, and says, and the mother's days, and I don't know what
and this is not a stupid woman, she's educated, she was a teacher
yes.
what I don't underst- and it's been like this all her life, what I don't understand is how she can't discern
between what she sees and the, and what's reality
I think that there's people who use it for themselves, like a spiritual escape, like, sometimes you have to release, eh, anxieties, frustration, and
yes, to me, but when I want, yes, but when I was to release something inside me, inside of my spiritualism I talk with God directly
Sure.
And I tell him my problems and, and my anxieties, and, and what I want for me, for my kids
yes.
I don't have, I don't need an intermediary.  I don't need a translator
Sure. yes, besides, they give them the title intermediaries, but
yes, yes, yes, yes, so if you don't
Let's say, that they're intermediaries
If you don't come to my church, my church is better than the others, and if you don't come to my, uh, for, because, father God everything that you do, he gets mad
Sure.
And if you don't come to my church, and give me money, father God won't forgive you, which is all a
No, it's No, no, yes the truth that, and well, but exactly, eh, what religion has done all through history, was to hold back civilizations, to not let them advance
How many people dur- eh, throughout history have dies in the name of God
And yes.
By mistake.
By mistake, logically.
The crusades, well, they're crusades, my God.
yes, yes, yes, that´s why I believe that there is always people trying to take down other people.
to keep them subjugated and dependent of others.
We are being used by a group of people.
that is a shame, Of course.
that is good but they take the word of God as if they really had it.
No, they have an schedule
yes
then the only ones left are are us.
yes
that to me is inconceivable and unacceptable, Leticia
yes, yes.
Its been about 20 years since the last time  I went to church. The new opinion of the Catholic Church is all avre the the news.
now they are going to start inspecting those who want to be priests and they will find out if they have had homosexual activity in the last three years.
No, I didn´t know that right?
And all those who are already in there that will they do with them I just wonder?
Of couse,like child abusers, and
well, that´s where I stopped going to church 20 years ago,  when all of this came out and the attitude which they assumed was not good.
of course.
hey, Rome
yes
Right?, that they tried to put it in, uh, hide it under the carpet and, to me, you can do whatever you want, but don't touc-, i don't have children, sweetie, because i didn't want to
Yes
but don't touch the children
Yeah, logical
But i don't have children, it doesn't mean... do you have children?
No no
well, just because you and i don't have children, it doesn't mean children aren't also our responsibility
No, of course, they're helpless, i mean, they're, they're unprotected
Exactly, it's innocence in the flesh
Sure
So, for a beast, a sick person
Sure
To come, and then the church backs them up, and on top you want me to give you money?, are you insane?
Yes, yes, yes, and many times they also take advantage of the lack of education right?
Exactly, of the weak, of people's weaknesses
Yes, because we see that
Hi
Hi, what?
Hi, it's Lourdes
Hi Lourdes, I'm Arturo, nice to meet you
How are you?, Nice to meet you
Where are you calling from?
From New York
Oh, ok, you're very close
Yes, yes, yes, and you?
I'm in Philadelphia
Oh, near, yes
Yes, uh, do you have a son?
Yes, and i was trying to
Uh, well, well, well, Hello?, no
Hello?
speak
Oh, good, look, it was
Lourdes
that, I'm carrying the boy and i pressed the wrong button and i
yeah
I put you on hold I am sorry.
Oh, it does not matter.
Well look, I think that eh, if we all were of the same religion
Aha
we always would have an excuse to fight one against the others
I totally agree.
so I won´t say that religion is necessarily
Absolutely.
the reason of
No. Yes, no, it is, it is the excuse, so lets say, so the religion if, if it is something very evident and specially when you have like a
lets say, so, very drastic meetings, like, lets say, the extremist Muslims right now, in western regions, so
Hmm, hmm.
eh, it is very noticeable, do you understand me, the difference a Muslim is very easy to be recognized and, and as it could be hate in a situation like the actual one no
Of course.
but undoubtedly if don´t, if we were all of the same religion it would continue existing so much difference, because at the end religion also is what, the, what makes
it is the community that practice it, if you understand me, so the
Of course, of course.
the feature is, is who, who is following it, the, the religion, at the end we are based in the same principle
Of course.
all, that there is an omnipresent being who made all
Sure, sure.
and even then you see all the difference there is essentially, I mean
Sure, sure. And, and the other is that even, for example, the Christian right-wing group that
Mm.
that put a bomb in a clinic, for example where they provide abortions
Aha.
I mean, they are as dangerous as the
The extremists.
Muslims extremists, what happens is that the
Yes, sure.
that since we are more used to them, we don't realize who they are and and they don't wear different clothes and don't
Yes. Mm, yes, yes they are, not so notorious.
yes, you know, they have Exactly, exactly, and Oh as far as, they ask as far as the topic of sexuality
Aha.
and the homosexuality, I think that eh eh, is one of the things that that concerned me a lot that they base the hate
towards the homosexual people in, for example, in
The, the motive is religious, right?
things that the bible say. Exactly, is something that, that scares a lot.
Yes, me, the other day, I was in, in the subway here in Philadelphia
Mm.
and there was a pretty crazy man there that came, i think, from  evangelists
Uh huh
from, from the evangelist church
Uh huh
And, uh, he was a, i mean he was black, i mean, without racial connotation, right?, just
sure
well, a black person, but he was albino, he was a black albino
Uh huh, right
And this man was screaming like crazy inside the metro about the bible and religion
Uh huh
And, and, and he said
Uh huh
"watch consumerism, how it has distorted all our images about love", and he said "love is what will save your life, love each other"
and suddenly he turns around and says "homosexuality is wrong, it's wrong, watch it however you want, justify it however you want, but it's wrong"
Uh huh
And then i, then i felt like turning around and saying "wait, i don't understand you
didn't you just say love each other?
are you preaching that everyone should love each other and now you're saying that they can't love each other because it's wrong?, that's not, i mean, what's wrong with their love?, i mean
Sure
If they found love in another being from the same gender, so what?
Sure.  Exactly.
What happens is that also, I think that, for this, if I justify homosexuality, we say that I defend it
Aha.
But then it also bothers me too to see that there's also so much debauchery, you know?
Sure.
And this, this bothers me, because
But there's heterosexual debauchery too.
Exactly, exactly, it's a little the same but it's
You know
in the same way that heterosexual debauchery isn't accepted, I say
Ah.
if I have a girlfriend, I'm not going to go out in the street, and, be really graphic, you know?  In my physical relation
Sure, sure, sure, sure.
in the same way I hope that homosexuals behave a bit more socially, I don't know, like, like they understand, no?  that
Sure.
that, like, they're happy because they finally have the possibility to, to communicate it more openly, but, rightly, that they're not so
That, that they respect.
Yes, that they respect a bit, but I think that this will also be something that with time right now, every time it's a bit more smooth because
Sure.
because everyone's starting to understand, like, for example a place with cities where there's more homosexuality, where it's accepted, you see that they're more discrete and calm because
Sure, because they don't have to be
no, yeah, aha.
fighting for to, to find a place in society, no?
Exactly, yeah
and so, when you don't have to fight, well you live your life, almost normal like
Calm.
like, like everyone else, no?
Yes, that's what I've noticed.  But but yes and well this, what more can you say?
I think that that he, yes, we will understand that religions are all different paths to get to the same, the baby's putting his hand in his mouth, wait, sorry.
Take our your hand.  Eh.  That there are, that they're are paths to get to, to the human beings to
The same end.
to the same end, no?
Yes.
eh, like, like whatever they call it, no?
Yes.
God, or Allah, or a supreme power, or
Or simply death
or, or yes, exactly, exactly, or
because, because there are people who really don't believe in anything, they only believe in death and so, and so it's
They don't even believe in electric lights
yes, well, yes, who knows?
Like my mom would say.
Ah, yes?
Yes, my mom says, ah, those people don't even believe the electric light because since the, the electricity is not something that you can see, right?
How amusing. Sure. no, It just appears by a
exactly, and there already
Ah.
so, eh
But she would tell me if
if you think about it, is more the things in common that the religions have if you think about all the things they have in common
is more the things they have in common than the differences.
Yes, absolutely, mm
because they all have a code of values they all have a series of deities and of or of saints or of people eh, who they admire
Mm.
they all have a, a series of eh eh, life rules, exa-
They all have the illusion of life after death or, or the
Exactly, or, or of , or of
or the eternal life.
or an code of, of ethics, you understand me
Sure, a civil code, right? of how to behave.
one, there will be differences in the, in what the codes what the specific regulations say but in general, the fact is that, the, the religions are more similar than different
it's something that it's not always, I mean, it's not always mentioned.
Yes.
I mean, they highlight the differences.
Mhm.
instead of the things that religions have in common.
Yes, yes.
So, it seems to me that up to a certain point, it's something that people that run, that run some religious groups feel that they need to keep the power.
Mhm.
and well, it's a way for them to control that power and a way to control
That's it. Sure. The religion.
of, look, how different we are instead of
Oh, sure.
I mean, how similar we are.
Yes, the, oh, what they criticized a lot of the, the, the government of Bush, no? That he kept control through terror, through fear of terrorism.
Mhm. Sure. Sure.
and, and, that has, you can see it throughout history, in lots of different times, I mean, it's been the same.
Sure.
the only way in which Hitler was able to get so many followers, for him to do whatever he wanted was to put fear in the, of him
I mean, the Jews, they are corrupting our people, they were afraid of a foreign enemy, the Jews.
Exactly, exactly.
it's the only way in which he was able to convince everyone to do something so brutal
Sure.
no, nobody would have listen had they been told, what are you talking about?
Sure, that's crazy.
I mean, why am I going to kill them or expel them from my country? I mean
Sure, sure.
any other, but not with terror, with that factor, no? Of making them look like enemies and then everyone backed him
Exactly, look, that's one of the things that, in my opinion, I rather talk about spirituality and not about religion
Yes, no, lets call it intuition, no?
because to talk about, exactly, if we talk about spirituality, I mean, I'm I'm Catholic
Yes.
but I don't have a problem on attending an Episcopal, Presbyterian or a Charismatic Evangelic service
Aha.
or, or, to a temple, to Buddha, I mean, I
Yes, no?
because it seems to me that, oh, like, it seems to me that we have lots of things in common, oh, and spirituality is something that unites all of us
Yes, exactly, you find harmony.
well, no, I'm not afraid of it, I have no problem with, with sharing with people of different religions.
Sure. Yes, no? I agree with you.
And, and i think that by creating institutions and creating, uh, those people, you know, they're human, they're not
Yes
necessarily like god came
No, sure, no, no,
And left them flat, but god left some ideas in the world
Yes
And every group of people decided they were going to
uh, they started interpreting them as he, as they understood them and they started to make the rules they wanted
Oh, exactly
Yes, and to, and in the end, i mean, the, the bible that, that's used now in catholicism, as the word of god and all that
it's nothing more than a compilation of one of the, i mean, the, i believe it's the, Pope Pius, i don't remember, uh, but after the fall of the
Constantine, the gate and
Uh huh, uh huh
everything, and the whole Moors invasion and all that, uh, they started finding that there was too much paganism, let's
Sure, sure
say, the romans, right?, and so they said "we have to, we have to defend it somehow", so they fixed many of the practices and many of the
the, lets say, the gospels and all that, and they started fixing them so they would say exactly what they wanted, do you know what i mean?
Sure, sure, and, also, also, the omission of books
And, and you have to understand, uh huh, give things
And add, exactly
and that's what happens, so that's why, just like you, I prefer not to get too involved with the institution, and, let's say, being
absolutely Catholic Apostolic and Roman, right?
Sure
it doesn't, it doesn't interest me
And the rites too, because rites are a way of giving continuity to the institutions and so on
Yes
and it was not God who one day said, ok, these will the rites this is the agenda you will follow every time you honor me
Sure
No
Yes, and you know, I am starting to get annoyed about a thing, for instance eh I come from Mexico, Mexico City, there I lived
Aha, and my husband has a Mexican father
Oh, is he? So
Yes
Well, so, there in Mexico I faced that the society is very, mm, very Catholic
Yes, yes
Hi, I'm Alfredo and i'm calling from New York
How are you Alfredo?, you're talking to George from New York too, what's up?
Hi, very good, very good
Well, that's the subject of the day, religion, what o you think?
Yeah, uh, well, I'm with the opinion that religion causes more division than union, it's more divided, and that's it
most of the people die in, uh, uh, wars
Uh huh
caused by religion, by differences, even if they're small
Yes
they have beliefs, uh, and I'm not a believer
Um
Uh, uh, uh, in a being that wants us to pray to him uh
yes
so i, i think there may be, yeah, if there was a God i don't think he's interested in whether i, Alfredo, uh, go and recognize him, no
Um
i mean, i thin it's like a pretty humane feeling and it would be a weakness
Uh huh
A being so vain that wants people to revere to him, right?, well, I'm not a believer and i feel that religion is
Yes
harms a lot and that's not my position
Uh huh, yes, yes, i think that all of the world's religions have the same idea, right?, they have only one god, with different names, they practically believe the same
but they call things differently, in a different way, right?
Yeah, but for example there are also
and
they exclude people, for example
um
the Jewish religion, that's more a race than a religion, i mean, you're a jewish
Yes, uh huh
if your mother is jewish, if not, you're not
Yes, uh huh
Uh, other religions, for example Christianity, are you christian?
Uh huh
Uh, Christianity, if you don't believe in God, you're going to be judged by god himself, right?
Yes, uh huh
So i find it hard to believe that a God will think "Alfredo, who doesn't believe in me, but has been very kind"
his generous life, he never lies, he's honest, uh, he's gonna be damned when other
um
that kills someone but shortly thereafter changes his life and asks God for forgiveness
Yes
uh, is going to be forgiven and he will
hmm
to accept Jesus Christ, that's what the religion says, that if you accept Jesus Christ as your savior you're forgiven
yes
so it's difficult for me to believe in this, you know, and I think it's better
yes
since I believe that religion was created by man to also, to yes, to control
hmm to dominate, hmm
also to, how it's much more comfortable to think that there's this story, to think that we don't know, for example, where we come from
yes
now what happens is that I would love to be able to believe and I would love to have this
yes
eh, this curiosity satisfied, no?
hmm
satisfy this curiosity but if you tell me that God created us I have problem so, well, and who created God?  So I can't resolve the problem it keeps being
unexplained this part, so well, ah, there you are
yes I'm not
but the large part of wars are for religious reasons, do you agree with this, yes?
yes yes hmm, yes, no here they thank God every time that they win a war and at a war
yes yes
that's no more than killing people, invading other countries and not seeing how the criminals until they confess and give themselves to God ask ask that they pay well for their crimes
it's something curious, right?
Yes, yes, but it's unbelievable
that the greatest criminal is very devoted and they, right?, they pray to god so they'll do fine, right?
Yes, it's funny
Yes, i, i
well, and for example, what do you think about the christian coalition with the right, the political right of the United States'
Um, yeah, right, that's, that's something that
what do you think about that marriage
Um, that's something i came to find not long ago reading and yeah, analyzing things completely, you find that here
it's called The Christian Coalition in English
Um, yeah, right
Right
Yes, where it's said that every
So they support each other and it has a lot to do on the abortion subject
yes
since they're anti-abortion
Um
Uh, so they got together with the republicans, but the republicans also have both values
yes
they don't have values of having, for example, social programs
mm
but rather cut social programs education, health, things that are, things very against the Christian values
uh basically Bush yes
the real Christian values then
and practically Bush was re-elected by the most religious states
yes, precisely by this coalition there is between the right
it was basically because of that
that Bush is from the right
mm
ah and and the Christianity
mm
God knows and I think that for me that is very eh strange because the Christian values are not
mm
for example they are in
mm, yes, mm
I mean they support the death penalty that's not a Christian value, only God should make that type of decision, a man should not kill
mm, yes
then the truth is that for me religion is very false and eh
yes definitely
and I respect that the people believe whatever they want but when I see that they control them and see that wars are formed and see that there's
mm, manipulation
that that say in the middle of an AIDS global epidemic
yes
the pope is saying not to use condoms that really bothers me
mm yes
that's why I'm almost anti religious
and I I I well I'm atheist
I'm atheist also
yes that is my clash with God that goes
yes
yes I really don't believe in any religion I think that the religions are I don't know part of the manipulation of the state right is the way of managing the masses, mm
yes exactly
of attending mass of brainwashing
yes
and and do any act any crime in the name of religion, isn't it true?
yes sure listen then you think that the homosexuals will go to hell
yes yes I don't think so I don't think so and that is a double, is a double now is a double standard no because I think that
yes
many of the big or not the big but the senior executives and politicians of many countries nowadays are homosexuals
yes
then but so they have to be able to keep there to be able to keep votes well be covered right?
aha
yes yes yes have you noticed that? that there's a lot a lot of high officials are homosexuals, mm
mm
but well openly they don't recognize it right? because well it goes against the religious principles that they supposedly defend right?
yes
then so yes I think now I think the solution is not a single religion neither right? or what do you think?
yes sure and and that's one of the points that they also told us to make but eh eh but let's answer the question one single religion
in the whole world, do you think there would be less conflict?
no I don't think so no I don't believe that is like if there was a single government at a world level
right?
mm, it would be the same situation, mm?
yes okay
yes I was reading last time I was reading a book that talks about the different religion of how well especially when one knows people of other religions
well to not disrespect them even if you don't agree with what they practice or what they preach right?
yes
and that book analyzed that really all the religions have the same basis the same foundations but however they kill each other for that right?
eh the differences are small but when-, but
they are really very small, is more the fanaticism what leads to create great differences that really what the religion of each one is based on
and you think that automatically look for example eh the conservatives have been associated
Uh huh
With conservative religious, i mean, the conservatives
Yes
religious and the, and the politicians, right?
sure, uh huh
in the same way
but
uh, do you think the same thing will happen on the liberal side?, for example, you are a liberal person
Um
yeah, would you consider yourself a liberal?
yes
yes or no?
Yes, but that they would unite with who or what?
I mean, i want to see if the rest of the stereotype is valid with you, being active, being liberal about other stuff, for example
Yes
that you're open to homosexuality, uh, you think you can abort a, uh, do you thing that aborting a baby, a fetus, is murder?
it depends, it depends of the way it's done and the time
yes
the next day pill is now up for discussion, right?, where many analyze, they say it's an abortion, many say that it's not an abortion
Scientifically, it seems it's not an abortion, because the ovule hasn't, hasn't been fertilized, right?
yes
but the people close up and send this type of things well in one way or another scientifically they try to explain and give them a satisfactory explanation for
for for the ones that believe that is an abortion is a crime right? mm
sure me I'm obviously
but I respect, I really respect the position of every of every person really homosexuals not homosexuals I really respect the position of every person
eh what happens is that there's a type of homosexuals for example the type that is very effeminate that is very that is more woman than a woman
I say that's not a homosexual that's a degenerate, mm?
yes aha
mm but I think that homosexuals yes because really there are people that are born and since he was born has felt of the different sex right?
yes
and is a very respectful person and it's a person that that is not well openly showing that he's a homosexual and that is this and another that is dressing in an exaggerated way and kind of these things
okay are you talking about when they march or in general?
the case of the homosexuals, what?
when they march on the street?
no not when they march, no in general look for example we are talking of beauty at least I'm Colombian I don't know from where ah one sees for example the hairstylists or yes
they are very effeminate, I mean they are beyond effeminate are more
yes
are more effeminate than a woman, mm?
Good evening, Patricia speaking.  With whom am I speaking?
You're speaking with James, Patricia, New York
James, good evening, I'm in Wilmington, Delaware.  What country are you from?
I'm from Panama.  And you?
Me too.
Don't tell me
yes
don't tell me
Tell me, do you think that religion is used to divide or to unite?
it depends, it depends Patricia, it depends because, um, I think, for example yes, if, if you're Jewish and I'm Christian and we get married, we will have to unify, there will always be the separation
but if we get married and I'm Jewish and you're Catholic and we get married
so yes
I imagine that as adult and intelligent people
aha
before getting married, this topic must be resolved
resolved, yes, but, at the beginning for example, I went out with Jewish people and the topic never came up, until, until after the relationship had already advanced
aha
so, I'm seen cases, for example with people who haven't ever brought this up, and when the kids come a separation forms
there's a lele, lele
yes, I go, or he brought him to the mosque, or he brought them to the temple, or he brought him to the church, you know, and I've always seen this in interracial marriages
more than anything, then the religion unites us when we are of the same belief, but when we are not of the same belief like it separates us, like it separates us a little
I think that the organized religion is good to unite, right, but then within each let's say organization, within each organized denomination then there are these fanatics that exist
aha
who are the ones who cause the social discrepancies
aha
right, whether is destructively like we see with the extremist Muslims
yes aha
eh like we see with the born again Christians, according to them, that they want, they want to stick their religion down your throat, whether you like it or not
aha
I'm also, I think that the religious leadership of all the denominations are the ones that are wrong because they have their own agenda which is based, first of all, mainly on the money
um aha
eh, God, doesn't like, according to them God doesn't like anything you do
yeah
and if you don't come to my church and give me money, God will not forgive you
yes
well that's totally wrong
yes like you say
me just like you was raised Catholic already as an adult I stopped going to church in the eighties when I saw the attitude that the Vatican assumed with these priests that were molesting the children
aha
and for me that type of conduct is totally unacceptable, because despite the fact that I never had kids intentionally I don't want the say that kids, my neighbor's kid, are not my responsibility also
exactly
the security, the child is not also my responsibility
um
then when I saw that attitude, I said, well until here I came with these people um. I am spiritual, I am not religious, I do not go to any church
I talk to God in the privacy of my home
aha
I tell him my problems, anxieties, my wishes, I want this and if it is the best for me, if it is what you want, you are going to give it to me, I do not have a doubt of that
aha
but then that people well they want you but I think this is more a brainwash that they give you at church and then, go and convert more people so they could bring more money
aha
What is you opinion about the Vatican´s attitude, eh with relation to homosexuality?
well I really disagree with that yes
that is a dumb thing
yes they take, if they want to follow the, the Catholic bible, Catholic bible has some verses that forbid all that homosexual activity
then where, where, where are we going? because there are verses there
no but you know the last thing they have said
tell me
eh, everyone who wants to be a priest is going to go through a psychological test to see if he has had homosexual activity
to me that is a, that is the most absurd thing that I have heard in my whole life, I don´t know what are they going to do with the ones they have inside
yes exactly, because they are not going to show anything in the test, the test is not going to show anything
Of course, of course not
And the, the, what it's going to do is take the catholic church to a depra-, no, not to a dishonor, to a, a
they're no only going to have frustrated homosexuals in the closet
Right
but they're also gonna have a little bit of hypocritical liers
exactly and
So, what's the purpose here?
The, the, i think religion is, religion is something that separates men, honestly, yeah, it separates men
you think?
and, like if i had a different opinion than yours it could separate us regarding something
not necessarily, i think that's the individuals mentality and, um
i think that the belief
the degree is not necessary, the education degree is not necessary, although it does help a little bit, even though i only have a high school degree, a high school diploma, but I'm a person that has read a lot about
yes
i have tried to, to take advantage of every opportunity that god has sent to me
right
right?, and i don't consider myself a dork despite that
yes
uh, but if you and me, if i see that our religious beliefs, and i don't bring the subject, if i want your friendship
Uh huh
So, i know it's a subject i must not bring up, like politics
yes, exactly, but there will always be, uh, there will always be, there will always be a matter that lightens this up
right?
I mean, lets, lets say you don't eat pork because of your religion
right
And i sit at the table and suddenly we go to a restaurant, and i order that, so you'll get offended, do you understand?
but the, the belief, yeah, the belif
No, i don't think it's like that, uh, James
Yes, the, the
that fr example if you invite me to your house and you know that i don't eat that, them because you're the host and you want to invite me to your house, you would make an effort not to serve me pork
Um, right, the belief itself, the belief of, for example i have Jewish friends, i have Muslim friends and i respect them in a way, i have gone to
me too
to places with these people and, uh, i eat what they eat, even though i don't like it
Exactly, but thank god i come from a poor house, i eat whatever they put in front of me
Right, so, but there are people, i mean, rel-, for example the belief of not only one god, but a trinity god, make us, uh, gets us closer
but religion, by submitting us to a certain
but that's organized religion, you see, they have their own agenda
Yes, that's it
And it's mostly to get our money
Uh, so, we, an organization that practically wants to submit us to a pace they can't even
Subjugate, the word is subjugate
Yeah, that not even they can, they can
they can't live up to the standards they imposed themselves
Exactly
that they impose to the population themselves
so the belief unites us, but religion separates us
it separates us, exactly, i completely agree
That's what i think
do you think that if there was [only] one religion, would that be the best?
If there was [only] one, no, i don't think so
Me neither
But that, if, but the, the individual, like you say, you don't have your religion but you're spiritual, i, i think I'm on the same plane, i believe i'm spiritual, i believe in god the father, the son and the holy spirit
I believe that Christ died on the cross for mankind
exactly
i believe that, i believe that you [can speak] to him or the father without, without having
i don't need no translator, i don't need no intermediaries
That's it, exactly
And like told you before, specially not one that charges me
and i read my bible, and if i have to go to the church, i go to the church, if i have to go to another church, i go to another church
but the belief in me is towards, it's god, it's, it's
exactly
and and I don't have anything against other religions, however, if they start attacking the other religions, then I do get away from that
I leave,
you understand, well, so I say, one has its beliefs but religion separates people
I'm look, this is the first time that I've ever heard this and I completely agree with you.
Panamanian, you are a Panamanian, I believe I had to discuss that same subject with someone else when I first started with this, oh yes, yes, yes, he was a guy from Canada and he, he didn't agree with that
I believe that we had to discuss this subject but when I started to talk about homosexuals in Church
aha
oh no, he was the one that touched on that homosexuality subject
and he went ballistic
yes, he told me, I told him, you are Catholic, let me tell you something, bring your Catholic bible over here and tell me, find one versicle that is clearly against homosexuality and he told me, that the homosexuals
or the people that sleep with other men are not going to heaven so
and he told me that lesbians
no, no, lesbians
that's, I've never read anything like that in the bible, that book was written by other men
oh yes, the bible was written by men but it was inspired by the Holly Spirit and I'm going to tell you why I think this way
that's right, so, for example, I quite sure that there were lesbians back then
and if you think about those times
so, why didn't they talk about it, in that sense
oh well, I believe, I believe that there must have been but it doesn't mentions lesbian but it does say that people that have
homosexuality and that's it
that, aha, yes, that has changed the natural use of women, that has changed the natural use of their organs
I see that it's not for gener, but for eh, eh for
yeah globalization, generalizing
that you have that, that eh there is no, I don't know what the word is, that you have that inclination
yes
they don't speak of men, or women, but about the inclination
exactly, so, not only, I don't know if you ever read Somos, eh, Somorra, Dmoda and Gomorra
yeah aha, Sodom and Gomorra
Hello
Hi, my name
uh, my name is Gloria, from here, California
Oh, nice to meet you Gloria, i live in Toronto
Right
Yeah, and, well, religion, what do you think about religion?
Well, to me, my personal opinion, i have gone to a lot of churches and sometimes there's a lot of racism, a lot of discrimination, right?
racism, in churches, uh, i never knew
Right, i, yeah, i have attended one here where i live, and they're always looking if you're well dressed, how are you dressed, if you have a car or not, so
sometimes it's only good for, to alienate you from the knowledge of the
Right, that's when religion is fake, right
Believing in you, right
What church do you go to?
i have gone to like, what's commonly named christians, evangelical a lot, right?
Right, right
But not all of them are the same, because
No, no
i have gone to others too, where the love shows, well, just going into the door, the person welcoming you is very different, right?
It's true, it's true, yeah, like you said, i go to a church that's called Jesus of Nazareth, it's international
Uh huh
sometimes people rather humble and too preppy
yes that is truth
some people do not know of humility, some people are very friendly, their hearts are noble and good.
mhm yes
I've also had people who have differences
There are religions where you cannot say your opinion as the Catholic and evangelical.
I have not visited any other church, only the Catholic and Christian
okay
I can not say that all are equal, because if I had the support of some of them
okay
when we feel bad, we always look for someone with more knowledge
okay, yes it feels good to go to church
mhm
the churches have their own opinions about themselves and always confuse people.
confuse it with that, mhm
I think one has to personally read the Bible
yes
some people say that it is dificult, but
the scriptures say it because they will find eternal life
yes it is truth
So, more than anything the bible is our guide.
It's true, it's true because
Because religions let's say that oneself, the same man, let's say, has put a division in the religions, but God is only one, no.
And to me- it doesn't seem that, sometimes there are religions like the witnesses, the Christians, sometimes they give one to the other, they say that they believe better than the other group.
hmm, hmm, hmm
it doesn't seem this way to me because when God comes he won't come to religion but to people, right.
hmm,
to the hearts of the people because I think that people in all the groups that there are who have a love and obedience and a fear of Jes- of God, right.
hmm hmm
So it's that on the final day and I don't think that it will be a religion but it will be in the hearts of the people.
It's a part, I don't know, but maybe I need to study the scriptures more, or read the bible more fully because sometimes when you go to a church and they preach something, sometimes you get scared, I've been one who has listened to something, and my God, and you see that night and I, so.
So it's good to read to not get confused.
aha, aha,
because I've heard many predictions that say that wolves were come dressed in sheep's clothing.
It's true, and they will say that this is who I am and not to trust them, and
Right, aha, aha
and this is why we as Christians, have the responsibility to read the bible.
We have to prepare ourselves.
yeah, we have to prepare ourselves by reading the bible so they don't come and trick us, to know which he is
yes
you know what's true, what's attached to the word of God.
hmm
yeah eh, And do you think that they use religion to marginalize?
eh, no no, not religion itself, but those who go sometimes to the church
ah the people.  To marginalize groups like
eh, eh, I've seen many case, I'm not, let's say, a millionaire person but I'm not on the street either, thank God he has always protected me.
aha
but they always say, how much do you have?  These people.  And since there's always, in a church in a religion, like a house of prayer, there are always people, always weeds there as they say.
oh yeah yes
true they're not doing things like they are in reality.  So I say, to go to see what bad faces or to go and do less of whatever, I say, better to stay at home and no one will look down on me.
Ah in my mind I ask God to protect me, to go with me, and
yeah
everyone says that you have to, right, clean your own house.
yeah but I really don't pay attention to these people who talk badly.
hmm
because they can't be a stumbling block for you.  Don't let them, you keep,
yes so
searching, keep looking for the truth.
hmm
Ignore them, say hi to them to be nice, ignore them, better to pray for them that they don't keep giving a bad example to the non believers, the non believers can think, oh, this is what Christians are like, like you, why should I go to the religion, better to stay at home, but
mhm m hm, maybe it is wrong, right?, not facing the situation and asking God for
of course, because even if you ask for the person or try to teach them, rigth?
mhm
but anyway, do you think that the Bible condemns homosexuality in religion? It is true, the Bible condemns homosexuality
That's why God made both men and women
yes, that's right
When He cre- when Adam and Eve where in Paradise, it was a man and a woman, it was not two men or two women
come on
But, you see, here they have already approved, eh, here in California that homosexuals can already marry, so,
oh, here in Toronto it was the first city, after Europe, Toronto has been the first city to approve
aha, so, I think that we are already living the last times, right? the last days
yes, it is terrible
when even the sons rape their mothers, eh, hit their fathers and so on, we are already living the end of times
the situation has truly become
yes, yes there is discrimination, right?
yes
about homosexuality, yes a big discrimination, we are nobody to judge but it is not normal to the eyes of God
yes, almost all religions condemn it, right? I think that Muslims, I had had the chance to talk with them, condemn it, there is no religion in the world that approves
mhm
and I have seen that in the Catholic church there are
And there are priests, that there's a priest who is homosexual.
priests, aha, homosexuals, yes imagine, how they pervert the
yes I mean that, for example no,
the word of God, aha, is terrible right. yes, so, the world is collapsing, the religion,
uh, we are seeing things, never seen before,
Yes so, the religion is a medium of, of discrimination I think that yes and I think that the false religion will make mistakes, remember that the religion,
we is you know for all the human beings.
mm
is governed, is ruled by the human beings, and the human beings are so imperfect that
mm yes there's nobody who's perfect.
and, and that, and that yes there is a religion in which the discrimination is very open and that then is wrong. because is not like that because remember that Jesus came for the sick ones.
mm
And then that religion is false one has to study, scrutinize, and withdraw move aside and search, but now since there are so many is quite confusing, here in Toronto there are a bunch of churches one doesn't know where to go already
Everywhere is the same, there's a lot perhaps a lot let's say from the part who has more humility to the one who doesn't have,eh, I don't know that honestly I say that the place they are using, the place that they are using, they should leave it to someone who really needs to search for God
yes, yes, is true
But mm I can't give my opinion about the rest of the religions because the truth I haven't, attending anything, the one I did attend once, was that of the Mormons.
oh
then I did see that they celebrate Halloween night they find a celebration for everything, satanic things, for me is not normal, being
oh The Catholics also celebrate Halloween
but what good is it then being in church, perhaps they mistreat the woman, they go to inappropriate places.
yeah
well then we are fooling are ourselves
yeah it's that eh, in the catholic religion remember that when they forced it on us eh, it was because they forced it upon us, the colonizers forced it upon them it was one of the first religions that arrived
mhm
eh, the pastors, the priests, the parishes were those who could read the Bible, the people couldn't read. And that's how the Catholics got used to going to mass to listen and continue mass, and Sunday yes it's that we feel remorseful so we go again
mhm yeah mhm the only day that they go is Sunday
and then Protestantism was born
it's the only day that they go to Church that they need a Chuch it's on Sunday
the Catholics, yes, yes, and after they continue with their lives, there's very few that really enter into a full religious life so then they don't know what, they haven't come to understand that for example that the saints don't exist
they shouldn't
no well they have to worship images, if everything is devlish, it's all like surrender and pledging to the enemy, right
eh, to pray to the sure, and that, and that Halloween is Satanic. yeah, yeah that's true, there's even those that
mhm
Hello
Good evening, this is Patricia, who am i talking to?
Patricia
Viviana, what country are you from and where do you live?
Oh, I'm from Mexico and i'm in Baltimore
I'm from Panama and I'm living very near you, in Wilmington, Delaware
oh, near, near, i just moved from Philadelphia
Oh yeah?
So i was even closer
Tell me Viviana, what do you think about religion, do you think it's good to unite or for creating discrepancies?
Uh, to cause discrepancies
You think
Yes
Look, i just talked to someone who made a lot of sense up to a certain point. That the belief in god is good for uniting, but that organized religion is the one who causes discrepancies
Yes, that's exactly what i think, i mean, i was raised catholic
Me too
But yeah, well, we're Latin
Uh huh
But long ago i decided to move away from, uh, to move away from organized religion
me too, sinche the eighties, i consider myself a person, I'm spiritual, i'm not religious
Right, me too, and i mean, i believe in God and everything, but
Exactly
I don't have to go tell him my secrets
Exactly, i don't need, i don't need a translator, i don't need an intermediary
Right
I do my things at home, quietly, respecting others
Uh huh, yes
I talk to dad-god and i tell him of my anxieties, my problems, what i want him to give me, and i leave it in his hands
Yes, that's, that's exactly what i mean, i have a son, i have a young boy and i pray him an "our father", but to take him to the church, no, i don't want that
Exactly
Yeah, right?
No, NO, he as an adult can form his own
Yes
his own opinions, and what do you think about homosexuality and the Christian church?
Oh, well, look, about homosexuality, i think that, i mean, if we're all equal before god's eyes, what does it matter?
of course we are, of course
I mean, my, i don't understand what's the problem
Me neither
in, in, in what, what, how does it affect people
If there are, if there are two adults that love each other
mhm
they respect each other, right? whatever they do in the privacy of their room, if they both agree, whose business is that? My goodness
mhm and
I think that, that organized religion is just money
yes, right, yes
it's just about money
For instance, the Catholics, the tithe in Catholic religion you must pay ten percent of all your earnings
Can you believe it? let me tell you something that will make you fall backwards, I was hairdressing a black girl here in Wilmington
mhm
And we were talking about religion, spirituality and so on, she was like you and me
mhgm
She was telling me that her sister goes to a church with no name in Pennsylvania, and one Sunday the father told the people that
they all had to give one thousand dollars because he and his wife wanted to go on vacations
ha, and what did the sister say? Or the cousin or whatever
she was dumbfounded
oh, but what happened?
what a rogue
and did the people, did the people give him the money or just quitted?
I don't know, it seems like the event, the collect had not taken place yet
oh
But you imagine this audacity Viviana
Well yes it's a horrible audacity for each person, well, where they want to go.  And for how long besides but to me it's ridiculous, no, I don't
what you saw in Philadelphia, you know you have, you see the Spanish channels, Telemundo and univision
ah y es
And you know that on Sundays there's a Brazilian talking about a church, about services in a church on Broad Street
yes, yes, yes
And every Sunday, they give the rosary of the thousand shrines, yes, no it's the rosary, it's the golden palm,
yes
or the water of Jerusalem, that's all free.
aha
But so eh, you and I know that once you walk through that door they will take your money.
hmm
so last night I was talking with a Colombian boy who lives in Florida.  And I was talking about this, and he was telling me that he knew
of an individual who they threw, who was fleeing Brazil because the law was running after him because he was in these activities.
ha
What he was doing was money laundering, imagine.  I come and I say, well, I think that this kid in Philadelphia
Is the, is the one I'm thinking of, it could be the same
It could be the same.
ah, what a small world
Look, I say to people because I'm open like this, don't
Uh huh
Yeah, some people want to die in front of me or want to kill me, but i tell them that no one is going to screw me in the name of god
Well, no
To me, that's a more serious sin that if you killed fifty people
Uh huh, uh huh, no, i, if they ask me for money i laugh very hard and i don't give them anything
Exactly, no, i, i get out of there running
Uh huh, me too, besides
I don't, i don't even give them time to laugh, i run out of there
Yes, and besides it's an offense
What do you think about...? please
And the, the, the worse is, and the sad thing is that Hispanic or Latin American people, whatever you want to call them, aren't very educated
Uh huh
they give them money
Uh huh, uh huh
And that pisses me off a lot, because they're
it makes me hysterical
Because they're taking advantage
They're taking advantage of people's weaknesses
But, but, also most of the people that do give that money, well, you can't reason with them because they believe in their heart
that they're doing the right thing
And I respect them
mm
But don't come asking me for money.
ah, listen and the Jehovah witnesses that come knocking on your house
I don't even want to know.
ah
I don't want, I imagine, here they don't come thank God eh, in this neighborhood but I in Florida
mm
When we lived in Florida they call every weekends, after one kills oneself
ah and then they don't want to leave
from Monday to Friday, that you want to sleep a little on the weekends to come knocking on the door Saturdays at seven.
mm mm
in the morning then I would put Friday night, a sign outside my door, that said I'm Catholic, look what a hypocrite
so they wouldn't come to bother me
And they didn't bother you
imagine that my husband is Danish, no, and he was telling me that once they came to do this once when he was in his country.
mm
And I know that he got to a point that he got so mad to the point that one day they knocked on his door and he took of all the clothes and opened the door naked.
ah
And that they left running and never again knocked on the door.
Uh, it's hell there, the devil is there, i don't know, oh, so funny, so then i tell them "i'm not interested", and i close the door, my
husband, oh no, my husband
where's he from?
he's American
Right
but he's very cynical, uh, he stands there and whatever they say to him
oh God, oh God, he gives, he gives back
yes, and there's, i have seen people that, i don't know how he does that, they really stay silent and don't know what to say to him
And i laugh, and at the same time i say "i wish i was like that", uh, being able to get my own answers, very
the, the schools
my very cleaver answers and very, uh, very logical with what they tell me
I don't have time for people like that honey, and, for example, do you think religion serves to unite or to separate?
Oh, well, no, i think it separates
me too, i think, i think it's
it separates people too much
the, the organized religion, who has it's agenda
Uh huh
and the agenda is "we have to fill the chests no matter what"
Uh huh, yes
"oh, these idiots will sustain us no matter what, one way or the other"
mm Patricia, remember the last inquisition
remember the crusades my love
aha, like all the people who killed
all the people who died in the name of religion simply because of the leadership
yes for hmm
For human greed, because at the end of the day we're all human.
Well yes, I don't understand because, like, if they want to pray to their God, do it in their house, like
sure, sure, and don't try to impose
I don't understand if people who are always, who want you to talk with God, who want you
For example
hmm
I won't subject myself to anyone because I simply won't give them this authorization.
hmm
What do you think, for example, about the different religions, if you think that, that there's a difference, eh, in this saying and that, this thing that we're presenting these days
About Muslims
Not only Muslims, for example the Jehovah's witnesses, the, eh, I attribute this to fanatics in each individual denomination.
uh-huh, the, they're the
You're going to find crazy people everywhere
exactly, and there are people who are really fragile or really weak, they can be controlled really easily
they, exactly, they can subjugate
So, there's always people that
and those are the ones that get brainwashed
Uh huh, uh huh, and they don't let them
Because that, to me, it's a vulgar brainwash
Oh, if i told you, my mom, my mom just went through cancer
Oh
And, uh, and she was dying on us in the hospital, and i said, the doctor said "if you don't give her a blood transfusion, she'll die"
Right, uh huh
And the, my mom's witness is a Jehovah's witness
Uh huh
And well, he did everything he could to stop my mom from getting the blood transfusion
Oh, i can't believe you
Even though, even though the doctor clearly said "if we don't give her the blood transfusion, she'll die"
She dies
he said, "no, everything is in god's hands", uh
And since the husband has the legal power
Right?, we immediately, very smart, very Mexican of us
Um ,that
we all went and, all of the five children flew to, to where my mom was
That
eh, immediately we threw him out
well done
no, if you would've bee seen, no but, I mean I can't believe all the drama that happened just because
because he felt like it
aha, and that he's a Jehovah witness and since he's a Jehovah witness, let your mom die because is in God's hands
no, I can't accept that
ah ah my God, no I just, just hear Jehovah witness and get
God forgive me but perhaps I would've killed him to get him out
no you should've seen poor him I even felt bad the last thing, I talked to security, they took him out of the hospital, well
you have to do what you have to do, with people like that you have to go to extremes.
mm, mm
so you do what you have to do, and your mom
Good evening, good evening it's Patricia. With whom am I speaking?
Silvia good evening Hi Patrcia, Silvia
Silvia, good evening. What country are you from and where do you live?
I live in the United States, in Indiana.
And what country are you from?
Eh I'm from the United States.
And your family. What are your family roots in Latin America?
oh, I'm Mexican, but my grandparents are from, from Michoacan
Are you, are you a Mexican?
yes
I was born in Panama and I live in Wilmington, Delaware
oh, that's nice
You are, Are you called Rosa?
No, Silvia
Silvia, forgive me
oh, no that's OK
Silvia. What do you think about, do you think about religion, does it unite or divide?
For me, I say that it simply divides there are differences and opinions. Even though there are a lot of religions that have made the effort to unite us
and to have general opinions anyway, continuing onward, to me racism or the divide between the opinions especially when it comes to be your turn, to speak about
for example if someone believes that yes Jesus Christ was actually a person to, that he walked on the Earth, that God made him, there are quite a few religions, well then if that was all for religions then we would all be in agreement right,
I think that the basic foundation of religion, is to believe in God.
um uh
eh, it unites us, but that the religion organized by the leadership, of the organized religion that of course have their own agenda that's the one that divides us.
um exactly, you've said it well
that each church, say that they are the best. And that God that all you do is bad.
uh uh
Especially the Catholics.
Especially.
And that if, and that if you don't come to my church and give me money, God will not forgive you, well we all know that's nonsense.
exactly
no,
Yes because, the government gives money and I realized it.
What they want is money, mamma.
Is true because what I've seen, my job, I work selling insurance, right
aha
and for us to sell insurance, the old person or the one that has little money then one has to go to church to see if well, so that big groups meet and have
there is where, they, they the organized religion seek out the weak ones.
um exactly, because they are looking for someone,
someone who has some weakness, whether it's age, disease, lack of education.
um uh um uh
So those are the ones they go after
Exactly, i agree
Minorities
Specially when you have a financial need, well, you go to church and they feed you, they can
I'm not, I'm not religious, like you, as a Latin american, i was raised catholic
Uh huh, yes
But now as an adult, i left the catholic church in the eighties when these things about the priests molesting children came up
Right
I saw the attitude that the Vatican assumed, and i said "this is as far as i go with you", and that was over twenty years ago
Uh huh
It's been twenty years since I've set foot in a church
Yes, my mom came from Laredo, Texas, she came in a winter because there was a lot of work, so she created a family on the fifties, but the first place where she landed, i believe it was the catholic church, right?
oh, holy...
And she heard over the heater, we call it the "calentón" [heater], that
right
uh, the heat was provided by
the heate-
it's a heater that provides the steam, well, the heating
Uh huh
in that building that was a church
um
you could hear the screams
the heating
yes and there you could hear all the kids moaning, crying, screaming
I don't believe you
and my mom would notice and she would complain to the priest and would tell him
and nobody paid attention to her.
Yes, what is saying, what was happening said. Don't worry my child, that those kids
were already into the thing
he, was
Imagine
he would say no, don't believe it my child those kids need, they are naughty, they need discipline, don't worry. She went, investigated and saw that they were molesting them
I don't believe you
And she left at the time the religion But she attached herself to another one, but really she
There are people that have that need of being guided, when I left the organized religion
um uh
Well I went through a long time, that I was well, searching, searching my emptiness. And since five, seven years ago I've been reading a lot of metaphysics, which is logical.
um uh Oh, yes, yes
Is logical, this is logical.
It fascinates me, the same
God loves us all, no matter what you do, we all go to heaven, because there's no other place, I'm convinced that hell is here on earth, here is where you pay for everything, that's called Karma.
That is true, here we suffer a lot.
Ah, here is where you pay.
um uh
And you see it daily, my dear, you see it, I witness it
is true because what I've seen.
What do you think of the religion, especially the Christians? That the attitude they have assumed with the homosexuals?
uh uh I think
What do you think?
I think that really, I think. That is a difference to, in the being itself, I mean, that in one's own body, is different, I mean that they can't
that the people, that that's a physiological difference.
Correct, then they can't, change their situation, they can't control it.
control
They already have that
There are some people that opt for this life.
that, yes
And I've known people like that, that have been abused.
um uh
Emotionally, psychologically, physically by the opposite sex. And in search of love. They have found a person of their same gender,
um uh
that they have offered this and have changed, right.
um correct
And I, I think that what is done in the privacy of a bedroom. If for example is a couple of the same gender where there's love.
Where there's respect.
uh uh
What they do in the privacy of their bedroom, where there's mutual consent between two adults
um
what does religion have to do with that. They are meddlers.
Correct. Because they are people who don't bother anyone, rather
That they don't hurt anyone.
correct and to me. Oh, they are knocking on my hotel, I work in insurance
aha
Who is it? Hi, Asia I'll be right over, I'm on the phone I'll come up Okay, Thank you uh, is that I'm at work and they have me here,
ah, I'm not even dressed, I have on my nightgown. One moment.
you are going to go up with the nightgown girl Knock on the door with the nightgown and say that you are a Jehovah witness
Yes aha and will leave right
Imagine that I'm - I'm married to a European.
That's wonderful
And he was telling me.
Thank you Asia
He was telling me that, eh you know how
look - Don't look at my hairy legs. I'm so excited look they are bringing me a refrigerator here
Ah how nice.
That we, ah because we I haven't had
See mama, see mama that is love
ah yes,
individual, that you don't need religion.
wow, yes because eh, eh, that is, the idea that. How many people do you think that in reality? have to get together with one I say for one
in reality have a good relationship with Thank you so much Asia, Bye, ah, we've stayed, well. For me if you have a good relationship with God one goes in private to ask, ask whatever one wants Right?
Sure, and eh, no, like I was telling someone previously,
And uh
I do it in the privacy of my home.
Exactly.
I don't have to announce it to anyone.
um uh then no
I don't need an interpreter or a mediator. I tell God my anxieties, my problems, my desires. And I leave it in his hands, that's I'm convinced that if is,
uh
for me, he will give it to me.
How many times have we seen people that comment as far as their time in need that is life or death are asking God to help them?
That they only remember God when they need something.
And it happens to them, what surprises me a lot, is that each time that in television appears a person telling that in a moment of need I asked to
well, they say it was a death person
I think those are actors, the ones from television.
There are some, many yes, but one person, for example recently there has been on television, a person who lived in California, by the beach, very close to the beach
it rained a lot and a mountain felt over the house, the lady asked
Yes
To God for help, then in the mind of his girlfriend that was living in city about twenty minutes outside
aha
He had a thinking, he worried a lot about his girlfriend. Then he came despite what was happening. Even the police forbidden  him, to cross the street and he tried to reach there.
And the man went.
He went and saw exactly, the lady was calling him and she went out.
baby that is illumination.
um uh
see it. That was not her moment, I think that, that, death is like, like a lottery, is like a bingo, when your number appears, it does not matter what you are doing, you can be having a bowl of soup
um It is your turn. That is.
And if, your number appears, then you go.
Um uh yes because don´t have, it is waiting, you don´t know when will be your turn but, I have always think, what a thing, when you
you hurry, old age. but it is what well, when we need one, because I was raised in a very strict religion.
to,
Catholic?
It makes me laugh when I talk about the Jehovah's Witnesses, believe me, Oh how rigid! none of the holidays could we
oh no
be invited, it was a cruel life, specially for a young person
Oh no
Then we were many, we were seven in the family, and there were quite a lot of bad moments because they were very cruel with us, but then, if you
good evening, this is Patricia, Who am I talking to?
hello this is Yolanda. Patricia.
where are you from and where do you live?
I am from Texas, I live in Texas.
Is it a Mexican Family?
Well, since many generations we are from here and you?
I was born in Panama and I live in Wilmington, Delaware, In the East Cost.
Oh, okay. Wilmington yeah, is it cold over there today?
horribly
yes, we
what do you think of religion serves to unite or divide?
well, it serves for both, but divides people who does not believe the same.
oh, right now we have the situation of Muslims and Christians.
the Muslims
Mhm
the foundation of all religion is to believe in God.
okay.Mhm
It is what unites us, what divides us.
okay
what divides us is the organized religion
Correct, yes.
what we, what divides us is the individual leadership
yes.
and the fanatics, inside each denomination.
Hmm.  yes, aha.
These are the things that cause problems, those who want to put eh, eh, their religion in you
yes.
as a place.
Aha, yes.
and so, the leadership of organized religion, I think that each one has its agenda,
Hmm.
that fundamentally is to fill their pockets, this has become a business.
Ah.  Aha.  yes, well, I think that religion is like the- the politicians, ah,
Ah, exactly, you're completely right.
hmm.  Hmm, yes.  You said
The only difference is that they use the name of God.
yes.  You said really well that, ah, what unites us is, is the people, the belief in God.  And this is what un- unites people.
It unites everyone, exactly.  But, it's the, the the the difference, what divides us is
Hmm.  Hmm.
the individual leadership
yes.
of those who are in organized religion.  I, as a Hispanic,
Hmm.
I was raised Catholic, and I stopped going to church in the eighties,
Aha.  Aha.
when I started to hear that the priests were molesting kids, and I saw the
yes.
the attitude that the Vatican took and I said, well, Icame here with you,
Aha.
who wanted to pretend that this doesn't exist, and everything that they wanted to sweep under the rug.
yes.  yes.
And I said, I've come here with you.  Now I'm going to turn around, I was, and I spend many years, during which I was looking for my place,
Aha, yes.
no?  And so, and I read metaphysics, for about five or seven years now,
Aha.
and it's logical.
Aha.
It's logical, girl.  and so, well, I've found mine where I pray to God directly.  I don't need an intermediary or a translator, and much less someone who will charge me to talk to God.
Hmm.  Aha, yes.
I tell God my problems, my anxieties, my wishes, and I leave it in his hands.  Because, I'm convinced that if it is good for me, he will give it to me.
Mm. Aha.
I don't have the slightest doubt about that.
yes. Aha.
What do you think of, of the attitude of, of the Christians with the homosex- ah, eh, regarding homosexuality?
Well, ah, as a Christian person, I think that we believe that the bible is the true word of God. And, what God says,
I believe it was written by man.
ah, pardon?
I think that it was written by the man, I don't read the bible.
Eh, yes, And, but I say that. But, like me, that I'm Christian, that, that is my, ah, belief.
Your foundation, exactly.
Aha. Eh, I think that it was written by man but inspired by
By God.
the Holy spirit of God.
AHa.
Then, eh, they are God's words.
Mm.
And, and, we, as humans, want to tell the creator how we are going to serve him, or how we are going to believe him. But, such a big God, who made
Correct-
all the universe, How?
the universe.
Uhu. Well, or the university-ah, yes, yes. How are we going to call him, how are we going to adore him, or how are we going to believe him? Eh, and that,
ah, according to, he made the rules for the world to have order.
Mhm.
And, when we apart from them, ah, the rules he made,
Mhm.
then we should have, we let it open for them to come, eh, as a christian, I, as a christian, I I believe that there is a God and a Satan.
Mhm. I think that jell is here in the earth, because here we pay everything.
And, yes, but, just think that even we believe or not, the truth is that there is a God and there is hell. And we die,
we are eternal creations. Ah
Eternal.
aha, yes, eternal
Aha
And, when we die, no, the situation does not stop. We
Look that, look that metaphysics, for example, I think about the homosexuality,
Mhm
if they are 2 same gender persons, that love each other,
Mhm
that respect each other, that lead their private and personal and public lives with honor,
Mhm
which is the p- in what-what is the church role? if they are in he privacy of their bedroom,
Is the only thing.
and there's two, there's two adults,
Mm.
that, that consent what is happening,
Mm.
if they conduct their life honorably, with love,
Mm.
with the truth,
Mm.
Who is who to tell them that they are wrong?
Well, again, we want to direct how, ah, we should live. But, ah, is what you have. If one doesn't believe in, true absolutes, one can live however one wants, and for him, it's good.
And, and, and, in the natural, in the natural, How are two people going to be, ah, of the same, ah, how?
Of the same gender.
aha, gender, how are they going to procreate No, is impossible.
But, at the end of the day,
And, that,
what matters, the only thing that matters, is love. That's the only reality there is.
Mm.
Really? And I'm not referring to, to physical love, the love, no.
Mm.
Eh, the tangible love, I'm referring to what you feel inside towards yourself and humanity. That's the only , and how you behave
Mm. Mm. I
under those rules.
Aha.
Then, if that's the only thing that counts, and if you fulfill all those, those requirements,
Mm.
what you do in your private life, if you are not hurting anyone,
Well,
Who is the church to condemn you
But is not
when they, when they themselves are doing the same or worse
Mm. That's the, the How can I say it? ah, what many people say. But, is not the church, no again, is the word
Is the leadership.
of, is God's word. Is the bible that says how we should behave, or how we should live.
Look that the metaphysics teaches us, number one, that God loves us so much, that he's love is endless, that is why he gave us the power to choose.
Mm.
Right? And, then, eh, that, that God forgives us everything.
yes, mm, yes, yes, if, if, if one repents.
He, he doesn't. That's why I tell you, if there are two people of the same gender, that lead their life with honor,
Mm.
with respect, they love their neighbors, they do everything right. There are people who are born this way, and who have no control, because , physiologically, were born this way
Aha
And it has been proofed by scientist studies that the homosexuals who are born homosexual is because they have a failure in the hypothalamus. It is a
eh, hypothalamus, it is a gland
MHm
So, there are people who are born, eh, heterosexuals, but that for their experiences with the opposite sex
Mhm
Whether they have been physically abused, mentally, physically, there has been someone in their lives that has shown them true love, and then they turn to the other side
Well, what do you?
It's all about love, basically
Aha. Well, mm, mmm, you say that love forgives everything, right? then
yes, because He loves us so much
but, but, what does He forgive? what you think is wrong or what he thinks is wrong?
Oh, I don't think that to the eyes of God, mm,if you are sorry because your own conscience, God gave us an internal mechanism
Mhm
to, to tell us when we are acting wrong
Well, yes. In my mind I think that
So, that is called conscience
yes. But, my conscience, some people don't have a conscience and kills, and abuse kids. But, in their conscience, that is not wrong
Then, they have no mercy. Because, to them
This is a, yeah, a sickness.  This is a sickness.
but, but, but, you see?  This person, thinks in their conscience, that it's, it's good to do it.
That it's normal.  Aha.
But, well, again, who, who will forgive, what we said is bad, or that God says that it doesn't agree with his law?
I think, that in these, eh, special circumstances,
But, how will it be special for on person, and another person doesn't, there isn't
yeah, this, this is a degeneration
special?  This is why,
No, I refer to these people, eh, eh, serial criminals who kill fifty people, or who molest kids,
Hmm.  Hmm.
this is a psychological, or physiological sickness.  No?  There's a- a defect in the mind.
But, but, sorry?  But, how, it's the, you're saying that, ah, homosexual, eh, is also something psychological, or something, ah, me, medic-, that has a medi- ah, how do you say, medical?
Aha.
And,
A- a medical situation,
so, they can have, say the same reason, well, it's not my fault, I was born this way, I'm this way, God made me this way.
I'm convinced that God forgives them.
Hmm.  yes.  Well, so, this is why I say, when you base the, ah, your belief on different things,
yes, good evenint. This id Patricia speaking, Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with?
Patricia. This is Manuel. I'm in Orlando, Florida. Where are you?
Hi, Manuel, You're Colombian. We spoke last night.
Ah, what a coincidence.
Ah, I don't think so. I don't know. There's no. I have spoken to some people a couple of times.
For me it's the first time that I repeat with any participant.
Oh yes?
yes.
And what do you think about music?
Well, well. For me its fundamental. I, well the music
yes for me too.
I have it. I like authentic sounds very much. I mean I have a small collection of folk music.
uh uh.
I also like international music, modern, classical music. in my car I always have
Dancing music.
tropical of course. In my car there's always music and I have.
yes, I'm a bit behind in that sense, see.
yes.
yes. Im a bit behind with Latin music.
But then you don't listen to. Ah but you do listen to other types of music?
yes. of course.
Uh uh.
Eh. I like Jazz
Uh uh.
Um. I'm, I'm. this raggaeton has me enthralled.
Uh uh. It's a very catchy sound.
Do you listen to reggaeton?
What? If I listen to?
Do you listen to reggaeton?
Well, I have not bought it until now I have not eh but yes of course I've listened to it once in a while when I play the radio.
uh uh.
Eh. There's one that seems very loaded, there's one that I think it's loaded that even
It's very happy music.
But there's another one that's very nice for example the music that this guy Daddy Yankee is coming up with, I think it's good. Those sounds are very catchy and the words don't hurt anyone.
uy uh. Ah, exactly.
it's good.
Ah, I listen to everything. I like to dance. I say, as long as it can dance to it.
Sure.
I listen to it. Um. There's a type of Jazz For example, that it's like very much like Danilo Perez, it's very esoteric, it's like a bidibido
Uh uh.
I don't like that Um. What else, what else?
Eh. Classical music. I also like it a lot.
Uh. Classical music when I'm driving.
is very relaxing.
For example,long, long. I hear eh, country music
I also like rock. I like classical rock also.
Um. Rock but the old one.
Like the Spanish one I also like.
Eh. You know what I was reading the other day? That it's been scientifically discovered that in small children, for example, the elementary schools during their education well
in elementary schools if they expose them to the music, whether singing or learning to play some instrument that they do better in their grades
Really.
scholastically.
Look how interesting. There are some nice vibrations.
it doesn't seem real, right? I would've never made that connection.
yes, I have heard of it. I even also saw eh documentaries that it seems that the plants are also very receptive.
Ah really.
Eh, to those sounds. But, that if seems of the soft sound, right? And, and also certain animals. In the farms or poultry farms. When they are chicks well.
It seems they put music and it relaxes them because that little animal is very nervous by nature.
uh uh uh uh.
I mean, look, is therapeutic.
And for example, when a baby is in the belly
uh-huh.
they give the mom headphones and she takes them and they put on different kinds of music, I've heard that the baby in gestation also reacts
entirely to music, of course, and they put on classical music, soft music.
yes, exactly.
that they react favorably, the power of music seems incredible.  For me music is like an international language.
yes, it's true.
Everyone understands music.  Everyone, the majority of people like to listen to music.  And even if they don't have anything in common
eh, socially it's always the music that unites us, no?
yes, well.  Right, eh, it's universal.  Like you said it's universal.
Hmm.
I, personally, I'm very very eclectic.  I'm open to listening to any kind of music.  If there's something that I suddenly don't like, well I respect what I don't
listen to.  The only thing that I
No, and at least, at least try to find something in it.  To appreciate it
know is to appreciate.
If, if I learn something, I learn that I like this kind of music
this kind
to open my horizons more
exactly.  The only thing I don't like is when it's too loud.  When I don't like it.
when we were young, when we were young, do you remember when our parents told us that we were going to be deaf?
yes, Even if, well, even if I tell you that we never expected a lot from this.
I did.
I, I'm at, the same volume, a high volume but not exaggerated
And, for example, when I'm in the car, I sing with the radio.  You don't sing with the radio?
yes.  yes.  Sure.  A few melodies that I know.
And have you realized, for example, when you're at a red light singing you look to the side and someone's watching you
And and people watch.  yes.
and it seems to them like we're crazy
Suddenly, or suddenly, if there's a traffic jam and they're surprised and they say, why is he singing if this is unbearable?  But they do the same thing, no?
What's happening to this crazy guy?  I definitely think that music is the universal language.  We all understand each other through music, in one way or another.
And it's a way, and it's a way
yes, it's correct.
it doesn't only unify but also pacify.
yes, this is very true.
You see?  That there isn't, the other day, three years ago, I went to Panama on a visit and I rented a radio, I rented a car
and from, from the house to the airport, when we went to leave it I heard a reggaeton song that I was hearing here.  And I thought it was the most
stupid song in the world and the only thing it told you was, was reggaeton.  And the only thing that it told you
Repeated. It repeated the same chorus a thousand times?
no, it's, look how stupid, the only thing it was saying was, chacaron, chacaron.
This, a thousand times.
Talking about, eh, it was stupid that you had to be a total Mormon in order to appreciate this. Now they were playing it. And I, without thinking, started dancing in the kitchen
I was to my..
I started dancing to the sound of the 'chacaron'
Ahead. There is something there, that afterwards in a theme they can put it to that association. Eh, eh, call it manipulation or
there's something that I don't like either, hello?
uh uh
it is that many people see music and associate music to idols of mud. I don't think so. Music is not Britney Spears. Music is not Madonna
right
That's another thing, and young people associate those
And then, in that association, they want to imitate
Of course
the singers, and turn them into mud idols, like you said
And manipulate them.
right, right, I, remember the vice president's wife, Al Gore's, she joined a
Oh, yes
a program against violent music, with violent lyrics, that she said affected the children
Uh uh
in a negative way, gangster rap for instance
Mm
street gangster, right? And she said that these violent lyrics affected the young people and pushed them to suicide, and to commit acts of violence
Or, will see those of the enemy and may kill each other
but, you know what Manuel, I think that all this is related with the home. I don't think that a song, OK I accept that young people are highly sensitive
right? easily influenced, but if you give them a solid base I don't think that a song can make a boy kill himself
Or hit
or go kill someone else, right, or attack him
yes, but unfortunately this a heal of our time. A lot of young people are growing up without character enough
No. And the family unity we knew, the one we grew up with doesn't exist any more
Oh yes
the extended family already, in some extreme cases mom and dad are in jail and it is the grandmother who takes care of them
yes, the grandmother
who doesn't have the time
yes. Or is very busy doing
or is too old
or both of them are very busy earning money, that's another problem
right, right. The base, the typical family unit doesn't exist any more, and I think that's why kids nowadays
identify more with music, and use it as the example for their behaviour
That's right
it's a pity, isn't it? Because
From that subject, from that subject there are important derivations, interesting ones
No, and they scare me
yes. I think that these topics that they touch on this program, in this study are very interesting. The should expand the time.
because really yes.
To half an hour
imagine that today and afternoon we were watching my mom and I I don't know a program called chattering
Ah, yes.
which is pure nuisance
Uh uh
And then they had a Latin rapper that was singing a song that said lift you skirt up to your back imagine that, right?
That I stayed like speechless.
And the worst is that the girls the girls delighted with that, the young girls delighted with that.
And then there are kids that go and follow Ah? no, I didn't sing. I had never heard that song but that is
No no no no. I say the girls.
Ah, no and the eh
With that type of message they are happy when they are
and the guys too
When there they are underestimating the woman, they put her as an object.
they think that this the wonder of the world like to give them three slaps and tell them straighten up, right?
No, they think those are compliments.
this is a song and it already ended.
Ah, it already ended.
what this is a lifestyle, I think that they believe that this an acceptable acceptable lifestyle if somebody were to tell me to hike up my skirt all the way up to my back I swear I would smack them so hard
No, today it's any woman that should do it.
exactly. exactly. And what I wonder is that why, for example when they write these lyrics would it be good, obviously it's just for the market, right?
That's apparently what kids like today? Can you believe that?
yes, and
We're getting old, Manuel.
And the worst is that from a young age, from childhood they are listening to that, dancing to it, little kids.
Exactly. You see it on television. It's incredible. There's another show from Mexico called something, but it's a show where they put you
little kids in dancing competitions and they give them prize and what do I know? And you see these little kids, three and four years old
dancing as if they were
Tamara.
Hello
Hello.
Hello I'm Marco, and you?
Tamara, nice to meet you.  Where are you from?
Hello Tamara, how are you?  I'm in Philadelphia.
Where?
In Philadelphia.
Ah, that's good.  But from wh- from what country?
Ah, eh, I grew up in Paraguay.
In Paraguay.  Ah I'm from Argentina.
yes Ah yes
And I'm in Boston
How are you?  Neighbor.
What type of music do you like?
um.  I have one of these typical questions that you can say, any kind as long as it's good, but eh, rock in general, um
more older rock, I don't really like the new music let's say
yes
There's little new music that I like, and normally what's popular isn't what I like the most.
And now that you live in the United States, does it seem more difficult to find new music that you like, like, in Paraguay were you more exposed to music that you liked?
No, you know that really there in in Paraguay, I didn't like the music, the local music.
Hm mm
There were a couple of small groups that, I was friends with the members.
yes
and, the music was brilliant because, I think that it must be very different when you know the people who are playing
Sure
But besides that, when I came here, eh, I think that, in general, the music was almost the same, eh
And did you come here a long time ago?
eh, yes, it's been almost ten years already.
Ah, okay.
I've been here
And do you like the music in English better or in Spanish?
Always, I always liked in, in Spanish. I'm, I
Hm mm
I'm I was born in the United States, and went to Paraguay when I was eight years old, eight years old
Wow
Eh, tell me that I was there until I was twenty.
Aha
And then, and then I came here. And then now I've been here ten years. Eh, then my formative years, so to speak, was
In Paraguay
in, in Paraguay.
Sure
But, I always spoke fluent English. When I went to Paraguay I went to the American school inclusive,
Hm mm
then
And what are you doing in Paraguay, in Philadelphia?
it wasn't very different. What?
What are you doing in Philadelphia?
The music?
No. what are you doing in Philadelphia.
Ah, eh, I'm eh, studying, eh network security, eh
Aha
basically, computer things, computer things. It was always my passion.
Ah. Also.
And, with, and that one thing of music, I now, I always listen with, in -mp3
And, you download music from the Internet?
yes, I just download music from the Internet, and I put it in my phone, and with my telephone, and the, I hear it from the phone.
Aha Aha
That's what I use the most to listen I haven't used any more compact discs, the -CDs in a really long time.
yes, and cassette it goes without saying.
Cassettes, I have a few but I have a kid who's five and I think that one day I can show, I can show that there was a time when we used this.  Magnetic tape, and- everything.
yes
When re- eh yes, I don't know, if you don't remember but in the twentieth century we used magnetic tape.  We made our
Hmm
our proxy, pro, our proxy, eh, our own, eh
Recordings.
like, like music recordings
yes
our, our system of pirating music but, on a very low level.
Sure
That was really slow, it was making a cassette like being, eh, a pirate
yes
cool, eh
No, I still save all my cassettes.  The majority.
Ah, yes?
yes, they're more than one hundred and twenty.
Yeah, that, that's a lot of cassettes.
Yes, you know what happened to me, because I moved from Argentina to another country, and from another country here.  So, I took it with me everywhere.
yes, ah, and you don't only use CDs?
yes, yes.  Eh, I use, I bought, I bought several CDS, but I never bought many, because, like, in comparison with cassettes, because they're always really expensive in Argentina
yes, yes yes
And, since it came out, I mean all that of the recording of -CDs on computer, eh I stopped buying. I mean, if someone bought a disc,
eh, they would record it for me.
Mm yes exactly.
Eh, instead of buying There are, there are very few groups that nowadays I buy their compact they don't even come out good.
I was hearing about groups of
Eh,
ah, as you've seen with this of the eh with the problem of the pirated music.
yes
Eh, that sure, coming from a point of view of business, obviously is a , is a problem.
yes
Eh, is, is something illegal
yes
but is something that and, like they all do it practically.
yes, sure.
that it doesn't seem, doesn't seem like something bad. And it's hard to try to teach the younger people that that's stealing. They, they already, already think
yes
they already think that is eh normal and is the way that it has to be done. Eh
yes
seeing the peo- It was that before when we did it it was more eh, recording from a eh knowing that it's illegal, then we don't do it very open- we didn't do it so openly.
yes,
Eh, when the, when we gave a, an album of a, of a person who, we gave them the disc or something, but on a mp3, but pretty
almost under the table.
yes
Ao, for, for what could happen.  But now, today, many of the, the creatures, I sure, I call them creatures, not are older, but
ah, they do this and for them it's really normal, it's very rare for them to buy music.
And, and does your son like rock music?
yes, yes
Or, does he like other things more?
he lik- he doesn't li- the thing he has, even if he's five.  So his tastes are basically what we give him to listen to.
Sure
But, eh
So they put on Led Zeppelin since the the cradle.
Aye, how funny that you said that, So, ah, this is particularly, our favorite group.
yes, I also like
Well yes.  We went to see Robert Plant live a while ago.
Wow.  He was in Philadelphia?
yes, yes, he was here in Philadelphia.
How nice.  I went to see in Buenos Aires, when Robert Plant when he played with the Mittens once.
yes ah this is nice, and we, even
In
every still praying that they will come back to meet, er, plant with Dave and
With Jimmy
and with, and to see if there's a, what's it called, eh
The, John, Johns eh
Jappa John, Jappa John, Double John, this
yes, Well, at one time they said that the kid, of, eh, was a drummer too, that, and, they said, that he was going to play in his father's place.
Uy
But this was about fifteen years ago, because the guy played in Argentina too.
And every now and then, there are rumors that they will have  reunion.
yes
reunion tour of the group and we're always
And-
They're tempting us.
And do you have a lot of recitals there in Philadelphia?
Sorry?
Are there many rock concerts in Philadelphia?
yes, a lot, eh, here we go, we go often to, and to us this really seems
That's good.
that the music groups, eh, with this, pirating, pirated music and this, We think that the people who play music, even if they're artists, who make
they know how to do what they do,
yes
they should earn well they should earn a lot, but not to the point of being ridiculous, like look, Michael Jackson.
Sure
Eh, eh, that a person that does a good song is brilliant. That makes money for that, that makes money for that, that makes money for the recordings and all,
but that for a good song that, he makes forty five million dollars
yes
Um, eh it seems a little exaggerated already.
Sure
Eh, and, and but, one thing in genera- I did like were concerts, the majority of the music that I like the most
yes
is live music.
Sure
Recorded, live.
yes
Eh, because is that I think they should earn their money doing, eh, concerts.
yes
yes, yes every time we go to a concert we are paying what, forty, fifty, eighty dollars.
yes
For a ticket.
Sure, sure.
yes, and they have places where thirty, forty thousand people enter.
Sure
Is good, is good money. They can make
Sure, but there he who wins the status, the representative. Is not the band either. I mean the band has a cachet to who they pay at first, when they hire them to work,
That's that's another thing. I um, I I always preferred, and still prefer the groups where there's a singer, a drummer, guitarist, bass player, eh,
yes
eh, keyboarder, that basically that there are those groups I mean of people eh, that the group is basically the name of a person,
that a person that sings that doesn't write all the music they do, no
Sure
never plays any instrument,
Hm mm
no, eh, that seems to me very created eh,
Is a product.
is a created sensation, a product that would eh be, of the public companies basically
Sure
And I think, look, I prefer that I would like to see that they make more than,  because the musicians that are musicians
are musicians from the soul.
yes,
And they like the music. It wouldn't be terrible for them to go play once in a while, or couple of years, in a small tour
of let's say, of a -x number of cities, where eh, is money that they can definitely , of which they can live well
yes.
Him and his family, that I think that they should make a lot of money, because eh, because I like it like that
yes, sure.
but, but I don't think that it shouldn't be one, one song, and from that, one song will live for, with millions and millions of dollars for
eh, for always
yes
That, eh, I think that is ah, music, while I really ah, just started, started recently to buy music.
yes
Eh, the music that I was buying, buying online, eh, the, because
Do you buy on the internet more than, more than going to a record store?
yes yes yes, eh, I buy on the Internet, because you can buy one song eh, you can buy as many times a, there are few groups very few that you can count, I think with, that you can count on one hand
groups that make, that make albums which you can hear from the first to the last.
yes
The majority of the groups now, especially, have a, a sensational song, and the rest kins of for someone
¡Hi! my name is Jorge

oh, but you have some group, some singer in particular, something that you like in particular
Well, I like jazz a lot
oh,
And I have some jazz favorites But I like, like I tell you I like, is that I like to listen to music so much And there are so many artists and varieties of, of music that
Is hard to have a favorite, at least, for me I think
Sure, no, and is the same with me, for me Well I listen, I can listen to all type of music, I like everything
Aha
I'm a, well my favorite topic because I'm a music collector, I collect a lot of music

in Turkish, so
yes
I love the music, how do you get the music? how do you buy it? do you download them? how do you do it?
oh, wow, by everything ah, well before it was buying records and all -CD and all, but on the radio And well now also on the TV, one having cable you have the music stations
Sure With Direct TV obviously yes,
yes, aha and Internet I also look ah, there are many ways and well you see, I also heard a program that was of the University of here ah, of Texas

And they had ah, European style music
European
And yes, and they had many eh, different like Like you would say Middle East I don't how do you say it in Spanish
yeah

yes
yes, yes they're listening to me I hope that they don't sue me
yes Don't say anything else because they're recording
but is like that, I mean now there's the advantage that you hear a new song on the radio, you come the next day and you have it downloaded in your computer
yes, yes, is, is very true yes aha and well ah You go to places where, do you like to go to concerts and something like that?
I tell you that before, before eh, I spent much of my youth also in Ecuador
aha
And well, any concert there would be, was a concert I would go to
aha
eh, I love it Well, in that, there in Ecuador, because obviously since it's South American there were very little very little artist would go
aha
But anyways I would go to all, to all the concerts, I can tell you Spanish, rock in Spanish, hip hop in Spanish
aha
ah, They didn't sell a lot, at that time it wasn't the reggaeton rather there was a lot of reggae
yes, aha
In Spanish also I can tell you, I like music a lot, I hear a lot of Argentinian music
oh, yes, yes that one is very nice too
there are many good Argentinian singers, there's from Spain, from Europe I especially like old Spanish rock music a lot
aha
A lot of music in Spanish, well I mean I tell you there a lot of diversity of music, right
yes, yes
There, for concert well I would go to all of them, now that I have my obligations My kids, my wife, well the time is a little limited, right
aha yes, is true
But I can tell you that I spend eighty or ninety percent of the day that I'm awake listening to music, I'm listening to music
aha yes, well, before ah, I had another job and worked at night
mm
And they always would let us use the earphones
okay
And I always had the radio well, the whole night I spent it listening to the radio and, or music or something like that but now just when, I work like thirty miles from my job
mm
And just when I'm in the car because at work there are times that on the internet I do put some local stations or something but I'm always so busy that
But I do like to have music around always playing or, or listening to music
oh, very interesting
yes, ah, I fall asleep, I put the timer and I fall asleep many times with the music ah, and wake up, well all the time I don't wake up with the music because there are times
that it calms me and I fall asleep but I always like to have music around
wow, for example what did you listen to today, what type of music do you listen to nowadays?
Well like I tell you jazz, plus I like jazz a lot and also ah, not too much classical but ah, each time in when classical music I like to hear oh, ah
What do they call it pop music
okay
Contemporary music I like to hear, more American I don't know much ah, of, since I've always lived in an English speaking community
mm
My music and all is in English but I like to listen to Spanish music is that I don't many of the artists
that's the problem.
and many times the radio stations here Well play this country music - polka all mixed and And I like it but not all the time
In what city of Texas do you live?

Yeah, the flutes, the "zampoñas", those are called zampoñas, they're called flutes, right
High zampoñas, ok, yeah, i like that music a lot
Oh yes
i do [like] that, because i have heard groups from Peru that have that style and yeah, i like it [very much], it's very [...] music, it soothes you, uh huh

yes no yes, I like some groups -ACDC I mean of the old ones -ACDC, KISS and Van Halen where the ones from my time

sure and have you been living here a long time
it's been five years

eh eleven months
not that long and
no, not at all
I imagine it must be cold there in Boston
yes, yes eh you have to wear scarf, gloves, two socks, everything

Oh, you cam, oh, i mean you're studying
Sure, exactly
It's OK
And this, how did you find out about this?
I found about this on the internet, on a website called Craiglist
yes
i found about it through it
Oh, look, i didn't know it's on Craiglist
Yes, i believe i found about it on Craiglist
Oh, that's good, well, it's really good, right?
Yes, yes, yes
And so i don't know, we have to keep talking about music or?

ah, well that's good, I thought that we had to talk on the topic that they told you
no, no, no, about whatever we want

yes ah that's good
so
you'll stay there
yes I'm staying here
that's good that's good, Texas, let's see, where is Texas, in Texas this, no
Sorry?
An Argentinian basketball player
ah yes in San Antonio, he's in San Antonio
ah, that's good, yes
eh, eh, in the Sports of San Antonio
ah wow, no idea.  Is Texas good, do you like it?
uh before I lived in Florida and I miss the climate
sure
and here you have the winter and everything but it's nice, picturesque, you have, you have some hills, a lake, it's pretty nice here
ah ah okay how nice how nice, if there was, I would like to know more of the United States since I'm here right
and there you have a lot of friends
yes, yes I've made a bunch of friends, what happens is that my sister lived here then when I came she introduced me to her friends
sure
and I live with an Argentinian friend, so luckily we made a good group of people, of friends
well that's quite good
yes, but always more than anything Latins, right
sure, sure like you don't know many gringos
no, not too many gringos in any case Europeans but gringos, no, so many
there are Europeans there
yes a bunch already
ah look
yes a bunch is very, this city is very cosmopolitan, since I then came to study
sure it must be like, like Miami, Miami is very cosmopolitan but
there's a bunch
especially of Latins I mean there's from all parts of Latin America
sure, sure, not as many, not as many Latins as in Miami
aha
let's say in Miami you speak, you speak, you can speak the whole time in Spanish
yes I sometimes had jobs that I wanted to practice English and they only spoke to me in Spanish.
sure
so
sure for that
there already, there already more English, English
there is everything, sure, here everything you handle almost everything in English the whole time, which it was very hard for me
look yes, is English hard for you?
yes is hard, I don't like it too much so
it was hard for me at the beginning but now I'm one more gringo, I mean I understand everything and I speak anything with anyone
and how long ago, did you start like that?
ha-
ah to speak well, since when? like in a year in two
um like after two years yes like at first is hard two years to, to speak well, well and after those two years I was living a year and a half in Florida and after
I came here to Texas and married an American
ah
and well like that eh that was my number one English teacher because she only spoke English.
sure is that is that the topic seems
yes, yes, if you're among Latins like it's hard because sometimes I kind of lose the English a little when I start to talk Spanish.
sure that is true, they told me that the issue if you want to learn English is to get an American boyfriend
yes or just get with gringos and try not to get with Hispanics
and but the truth, I'd rather be with Hispanics and not learn the language eh
well but since it's what you need and sometimes confront, even if it comes out bad, the words, and until the end since you're getting better,
yes it's good, it's true, I'll do this.  And what's your name?
in the beginning, Alvaro
ah Alvaro, that's good
and what was your name, sorry?
Iliana
Iliana
yes
you know at the beginning I spoke English but I didn't understand what they were saying to me and since I recently started to understand more and more
sure, sure, sure I realize this, that the, understanding every time more that counts a lot, at the beginning you think that it's nothing and after you're forming words
yes, yes they open your ears
sure it's so, this is so incredible, so well
and you, how old are you Iliana?
I'm thirty one
ah wow, that's good, I'm thirty seven
you, how old?  thirty seven
yes
you went to thirty two
at thirty two I came here, certainly
sure, ah wow, and you don't want to go back, would you go back?
yes I would, if I had enough money to live there, but if I go right now I'll be flat broke there
right, that's the point, and are you still with your wife?
sure, no, not the one here, no, neither the first one I had a son with there in Uruguay
oh, so, and where is your son, in Uruguay?
yes he is in Uruguay, I send him money every month
sure, oh, but do you see him? do you keep touch with him?
I saw hin in July, I went to Uruguay
oh, good
but once in a while, it's like once a year because it is very expensive going there, and this year for the Holidays it's not easy, everything is so expensive
sure, sure, it's not convenient either
sure
it's more convenient in low season, I can get it for half the price
aha, aha
the passage, what do you take, the Chile?
yes ,the last times I've gone on land Chile, yes
sure, it's fine, these Chileans did it well
yes, it has good prices
yes, yes, it's true, and
Good evening I'm Joe.
Hello, good evening my name is Blanca
How are you Blanca?
Fine Thanks
Where are you calling from?
Ah from Phoenix
From Phoenix, I call from Colorado.
oh, very good
Well, I practically like all types of music, as long as is not, that of, Heavy Metal as they call it, and also of that one that is of
of the, what is it called, the one that is of, of Punk or something like that.
like what?
That the one they use those, ah I forgot the name already let me think while you say something.
uh ah well, no I like all types of music, depends also on my mood. well is obvious the type of music I listen to.
eh, I like a lot, I, I like a lot, the dance music, and the salsa, I'm very tropical to pick my music.
how nice, and what music do you listen to there that is tropical.
Ah well, in my country, I'm from Colombia, the tropical music is to dance.
yes.
ah, then is like, like dance music, but, I don't like dance music, I don't like the technocumbia, nor the Mexican music, um, um, let's see, the Mexican I do like.
The romantic, the mariachi one, yes that, but, but that one
The northern.
The northern is texmex music, I don't like that
Me neither, and the one that I was trying to tell you a while back is that rap music, the rap music. I hate that one.
ah the new one, the one that they are coming out with now new
Because that one, well that one, the reggaeton also.
the reggaeton
I think that the lyric, is very, stimulates bad things, for example the reggaeton like, it demeans the women. Like sexual objects.
yes
And, sometimes they use very vulgar language, I don't like it. the music in itself, if it wasn't with that type of lyric. It wouldn't be that bad, but the lyric kills it.
yes I think, I think that for example I love the bachata but just as the bachata, many other type of music, for me, the reggaeton seems
oh, yes
that we are staying without resources, I like it for a party and the kids have fun, and while one sees them and that but I think that the great composers are staying without resources and
the great singers already don't know where to make it, because they are all making it with the reggaeton.
Exactly.
I find it sad. I love the bachata, but I think that I think, Where are you from?
I'm from Puerto Rico.
Well, I think that the Dominicans, not all, the ones that sing bachata in their majority they are non composers of music. Because they take a
The romantic music, the ballenatos, the, the music, the merengue all of it and make it into a bachata, if you look, there aren't, um, they are very few the bachatas that are
original lyrics, written in bachata.
Is true.
but all copied from, any other rhythm.
yes, the bachata is a music that I love.
I love it.  I love it with everything and that is copy, but I find it very sad,
I like the merengue, I like the salsa, I like Colombian cumbia, I like Colombian music a lot.
Okay
I'm crazy about the music of Shakira and Juanez
And of Carlos Vives.
I love Carlos Vives, also, I have records of them CDs I love them
Yes aha, yes
There's a lot of talent there
I, I love music, I'm a musicologist full time, I love it, I love the tangos, I love romantic music, I love old music, the ballads and that.
Me too
But everything in its time, and meaning, according to my mood, at the moment. If we are among friends, talking and having some drinks, like that conversing.
Maybe some ballads, some romantic music something like that more soft. But for a party, well There whatever goes. Though I have my taste, and I prefer a certain type of music in my dances
Exactly yes, I agree
The music imposes in my house when we dance the music that I like imposes, if another person brings music, we put that music also, is obvious.
that is a taste for everyone.
Sure.
But for me personally, that type of Mexican music, and, and that other, I find it so awful.
I imagine that in Phoenix they have a lot of that too, right
Oh my God here I live breakfast, lunch and dinner is that music.
Yes
everyday, everyday, that's a pity.
yes, we do have three Hispanic radio stations, one has Northern music, the other one plays a mix of rhythms  from different Latin American countries but, mostly Mexican music.
and the other one, well they play too much Reaggetton and things like that, I hardly listen to it.
the, Mexican music is very very nice, the, the mariachis, rancheras, romantic music, they have a lot of
I really like Luis Miguel's music, I love it.
aha, they have very good pop music singers and all of that, Alejandro Fernandez
yes
All of that. It really is a pity that it's not that popular here, it has so much, so much Northern music
Mexico is so big, because I know, I mean, my ex-wife she was from Oaxaca, Mexico and that state is in the last part of Mexico, down there near the South, near Chiapas and the culture is so different
um
that the culture from the State of Chihuahua, the North.
hum
The music is completely different, even their dialects are pretty different
I see
And, food, meals are different too.
everything is different, aha
yes, but I just like all of it, I play the piano and when, when I was younger I was part of some bands and things like that.
yes
And I used to play lots of different music, salsa, merengue, things like that, ballads, I loved to play ballads in the piano.
aha
For these days I have not had much opportunity because I have just a keyboard now and it is not the same than a piano like the one I had, I had a baby grand
piano, and the music that those pianos play, it is fabulous. now I am in a smaller place. Because of that I also teach that to my daughter.
um uh
Well my little daughter is only five but I teach her music.
yes
She loves the piano, she loves to sing, she has a fabulous voice for a such a little girl. She spends time singing to her grandmother "La negrita cucurumbe" ( the little black girl cucurumbe), and the grandmother delighted with her.
Well yes, Do you have sons?
yes I have two children, I have two children, I have two babies.
what a blessing, how good, how good.
I have two children and they love to dance too, since they were very young.
yes
Any thing for them is dancing, and do you know what is so particular That sometimes the tongue is the punishment, it is a say, the tongue is a punishment.
I don´t like northern music my son. he hears it and begins to dance, he loves it. And I, what a plain taste my son has.
punishment, punishment for not liking the northern.
yeah
No, but, I don´t know look that northern music, not all, not all is terrible, but there is one that is horrible, because it is like if it was, the regueton about the lyrics, because it has obscenities  and they are very, well
eh,
It is the same, the same sound: "chinguis, quringuichingui,quringuichingui, quiringuicha", it is the same
yes, exactly, yes yes I like it the variety in the rhythm, that is what tires you, like when the rap appeared here in the United States at the beginning when there were
Hammer, Hammer and all those people, Bobbie Brown
yes
I like it at first and I loved, because it had a nice rhythm, like rap, but different
I see
Now, it's all the same, all the same, so, it's violence, that if kills, if murders, if it's that
yes, look the reggaeton is the same, bum ta bum, bum ta bum
yes, it's the same, the same lyrics, or different lyrics but same rhythm, the same sounds, I don't know how there are people liking to listen the same all day
And they don't get bored, because, when I'm in work, you use the computer all the time, and we are allowed to listen the radio and after doing all our work nice, I mean, the computer radio
So, I play the music, a Latin station, with all kind of variety, in the internet, I love it
Hu
Because it has variety, you know, it's Latin, but, they have variety from all countries, from Venezuela, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Mexico, all those places
yes
Because all those countries, they contributed to Latin music, there are many
yes, here, there was a station that played a lot of music, a variety, but now, there is only romantic music and anywhere you want
you listen only those northern rhythms
Oh
Everywhere
There was an station here, I think that it was called Romantic Radio, and well, it seems that people got tired, and it left, I think that came from California, so, all the time it was
ballad and ballad and you were slept and at the time was nice, but after that it got bored
hum
So there's better variety, there's a more lively rhythm.
a, good
But yes, here the majority of Latinos here in Colorado are from Mexican descent.
yes
So well, sure, the influence, it also really influences the radio, what you hear.
uh-huh well it's true.  It's true, it's pretty influential.
And how long have you been there in Phoenix?
Well since May, only about six months.
Is this the first time that you've been to the United States?
I lived in Massachusetts, I lived in Massachusetts
Oh in Massachusetts, it's cold there.
yes, my husband lived, my husband lived there for twenty years, and only for five years.  And in the company where he worked, they laid him off
Oh, what a shame.
And so we decided to move because we were tired of the snow.
The cold, yes here
And we came to the other extreme, while it's great here, here it's great in
yes but it's really hot in the summer, this is true.
only, in, only in summer, but in the other seasons it's really great.
yes
It's a really nice climate.
I imagine that it must be very nice now in the winter
Yes
Because here in Colorado it's really cold
It's a one-sweater weather
Here in Colorado it's really cold right now
Oh, yes
But during winter, i mean, a very cold winter is starting, but usually it doesn't get this cold in December. Last week it was like ten degrees below zero last week
Uh, oh no
So, with the wind it was like twenty one below zero
No, last year we had, I'm sorry this year, in February, a snowing in Boston were we were trapped in the house and we couldn't get out
wow
Oh, we don't want more of this
No, and here, the moisture is pretty high here in Colorado
Uh
The humidity is not so high and it doesn't feel as bad as if you lived in Chicago, in New York or there in Massachusetts
In Massachussetts, yes
Yeah, no, but i like it here, it's just that I've been in Colorado for too long
Yeah, I'm liking it here very much, but i do worry that i see it's a, a city, a very insecure state
How?
There is a lot of insecurity, maybe because it's a border state and there are so
Regarding what?
Hello?
Hello? How are you?
Whom am I speaking with?
Ah, you're speaking with, eh, Vicente.
Vicente. hello Vicente. My name is Liliana. Where are you from?
I'm from, originally, from Panama.
From Panama? And where do you live?
yes And where are you from-, and, and where are you from?
I'm Mexican and I live in Baltimore.
In Baltimore.
Uh um, in Maryland. Where do you live?
I live in New York, in the ci-, New York city.
Ah, very near. Very near.
And in the, in the middle of New York.
Uh um, ah, in the
I live like two miles from Ground Zero.
Ah, really, in the very center?
Ah?
In the very center?
yes, in the middle of the center, yes.
Oh, and what do you do, and what do you do there?
In Manhattan.  Ah?
What do you do there?
I'm an accountant.
Accountant?  Hey, but the rent is really expensive there, no?
yes.  The rent, huge.  You pay, you, what I pay for a small room, for two or three rooms, right?
Uh-huh.
In many parts of the United States and in the world too you can have a house.
yes.  So-
I was talking with a person from, I think he was from Mexico, a Mexican who was an American Mexican, or something like that.
Uh-huh.
And no, he was paying much less for a house with three
yes.
And what, than what I was paying here.  But I think, I'm goig to move from here really soon, eh.
How long have you been living there?
About twenty years.  Twenty give years that I've been living in a city.
In the, aye.
yes, but blah, the thin is, you get used to many things sometimes, you know?
yes.
In the city everything's close, right?
Uh-huh, you can walk on either side and
On a-, exactly.
Uh-huh.
And eh, I was reading a book that was saying that, that people in California get fat because eh, because all the things that come
yes.  Uh-huh, if you don't want a car and if you don't have
everything in the car to go to this, to go to look for this, to go by car.
yes.
While people in the city are skinnier, because everything is close so we walk.
yes.  Aha.
And we walk a lot, I mean we walk a lot, a lot in the city.
Eh, and so you don't have a car?
No, no, because a car will cost me like
Oh, you don't need it.
eh, what I pay, what I would pay to park the car
yes, that's also
it's like three hundred a month, at least
yes.
Three hundred a month, at least, to park the car.
Aye, no.  Okay, also, God.
Aha, so that's what I think, eh.
And, eh, and, eh.
This is, you pay it, this is what you pay for a car, if you can buy a car, right?
yes, aha.  And part if you wont use it, what for?
No, and the thing is that when you have a car, no, no only this has one, for a bigger one than this.  And when you go out, with what you
you park the car in the garage, right?  This is your regular.
Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
But when you go to visit someone else and you go in the street and there are so many rules, it costs you a lot to park and the and
and you park and there are certain streets where you can't park.
Uh-huh.
OK?  And if you have you car there, forget it, the police will take it from you.
Oh, yes.
In New York they take your car in a second.  And only you get out of the car and you go into a shop or a bodega, as the Puerto Ricans say,
Uh-huh.
And you come back and your car is gone.
Uh-huh.
It will cost you, it will cost like two hundred, two hundred fifty, three hundred dollars
Aye, no, plus the three hundred a month and the insurance, ah no, too much.
yes, it's, it's too much, it's too much, I don't recommend it for anyone, it's
A taxi's better.
But tell me, something in, New York, right?  I remember before with a mine that started something like this, and the majority of people that you saw were Puerto Rican, Do- Dominicans.
For well, well, Puerto Rico belongs to the United States, you see?
yes, yes, yes, yes.
I'm like a United States citizen.
yes, yes, yes.
And, and the Dominicans come here too.  Now?  There were Chicanos, Ecuadorians, Peruvians, from all over the world.
Guatemala.
Guatemala, in, in this I can tell you that if you go anywhere I kno-, I call them Incas from Peru.  You, the things in the street anywhere
Uh-huh.  yes.
And many are also illegal, but
Uh-huh.
In the city you can hide.
yes.
And you can hold back a lot, you can find a lot of little jobs here and there, you know?
yes.  Aha
And the, and they have a lot of problems and also, they don't have a lot of time to be chasing you, you know?
yes.
and you can do little jobs here and there, in the city.  But if you were out of the city, then they will come and look for you like that, illegal, you know?
But, but it's a thing that, I think that here from Guatemala, from anywhere, and there's a class, and to me there's not much class of, of
of Latinos here, you know?  Europeans too, from, from
yes, and the Argentinians, yes.
from Spain, and from Argentina
Uh-huh.
yes, there are Cubans, or, Cu-, eh, Mexicans in Miami, the Cubans dominate there.
Uh-huh.
Until the
You know, eh, I've only been to New York once.
Yeah.
And this, the Spanish part, hey, you heard all kinds of
S-, Spanish.
you hear all kinds of, eh, of the language, yes.
yes, yes, S- S- Spanish and other languages too, and between Spanish also because and, you, and I don't know, in Mexico there are bananas, right?
Uh-huh.
And, eh, I was chatting with an Ecuadorian and they ripen them.

It ripens, but ripe is, a state of, or a fruit, right?  That a fruit is ripe, right?
yes.  Aha, yes.
It's ready to eat.  But it's a banana, no, the name is banana.
You, what do you call them.  And you, what do you call them?
In Panama, banana.

Eh, no, no, not too little. A, eh, a big boy, he's twenty years old-, twenty one years old
Ah, ah, well he's a man already.
He goes to school and all that, eh.
yes.
But, but, the thing here, and, uh, look, of what, what, what, what we should be talking about.
Is the music, but how boring.
Ah, but the music is good. Well, but, they are boring, because look I was, I was talking about this with a Spaniard lady, right?
Uh um.
And, and we were talking about how, rap, rap, they're rap music things, right?
yes.
And, the influence in rap and all, in the whole world right now. In all the music. I was, I was the
Spanish that I, that I was in Chinatown here in New York, right? In New China
Uh um
And was listening and I said
Ah.
Oh, that's rap. -O-K. I didn't understand the language, the way they were saying it, I knew that it was rap, and a Chinese told me yes, that piece of crap rap, in all languages, in all, all, in China now.
yes. Uh um
And the, the Spanish lady told me that in Spain, you go to all the clubs and the uh, bars and all that and all you hear is the Reggaeton.
yes, in Mexico also.
Reggaeton, yes, because here there's a lot of Mexicans who work with the Chinese with the fruits, see?
Uh um, uh um.
And, you, you, walk by the side of a radio
yes. It annoys me, do you like it?
Ah?
I don't like it, do you like it?
I don't, I don't, no us the, I call myself us the old people, right? We don't like it we got used to hearing people, people singers
right.
yes, and with a good voice and all that.
Eh. Luis Miguel or Julio Iglesias, Vicente Fernandez.
yes, yes, yes. yes. But that rap, Oh, noise, eh.
Aye no, not to me
But, I'm telling you because I've talked with a lot of people from all over the world and they tell me, they tell me that in Spain it's all Reggaeton and I say, what?
How strange, right?
yes, that's the music of E- it's the music of, the, because when I was with Chinese person and he told me that
that Korea and everything is- everywhere you go with
No, I don't, I don't imagine rap in Chinese
Huh?
I don't imagine what it's like to listen to rap in Chinese.
yes, through I, I know that through the way that I listened to music because, I, immediately recognized the way that the were s- saying, right?
Aha.
That this was rap, but in a different
And in Panama?  And there isn't rap in Panama?
No, how reggaeton sounds in Panama.
Ah, it's the sa- it's, in Panama it's the same as in Mexico, reggaeton.
yes, reggaeton, it's the, the original in Panama, yes, eh, if you go to look for reggaeton, when they say reggaeton in Panama
Ah, OK
Because many Panamanians have the, Latino, and there's Latino music too but many in Panama, English and uh, Caribbean things
Uh-huh.
These have a lot of influence in Panama
Uh-huh.
Do you understand me? Because Panama is small, three million people
Wow. How small, yes.
But Three million. Yes, But it's very developed, yes, you don't find one thing that's not in Panama and there are people from all over the world, see?
Then it's no the third world?
There are people from all parts of the world. yes.
But, Panama is not third world?
Ah?
It's not third world? It's not a third world country?
No, no, no, no, Well, there's, the thing is that there's eh, nowadays, I don't know, I don't know, I haven't gone much because no It is developed, but also is in the middle, eh.
Oh, yes.
Understand? Because it's a small country, look, once, we had one hundred twenty banks
Wow.
From all parts of the world, yes. yes. a small country with three million is going to have one hundred twenty international banks and all that. But that's how it is, because over there there's a lot, a lot of money passes through there.
Well yes, true. There will be a lot of industry and all. Aha.
Because of the commerce of the canal, yes. Because of the commerce of the canal, and also the Colombians brought all the, the drug related money. In Panama it's said
Ah, yes,yes, Aha. In, ah, they have to hide it somewhere.
Well, that, that's called money laundry
Well yes, aha, but in some place
Money, money laundry is a way of converting ah, illegal money right? illegal.
Uh um, ah, illegal money. Uh um, uh um.
And, no, if you go to a bank right now, ten thousand, ten thousand dollars, right?
Uh-huh.
The bank reports it to the government.
In Mexico it's ca- they say that the people give a name
Give, what?
Give a name.
Give a name, yes.
Sure, a drug dealer comes and tell me this, I'll give you one hundred thousand dollars if you give me your name.
Oh.
So I give him my name and they can open a store or whatever and put an account in my name, but it's their money, and they give me
Aha, yeah.  But this is them.  yes.  But here no, they can't do it, because you ten million pesos
Uh-huh.
Yes if it's a store there's no problem, right?
Uh-huh.
But the government watches people who deposit a lot of cash. Because, let's suppose that you are, that they're watching you, and you earn like
twenty thousand a year, you see?
Uh-huh.
Then, then you deposit one hundred thousand dollars.  Where did those one hundred thousand dollars come from?
Well, yes, they will ask you and then they will start with the taxes.
And, eh, and where did you get the one hundred thousand dollars?
Uh um. Uh um.
You are doing something, something that is not legal, you are doing something that are not reporting to the government to pay taxes.
yes. yes. Look yes.
Sometimes like that too, understand?
Uh um. Listen, and you, are, are an accountant and are, are you certified?

Uh um.
And I was able to study and all that, well I was a long time teaching. But now I find that my English is worse than my Spanish now.
Your English is worse than Spanish?
Better than Spanish.
Why do you say that?
I'm losing the Spanish. And not only me, -O-K? Look, let me tell you something. My, I, -O-K Eh, you hear Jennifer Lopez, right?

Jennifer Lopez when she was making the move, with, the movie of
Selena. Uhm.

Uhm.
Hello
Hello, how are you?
And fine and you, who are you?
Eh, my, my name's James, and I live in New York, and you?
Ok, my name's Olga.  I live in Texas.
Texas
But right now I'm visiting Kansas
In Kansas.  Wow
Kansas City aha.
We're far.
Ah, where from?  From, from New York?
Yes
Well not, not so far.
Not much, have, have you visited New York recently?
Yes well no, about two years ago I visited New York.
Hmm.  I, I think that we're far.  I've never been to Kansas.
Oh no
Oh yes, yes, yes. I passed when, when I came from my town, yes.
Oh, they're small counties, but it's pretty here.
Eh, Yes, do you like it more than Texas?
Oh no, I like Texas more
Oh, what is it with Texas that everybody likes it so much?
Oh, well, it may be because I have been so many years living there, and I, eh, know it better, the city, the peopl,e everything. Maybe that
Oh
But, figure, I've lived for more than thirty years in the state of Texas
Wow, are you staying long here?
Eh, no, Hardly two days. I'll stay until the twenty-nine, and then from here, afterwards, the twenty-nine I'll go
El Paso, Texas
Oh
and then back to Fortward, were I live
I see
That's it, and what do you think about the subjcet for today?
Music, I like music
Yes
I lo-, I love music. Music amazes me
Hm mm
I don't have a, mm, specific preference for, for a kind of music. Eh, I listen to any kind of music, eh, I enjoy more soft music, I like classical music because you have to
it has a message. Music that relaxes me
Mhm mm
Eh, and sometimes, I play, I don't know, a Reggae-ton, something like that, that are more, more
Like noisy
hyper, more noisy, hyper. But I don't have a, eh, specific preference. I can't tell, oh I like salsa, or ballads, or
Reggae-ton, I, I like them all, but I prefer music that
Hm
has a message, that brings peace, that brings, a , a message, like a good message for your soul
Hm, mm, well, yes, good description. I actually agree with you, because more or less
and
what happens to me, I have no preferences, but I do like much more classical music. Because if listen to, for instance,
country music, or polkas and so, well it does bore me listening to that music
Aha
The music that never bores me, precisely, is classical music, that's why I think that classical music is what I like the most
They ask us wheter
Yes
it plays an important role in our life. In my life it does, because, like you said, classical music is important to me because
it brings me peace and quietness, it relaxes me.
Aha
So, when, for instance, when I am crushed or, sorry, when I am sad or so, I play music. And it helps a lot because
it pushes me to meditation, sorry, meditate about life. That maybe in that moment I know for a minute
let's say, of sadness, but I think of the other people, and say there must be people feeling worse than I do. So, yes, music helps me
Yes
much to, to reconsider, and and I'm not so bad, because there are much worse people than me.
Yes, it makes life more pleasant.
It does.
It makes life much more temporary.
Yes
There are moments when, in reality, you get sad about some topics
Yes
and, it can be that touching on these topics that have a, have links to similar situations that you're really living,
Hmmm
and since it touches you a little bit, but in reality, I like it, I tell you, I like music that carries a message.  Something that
this, if it's something lively, that carries a message, if not, it's only a racket, to say it like this, and the noise with
combined with people who are happy.
Hmm
But this really doesn't have a message
Hmm
a message, or something personal, something that the artist, ah, writer, the composer, the exhibitor of the song.
Hmmm
This, wants to bring it to the public.  And this only, if I want an important role in my life, sure, because, I tell you, without, without it,
eh, there are situations where live makes, makes you sad, and, what I know, you feel alone.
Hmmm
And music makes you happy.  And I think that it has something to do with the real creation of us, because eh, if we sit and we look at the Biblical level,
Hmmmm
the truth, like in, times before, for example, they say that David danced.  Or the praises that they gave to God.
Hmm
And if we go much much further back than this it says that Lucifer was the, was the angel who was in charge of music.
Of the praise for, for, for God.
Yes
So yes we're created in His image and likeness of God, it means that the Lord likes it, Go- God likes music, no, the, the, the
we have a link to, to them, then.  We're part of his creation, so we have, it brings me to think that, well, God liked music
he enjoyed music too, he lived music and I think that for this, for us that they say, you hear all kinds of music and
and, and it means that music is a universal language
It is
And so, eh, yes, it plays an important role in our lives.  I al- I work in the car
Hmmm
almost eight hours a day, ten dollars an hour, every day.
Hmmm
And, the first thing I do is put music on, and I tell you, I put music on, any kind of music,
Ah
that has a message, that brings me, that brings me tranquility, that brings me peace, that makes me happy.
Hmmm,
And now another negative music or that has to do with violence, that has to do with, with with, with other issues, other problems eh, or, or
personal things, I don't listen to it. I, only listen to anything that brings me, a type, a type of message, a type
some sort of joy, something of
Aha.
that brings me tranquility, brings me peace in my life.
Yes, look, I liked the idea of what you say that really the music is, is a companion, is a companionship. Right, I, I do feel when you are alone, and, and
Yes,
and you listen to music, you don't feel alone. Then, and, and especially if it's a music with a message, like you say. Because, messages that make you reconsider
meditate, so.
Aha
Then, yes, up to a certain extent well is essential. imagine if, if there was no music I don't, I don't know I have no idea what would happen without, without music.
Besides look, I love to dance.
Aha Ah see
I love to dance a lot. So imagine, without, without music well, I don't know, don't know what we would do.
Yeah Look you see, you see, then, then let's put this dance, you dance when you are happy. The music has brought a, a
a joy, understand.
Yes, yes
And, that's why I tell you, is something is something like, like you say, indispensable, and
Hm That's, that's like food for the spirit, like
we and
like a oh, something that propels you to keep going, to rest a little and keep on going in your routine or whatever right.
Yes No, that, that, is my opinion of music
Hm mm
And I think I think that I share it with, with, with many other people because, really, unless they have a preference for music,
Hm
that they like something specific.
Aha Yes
But tell me
Well so far you and I are in complete agreement really. Because yes more or less we coincide in, in our way of thinking regarding music and
yes
and like we start focusing more or less on the same type of music, because I too listen to any type of music, but it does takes me
I'm much more interested in, classical music.
Yes
Because like I tell you, the ones, the other types of music, well I would listen to one, two, three, four songs, already the fifth like kind of bores me, or like I'm not liking it
And in, and the classic well no, that one doesn't bore at all.
Yes, and
Then, yes, yes is
And it doesn't bore, and even less when, when you have knowledge of who's playing it, of who
is Hm mm
and, who was the writer, and how old it is, like that, because I, because I also start listening to classical music, and
Hmm
whe- I have a friend who's a professional pianist,
Hmmmm
in, classical music.  So he
Ah
eh, when they play, they're playing something, and he says, hey, this is Bach, this is Beethoven, this is the other.
Ok.
And so he tells me more or less what, what he's playing, and I more or less understand through, through
through him, well.
Yes yes
But, when, when you know, when, he really hasn't brought it to plain paper
Yes
to paper.  Eh, it was in the paper, what, who's playing, what they're playing, and you understand a lot more, so it makes you like
you appreciate it a lot more, therefore.
Yes, sure, yes, li- it's like when you listen, when you tell something, like a story that they told you.
Aha
Well yeah, you put the emphasis according to what you think it really relates to.  Music is like this.
Hi, my name is Leticia
Hi, how are you?, Hi Leticia, How are you?
Fine, everything's fine, what's your name?
Uh, my name is Jaime, I'm from New York
Uh, Armen
Jaime
oh, Jaime, I'm sorry, right, because
what?
I know an Armen, and i said "oh, another Armen"
right
two, uh, i, I'm living in Philadelphia
yes, yes, i can imagine, i thought i talked to you a few days ago
Yes, i don't, i don't think so, because this is my second call
Yes, yes, uh, let me see, yes, uh, you're, you're in college, right?
yes
Right, i spoke to you, i think it was last week, like, a week ago, i was, you were headed for some beers, i think
No, i don't think so
No
No, because i don't remember
uh, uh, the subject was regarding the abuse towards women
ah no, no, no, no, no.
It wasn't, it wasn't you then.
It wasn't me, it was someone from Philadelphia too.
There are many Argentinians in Philadelphia then.
yes, wow, you talked with another Argentinian in Philadelphia, how crazy.
yes, it was an Argentinian in Philadelphia, I think.  I won't say with the same voice, because it can't be the same voice, but.
And you don't remember the name.
At least.  No, I don't remember the name, but, this.  Eh, What did I tell you?  I don't know if, so she said she was
to get a beer and it was when I got a beer then.
Ah no, I don't know.
You don't remember, no, at least it wasn't you, it wasn't you then.
Ah and ah, sure, how nice.  And where are you from?
I'm from Panama.
Ah, how many Panamanians are there in this study, because the other day I spoke with a Panamanian too.
Oh yes, yes, I know who it is, I know her too.
Patricia, from,
Patricia, from New York.
from Delaware.
Aha, from Delaware, exactly.
Wilmington, I talked with her the other day.
She talks a lot right, she talks a lot, Patricia talks a lot.
yes, we talked a lot, she talked the majority of the time. This is so funny.
yes, yes, And how?
mm? And how did you find out about the study?
on the Internet I was playing with Craig, Craigslist
Ah, on Craigslist
aha
ah, look at that.
eh, tell me, tell me.
yes because that intrigued me, because I think the study is from the university of Pennsylvania.
yes Aha Is the same one that you did.
Sure, yes, yes, yes.
And what And what do you study?
I'm not studying, I'm doing, I'm working.
Oh, you work in the University, how nice.
yes, yes, I'm not studying
Well, we already talked a little of everything, now let's talk about the topic before,
yes, what's more this topic, I already got it another time.
Ah, yes that's why you were so bored right. Me too.
Because up to now every time I've talked, I talked with two women, I never talked with men that's why I tell you that for sure I didn't talk with you.
For the two times I talked, I talked to women.
Ah well then it's good then. The topic is good.
And what are you doing in New York?
What did you say?
What is it that you are doing in New York?
I mm, I have a small. clothing company.
Ah, look how nice.
And then, practically, eh, I do, the buying, the selling,
yes
I go and show samples I go to the deliveries the only, the only person that works there is me.
Ah, look how nice. Have you been doing that long?
the only one. I've been working like that seven years, already.
ah, good.
Although, although this year is the slowest year, but well, it's been seven years. And you, only work in the university?
yes, yes and I do studies no.
When are you coming to New York for a little trip around here?
yes the truth is that New York we wanted to go this weekend, but at the end no. We didn't end up going but. eh, this year I was there twice, it's also not been that long that I've been living here, it's been seven months, so
Ah yes, only nine months.
yes, yes, it hasn't been long,
okay
so, no, I was in New York twice, this year.
And yes, and what, how did you like it? You like it or not?
I like it for, like it for a while, I mean I like it for a while, I don't like it to live there.
Why don't you like it to live, tell me?
Because too much craziness, a very hectic city. I think I would go crazy, I don't know.
That's what makes it fun.
yes that's why I like it for a little bit, but after I want, I like Philadelphia because it has, is more peaceful and also you have things to do, is not that you don't have anything to do.
But anyways we are so near that whenever I want I can go to New York to spend the day.
eh, ah that's good.
I mean and it doesn't come out that expensive.
That's good, No, really right. I, I have gone to Pennsylvania, to Philadelphia, but since I have no ambiance. I don't have people I know, or anything, I've gone to walk by the,
by the, the main avenue, I've walked, I've eaten, shopped, and at night I went to a few restaurants.
yes
to talk with crazy bartenders only and after that I came, I returned.
Sure, to spend the day is good, same here,  in comparison to New York there are not that many things to do, that's true, but,
yes
well, I mean to live is good, because is a city that has a more or less acceptable size and you find everything you need.
And how about the night, how do I say it, the night life there?
and here all in the United States at least. I don't know in New York, but here everything closes, very early to my taste.
Oh, yes, And you like it?
and the, the weekends after to eat, after eleven it's difficult for them to be open.  I'm used to go to eat hm,
At this time or at nine or something, so, not so late, not so early.
ah, ah, at this hour the chickens go to bed there in my cit- there in Panama.
yes, not for this, in Panama they also eat dinner late.
no, yes, eating dinner early, and after going to bed early because there's nothing to do anymore.
ah, they eat dinner early and they go to bed early in Panama.
yes, yes, at, no, at eleven at night the restaurants are already closed here for.
ah, look at that.
Di-difficult to find a restaurant open later.
I didn't know this.
yes
No, it's the opposite in Argentina, people.  The restaurants open at eight at night and until two in the morning, three, they don't close.
ah, That's good.
And the, the bars where you can have a drink, they can be open almost all night.
Almost that, no, yes, there are bars that are open later, but.  Usually, for get it, the restaurants are closed early.
hmm
Early, well Leticia, tell me, tell me about the technology and the,
The, the technology, yes.  Well, I'll tell you what, what I said to the same person I talked to.  That,
Tell me
That well, that things around here that I feel I depend on are the computer and,
and the telephone.
and of the com- and the phone up to there only because by the computer I also manage by the phone let's say, but, I mean the computer more, than the phone, but the phone also, no.
You sound, You sound relatively young Leticia, how old are you?
what?
How old are you Leticia?
Thirty one.
Thirty one.
yes
You sound like a fifteen year old girl.
Really
yes
No, I'm not that young.
yes you like a fifteen year old girl
How old are you?
I'm thirty seven years old
aha Well
eh
Up to thirty is good, the thing is not to pass the thirty.
yes.
how nice, Thirty well, I can stand it
The bad, the bad thing is that time doesn't forgive, Leticia.
No, that's true.
eh, that doesn't forgive not for love, nor money.
yes
He, he will, will continue to keep getting older, but forget it, that's only a number.
yes
after the, after the mm
yes
well you already entered and admitted it, it means, that, that, you feel good, about your age. Ah, because there are lots of people that,
No, yes, yes.
it doesn't feel good to say thirty one, thirty two, that's it. Especially the women. When they already pass twenty five, they don't want to keep aging.
Well, yes, obviously, I also don't want to keep on, but well, one ages.
And
what are you going to do.
Exactly what can you do?
yes is like that. And how do you feel you depend on technology?
I depend on technology only, eh, the same as you, the eh, communication, what has to do with technology, that if eh, I have to do a fax, send a fax.
receive an email with, with pictures,
Sure
or, or, send a, an inventory on excel.
Sure
eh, receive an inventory on excel, send a wire. To pay for merchandise also. Right now the phone,
Sure
is very useful also, because, I take, I've taken pictures by phone, I've sent an email and the person has seen the merchandise without me having to show it to them or having to go there to,
the office.
ah,
To, to send picture, you understand.
yes I understand.
So, Because yes, let's say you have one of these electronic digital cameras, that you take pictures, you still have to take a computer,
yes
to, to download the pictures and then send them.
yes
Well with the phone you just send it like that and no,
Sure, yes, yes, yes
and, and yes, I really depend, it makes my life easier. It facilitates things, they make it much faster, and, and I like it, well I like it eh,
Who doesn't, who doesn't like to make their life easier, You understand me? so, in that sense, that's all I have to say about the
the computer,
yes, yes of the communications more than anything.
yes, yes exactly.
yes besides I think that it was the revolution of the last few years, the topic of the communications.
Aha, then, yeah, yes practically all, I think that I already elaborated, much more last time that I talked with, with, I don't know with whom, I think I spoke with an Argentinian the other time, there in Philadelphia.
yes
Mauricio.
Mauricio.
Mauricio. Yes
Mariano, no.
Mariano, Mariano, Mariano,
Is my husband
Ah Mariano is your husband
yes
I spoke with, spoke with Mariano, I don't know if I spoke with Mariano of the same
It could be, it could be that you spoke with him.
of, of the same topic, ask him if he talked with from Panama Oh, no with Mariano I spoke, Mariano I spoke, I think that I spoke of something else with Mariano.
It was regarding the women, the abuse, the abuse of women also something like that.
ah, it could be, I really don't know. But, there are many Panamanians in the United States, or no.
No, not really, I have, I have.
No
eh, I've been like fourteen years in New York and don't know.
You don't know any Panamanians.
No, I don't know any Panamanians.
Hi, I'm Arturo
Good Night, This is Lourdes
To whom I'm speaking to? Hi Lourdes, well
Good night, which is the piece of technology you use the most?
well, depends, I think that music, All that has to deal with music
Oh, like MP3 players and the
Because, yes, Mp3 players, CD's and all that, any kind of music playback, but I think I listen to music practically all day, then
I can't stop to use the cellphone, I was sometime without a cellphone and I didn't used that much, now it might pass a day I don't make a call, or be called by anyone
I see
And well, also the computer, but you use that a lot
And those, and technology, has helped to choose music or what?
I think that technology has definitely helped, because, when I was younger, the only option was having some tapes to listed
I see
And in the road, and now, if you want to choose a song from a tape, it was hard because you had to forward the recording and it took time
Sure, sure
And now, with technology, from a MP3 you can see all the music you have and you can pick a song
At any moment
And in fact, with iPods you can have almost all your music library, at any moment, that's really cool, it's really easy
Well, figure out that I would say that the computer
yes
Because eh, the computer
aha
Because I use in my job, I use it at home, eh, for things, I mean for anything, right?. If in the morning we are going to
yes, I see
work, the first thing my husband does is look for the weather cast in the computer
sure
And if we need to save information or, eh, eh, keep the house accounts, then we do it on the computer
so, we don't have to care about papers or anything
yes, right, but you must have a backup, right?, you must have it well protected because in case of malfunction you would loose a lot of information
Well, look, that's our sin, we are very bad with the backup so we keep paper records, for five or six years, but after that we destroy them
But keeping the backup like more regular, eh, at home, eh, we are not very good at that, in the job we have a
that, eh, everybody save their documents in a drive
aha
and so, they access the drive, they work in their own computer, but they save in the drive
In a drive, oh, OK
And so, it is a way of more or less preventing in case of
yes, because it
worries me
not long ago, my hard drive was deleted, well, a beverage fell on to my compouter
Oh no
it did in my laptop, it erased everything that I had, I had super important pictures of trips and lots of music and things like that
and I was pretty stupid because I didn't back it up before, so I lost, I lost everything
Oh, that's a pity, I'm sorry.
it was horrible.
I'm sorry, you see, that's another thing, we, the ones that have, for pictures, we have the pictures stored in the laptops
aha
But we have an external drive with copies of all of them.
Oh, okay, that's great.
And now that we have a new baby.
Oh, yes
You know, you take pictures of him every time he smiles, you take a picture if he farts, a picture, we take a lot of pictures of him
yes, of course,
so, we have hundreds of pictures and maybe four or five are really nice pictures, wonderful pictures, so we do share those with our friends.
yes, that's right
so, we keep the rest in the special file. Some are in the computer and we have a copy in the external drive.
oh well
But you are right, when I was writing my thesis, my master
aha
oh,oh, I had to file it on a certain date in order to be able to graduate, right.
aha
And can you believe me that after working on weekends, on all sorts of arrangements, uh, i was changing my computer from the university to the house
Yes
And all the changes i had made in the document got deleted
Oh no
yes,
Darn, such a trauma
And after crying like an idiot for like twelve hours i said, well maybe that means that the next thing i write will be a lot better than the previous
Yeah, i mean, yeah, i hope so
And so, uh, so with that mood, well, i, you know me, i stayed working the rest of the week and i met the deadline
Yes
But, it's true, i mean
wow
that's one of the things that, it's technology, exactly, exactly
yeah, that, that is hard for us, right?, we have to
Because then you become a slave of the computer or whatever technology
Yes, sure, exactly, if you lose your computer, or you lose your cellphone, for example, or you lose something and you don't even know how to communicate with anyone, you don't have
Sure
you don't have a phone agenda and you don't have anything, because everything was
It's true, look, i, i mean, the, my phone ran out of battery once
right
and I couldn't find, I couldn't find the telephone number of my dad, I don't know it by heart. They moved, eh, the number is new and believe or not I don't know it, because I have it saved in the cellular phone agenda
yes right
and I don't it by heart. So it is, it is a question that helps a lot but also makes you somehow a slave to technology
yes right, right now we become more dependent on that, before, maybe, I mean, I mean before people, people managed to live without, but right now
I think it would be the same with or without cellular phones
Sure
it's just that, we learn to depend on them, actually I don't think that have changed, no, no, not so many things have changed, but
Sure, sure
But, but yes that's it. There is a lot
Another, another piece of technology that I have realized how important it is, is the microwaves oven, because before
oh, yes
I have never cooked in the microwaves
No
because I don't like the taste of microwave food
yes no
but now, with the baby
aha
to prepare his food
aha
In five minutes I can steam cook for him pumpkin, 'yame', 'yutia', banana or whatever I want to feed him
Right
And so, i don't even have to think
And before it took more much time or what?
Exactly, exactly
Yes, i have also noted that right now, because, uh, i just started living here alone in, in the school, i lived at home with my parents before and
and the, well i worried about the food and now that I've started cooking and all that
right, right, right
I realize now that, it takes a lot of time, and sometimes i mean, i don't have the time, because i have to work, i have to go do homework, or i have to study, whatever, and the, I'd like to have a microwave and i don't
right
i have to get one as soon as possible, because yes, it saves a lot of time, it's really impressive
Sure, sure, to re-heat, not so much for cooking, the taste is not very good
Yeah, not to cook, exactly
But for re-heating
right?, but then there are those instantaneous foods in the airports or stuff like that
Yeah, because then once a week, of course, of course
that, well, you can buy and cook a lot faster, and it doesn't taste very good, but it nourishes you
Sure, but, and, the other thing you can do is cook once a week, you freeze it
right
and defrost the meal, uh, according to, the days of the week, right?
yes, that's a good, a good technique, to defrost everything there
here we do that with minced meat, we season it slightly, marinade, salt garlic, nothing more
aha
then we save it in individual packages
yes aha
and, one day we thaw it and make tacos, another day we thaw it and make tomato sauce for the pasta
oh, look
another day we thaw it and do some other thing, and since it is already seasoned all you have to do is put it in the microwaves, heat it and mix it with, whatever, right?
whatever you are going to serve. Oh, great idea, great idea, maybe I will use it too
oh, do it, you'll see how useful it is
yes
eh
because otherwise I end up cooking whatever too quickly, usually pasta. because it is the fastest thing I can do and
Sure, boy this way you'll end up putting on sixty pounds
and that stuffs me, what?
That you'll put on a lot with the
yes, right?, with the pasta diet
with the pasta, eating pasta, just pasta, right, right
yes, no, no, I must start my new diet. But anyway I don't have,, honestly, I don't have any problem with
with weight, I am rather thin, I don't know, my metabolism processes everything very fast and I hardly gain weight
yes, but until you are twenty-five. twenty-six, thirty
Well, likewise, yeah, exactly, that changes things
So you see, there's no, there's no "god forgiveness", yeah, right?
yea, right, there's no, there's no, they don't discriminate by race or color
No, no, there's no metabolism that can stand it
Everyone, yeah, it's true
The, although sometimes you don't notice, but the other technology that has also made life easier is the washing machine
Yeah, it's also impressive
because the first, the first three months i had my baby, well, i washed all his clothes by hand, because we didn't, since we were using a public machine, i didn't want to use
Yes
uh, put his clothes with other people's clothes, because i didn't know what
right, yes
Look boy, what a horrible thing to have to wash every two days, because it piles up a lot
Right
And then, well, it's not soaking, and rinsing, and no, it's soaking,
Yes, i can imagine
scrubbing the clothes, rinse it, hang it
Yeah, no
uh
A different story
Exactly, exactly, so
yes I think that also that's like what I was thinking now, the technology where it's changed us the most is  in the simple things, in the daily life like,
having electricity, having I mean having electricity to have a refrigerator, those things that we now see as basic.
sure
are, that has affected us a lot, it has changes us a lot we don't even realize it but, but, if you start to take away those fundamental things like the refrigerator, imagine living without a refrigerator, it would be so hard.
no exactly, buying everything, buying everything daily
Everything per day, yes everything fresh, everything per day, it would be ugh, imagine. It would be, another story.
and in fact one of the reasons why many kids would die when there was no refrigeration was  because the milk you would buy in the morning already in the afternoon the milk was, curdled, it was spoiled.
Hello?
Hello?
Who am I talking to?
This is Paulo, what's your name?
Paulo?
yes
Paulina.
Oh,
Where are you from?
Lets see, people will go to
from Argentina.
yes.
I'm from Chile.
Oh, well, we are neighbors.
Neighbors, yes, how are you?
Fine, how are you?
Fine, where do you live?
In Philadelphia.
Philadelphia.
Yes, what about you?
In Georgia.
Oh.
In Athens, Georgia.
uh uh. Uh uh. And how is everything well?
Good, what are you doing, studying or whaht?
No, I'm working. Working in whatever.
yes. yes.
Uh uh. So that.
How long, have you been here?
No a year.
A year?
It's going to be a year, yes.
Ah.
yes yes. you?
Um, eleven.
eleven years?
Eleven years
Uf. Man
yes, I came. I came here just after the after the how do you say it to um
Fourth half I don't know what it is.
to High School
oh, High School
The High School, well, yeah, fourth
Yes, uh huh
That's it
Studying here?
Huh?
Are you studying
Oh, i came here to study and then i got married, so my husband is getting a doctorate and we are here in Athens, still studying.
Oh, oh, hey that's very good
Oh yes
Uh huh. I have my husband here that's also
And that seems like, yes
He's doing a Post-doc
Oh yes?
Yes,
Oh, very well
Here in Penn University
How's that?, in which area?
In biology, molecular biology
Okay
Uh uh, and what are you studying?
how nice. I'm home with the kids and
Uh uh.
he's studying technology
Uh uh.
that is from the area of the occasion.
Uh uh
Ah yes
Well. a lot of kid? A lot of children?
Two
Two kids?
Andres is three years old. And Cristina is a year old.
Ah, cute little ones.
yes.
Beautiful.
yes, and do you have kids?
No, no, no
Not yet?
We are thinking about it, not yet.
No, it´s all right
we´re, uh, used to the life in the United States, after that we´ll see
yes, no?
We want to, but we can´t do it yet. It´s not economically
It gets harder
sure. Sure, sure. First we have to come here and get settled, and then we´ll see. So, all right, has it been a long time since you last went to Chile?
Let´s see, we went there the last time, yes, a long time ago, let´s see, I´ve gone back twice
Oh
and the last time it was because my family came here, so
Ah, very good
she, when did we last go? 2000, 2001
Uh uh
Four years ago
yes, yes, a long time ago
yes, because I was pregnant with Andres
Sure
And we went to collect blood samples, in fact, because I was working in a laboratory that, a project called, molecular genealogy
Uh uh
where they make a data, a database about. Like the, more or less like your wife, about
Uh uh, yes, yes, yes
They take some blood samples and you were there with mu husband
Oh, that's nice
and they will take
Nice, nice
And the last time he went to Chile
Oh, we were in Argentina few time ago, like a month
Oh really?
yes
Oh, that's nice, all your family there
Oh, yes absolutely everything
Oh, that's nice
That all
You miss some things
yes, I miss
other thins are less missed here
Yes, it happened to me, I mean being all those
Mm, no,a year is a year
little time, and somethings they had, well, yes, yes
In bank, the moment you enter you are getting out
That's fantastic
things yes, some things are much easier here.
yes, and even the required power that you have here
yes, no?
yes, and when we met in Argentina everything seemed, like, we weighted everything and it was cheap.  But it's not the same.  With
here and we buy and we deprive ourselves, like, in Argentina you know that when you go with one hundred dollars, it didn't seem like one hundred dollars. They're charging us a lot.
For this.
yes.
A lot of aha, it's like.  Well they're all, they're all
No, yes.
It's the same.  So, well.
Some things are strange too, I remember this month when I went with my husband
Hmm.
We had to make presentations and everything and sometimes there were some things that's part of the culture no more.  It seemed, I don't know, we had the permission and everything for
like transport blood and everyone seemed to us
yes.
they opened our bags, took out my bags of shampoo and conditioner and said, what's this?  Shampoo.  So, with the papers and everything, well good.
Some things were more complicated, were heaver than here, here it was easier to do things.
Sure.  Sure.
But other things like eating avocado, here it's really expensive.
Uh-huh.
any food.
yes, yes, yes.  Ah in Chile, yes, we eat a lot of meat
yes.  Here it's expensive, very expensive.
here it's really expensive and it's not the same, so that we had oh, terrible, we spent thirty, forty, fifty kilometers when we went to look at the airport and we immediately stopped at a grill and I started to eat meat like I
like the carnivore I am.
No it's true I miss it and mare that here I buy everything cut and everything
Everything cut up differently, and I don't buy it because it's so different for
yes.
or anything yeah no no no.
And it's really expensive, yes.
yeah, no.  Uh-huh.  So good.
No, and it's from a friend who's in Argentina too, eh.
yes, we're
She always says, no.  The meat that I no.
yes, the meat is horrible.  The wine too.  Here it's expensive and
The tea too, even if you can buy tea and everything well
yes, we can find it. Yes we can find it and it's fine, yes, yes yes.
Yeah.  Life is good if there's tea, everything's good.  Nah.
Eh, no, we're missing meat.  Now we have to dedicate ourselves with coffee too, everything's good but these things that you've also lived.  You go finding
in the taste of the food of the most
Yes.
Afterwards everything is good.  There is always something similar that we will find so it's good.  What is that?
Ah, that's great.  So. And um they gave your wife the scholarship, how does that come together
Yes, yes, yes, the one with Penn University, us, we are from Mar De Plata, sort of near Buenos Aires
Uh huh.
And from there from Mar de Plata and everything they said okay and they gave me the J1 J2 visa
Uh huh
It allows me to work and for the time being we are working, as it goes working at Penn and I work.  At times a job ends and I start another.
I've only had this for awhile it's my third job.  So but I know very well
Yes.  It's difficult at first but afterwards
Yes, yes, no
Things get better.
Yes, yes, yes, I spend my time getting to know more people. We don't go distinct people that
Yes
They offer work and well you make friends here and there.  And since I know a
No yes
a guy from Chile also.  I haven't seen him for a long time. He's a music professor.
Oh yes.
Uh huh.  So I don't know, he's been here about 10 or 12 years.  He left once.  Didn't he tell us.  You don't remember.  You don't remember.
Ah, no, no, I asked you about the music professor.  Wasn't it one time, he returned once to Chile, didn't he.  Ah, he said he went back five years, but afterwards he missed it here.
it happened that he was in Chile and here
No yes.
Because he has his life.
yes, no.
here too, right?
You miss it, I say not the next time that we go on a visit I say it is better to go for a I tell my husband that if we go it is because he is
he is American but he speaks Spanish
Hmm.
I say, I would like to live for a time in Chile or another Hispanic country for children to learn Spanish well.
yes, fantastic of course.
Because here all their friends only speak English and we at home speak Spanish but is like if, they prefer English because
They lose it a lot, right? It is a lot easier.
all of them speak it, of course.
For them.
It is possible to go for a while, I say the ideal would be to be contracted from here.
Ah, they would have a great time there.
yes.
This is what we all want. It is very difficult to find. All of them Argentinians, Latin American all of them say it is the ideal, right?
yes, because they
But until now I don´t know someone Maybe that
I don't know, my sister is also married to another gringo, she and he are working, she works for the government in some construction companies, he is, uh
Um
How do you say construction manager there?, Construction engineer?, i don't know
Yes, uh, foreman. Well, he's an engineer
Well, uh, but i don't know, uh
Well, yes, right?, but so, to run Argentina, uh, with six
Well
Uh
The thing is that each working company has several parts or projects in several projects and they were re trying to be employed for like two years in a project in Chile, but
Um
it didn't work out so
Oh
Well, let's try again
Uh huh
later
Uh huh
But, i told him, he told me "if we go to Chile, instead of spending all our money in, uh, going to the most expensive schools and all that, we take a
all the money and live well and afterwords we come back with a small saving too
sure, sure, yes
Instead of living large, right?
And how much is the dollar in Chile?
the truth is that
You don't know what the difference is, no idea?
I don't have any idea.
yes, we're seeing on the Internet, it's three with forty three cents.  One dollar for it's three with forty three pesos.
it's going up.  I don't know what's happening in Argentina.
But even in Chile it's more, it's like five hundred, six hundred.
ah yes.
But I don't know how much it is
yes.
how much it is in Chile and Argentina, I don't know.
Sure, I don't know, I don't know.  Sure.  No, I don't know how it is
But things were expensive when we went, some things were the same price as here and people don't earn as much as here.
Sure, yes, I know this.
Some things were as expensive as here and
yes, yes, we saw it.  When we went there, to the, the
yes.
crazy, what they charge.  It's crazy.  And so after a while I got my car insurance,
ah, and the gasoline
and, and well since I
terrible, no.
borrowed in the tank and started well the needle so I said to the boy who was there that no no, that way, that way
So expensive,
No yes it's true, it's like three times more than here or more.
Sure, sure, sure.  It makes them rich
yes.  And it's expensive here and now but
Han, but with a salary more or less of a manager, no.  There it hurts every time that you're going to charge, you have to have the tank, no.  No, no, no.  So
This is something that's oof.  If I go back one day.  At least like, how we said, now I have a friend who went back
Argentina.
to Argentina and close to Mendosa.
Yeah.
There, on the other side of Argentina.  And each time I have to call, I call on the telephone and it's, yes, yes I was there for four or five years
and he went back
You get used to it here.
Ooh.  And they say that it's difficult for me to buy a car and
Hmm.  And to open a bank account.  You have to, I don't know, it's complicated.
yes, it's complicated.
Hello!
Hello! How are you? Who am I talking to?
Marcela
Marcela, Good afternoon, I'm Lorena. How are you?
Well, thank you. Where are you calling from?
Where? Where am I calling from? San Antonio, Texas.
yes
And where are you?
in, eh Saveville, North Carolina
Ah, in North Carolina And where are you from?
I am Argentina. And you?
Ah. And, I'm Mexican.
Ahh
How are you?
well, How's it going for you?
Well, many, many thanks well, today's theme is pretty interesting, yeah?
Yes technical artifacts. What's nee- yes, well look, the dishwasher
Yeah the juicer, the planca, the microwave,
sure, but
eh, the radio,
yes, yes
the computer,
yes, perhaps they are, eh, want, eh are talking of, of more modern things, more digital, things that we've had in these last years, and that would be the computer and the cellular.
Oh, yes
has influenced our life a lot and yes, they are technological advances. Because well if we go to places where they still don't have them, where, instead of the blender they have
to use a mortar and pestle
Ah, yes
Right? or the manual grinder and,
yes, or take wash the clothes in the river by hand.
and, exactly Right?
I shoot myself
then I think that yes, these are definitely technological advances, that have influenced our life a lot.
yes, yes
and for good because I frankly, I wouldn't be too much in the plan, in which there are people in the, social experiments Right?
yes
That leave all the technological advances behind and want to live like that, totally natural. well that's interesting, for a brief time.
yes
Very physically exhausting right?
No, look, what surprises me is this that my grandmother my Dad's Mother
yes
she was, I don't know, 30, 30, or 32 years when she got married, in 1918
Oh
So, she was old in that time
yes
Being that old and getting married
yes
And then, she was, well, my grandparents were are Catalans
Yes
And then, they make cloth, you see?
yes
She embroidered, all the things she used at home, the blankets, all was embroidered and all was done by here
Oh, that's nice
All the cloth she used, all the cloth her children used, she did everything, except my grandfather's suits, that were made by a tailor, but she could made that if she wanted
The shirts
Oh!
she did
yes
All tat, and it cooked delicious how they cooked and you read about all days in the Argentina newspaper, a Catalan newspaper and a French newspaper
Oh my God!
yes, and they did
wow
she was the manager, the one who handled all the money of a factory of overall uniforms that my grandfather owned
oh my god! she was an exceptional woman, don't you think so? although
how come she could do all that, when I was a child she did have a washing machine but she used to do things
the traditional way, you know what I mean?
with her own physical strength
And I think it is because we do, we do a lot of things but we spend almost a third part of the day in the car
Absolutely, Our time
and when we get home we are exhausted eh, and then we sit down and watch TV
that's it
and talk on the phone
less every day
understand?
because sometimes I miss the telephone a little, because I think, you don't talk to your friends not even on the phone, because you don't take the time
No, that's not true
sometimes
that's right
for, for that
Oh, so
but, you are absolutely right
se
I agree absolutely
it is very funny, I mean, they had less technology but achieved more things, of course they didn't have the chances we have nowadays as women
uhm
but they achieved a lot in, in, in the matter of production
of production, of course
and we don't, maybe the women, I am an Artist, so it's like I don't really count, but women who have
eh, professional jobs working in companies, eh, who are accountants, doctors, lawyers, things like this
Well you decide less on your own time actually, somehow your grandmother could organize her time in a more personal way, because, well
when you are an employee working for some other person
uhm
well, often your time belongs to the employer also, often
yes and so the production goes to
and then
to the employer
yes, and it takes most of your time and energy, like you say, when you go back home after driving, after driving the car, after
having worked for eight or ten hours in some other place
yes
and when you finally get home you go, oh!
Sure, you want your time
What did I have to do?
you want your time, because you've been giving all your time to others
And it's true that when you use certain technologies, you avoid learning how to do things they way they were done when those technologies weren't around
if someday a bomb falls or a fantastic situation like that, you'll have to start civilization all over again
yes, yes
well, then I wonder: how will we do it?
we won't know anything, you know?
if we didn't have everything at hand
My sons, I have two sons, one is 23 and the other is 17
yeah
And they went to a school for, for, for, seventh, eight and ninth grade. They were here in the mountains of North Carolina
there are about 28, 29 students, tops
wow!
and they live 4 or 5 in cabins, and they're in the middle of nature
Ah, then they have to learn that, learn how to survive
and they have no computers
wow!
no tv, well, there's a TV that
yeah
that sometimes on weekendsd they bring it, to show a movie, they go and rent a movie
wow, how interesting
but the boys to everything we wake up early in the morning, because I work there in the fall
how great
you wake up early in the morning, everyone helps with the breakfast and there it goes walking, a, a half mile until the
school buildings that are cabins too
hmm
you and there, they start the day with a half hour of singing.
aha
anything, any song, anything that you want that the boys can play and after the boys play guitar, the teachers play guitar and after that the day begins.
and you know
but
at the end of the day
but how interesting
they've done, we've done, we've achieved many things
aha
you know, of course not, what do I know, the boys grow up constantly doing things, doing work but also
we return a little bit to what you were saying, about not watching television
participating
not having a computer
yes
no way that should take your time, your time is to be used in other things, look how interesting really
yes, yes, yes
technology is not completely good
yes
it takes a lot of your time
yes, I think it absorbs too much energy
the boys now spend the whole afternoon in the Internet
oh, yes, and playing video games
and every afternoon in the week, right?
mhm
then you don't have a chance to give your time to other things
yes, so, sometimes I wonder what will be of that physical creativity, understand? that creativity that comes from being among
us when we are very young in the streets, trying to, not to get bored and the comes an idea, and then another one. Now they talk about
ideas, boys talk about ideas, but while they are playing games on the cell phone
right, yes, yes, you are absolutely right
so I don't know
it is, it is relative somehow, the use of time, nowadays, how we are using it still having all these entertainment devices, television,
yes
computers, video games, and all that stuff, they are great consumers of our time, and therefore of our creative activity, like you say.
yes, yes, it comes to destroy our energy
and of our energy
So no, I don't know and I'm very guilty, I'm now trying to not turn on the television because I have a lot to do. Because I turn on the TV
and even if I'm doing things, yes, going from room to room fixing putting this I go shopping, return, this and that. the same is like
it sucks my energy.
yes Let's see, Listen and why, What do you do? how is it that you're an artist?
oh, I'm an actress and also direct.
Ah, okay
then when I'm not working, I'm here in the house in the house
Okay
I paint the walls fix things
well, yes
build new rooms,
aha
thing is working, is
exactly, like resting but working
Sure
And in well, resting, making adobe like they say
sure
here in my country.
yes, And what do you do?
eh, well look I'm a teacher.
Ahm
yes
God bless you
for small children
Ah what a thing.
Eh, I love it, eh the truth is that I love it, because there
Oh, yes no, it's a vocation.
There you have a whole reener- You get filled again with positive energy
yes, yes
Because they really are something else, they are not yet,
yes, yes there are no limits,
they are not so educated on the other options yet
mhm
so there yes all the use of time has to be always very creative and, and and even though at schools they are promoting a lot the a
support in the use of computers for education. But well it's not generalised yet And it's you and well you shouldn't satanize the either,
let's say, the technology because precisely with respect to education, computers are, yes a marvel
oh, yes no that's true.
Usin educational programs and all that,
No, and unfortunately we have to maintain the popula- tion. to the level of the Chinese.
yes, that have a very high technological development.
because they do have a technological development and they are advancing very very, very fast and in that culture education is sacred,
yes
and in this culture it's not.
No,
and then there is where we really can fall behind. we will fall behind but
Your kids, eh, What are they studying?
they are both artists, unfortunately I don't have any any
Hello Jose
Hello, How are you? My name is Marco, And you?
Jose
Hello Jose, How are you? Where are you?
In New York
In New York, I am in Philadelphia.
OK
Technical devices.
technical devices
What type of technical devices do you use?
eh, for my the computer
mm
Eh, Eh, something essential
essential it's what
I use it every day. eh
Connected to the internet.
Yes connected to the internet. am, I helps me to to check mail from work, the personal mail. Eh, I can see, eh eh, the pictures that
I'm taking classes at university. And then sometimes they put, eh, homework,
On line.
and they put different things. eh, raleted to the class, so I have to check it, that. every day.
Yes, I also, I also worked as a computer technician. I assembled them, dissasembled them, fixed them
Okay, yeah
eh, I have, of course, a network here at home, made with 3 machines, a couple screens, my phone, which I´m using to talk now, it´s a, it´s a
how do you call it, a pocket, a pocket pc, eh
hmm
one made by, by hp that basically I use, connecting by wifi
okay, hmm, hmm
to internet, i check my mail, I download videos, I even have movies, you can have a SD card, I have
hmm
hmm, I have, all the information of people, I don´t remember anyone´s phone number
hmm
and I almost don´t remember my own phone number because I don´t dial the number, but I use words, or I use the name of the person I´m
calling
ah, okay
yes, now everything is, at least me and other people I know too, used to put directly the name without, without remembering the number
eh
yes
I have there my mail, my electronic mail, the e-mail addresses too
ah
all goes in the computer, or in the phone that can also connect to the computer, and can move information from one to the other
mm
I listen to music on -mp three through my phone. I put the headset and listen to that.
mm What type of phone did you tell me it was?
eh Is a, is a -hp is an ipaq
okay, okay
That basically the phone in itself is, wide, eh
aha, yes, yes
is wide and it's basically pure screen
okay
a, is a
Has, and it has like a typewriter, it has like all the letters. Like a small processor like mm
I mean ah, it even has I think that it has, eh pocket word and also excel things that are installed in
okay
in the
But it does have a lot of keys. There are, are, a lot of keys.
It doesn't have any key, it doesn't have any key.
oh the keys only the normal ones.
No, no in the, it doesn't have, it doesn't have eh, it doesn't have a keyboard
okay
like that, complete, I had before this one the,
hmm
the, the trio
hmm
And it had, it had the complete keyboard.
hmm
I wrote with this with my two thumbs, I wrote pretty fast.
hmm
eh, but now that it has a screen, it has, it recognizes hand writing,
hmm
eh, I've also learned to write rapidly.
hmm
eh, and it connects with, with everything at work, I also go to class, there are classes where I go in person once a week, a four hour class.
yes hmm
And, the rest is online.  Eh, the subjects are all delivered online, all through email, eh
okay hmm
it seems to me that we're really used to it and I think that we can get used to, we could and should get used to it a bit more.  For example, to see dates
friends' birthdays, family,
hmm
this is something really easy to put on the computer, on the machine without thinking, literally
hmm
Oh, remember
Mm
All the dates and all the events, I think that not only the ones remembering looking in a while, It's not that often
I think that we depend to much in this technology, or too little
I think that we could also, decide, I mean, there is certain people that can't remember more than the telephone numbers
that can be a bad thing
Mm
and basically, according me, I've been using that kid of device for several years, several years
yes..
And after I broke or lost the plastic device, I don't remember anything, I don't know anything
Mmm
And I ask myself for my own telephone number and I don't practically remember
yes
But know, of course, with the connection, or connection the device to the home computer
Mmm
It's always there, I don't lost the information
Mm
You don't lost the phone numbers, the names, specific data, Things you don't always remember, without a note, and when you write those down, you usually write in
a piece of paper that is in reach, at the moment, you remember
yes
you don't necessarily find it back when you need it
right, no, you can get, uh, a lot of information in the computer, and retain it still, to a point where
Yes
you need it or don't want it
And that's why it will only give it to you when
Yes
you remember to ask for it
also, yeah
that's the other problem
Uh
Uh, of course, with the new, uh, new programs that are there and remember to remind you, my phone reminds me in the morning, i mean, i have
my whole day is on the com- on my phone
oh, OK
Uh, see, in a schedule that i have in
uh huh
my whole day schedule, what i do since the hour i start working
uh huh, uh huh
until the hour i get out, the hour at which i have to go pick up the kid from school
Uh huh
To
You have and organization
Exactly, and finding her in high school, sure, for me coming back to faculty to see the classes I'm taking
Mmm
And looking in one look, I see that I have to do in the day, things that before you were always trying to remember, or write down in a
in your arm or in a paper, or as I said
Mmm
Not always in your disposal when you need it
Mmm
But, it's, I think that people, there are people that dedicate too much, not dedicate, but have, they have
yes, yes, it's needed to much, not now
Mmm
no, it looses the human side, let's say
yes
And for example, you feel that you are trying to talk, to call some companies for problems you have
Mmm
Call to the telephone and you have to deal with
With a machine
With a machine and try to
And operator or a machine, like, press the number for that, press number two for that
yes, exactly
That, on one side, i understand that on the side
it
On the company side, uh, yes, it has a lot, a lot uh, lots of complaints, and they kinda want to organize the way to help the client, i mean
did you change direction or do you have a question about this, you know, maybe so
It makes sense, yes
i helped him/her organize those questions, so that the person that's going to help knows what the problem is. Or what specifically about the problem
Exactly
with it, but, uh, it's very frustrating to call a credit card, and have to talk with the operator
that will possibly have consequences, uh, bad ones. Like you lose your card and have to speak to an operator to put pressure on the
uh
that you have been stolen and you want to talk to
yes
them to cancel your card before someone will use it illegally
The way it looks in theory, and i think that most of the time it's like that in companies. The private companies
those public companies and government, typical throughout the world, i guess
uh huh
Uh, they'll find, you'll find that they go around and around more than a snail, i mean, but many others don't, they can't get you the person
Uh huh
Because it almost seems like they're trying to avoid talking to you
Yeah, of course
But
The company, the company, as they did in New York, or what they are doing in many places
the public transportation system, it's doing everything, when you go to the local train station and you buy a ticket, you buy it in a machine, you don't buy it with a person, then that affects
Sure, that might have sense, because it's a really easy transaction, and it might be really fast the machine, while a person
yes, yes, yes
The person is making money by hour and there might be benefits
yes
if you pay, let's say, $10 per hour in the work
Mmm
and the company has some benefits, healthcare, and things like that
Mmm
Hello, my nameis Miriam.
This is Gloria from here in California.
Yeah, How are you, Gloria? I'm from Toronto.
OK
Eh, electrical artifacts Are you dependent on that?
No, what everything, what I use the most is the computer
Uh uh.
yes, the television, no?
Right?
Uh uh.
We are very dependant, I also with the computer to be more informed yeah border
Uh uh.
of the city, right?
yes, over all I use it to communicate with family.
Now, that it's become cheaper than calling
Than the phone.
yeah long distance, yes.
Definitively. Uh uh.
yes, and tell me, Have you been using the computer for a long time?
No, eh. Less than a year.
Oh
Oh, less than a year
I see
The television that
From all the life
The news and all that,
yes but
but, is not that also the
The television
Being a fan of being all day in front of the television, I do use more the computer
Oh, really nice, nice
Yes
Instead, I was born watching Television, I really like the television
Oh
But it's bad
Really bad, but, there is nothing else to entertain us, right?
I try to
Mmm
I really like to watch the news and sometimes I'm really nervous of the talk show that sometimes I watch
Mmm
But I try to, when my son is around I try not to watch it.
Uh uh.
of the
Is the first thing they tell you. Well, the pediatrician tells me, No TV
yes is true.
Guadalupe tells the girl, No TV Guadalupe. And she there loves the TV.
yes, well, is that sometimes there are things so
Uh uh
bad. So entertaining.
Uh uh. yes
That's why eh, that's why they make it, so entertaining so that one becomes hooked.
Mm, yes, now the radio is little, only when my husband is here he likes to listen a lot like a lot to that rock music and everything even though
he's already up there in age he's always liked rock.
Rock how nice, the rock
Uh uh.
Latin or American rock?
More than anything eh yes you could say Latin because is eh is eh a group eh, I don't know where it's from. I have no information of
that type of music.
Oh, how nice, how nice, well is
Uh uh. Uh uh.
also eh because honestly music makes the heart happy.
yes, that's true. I like romantic music better but I'm not so much of a radio person, more the computer.
It takes us back. Uh uh.
I don't know if it's good or if it's bad but yes. I like to research a lot.
Okay.
Uh uh. Technology is not bad.
But, do you go into the chat rooms?
No, No, No, No, No.
No, eh? I don't waste my time with the chat also but the
No.
my husband does lose his worry a lot.
Once I went into one of those and I didn't like the experience because sometimes is just so they attack you
It's true, it's true or if not the people seem very
Mm.
I don't know I don't trust it.
Not all, not all the people are sociable. In one is just to offend you.
It's true there are very ignorant people that go there, yes.
Mm, yes. Uh uh
Okay
Then. I don't think that there's anything wrong, anything wrong, more than anything the computer because I use it mainly to mainly to get information.
Tell me, and the washing machine?
No, eh, yes to the laundromat, I go to the laundromat.  I don't have one here at home.
Yeah. You don't wash small things by hand?
yes?
In exchange?
Sometimes I prefer to use it, I to it by hand because sometimes the washing machines don't do it well.
No, they don't do it well.
Hmm.
But I think that for the washing machine to wash well, I've looked for the secret, it's to not fill it too much.
yes, right?
with clothes, yeah.
Uh-huh.
But washing by hand, I can do this with everything, while I think that yeah my liking for the television and the washing machine I think would win.
No, I do it by hand.  Eh, all the colored clothes I wash here at home.  I sometimes wash the white clothes here but
eh I give the rest to the laundromat.
But, but you have a big space because on the other hand no
For me to to be well.
A house has to be
Eh, you can say, every two is ah, duplex
oh so.  You have this, a bathroom that's big where there's a washing machine.  Where you wash clothes.
Don't think that, I wash here in the kitchen sink
Oh, look that, Well
I put it in water and i put it there to soft the soap
I see
And after, I cleaned myself in the same, no, it's big
I congratulate you, because I had to do that in Peru and, hell, I delayed it until I was with nothing left and my mom made me do the laundry
Oh
Here in Canada, the first things I sold when I arrived was the washer
The washer, no more soap in my hands
No more soap and cold, and besides I don't know
yes
when i tried to do the laudry manually, and I used, I used gloves
Oh
It's hard, because those detergents are really strong, right?
yes, that happens to me, and I have my hands also like that
No, you have to use gloves woman
Oh, well, I don't really get along with gloves
Because, if not, you are going to get arthritis, because those detergents are mean
Also, right?, yes, because you have the need of using the appliances
Didn't I told you that
electric.  It's true.
Yeah.  Yeah.
Hmm.  There really essential but sometimes you get addicted to the things, no?
They're very, yeah.  Imagine, sometimes I think, what would they have done a long time back?  We went with my son to visit a village that was called Pioneer Village.
Hmm.  Hmm.
From the Pioneers who came to Canada, right?
Hmm.
And they taught them how they didn't have electricity and had to do everything like they really lived.
Hmm.
I
Before they were sent around using things like that.
Yeah.
The televisions used a car battery.
Yeah.  Yeah.  Life was really hard before.
yes.
It was really hard, now the truth is that in homes
technology has really advanced.
they save time, yeah, and it saves time too.  It saves time.
yes.  Definitely.
Imagine how hard it was for our mothers who also had so many kids
Um, uh, yeah
Oh no, poor thing
Yes, they're essential, to me, i think that yeah, there are a lot of comfort here, well, that you can't have in your country, well, you never had
No, no, no
Right?, here you come to socialize a little bit more, to update yourself
Yeah, it's true
Um
But int our countries [...] is also being introduced
Yeah
the thing is that power is expensive
But, the one who has no money... uh huh
Power is too high
Yes
But sometimes here too, i don't know, it depends, it depends on the use you give to it, because if you abuse it, power costs too much, uh?
That one day rising too much
Yeah, although there are
The only consumption i have is the computer, yeah, my husband doesn't even use it. We supposedly bought it to learn both, right?
Uh huh
But now i know more because he's going to study computing at school and all, but he doesn't like to touch the computer at home
Yeah, that's it, yeah, it's just people now, uh, now we study or work in what we have, i mean, in what we need, but that's not what we like
Mm. Mm.
we only do it in order to survive, right?
yes.
But the people already don't follow their heart.
Mm.
It's what they like to day and it's already almost that they are very sad.
yes, it's a necessity.
Already. That's true.
yes. But, yes they're very important those electrical devices in truth because
It's here?
There are a lot of advantages.
yes, yes it's
But also sometimes it's wholly dependent on one thing
yes, because
Because when I don't use the computer for months but. On the weekends, now that I'm here, I don't get on the computer.
Oh.
Mm.
No, I'm not so dependent on the computer. Also I don't like very much either.
No. I like it.
No, computers bore me.
I like downloading music, I like it, from some countries. I like it, if something comes to my mind, I search for it. Well, that's a second brain, right?
I fins a waste of time the Internet
yes
Because sometimes when I look for something
MM
there is so much information that I don't know which to choose, and the one I choose
MM
is full of propaganda or the information is not that good, so I got tired of it
That, mm
I don't know, honestly, I don't really like it
yes, but I also say that there is a big addiction to television, right?
But it is necessary, already
Well, everybody has his hobbies, let's put it that way
His, yea, yes, right. Tell me, do you think the telephone is a need?
Oh yes
Of all, of all the devices we mentioned, which one is a basic need we can't do without?
The stove
Oh the
To me the stove, because I use it all the time. The telephone also, you see
The telephone
anything one to the phone an emergency or something, the telephone.
Yes, I honestly think I mean, basic, basic would be the phone
Mm.
The stove I don't know, you never cook on the kerosene ones? or gas?
Of gas, also, aha.
Okay. The stove could be replaced
yes. the phone, yes, is also one.
But the phone is essential. Is essential. I deem it more essential than
yes.
that the television and all the phone.
you are always connected if you have a phone handy.
really?
It's very necessary for even when one goes out an emergency or something. Mm.
yes, also for. Just to say if you have a meeting and something happened and they call you to tell you yes you know don't come Don't come anymore
you save time, right?
Mm Mm
I deem it so
Mm.
So essential that. And to find jobs. To call the hospi-
Everything, uh uh
what do I know already.
Ah yes Uh uh.
The telephone is so important.
It is.
Okay. And what else could be essential?
Mm. What is used the most is the radio, the television.
The television.
The computer which already became
yes, yes it's become here.
Uh uh. The microwave.
Like that everybody, right? Oh, the microwave. Do you use it much?
No I don't like it at all, to heat up things there, my husband does like it because he says it's faster but I like it better on the stove.
Okay
That's why, I've heard now many things about the microwave. The blender is also an essential part for me. Eh, my husband is Mexican and he likes a lot the
the chili sauces and all that. I use the blender a lot too.
Oh ah yes I on the other hand I'm lazy when it comes to the blender. I use it when
Oh.
I need it
The toaster all that.
Uh uh.
Mm
And what would you do in a city? town with no electricity?
Mm
It would be hard, right?
I don´t know, I come from a place where I grew up that had no electricity and
Uh uh
with firewood, with firewood
Really?
yes
Wow
Uh uh
But you have to go and get it, right?
sure, and yes, there´s a place where you have to buy it, and I spent all that
Oh
MM
and the firewood, the whole house or just the place where it´s lighted up? In the room where you set it on fire
Mm, yes, it reaches a lot
Oh, look, how nice, I had never
Mm. Mm. It´s essential during the, eh, like right now, yes, it´s raining a lot, we have to heat the house and all that, no?
Hello, yes, who is speaking?
Silvia, hello, how are you? Silvia
hello, this is Alavaro
pardon, what? Alvaro?
that's my surname
oh ,yes, yes, pleased to meet you
and where are you calling from?
I am calling from the state of Louisiana, but I live in Indiana
aha
and the artifacts, what kind were they?
what?
I didn't understand the lady on the phone, she said they were, electronic devices, is that right?
yes, electronic devices, and things like this
oh, electrical. mm
so you are from Indiana but, where were you born?
oh, I was born in, in Indiana also, but raised in Laredo, Texas, with my grandma, there is where I learned Spanish, we are actually Mexican, ah
OK
my grandparents are from there, my parents were born and raised in Texas and we hardly noticed about the many trips to Mexico, we don't have any relatives there
aha
but the electrical devices, I don't understand in what way..eh
but, look it doesn't matter, eh, you can talk about something else, of whatever you want, yes
oh, really?
yes, yes, yes, is not mandatory to talk about the topics that they put
ah, that's good, because that's what I didn't know, is my second time that I talk on the phone. Because the first time was a topic very
hard, for me anyhow it was the topic of religion, to see if organized religion affected positively or negatively
yes, eh, I think that I talked with someone regarding that also
aha, aha, and how many times do you call by phone?,
okay
do you talk on the phone several times a day?
eh, they call you only once a day
oh, really?
but, this, this call for me I think is the twenty fourth
yes, oh, that's very good
mm
I love it because yes, to talk with another person ah know where they come from, and where do you come from?
I'm from Uruguay
ah, how nice, and never, I never, ah I don't see the difference in your, you don't even have an accent nor anything for me the same, right? because, ah
we've known families from Uruguay and I don't know the accent seems the same, as the Mexican for me and how far are you from where? no ah, I'm not sure where Uruguay is
Uruguay is to the south of Brazil.
oh, really?
Yeah, well, just south of Brazil
Oh, wow, so it means that they do speak Spanish in Brasil?
No, they speak Portuguese in Brasil, and
oh, and
And Spanish in Latin America, but on the border
and, right
I'm sorry, on Uruguay's border they speak, uh, Spanish and Portuguese too
Oh, and its, oh, they speak Portuguese?
Yes, yes, yes
Woe, and
uh, i, can i speak Portuguese?, a little, just a little
Right, a little, yes, i can understand them a little bit, but it's hard for me because they do it very fast, yeah, and there were also others, right?
Uh, i'm sorry?
How many others, uh?, oh, it seems there is another call coming in, I'm going to ignore it, but let me see who it is, ok?
OK
oh, just the Dalva, no problem, it's just i bought a new phone and i can't understand it yet, i haven't studied it
Oh, it's a cellphone, I'm living in Austin, Texas now
and where do you live right now?, in Austin, Teas, well, you're not too far now, i have a sister that lives in Houston, Texas, and we haven't seen each other for seven years, i don't understand why she doesn't come to see us in
Oh, yes?
Indiana, I'm like half an hour away from Chigago
yes
and so we grow up in the cold and my work brings me to many states to, to explain to someone the benefits of their work
and for two or three weeks we go as a group, and face to face we explain all the benefits that they have, the health plan, the life insurance plan
the plan for, and, the ah
aha
well, everything the have, no?  ah, and right now we're in a casino and there are like five thousand employees and I've worked from five to
to six in the morning, no, here I start at ten now that they put me in
aha
from the, ah, nine at night to six in the morning
aha
and people are really really relaxed here, really nice, ah, it's what they call the by you
what's it called?
and the last names in the bayou from Louisiana
ah, I think that I know it, I've passed by there
oh yes, it's the place where they say Kinder, Louisiana and a lot of personnel, people here seem Mexican, but in reality they're Indian
aha
and they have their reservation and they give them, well, they govern their own nation, right?  So they can feel comfortable, so they can return their rights to them, ah, the earth
but really strange because for me, here everything is, a, French, the food, the last names,
eh,
they can be white, dark, or Indian, and they all have a French last name, it's so strange to me
uh, that had been a French colony, right?
What?
that there, there there they'd been a French colony
uh huh, that's what happened, and they got last names from them uh huh and here hurricane Rita hit them pretty hard here, the Wal Mart's store here still isn't, uh, completel- completely restored
ah, yes?
here you see, yea, the stores look all broken, some of them still are, uh the trees uh, you can still see them, well they're damaged a car that
got stuck under a, uh, a big tree, and they still haven't uh they still haven't gotten it out
ah I mean that
mm hmm
sh- it must be pretty moving, uh, all that yea
and uh huh, I've only, I've only been in the southern states and they give me choices to go to the north, I told them no, for that
you can stay at your home and work there, uh and we, we've had to stay in hotels, you never know co- what's going to happen to you here we've had good ti-
they always treat us well but the people, I just started this job, and the people who work with me are older they're like fifty up to sixty five years old
uh huh
I don't know why it's like that but yea, the people have already been doing this thirty years
right they're more experienced
mm, mm hmm, and what kind of work do you do?
look, right now, uh, what I'm doing lately is pizza delivery um, delivery in, Do- Dominos Pizza
mm
hello?
hello, my name is Leticia
ah, how are you?, my name is Mariano, here from Philadelphia
ah, I am also in Philadelphia
ah, that's good, how did you find out about this contest? about this contest, study
eh, in truth, eh, I think it was trhough Craig list it was, now I don't even remember
ah no, a- I, I found out through through, how do you call it? through a friend I have
ah, and, and where are you from?
what I am from Buenos Aires, from Argentina
ah, me too, yes
don't tell me that's good, and, what do you work, here in Philadelphia, too?
yes, in Penn
ah look at that, , me too, I'm here at the University of Pennsylvania,
really, in which floor, where are you from, in which building?
in the biomedical re- cla- eh this study is from Penn, that why it must be
ah
ah, and what do you do here?
I'm doing, ah, let's say that I'm working as a technician
aha, as a tec- as a technician aha, in which area?
mm in, in the part of lypids and and, and well, and cardiac illnesses and well, a bit of everything
a little of everything, there are many Argentinians, I, it hasn't been long that I studied here
yes
it's been like a year
ah, well me it's been six months
six months, but there are many Argentinians
yes, a bunch, and what, what do you think of the topic?
there's a bunch of, I didn't hear the instruction to well, is, is, is I think that is of living in the city or no, right?
yes, what do you prefer to live in the city or, live in, in the outskirts?
no, I would prefer in the outskirts I mean, in the like that kind of the country, a place like that with a lot of nature, a place where the women can't be tempted and spend too much money
but what, what are the advantages of living in the outskirts, for you?
you see that women are super spenders and, and for me to have peace, be able to dedicate myself to the more essential things in life, be able to dedicate myself to the family, be calm
I don't know, I think that the contact with nature is essential
and, and, and, why wouldn't you like to live in the city?
and because, I don't know, I don't know, I feel one gets into a rhythm in that we also come from Buenos Aires and Buenos Aires is much more, eh what do you call it?
terrible in that sense, but but, I prefer much more, a smaller city this is small city, in comparison to Buenos Aires, and the truth is I feel much better
so, despite being a bit far from the family, and sometimes one misses, I like, I like, I think that the size, in the city of Buenos Aires there's a madness of people
I was living in Palermo which was a nice neighborhood, no, is not that it was bad, but I felt like a pressure in my head that I didn't like, there's something that I don't like about that
and I don't know how to define it, but, but, I like it more to have a house, have my feet on the ground, be able to go out and step on the grass and
I don't know, simple things
and but, in this country you think that living in eh, ah, in the outskirts is compatible with a peaceful life, because I mean, you have to travel every day probably until
Until downtown to to, to work, if you work downtown or in Penn  in this case, or
yes, yes, and i think that yeah, because you can have a car or you can use the, public transportation, lets say, for the week, it's not bad
you can go in train or in subway, i don't think it's bad, i think that, it's a good option
but Philadelphia is also a very special city in that way because
and, that's true
they say, like not every, not every city in the United States have that public transportation availability
Yes, that's true, that's true, besides, Philadelphia is little, you can walk a lot
And how long do you plan to stay  here?
and, around two or three years, three years i think, i came to do a post-doc so, you see, you never know, uh, I'm with my wife so
sure, yesterday i spoke to a guy from, from New York that asked me if i knew a girl that worked in Penn
Oh yes?
That's argentinian, but i don't know who he was talking about, because, i, the guy is from Panama
Right, and what girl was that?
But he didn't know the name
Oh, it's just that there are a few argentinians, i don't know, i don't know if it's good or bad but there are a lot
And i know, he told me she worked in Penn and lived in Philadelphia but
Oh
He couldn't remember her name
Oh, yes, no, i don't know
And, uh, and well, i, I'm happy living in, living in downtown
yes, do you like it?
yes, it is not as aggressive city  as Buenos Aires
I feel very good over here the city is very nice.
where do you live?
I live near South Philly
oh Me, too
really? do you know Paula Stein?
Paula, yes, yes, yes
she lives near my house, not too far away.
yes, yes, yes, I know her.
Yes but I thought it was a comparison of another area.
of course.
because, there are things to do, you know, maybe during the night time would be safer.
yes
I feel comfortable here, if it wasn´t for the two little mice
It is full of mice in Philadelphia
It must be something of philadelphia, Because there are Many in Landlord too
of course
so for how long do you want to be here?
maybe three years.
something like this like, like three years.  Are you single, are you married?
I don't know, yes more I'm with my husband, that in reality we both came and, and well
aha
he came to work, but the truth is that he's not working a lot, like
ah, no?
yes the truth is well, in the end I'm working now
yes yeah, yeah and well, it's a big of justice, every time each
yes, and and well, everything was planned in a way and good, but he works, but the truth is that
but neither
I'm the one who
ah, yes?
earns more, and this, no?
how strange, in general it's always the men, no?  those who
yes but no
not in your case
no no but, we're happy all the same, we like the city
yes
yes the truth is well, we take advantage when there's a study so, so also
that you can study, now
that, that also lets us do something more this, this thing
that can, of course, participate, right? and I saw one of Viagra that was very funny because they gave you, mm, double the normal dose and you could, mm,
and they made you vision studies for, I don't know, for five months or so, it was good money, like the mexiacns say, it was about one thousand eight hundred dollars
figure
so
there are studies for anything you want, but I, I mean I wouldn't inject anything for instance
no?
these things, I don't like, medicating and so
but well, if something happens to you they give the money to your husband so, nothing it was just a joke, mm
eh, n-
no, no, right, injecting stuff, no
and, and
no, I'd rather not
did you make many calls with this one already?
I think about fifteen, more or less
oh
but now I am, I am calling from another phone because, I don't know if you received the email, but if you make five calls from different phones they give you, how you call it? they give you more money, they give you five more dollars
oh, yes, yes, yes
so now I am calling from the office
yes, they called me, they sent me an email with that
yes, yes, so, you can call from five different numbers and you get fifty dollars more
sure sure
so that, eh, yes good
good, good, that's good, that's good, everyone I know, who speaks Spanish, I'm telling them
ah, yes?  You know many Spanish speakers?
hmm yes, yes a lot
a lot?
yes, many are engaging in this
yes, yes, I don't know if they will continually do Fisher studies and
yes
that, like, because I saw that there are other languages too, I don't know if they will open another one for Spanish, but what I read in the mail, it's probable that yes, but, but I'm not sure
yes, I don't know, in truth I don't know, but it's interesting
it's yes, yes, a very interesting idea, true that
yes, the only thing that well, yeah two times the topic of the day repeated and well
well to me too but, but since you speak with different people in general
and at times yeah
it's good, because you exchange opinions and see
yes, yes
see how they think
yes, yes there are times when it's interesting to hear other opinions
a Venezuelan and this, it's nice, really nice
ah, yes, yes, the Venezuelans have an accent very
ah, from Los Angeles yes, I love, I love the Venezuelan girls
yes very, men like them a lot, especially, it seems to me that the Argentinians in particular
yes, ah no, but, yes, yes, women like that drive men crazy, you imagine that you are talking with Catalin Fulobo but, but my God what a beautiful accent they have
yes, yes, yes
there are other accents that I don't like too much, but that Venezuelan girl's, or the accent of the Venezuelan girls in general is very pretty, the Cuban one also
yes and the Panamanian is very similar to the Cuban I think
eh, you think?
yes, I find it very similar
I mix those up a lot, the Cuban
and but, Panamanian also a lot, and I didn't know how they talked, no?
I can more or less distinguish the Cuban and Venezuelan, and then the Mexican but the rest, no, no, no, no, I find it hard
sure, sure
honestly, do you have any plans for today?
and do some Christmas shopping eh, yes
ah, really?, my God
yes, yes, I feel like buying a few things, let's see
your poor husband, you go with your husband?
is like that, life's like that, one works to
that's true
to also pamper oneself, no?
totally, yes, no
I mean, I think that it's part of, of, of everything
exactly
and no, and well, for me the truth that I
Lurdes.
Iliana.
Hello Iliana. Good evening.
How is it going, Lurdes? How are you?
Ah, fine thank God. Well look I live in the city. Eh, and I love the city life. The happiest day of my life for me was when
I sold my car because I moved to the city and here the bus is very good I live in New York.
Ah, A, you live in New York?
yes, yes.
And where did you live before?
Before I lived in Connecticut. In Hartford. And well, in the outskirts in a little town called New Britain. And to get anywhere
I had to drive. I needed my car. Not to go to the supermarket. I could walk.
Oh.  Sure, I don't like those places for example.  Everyone told me that Los Angeles is like that. Whatever is the city you have
what do you call it, go in car everywhere.
Sure, sure, Where do you live? City in suburbs or what?
No I live in Boston.
Ah, okay
In reality I lived in the city before. I'm Argentinian and lived in Buenos Aires and
Ah how nice.
and I moved over here, yes let' say to this city and I'm not used to it, no?
Sure, sure.
Oh, friend, Boston seems quiet for me
Sure, compared with Buenos Aires
Sure, it's a quiet city, New York, not at all, is not a quiet city
Well, look, for me, the convenience of having all to my reach no, having the supermarket near, the work near
the care of kids near, the doctor near, all the mail, all is, I mean, I can walk, all it's near so
Oh, knowing that I can take the train or the bus and get to any other neighborhood, and i arrive to a totally different neighborhood
where I live there is a lot of variety of
yes
food, really ethnic variety, and well, a variety of services I really like
yes, that's it, I also like it, I live on the outsides of the Downtown
Mmm
And it keeps been the city, but I work Downtown, then I have everything there
Oh, that's nice
yes, it's really nice, luckly
And do you think this is the ideal place or you'll like to?
No
okay
Not at all, I Love everything, I love it because it's safe, I love the city because you can transport yourself without a car
Mmm
and let's say, that's all good, But I don't really like the weather
Aye, no, this is cold.
Sure, no, his favorite his whole life.  eh, something a more difficult city, let's say that but not, hot.  I need heat and the beach, I realize.
Sure.  Sure.  Sure.  I understand you perfectly.  There are times when these snows fall and I say, aye my God, each time in this country again.
Sure.  Besides you forget.  The summer comes and it's all so nice you can walk in the city.
Sure.
and you forget and after winter comes and look now
Yeah.
you remember that it was, you will suffer and
Sure.
and above all the winters are long.  Here it's until June.
Sure.
Cold.
Hey, And there in Boston it doesn't snow much, right?
yes.
Uh.
yes, a lot and after it freezes.  The floor and you slip and everything, it's all a mess.
Ah, yes.  And.
And you, where are you from?
And for.  I'm from Puerto Rico.
Where were you born?  Ah, less.
From Puerto Rico, here borrowed, but figure out, one of the questions was the ideal house of the ideal site to live, right?
Yes
And I think that I would like to live in one of the both extremes, I mean, have a house in the old San Juan
That even if it's not the great thing, like New York, but it's  comfortable because it's all together
To have all in hand
Exactly, or live in the country, with a farm, and have a coffee plantations or some cattle, and live in country, but
everything that stays in the suburbs, the developments of, well, all those of cars, none of them I like
yes, sure
So, It would have to be one of those extremes, Totally urban or totally country like, right?
Sure, yes, for me, instead of the country, a day in a beach cabin
Oh, really?
Yes, I love it, so, I would be able to have a house in the beach and nothing else, only the sea, or a city, a big city sure
Where you have everything, walking and done
Look that
Everything else
the idea of the beach didn't come to my mind, but does no sound bad
No, with a house and a little bar for tourist, cocktails in the night, like being able to live and done
Sure, and it's done, hey look, now that you told me that in Puerto Rico
yes
The snake, oh,there are many people that comes visiting and they found out that, well, that there is almost none touristic development
so what he developed is really local and finished doing what you just described.  They buy a
Sure.
they have a guest house, they have a little bar for the people who are visiting there and live the rest of their lives there in this dream that you just described.
Sure, and well they are happy, I'm sure that they're really happy.
yes.  yes, yes, yes, yes.
But for example, look, I have experience.  I was in Costa Rica.  And there was an Argentinian family with three little kids who did this.  And this is paradise.
but look at what happened.  They were, the woman had a nail from the table in the eye.
Aye, no no no no no.  Don't tell me.
yes, and well, after they had to sell everything in Los Angeles, to operate on the woman and this and the other so
and everything to have a hospital well
Aye, yes.  No, because I imagine that there they didn't have anything, no
Sure, they didn't have anything.  They had to go to
the center
The United States for the emergency that was all
Ah,
terrible.  In the end it was a disgrace because I only knew them as happy and after I met someone who knew this happy family and they told me this tragedy, the truth that
Aye.
I don't know, whether to because
It's not the rise of the fall.
Sure.  No.
Ah, what a shame.
yes, but well, everything everything is suspect. They know it all, you lose and you win a little.
Sure. Sure. It's not definitely, because here for example well I like it a lot but the pollution is one thing that well that I think my son, my poor son
will grow up with asthma just thinking about it because since there's so much pollution, right?
Sure.
since this is a city.
yes, yes,
But well yes, like you say, everything has its pro and its con.
Sure. yes or the stress you have in a city.
That too.
That makes you age faster and let's say everything, well.
Sure, the cost of living is much more expensive.
They are all a bunch of Sure.
eh. You are making for example you make good money but everything goes in rent, the food is much more expensive.
Sure, as is.
Not always do you find everything fresh.
And what do you do there in New York?
Well here I work in that public school Columbia.
Ah
teaching.
what do you do?
giving classes to Masters students.  And making investigations.
ah, wow.  And what topic do you teach?
well I work with prevention among youth.  I also work with urbanization.  That so, I study how the city helps and promotes the health and
the way they contribute to our neighborhoods and all these things, and how they influence the health of other people.
Sure, ah, how nice.
So.  So here is the ideal place because I have a huge laboratory here in New York, no?
yes, no, sure.  I'm here in
And where are you?  In in
doing a post-doctorate in genetics at Tufts University
Aye how nice, how nice.
yes.
Are you doing a lot of work in the laboratory?
yes.  Sure, exactly.
Ah, okay okay
What happens is that a half hour is all automatized, I do, yes, it's not not so terrible, let's say.  Before it was worse when it was bad, but now.
it's more automatizes so it's easier.
Aye how nice.  How nice.  I remember when I was working on my Bachelors at the University of Puerto Rico where I worked, I was doing
yes.
eh, working in the laboratory of molecular genetics and my lab partner and I were the only ones who could insert piece of, ene, ah, in a
that we were manipulating
in a
I went, I jumping hopping because of the plate that we had prepared the things,
Sure yes yes yes.
all the people like kind of cream like that. Us with the blue plate and well the only good experience that I have with genetic. Besides I'm a disaster with that.
Sure, well no, but that is good, you remember and everything.
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
yes, no I more than anything I do like I amplify more, genes and ready. Is more automated.
And that is, is, eh, what type of investigation? What you are doing now
I'm like Pharmacogenetics. Is like a sort of molecular epidemiology. I get populations, cases.
Okay
And controls. I analyze genes and variations in the genes and try to associate the
Ah, how good, how interesting.
yes for example now, now what I do is a population that took a drug that decreases the cholesterol and some respond good and others no
To the drug. You see that one also takes a
Okay, Sure.
and then I try to find different variations in the genes that are
That can explain the
that are the Sure, in what are good or bad respondent of the drug.
Okay. Ah, how interesting. How interesting.
yes, the truth is that, luckily what I live has nothing to do with the beach and cocktails
Eh.  Yes well good.
I tell you that when the experiment doesn't work, this more emphasizes the idea of the beach and cocktails
Aye all the same but look.  What you have to do it, you have a little savings jar for vacations and every time an experiment goes well, you
every time that the experiment turns out bad you put two and this is like you're vacation fund and such.
Ah.
you see, so when your vacation time comes, above what you calculated it to be, when it's a really good snowfall
yes.
you go to the beach with the
With the Cocktails
with the cocktails yes above all.
Sure.  yes, yes, yes, luckily right now I'm going next week to Miami, my brothers live there.
Aye how nice.
Yes, it's a breath of fresh air.  yes.  Sure.

sure something like that
well, how good how good, how good, how good,and, I also do a little of everything now this is already, this is my first year here in Philadelphia and

ah, no yes right? because everything is outside, then it's too cold
too cold and too  many hours in construction no, no, no the last days I was already coming almost frozen
yes terrible although now well
so well mm
so luckily here the, the climate is, is better than over there in Philadelphia?
ah yes?
well yes I mean, because over there, here, even today it was hot, today it was like twenty, twenty five degrees, something like that
I can't believe you, I'm moving over there
yes, it was sunny and everything here
where did you tell me you were?, that I don't remem-
in Atlanta, Georgia
ah, in Atlanta, aha aha, ah, but is much better climate then than here, no here the climate is terrible
yes I can imagine, or
a terrible cold, and yes this week we are happy eh, because there are no temperatures below zero, because this week we have everything one degree, two degrees
ah, I think oh, my God
so this week it's supposed to be nice well, obviously the firefighters
listen and oh and it's going to get worse before becoming a problem
sure, eh for for January we have temperatures of ten degrees below zero, eight degrees below zero
wow, how awful, no I would die I would die I can't, I couldn't
you couldn't no?
and no, And are you from Buenos Aires originally?
there near Buenos Aires, Mar de Plata
Mar de Plata, ah how beautiful, also Uruguay
eh?
that's is on the way to Uruguay?
no, no, is not, if you go from Buenos Aires you would have to go to the south, to the side of Patagonia
ah, okay, okay, okay, okay
it's four hundred kilometers to the side of the Atlantic more or less yes is the Atlantic Coast
ah, okay I mean, not so close either but also
four or five hours from, from the capital of Buenos Aires
ah, okay, I already understood
aha
no, what I was saying and, how's the climate there? the same but I imagine is not as bad
no, no, no, no, there's no snow or anything, there are never any temperatures below zero
it could be the same as in Chile the only time that I had terrible weather was when when I was little we lived in Punta Arena
I don't know if you can place it but it's the city more to the south of Chile
oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
is
terrible, over there no
yes, there was snow and all the pipes froze and
ah
we had to go out, to look for snow to have water
ah, how hard
yes, no super terrible
aha, and how long have you been here in Atlanta?
I'm here since two thousand
aha, quite a bit yeah
yes
and, do you miss Chile or not?
yes, yes same as you, I go back every time I can, for example, I was in Chile for all of two thousand and three
ah, nice, the whole year?  how great
yes
aha, aha, aha, yes, yes, yes, there's a lot of, of Chilean people here in the United States
yes like, in any way, but only it's not so interesting because they don't get together as much as other groups, like, I don't know how the Argentinians are but
it's hard to have a Chilean party, for example, for the ten, for September eleventh there was a, a kind of patriotic party here in Atlanta but
there was, there's a population of five thousand Chileans in Atlanta and only two hundred went, so since
eh
yes eh, and in, look, and they told me how, for example the Brazilians, if they had a Brazilian event there would be ten thousand there
yes, yes, yes, yes
but the, Chileans are more modest, I don't know how, you know like it's the same, in South America we have this reputation, and in a certain way it's true
yes
aha, aha, so we don't get together much, everyone does his own thing and that's it
sure and I don't know how Argentinians are
no, Argentinians, at least here in Philadelphia we get together a lot
yeah
yes, yes, yes, in fact all my friends here, well the people I know, they are all Argentinean and some Mexican also who like coming with us, Spanish too, we join with Spanish ad Chilean often
it is very dif- mmm
only one friend, I had a Chilean friend who was with us
mm
but
I see
well, I don't know how it will be between them, if they join often, honestly I don't know, so, anyway
sure, and it depends, I, in this system, I have talked to two persons from Spain who are there for the
yes aha
and then an awful lot of people from Philadelphia I have talked to, I guess it is because that's where the progarm is from, actually
that here is what?
this program, the one why we are talking is from the university of Philadelphia, so
mhm, sure, ah, people connected here and
sure, because I, I have already talked to about fifteen people from the city of Philadelphia
they connect you, aha, aha
yes
aha, yes, yes there are a lot, they gave me the mail too and I enrolled myself immediately, and yes there are many enrolled here in Philadelphia, talking about the program
and have you had many calls?
yes, many what?
many, have you been called many times?
yes, yes, is that I didn't hear, sorry, that if
yes, no problem
yes, yes they have what? you said
if they have, if they have called you many times to talk on this system
Oh, yes okay, I already have twenty two I think
ah very good, very good, no this is my second
ah, is like amusing I like it
talk, yes is very good yes, the truth is that I like it a lot
yes
the truth is that is very good, is very good to meet people and, and well, and make some money
yes sure and, I've always gotten to talk always with people from, to start with many Hispanics, I mean I've gotten to talk with Mexicans
with Spanish, with with eh with, of everything, and also with people of many ages, I mean, I've gotten to talk with young people and with old people I even got to talk with
with, like that, excuse me that I'm trying to give directions ah and what is it called? and today I talked to a mother and her daughter and they lived in
different states,
ah, yes? ah
but with, sure then I talked with with a lady Rocio let's say, no and, I spoke to the daughter first, that I got to talk with a lady named Rocio and then the lady asked her daughter if I had talked with a
Chilean from Atlanta that was named Alicia and then she said yes I talked with her
mm
two days ago something like that
ah, very good
yes
well, and what is the, step, staying there in Atlanta to live? or you don't know?
ah, no yes I'm already like set up here I think, for a while
you are staying there already, aha
yes
aha
in, in fact, eh
ah, we are seeing, we don't know what well, we've been here a very short time and well, we'll see what happens in the future now
sure
my husband is working and studying a little here in the university of Penn
scholarship
sure, yes, yes, he's working there and
alright
and well, depending how it goes
mm
in life, day to day we'll see if we decide for now everything is fine, for now everything is fine
sure and you, and how did you arrive to Pittsburgh, I mean Philadelphia, was it by chance, so to speak?
no, no, no, no, no, because my wife was looking to do the post-graduate somewhere, somewhere
ah sure, mm
of the United States and well, it presented here for the University of Penn and
and
we got in touch immediately and they sent him the okay
oh that's nice
so, we came here right away, yes
oh, that's good
yes, yes, yes, she came with a job and all settled
sure, do you miss Argentina?
and I don't but my wife does
no? oh yes, that's normal, oh, for example
yes, oh, is it? yes, yes, yes, yes
so, I came here with my family, mi mom and my brother, he's been fine and I'm the one that travels to Chile often
oh
to to visit, and I still have family over there, so
aha
really
you do miss it
so
sure, sure, oh, we just got here too, we were in Argentina about a month ago
mhm I see, a month ago, oh wow
and well, fine but maybe, she's, she'd like to go back
sure
miss a lot
yes yes is true, and also you can maybe return to visit
when are we going to return?
sure, maybe to, to,. you have family there? to go visit
all, all, all, I have my brother in law, all, all all the family is there
ah good
no here it's just as two alone
yes ah, wow
so, it gets complicated
no wonder she misses it
sure yes, yes, I miss it, I have my little nephews and and well, we miss them and well over there with the family is much easier, but we no
from my family absolutely nobody is going to come over here so, we will be alone, we will work and next year for the end of the year we'll see if we go or not
sure
as long as we can go even if it's once a year
what, sorry
I say as long as we can go once as year
yes that's why it's good, during the winter would be good like that you would be less cold because over there is summer now, so
sure, sure, yes, yes,yes, that's what we were thinking
that's that's the fun thing
eh, but we thought about doing it eh, in January of next year that we'll go there and catch a bit of heat on the beach and all this, and we're saving now
in the dead of winter here
sure, especially because here it's the worst
it's crushing, the winter here
yes
terrible, yes, yes, yes
and, and do you live in a city or more in the suburbs, lets say?
no, I prefer to live in the city, always, yes, yes, yes
yes, no me too
you, yes?  yes, yes I lived for a while in a place that was pretty far from the city and I didn't like it at all, it's for more solitary people
yes, right?  nothing more than it's very boring
I love living in cities, I don't like to go, yes, yes to the shops, the banks, the car,
sure
Hello.
Good afternoon. Oh, I'm Lorena.
Hello. My name is Juan.
Where are you calling from?
From San Antonio.
Oh. Well, we are quite close then, I'm calling from Spring Branch, it's about forty kilometers away from San Antonio.
Oh, hey we are quite close! I think we might be neighbors.
Oh really?
We might have came across each other in the street.
Mm.
Without realizing it.
How's your neighborhood?
Oh, my neighborhood, it's well, that, it's a city. It's a mid-size city, it's quiet if you compare it with other cities, that's the truth.
as always, it has some dangerous areas but the quiet ones and the areas where people live and for other, oh well, it's quite stratified.
Oh no, well look, in my opinion, oh, we decided to move to San Antonio which is the biggest urban center around here
around the center of Texas, we moved fifty kilometers or thirty five miles away to the North because we were looking for something more rural
less urbanized and well, that's what we like, exactly, yes. We like green areas, we like the natural protected areas around the lakes. Oh, that
And all those things we've found them here, we just moved here, it hasn't been that long. Since we moved here.
Hey, for what you are saying, it seems to me that you live in a recreational or holiday area, it seems to me that you can spend
a weekend there, or a full vacation.
Well yes. That's it precisely, but only for the people who like this kind of contact with the nature, right? Because you know there are a lot
Uh uh
who don't choose this kind of life because they like the big urban centres and it has nothing to do with the difficulties or not of natural lifestyle, right?
Exactly. It's not my case, I would love to have some place like the one you live in. But the ideal place woul also have a beach
if it had more
No, well yes, beaches are something wonderful, right?
Exactly
How would be your ideal home? Thath was the question, the subject for today
Well, I think I would rather have a couple of houses. One house would be in the beach, with a view of the sea
With a very nice design. Maybe with a swimming-pool, and so. But I would always like another house, that one would be for the vacations, to relax
But another house that would be closer to a some more movement. For instance in the city. In an interesting city, where I could, eh
combine both lifestyles, some things in one place and then the other for a change. One single house might not be the most suitable, not the best thing
There is some need of changes, like when you take your vacations, right?
Uh uh
you go there on vacations and you are so well there that you would like to live there. But from other's experienecs I know that
when you get to live in that place, after a month you are already fed up with it, and life becomes routine again, so changing from one
lifestyle and city to another would make it nice again. Only one kind.. well maybe would be better
having a couple of them
Well, but then you must agree that we are talking about idyllic situations, right?, because you would be moving
Of course
in the daily life, it is not the most desirable thing. I don´t know if you have a family but having a family with children that have relationships of
friendship and schoolmates
Ah yes. Ah yes.
and activities and moving well that results to be complicated, right? However, I tell you
Oh no, I say that in a case like summer vacations, right? Because they don´t have school, you are going to stay away for two months.
Or, suddenly well vacations here or there twelve days And suddenly well, I don´t know, you go and the kids are with their lives and when they grow up
I am no, well Is like looking for other opportunities maybe on business, you make some in one place, you make another one in other place
Right?
yes.
I don´t know. You can invent something there.
I think that it depends a lot of the location that you chose for living.
Exactly.
Eh. The job opportunities, life opportunities or how close can your life style be in relation with the place you have chosen to live, right?
Exactly. Maybe, I can tell you an example if you had both kinds of houses about thirty of fifty miles from distance
yes, no, no, no, no, no.
Maybe is not so different.
It would be fantastic. Now.
Uh uh.
Eh. The reality is that there are countries in which, you can find, for example. I am thinking in the beach, right? If you think in Mexico beaches maybe it is true that almost
like not urban places. There is a little town to join it with activities at the big city but I star to think in the beaches, like for example in the United States
Where i say, every port, or every little beach, i don't know, it's a reason for great development, and the, well, all the, uh, usual consumerism options are present in the shopping
all the movie theaters, uh, all those things, right?, even if they're
Yes, yes, indeed. That could be something... something... it's, uh, interesting to keep in mind, right?, and i imagine that these kind of situations, for example
It's not the same to think about San Francisco, that has a beach and it's a city, right?
Um
You can have both conveniences at all time, bu in the end i bet it's a city, San Francisco, than a beach, i
I'm thinking more of a place, i don't know, maybe like Puerto Vallarta, right?
Um
Well, you can be there for a while, there are peak seasons, there are low seasons. So you take advantage of the peak o low seasons, depending
on what you want to do and an X town. Since every time distances are getting smaller, for example, if you go from the United States to a
beach in Mexico, it's maybe three hours away by plane, you go and come back. Just in a day, easily. Or the same in Texas, if you're in San Antonio or
you have a business in Corpus, but you combine, like in the winter, the business in Corpus is not too strong, it can close down, what do i know, something like that, that's
Since they are idyllic situations, it's figuring out, right?, when the plan is well made. Right?, well
Yeah, well, uh
Yes
We, we take it, that's it. Yes, right now, uh, sorry, sorry, they're talking to me here
So, in that way, when you talk about idyllic situations, like you don't have to finish the project or have to be, it doesn't have to be a real project and
stable, just an ideal situation. Something like that, those would be the conditions, right?, well, for a man like that, right?, but yeah, the thing is that i would like to
have that kind of alternatives, combine something in which it's completely a holiday, on vacations, let's say, like a luxury, right?
Um
No, quiet it bears much spending and things This one, related to consume, don´t.
Hmm.
I di what I want, when I want in that place and that is all.
Hmm.
Is like in another place Well maybe is combined with the work. I say that because Well the same Sometimes to be doing only one activity well
for a time well it is a routine and it makes you tired and you must know what to do with You can or cannot have a work
Of course.
and in the ideal place Right? You can go on a vacation while in other side you are
something of work, or business.
Hmm.
Maybe in that sense for example, an ideal situation would be, not only a location, but for example to have something you could
routinely moves. For example as if you were a boat owner right?. To have the location and you go to that
to that and that is all. You know a region and you pass through it.
Well, yes. But it sounds to me a lot more like a
Right? I miss the holidays.
to have a retired one life, right?
yes. yes. Honestly yes. Well. It is a
Of course.
opportunity, right? Every time they are not talking about vacations but a location and I say The closest to that would be to have a
house in a beach location and to relax right?
Mm.
how about if you could have some business? In the beach of or no ah?
Ah sure, sure, sure, sure. That's always an option very
That you don't necessarily have to be there the whole time. Perhaps you could
very feasible.
for examples, thousands, right? And then it goes very well
Uh uh.
today you dedicate yourself to see if you sell something and see what you buy and And you are there these two, three months and
Look to talk about idyllic things if you allow me to interrupt you. Right now, I'm going outside my house
no?
to the back part of my backyard and now I'm going to give the deers some food. I'm seeing that here is full of deers and so I'm going to give them a little bit of
No way.
corn to the deers. That's the type of
is Rudolph there?
Pardon?
is Rudolph there too?
No.
Go Rudolph
But, but really this contact like this with nature and with
Oh.
Hello?
Hello, hi, how are you?
Fine, Marcela.  Who's speaking?
Ah, Vicente, from New York.
How are you?
We haven't talked before, no?
yes, yes. You live where I want to live.
Aha.
You live where I want to live.
Where, where do you live now?
I live in Fayetteville.
In Fayetteville, North Carolina
In North Carolina, yes.
Aha.
So no, it's a town, it's a big town but it's a town, it's not a city, you see?  it's not
A city, yes.
so I, eh, like, being born in Buenos Aires, I'm a city, a city rat
You from Buenos Aires?  It's Argentina, right?
yes, I'm Argentinian.
Aha.
Sure, I lice here since I was 9 years old, so I'm not longer Argentinean , well
Yes
But
Well, I have been in New York for several years, I'm originally from Panama
Mmm
and well, what can I say, Also, and all that from New York, but I like New York, the thing is that I'm not that used to New York
that sometimes, okay, we have to talk about, living in a city, living in the town, and yes
Mmm
yes, we want to move from we are now, right
yes
Okay, and well, I live in New York and in a city like Manhattan
yes
and when I go to New Jersey or Philadelphia
Mmm
And when I go upstate, right?
Yes
Eh, up the state from the city
yes
is like in that moment being in a foreign country
yes, yes, yes, yes
oh this is, look at that street, that street doesn't have
Mm.
it doesn't have a a name
Lo-
and and it's
yes, yes, yes.
which house? What's the house number? Street
You feel lost. Oh, it happened to us when we first moved from Los Angeles, we though everything was dark, the streets had no name, people knew the name of the street but
Oh, exactly, that's what I was trying to tell you, yes
but we, that didn't live here, we had just arrived here, didn't, I mean, we had no idea where we were
oh oh oh, you tell me that you come look for me, come visit and you can't find the, the street because it has no name and sometimes when you get home you know that
Mhm.
you get out of the car and you have to walk to that person's house because there are no numbers in the houses so there are things that, I don't know
Not only that, but
Oh?
it's like, in in Manhattan everything is in the side, you want something, you walk two blocks and there you have it.
yes yes, everything is close, exactly.
Everything is closed, easily reached.
And everything, exactly, if you need something you can go look for it and you find it.
yes.
there are specialties here to, there are so many people, you see
yes
There are specialties, you can go and buy thing, that, that, that you wouldn't even imagine there is a, a store, a
Hmm
there is a store for, for things you wouldn't
It's very, very concentrated, in Buenos Aires too. If you want a special button, you go to the House of Buttons
Yeah
Eh, it has 5 stories and they only make buttons
Yeah
and they have thousands of buttons, but if you see they don't have a button you like, you go and talk to the designer, and they will design the button you want
it's ridiculous
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
eh, but what happens is that Buenos Aires is such a huge city
A
it's like, like New York but it's huge, absolutely huge, sometimes you feel like you're traveling
Well the
constantly
New York is not so big because of people's concentration in New York because
And no, sure, eh, eh, eh, I mean
people from New York are going upwards, they're making, eh, one on top of the other.
Yes, really concentrated everything
all buildings, all it's really concentrates, exactly, for being the more populated, from some countries in America, is Mex, Mex, Mexico
Mmm
Mexico City
yes
which is also Mexico's capital
yes
Do you understand?, and the reason is because Mexico, Mexico city is, if you lived in Argentina, an Argentinian city
Mmm
There are not, many, many cities in Argentina, understand?
yes
But in Mexico there is a major city, Mexico City
and the rest are towns
yes, well, a country with only a city
Mmm
it has to be big
yes
because if you only have one
yes, no, that's true
because, in New York city, when you are in the Unites States there are many cities, cities and the
I like, I like being, I like going to the mountains here in North Carolina. I'd like to have a hut, a place where I can escape to form time to time
Oh, exactly, because I, I was also thinking of retiring, retiring already and I had this surprise, no, no, I know that, I had an Argentinean friend
Mhm
eh, that talked to me about, I am, we are accountants, ok?
Mhm
And when he told me that, that in Argentina some time ago, there was a profession where people watched the inflation, right?
Mhm
and go to the shops in Buenos Aires and change the prices, every two weeks
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
he says that if you don't buy now, and go back after three weeks, forget it!
No, no, that's true, that's true
yes, and he says that is a profession,m people who have specialized in that, and I said, What?
And also, there were people in the times when everything was so, when they gave such a big interest on money
yes, bu ,by, from
they called it doing the bicycle, you bought one hundred dollars when the dollar was low and trhen you sold them when it was high and put it in the bank to get the, the, the
tax
eh, the, the interest, and then you took it out and called it doing the bicycle because the guys went from bank to bank within the city area
Aha
and so they called it the bicycle. And what do you do? I do the bicycle
But, at least, the thing, see, I remember that in nicaragua I had the, the
Mm.
in the banks in Nicaragua we have sixty and, sixty five percent interest in the money
yes.
six five now, many businesses don't don't make sixty five percent earnings, understand
yes.
but the thing is that many people would hear it, hear that, and I would laugh with him, because many Latins would hear that and said that yes
you, you, you buy currency from Nicaragua they give you and you sell it in the bank, they give you sixty five percent. But, but the inflation, right the inflation
Sure.
is one hundred percent, so you lost
You lost, you always lose
yes, so you lose, right?
And you, and you are from there in Manhattan, where do you live, in an apartment?
yes, that I live in a house and but, eh, I, I thought sometimes of moving from New York to I don't know, because I have a little business that I'm doing here now, and perhaps the business will take off.
Mm.
Because the opportunity, the opportunity in New York is very big also, understand?
yes.
You can find a lot of things to make money, right
yes, yes.
Eh, and, if there's this or that and look, the people from New York ah, what can I tell you? I, I remember twenty five years or thirty years before, when it was only
Puerto Ricans and Dominicans.
Mhm
Now, you see, we call the people from Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, 'chorritos', 'chorritos', right?
yes, yes, from all these places
that are, that are of mixed blood, you see
Mhm
Oh, half-breeds here, eh, and 'chicanos' also, there used to be 'chicanos' in New York, they were from the West End
yes, yes, yes
eh, eh, eh, West, West, but now
yes, I think that when I arrived to the United States, and we lived in New York, there were not Mexicans, they were all Dominicans or Puerto Ricans
yes, 'chicanos', now there are more than Puerto Ricans, more than Puer-, than Puerto Ricans in New York. And now
they didn't tell you, but the blacks are not the, the, how you call it? eh, how you call it?, they are not the minority, ok?
yes
Hispanics are much more, there are much more Hispanics in, much more Hispanics than blacks in the Uninhibited States
yes, no, there are little, sometimes, there are less
they are ahead now, they are ahead
because the Hispanics are ahead now
yes, they are ahead, because in New York, you see, there are 'chicanos', there are Incas from Peru, oh, you see, the Incas from Peru play music in the street
Mm
eh, their music is a little
Oh, yes, the collars they sell-
with the, with the, with the
yes, flutes and things
with the flutes, yes but that music is how do you say? too melodic.
yes, yes, yes, yes.
Sometimes you got to put rhythm, cause now a day everything has rhythm and everything is you know, faster and all that
Mhh.
Cause now the rap, ah, is in the, the Latin songs you see
yes.
ah rap like the regueton, regueton.
Is in all of them now.
I was talking to a lady from Spain and she told me that all of the clubs and bars in Spain play the regueton.
Mhh. hmm
yes, how you know?
yes.
But peop- that, that is the one uh, it has the influence but,- here in New York, how can I put it, here in New York there is
everybody, and you can find people from everywhere, from Argentina, and Chile, there's one, no two people from Chile in my house, and chicanos, there's people from all over the world, from Spain and everywhere
yes
and so Latin people, well we are talking about borders, right the Mexican borders.
yes, yes,
there, like how the come, how they come over here and.
And more and more are coming
And what they have to do to come here, and sometimes they die, there's people that... because they have a desert, right?, a desert
Uh huh
They die, oh, what a terrible thing, but all, if all the Latinos could come to the United States, they should leave, not, not all of them, but most of them, come to the United States
Yes, yes, no, it's true, because we all have TV's and we all see the things that are here, on TV, and we all want to do that
And
and so, in order to have that, how will you buy that if you don't have any money?, you have to go to the country where you can work and make a lot of money. The thing is that people think
yes
uh, many times, the immigrants believe that they, they're going to come here to work and then they're going to come back
And they're
with all that money
No
But what they don't think about is that, uh, the culture swallows you, you start spending, you start having debts and you don't get out anymore
No, but the thing with the culture, no, you change, you change, uh
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
When i got here, you, you'll eat less, and use less, look, I'm here, there are some chicanos here that have sneak-, uh, how do you say it?
sneaker, right?, sneak-, what do you call them?, sneakers
Right
Those are, you know, the sneakers, the ones you use for sports
Uh, yes, yes, yes
The ones that cost one hundred dollars
yes.
You see a Mexican, that wears, has a eighty dollars blue jean
Hmm. yes.
For them, eh, in their country they can get dressed for a year with eighty dollars.
yes, that is true, that is true, look
But the thing is that people
we, my family, we knew
Ah?
we know only one case of an Argentinian family that came here, to Los Angeles and didn´t spent a cent, that people
they didn´t went out to dinner, they didn´t go to the movies, they did nothing
Ah, no well is eh
and they lived,they lived as they lived as, as poor people, lets say, they ate right and all that stuff, but they kept all the money, they kept all the money and
they came back to Argentina, exactly as they planned, after five years
Hello
hi, who's speaking?
yes, yes, hello, Manuel's speaking, I'm in Orlando, Florida, where are you?
hi Nicolas' speaking, I'm in the city of Philadelphia
ah, very good, Hi Nicolas, how are you?
what's going on Manuel, how are you, fine?
fine, fine
sorry, I didn't hear you too well, where, where are you calling from?
from Orlando in Florida
Orlando, very, the heat very pleasant now in December, right?
well not so much, but yes eh, I know that it's much more than there in the north
yes, I'm already freezing here
eh, yes, well, well look that, that well eh, like we heard the topic of the day precisely spoke of that
mm
so then I tell you well eh, allow me to start, if you don't mind
aha
eh, I lived in New York
aha
for, eh, seven or eight years
mm
and, I liked the city very much, the environment, the cultural life, is, eh, is wonderful but the weather factor doesn't help me
mm
then, there I identified a, a, a, eh, a determinant factor for the place where I should live which is mild weather, or hot
okay
then for me, eh, the climate matters a lot
aha
number one eh, the matter of the landscape two and of course also that that, it doesn't really have to do with, with the housing in itself
aha
but it's important the type of city where you can develop according to your profession, or or, whatever you are looking for, in fact well then here let's say that,
I am in that sense, well, a little better that, that in the north
mm
but without recognizing that there, eh, eh, in New York, specifically, there's a well, eh, eh, an incredible way of life, especially in the area
social and cultural
mm
tell me about yourself
well I, I'm originally from Mexico and I'm from Mexico City, and I've been living three, four months in Philadelphia, so then is not something that you say
yes
that I'm used to this type of climate, so then now I'm just recently, getting also a climate
ah, yes, very very little
yes, whereas in Mexico, well you'll never see snow during the year, nowhere in Mexico, except in the mountains, right?
oh, of, which city, which city, I'm sorry, do you live in?
in Mexico City, it's the capital
Oh, fine, yes
so, this to me, it was a huge change because of the cold, the cold, overnight, I mean, one day we woke up and we were below zero
I mean, it was a very drastic change and I'm still not used to
sure
the cold weather, it's been hard for me, I have a lot of work and since I like warm weather better than the cold, so, to me, weather is a very very very important
it took some time and I know that I will get used to it but right now I do miss the warm weather of Mexico.
sure
so, this, well yes, that could influence my decision regarding the place
oh, oh, yes
so, in Mexico I was used to living in the city, it's huge, right, no? Mexico is huge and you have so much things to do
yes
so, when I first arrived in Philadelphia, lots of people told me that Philadelphia was the fifth biggest city in the United States, but still, I do feel the change, right? the size of the city
yes
so, this
yes
since I live in big cities, well, no, no, I don't actually know a lot of small cities or anything, to me, small cities are fine, and we often visit New York, so there's a difference between Philadelphia and New York
but, I honestly think they are similar, I like them, I like the warm weather.
sure, both are
and, a big city for me is something, I don't know, indispensable
eh eh now, eh, also in the introduction it talked of the dichotomy, let's call it that, city-country, what do you think, city
aha, mm
or country, where would you live better?
between a city and what, pardon?
and the country?
ah, I think that in the city because in Mexico, my dad lives in a well is not, is not the city but a town a little bit far from the city, and he basically lives like that in the country
yes
and, I mean, is very pleasant and all, but sometimes, like that's limited a lot right? the activities, things to do unless you have a lot of ingenuity, right? and
and have a lot of creativity to manage, but, essentially for me, for example, it limits me a lot
yes, yes
the activities I can do in a, in the  country, in a in, in, in in the country, yes right in a, in town far from the city
but, also I don't go to the limit of , you know what, I will never live in the country, because I find it very nice, also living there, right? and it becomes something also indispensable
aha
and with the pollution of Mexico City, is so brutal, that is important getting out of the city every now and then
yes, yes, I suppose, yes
then, well, also the country for me is an option, but not like that to live, every day of the week, right?
well, eh, look that for me in this case I would try to combine both things as much as possible and that can be achieved
aha, aha
in the outskirts of the city there are many outskirt sectors in the big cities that combine in some way those two factors, they are very close to the city
but many of the country things can be enjoyed
sure, like living, like living outside, in the outskirts of the city
yes, yes, like living in the, in my country it is called, I am from Colombia, in my country its is called the 'leaks' of the city
OK
that is exactly the outskirts, the place where, the place the urban area ends up and somehow begins the rural area, but not being too far yet
yes, that is an option, you have the city on one side, with the urban lifestyle, you can live like in the city
it also happens often that you may have some emergency, and being far from the city is like a kick in the ass,
so, in the situation you are putting me now, you are close to the city but also, as I told you, you have the calm of not living inside the city
yes, I also think it's a good choice already
mhm right, and this makes possible, for instance, having more green areas
damn right
yes, even, according to your taste or interest, some kind of orchard or vegetable garden, because many people like to cultivate
mhm
or gardens, that's what obviously you can't have in an apartment
mhm
animals for instance, it's also much easier having animals, several, not just one
aha
so, that would be nice, in my case, I would pay for that, I wish some day I'll make it, but, however I am quite adaptable, whether it is the country or the city
whatever it is, I'll manage to enjoy it
mhm
yes, that's it, that's the good thing about it, if you have a problem there, a health problem, which is exactly what happened to me in New York, well, there are lots of
you are happy in that city
you have to run because that's what got me out of there, it wasn't because I didn't like the city, it was that I couldn't stand the cold and I was getting sick of it
oh, really
of the weather, yes, of course, of course
yes, I hope that this time that doesn't happen to me in about six months because I haven't been here during the winter, oh well, people say that winter months are January and February so
oh, yes
I don't want to think about how cold it'll be here in January and February
well, no, it might be,
I  might feel better, right?
you might, if it doesn't really hit you that hard, you get used to it, in fact, many people like the cold, they like the
oh, weather seasons
mhm
so, you know, every organism is different
mhm, that's true
so, about the housing itself, the one of your dreams that they said, how would you like it to be?
the one of
two stories? wooden floors, what do I know! crystal
oh, I mean, the construction?
yes
well, I don't know, to me that, I don't know, I find it surprising that most of the buildings here are so shoddy, I mean, it isn't even a wall, it is like a
like a drywall or something like this
ah, no, the inside, here the insides are kind of cardboard, I don't know
yes, I don't know what they are made of, but when the Tornado appear they take every single house, so
architecture here is very simple, these kind of things for instance, you w¡ill never see them in Mexico, even the, even the poorest house is solid, right?
I mean, made of cement not cardboard, but well, maybe cardboard but not this kind
yes
so
ye, it is a metal structure and then, eh, the outside is kind of, yes, I am not exaggerating, it is a fine cardboard
yes, I mean, but the house looks fine, I mean, you see the house from the outside and it looks fine but, a little push on the wall and you break it
yes
you break it, so this is, mm, I am not used to that nd I don't like it either
it's just a not too strong building, right? obviously it must have its
yes, but tell me, finally, since
like this one
I think it almost hung up, eh, did you choose living there? or is there a particular city that calls your attention?
mm, no, I came here because I am studying
yes
mm I came to study my degree,I studying the first semester, so this is not an option, I chose Philadelphia
but obviously I had a choice, right? and Philadelphia seemed very interesting, I had already came here before, but not to live in, not for a permanent residence
mm, but I liked the city very much, I liked it not being as big as New York, New York, because that was a
tremendous chaos, so I liked it not being too big or too small, right? so
yes
this city is fie to me, and actually, like you say, I don't live in Philadelphia, but in the University, so
in the campus, right? that is
oh, we-, very well
that is outside the city, so I find this very pleasant, right now I am very, very, very comfortable, the only problem is the weather, I mean, by now
but I hope I will get used soon
yes, you'll get used to it, and have a good coat ready, because the winter is about to come
yes, I haven't used a coat in my whole life, it will be my first time actually
a good coat, thick, good gloves, good, good, eh
earflaps and all the stuff, absolutely
earflaps, hat all that will be decisive when the time comes
yes, I will have to get used to it, the worse is yet to come, but, I'll make it, I'll amke it
oh, yes, sure, sure
no doubt about it
because, definitely, the most critic moment, eh, is after midnight, as usual, and by that time you should be home already, I guess
yes, but, for instance, here during the week, because I think it started snowing about three weeks ago, but it snowed already so the temperature is already under zero
I mean, the snow has frozen already, and it is permanent already, I mean whenever you open the door there is snow
oh, that's right, yes, it's inconvenient  to move around, because when it's frozen you keep slipping all the time
there is ice, so it is quite unpleasant, right?
yes
but the best of, the good thing is that these last three days the temperature raised a little, so the snow melt
oh, good
so, that's good, right? obviously I think that the temperature will go down again soon, but I hope it is not too soon
sure, yes, yes, well, now, what was you name again?
I am Nicolas
Nicolas, so, then, eh
it was a pleasure talking with you
a pleasure having talked to you, have you done a lot of calls already?
mm, I don't know, I don't count them but I have done some

And
and, the topic like the quality to live that's the topic?
eh I think that yes in reality how one would like to live, eh I don't know I would like to live a little bit further from the city but,
aha
on the other hand, I'm from Buenos Aires which is a very big city and I'm used to, to living in a very big city.
oh yes, very interesting, And what's the population of Buenos Aires?
I think, the truth is I don't know, eh, exactly but I imagine that it's like ten million, something like that, eh ten, ten million, yes, I mean
two million, oh, ten million ah, is the biggest center of population in Argentina, right.
yes in Argentina, yes, but also, much less than what it can be in Mexico or in Sao Paulo which are cities that in, in Mexico I don't know how many are there but in Sao Paulo there were like eighteen million.
ah
so, but is, is the capital center so to speak and the, the surroundings that
yes
there are, there are many towns that are called, misery villas, I don't know if you've heard of it, like the favelas in Brazil.
aha, yes
They are the poor neighborhoods.
yes
and there, a lot of people gather that arrive for work from the interior of the country.
aha
here is not like that too much because no
yes, well here in Los Angeles, the population particularly from Los Angeles I think like ah
are
like ah four million
yes,
And but there are other areas, the county of Los Angeles, and it has I think that the total is like ten million
and do you do something related to Hollywood, with the movies.
ah, yes, sometimes I make commercials.

ah
being near the cows, horses

it is difficult to live here with this cold, but
maybe you would like Los Angeles, Half of the people from this place didn´t born here in Los Angeles County.
eh, of course
yes
but eh then I don´t know if we are going to stay here, eh, we are going to stay a long time here.

mhm
yes, I'd love to, when people have a dispute I try to oh, help them reach an agreement before they go to trial.

yes, mhm
and they need another job, and that's normal.
And what, do you have a manager?
I have a manager, for, for the movies, yes.

Hmm.
And so, I, what was I going to tell you?  I went with an old one, I have an old one that's a puppet
and I say that it's my husband.  And who feels and doesn't answer me.  And doesn't ask me what it's for.  I do it to everyone, people laugh, everyone thinks that I'm crazy.
Aye, how cool, so you're really
Yes.
you're really funny and smiley, ah, okay.
Yes.  I have a friend, she's a clown, but my friend doesn't dance with them, I like to dance and play, I do it really differently than her.
she's better, doing faces, painting faces, but I think I paint the face too, but, I like to do activities with the kids and
Well yes, because the kids are those who want to jump and
pe-Exactly.
paint and dance and that's how they're happy
Exa-Exactly.  But she does a li-ah, like now, the party that we went to I was jumping with them, and she told me that they had to stay quiet because if not
each time that I have a party they will expect the same
And, and
Aha yes, because I like to dance.
Aye, hey Gloria, and how did you get into this call?
I applied like one or two years ago on the internet through money and shopping
Oh.
one that I belong to and they sent me this then, I did it last year, eh, eh, last year it was dif-, very different I mean, this year is, eh, speaking in Spanish
And last year how was it?
it was, you had to call from different cells.
Ah, yeah, they did that one too?
Yes.
That, now, yeah, I don't know if you got the email in which you have to make five more calls
Aha.
from five different phones and
Ah.
they send you fifty dollars more.
Oh, yes.
Mhm.
Oh, I didn't see, I haven't seen my, my, my, my email no, no, no.
Yes, you have to, for example it can be your cell your husband's cell, the cell of a friend, five different ones.
Aha, aha, yes, I had
And then
I got like a hun-, three hundred dollars last time
Really, and how long did they take after you finished to send you the money?
Ah, like eight weeks.
Aye, my god, two months?  Well.
No, don't count on the money, if it comes, when it comes it's a gift
Well yeah, yeah it good that you tell me, because I was thinking that when it ends, in the end my check will come.
No, they take it very, and if you didn't send the, the the tax form
Hmm.
they won't send it to you.
Why not?
Because you have to send a form that they, they demand
Yes, I saw that, but well I ignored it, right now I'll print it and send it
and yes, yes you have to send it or they won't send you anything.
And.
And is this the first call you're doing or have you done a few?
No, I think that I've gotten about ten.
Ah.
Like ten calls, this, and so it's good, more or less the beginning, eh, the first time it took forever, but after I learned that we could talk about anything
Aha.
so it wasn't so difficult.
Oh, really?  We can talk about anything?
Yes.
Oh, I thought that when we had to talk about anything, but it had to be about the first topic, so, you know.
Ah, no, no, no, no, at most you can speak of, do you know my friend is the director
Yeah
of the program?
Oh, okay
Then she´s the one who talked to me and said hey, Liliana, because she just, she´s been here for a little while, and said, why don´t you sign up? It´s very easy, I don´t know, I don´t know how much
Yeah
and that´s why I signed up, then the first time
Yeah
ah, it felt like an eternity because we were talking about, about the United States, and the United States in the world and God knows what
Yeah, hmm
and I was talking to a very old gentleman, who was driving the conversation, and there I was, who didn´t know what to say
Ah
Then I talk to my friend, and I tell her, hey, those 12 minutes felt like an eternity, I didn´t know what to say to this man because he sounded very old and
well informed, and well, I´m very young and I don´t have so much information
Yeah
And she says no, she says don´t worry, you can talk about anything you want
Oh, okay
The only thing you have to do, you have to speak in spanish, but you can talk about anything you want, and I was, ah, OK
Ah, good, then it´s good, then
Well, yes, and then
Yes, one day I got a man and it was very hard, but he started talking and I didn't understand him
MHm
he spoke a horrible Spanish and I couldn't understand it, but I went along and I talked about other things, you know, about the subject I was supposed to talk about
because I don't know, now I woul speak about anything
So
er-, oh, horrible, it was horrible, those twelve minutes seemed like one hour
That's how I was the first time, yes
I thought, oh my God
I mean, I do know about what is going on and so, but I don't know it so in depth
Aha
like that man who didn't stop speaking, and, oh, I felt so stupid
Aha
and I told,  I told my friend 'I can't do this' and she told me, just talk about whatever you feel like, don't worry
So, your friend is the one who recorded the conversation. The one who did the commercial, your friend
No, there was one before, right?
Oh, because I talked to that girl, the one who did the, the introduction, because before there was a man, an American who, oh, you didn't understand a word
Yes. Yes, that's what she told me, she told me before there was a, a person who spoke English so bad that nobody could understand a word, and then she talked
to the directors or whatever, and told them to change him
Aha
they changed him immediately, but it was not her who talked
Oh, OK
But she speaks perfect Spanish
Oh, ok, ok, yeah
But yeah, she was the one who told me "you have to change this, it's horrible, you can't understand a thing"
And what kind of work do you do, are you a housewife?
Yes, i do nothing.
Oh, ok, OK
I have, well, i have my two and a half years old boy
Right
And, uh, and I'm at home with him, i take him to the library, i take him to
Oh, ok, right
to the museum, my husband works and two or three days a week i work at Gap
Right
On, on this Mall, like four hour, it's like ten hours a week
Oh, ok, OK
And that's it, but no, i don't do anything else
Oh, ok, OK
Until, until he's a little older
Right, yes
Good evening.
Good evening, yes, How are you? Whom am I speaking with?
Fine, How are you? I'm Marco.
With whom?
I, I, I, my name is Marco. And you?
Ah. Where are you calling from?
Eh, from Philadelphia.
Ah, How are you? You're speaking with George, from New York
Ah, George's speaking, How are you?
Fine, thanks. How are things with you?
Eh, I've been great, u, let's see, city, What part of New York are you in?
yes. I'm in Manhattan.
in Manhattan, yes.
In Harlem, mm
That, ah that coincidentally the, the question is about
yes.
the places where you live.
Uh, Mm.
Did you move to Manhattan from a place less, eh, less urban
No, urban just the same, from Bogota, Colombia.
Ah, we- well
Where are you from?
Eh, I, I, in truth, I grew up in, in Asuncion, in Paraguay.
Ah, yes? yes, B- Bogota is a very congested city, similar to New York.
Ah, yeah.
The only thing, it's that it doesn't have a train.
Ah, yeah. No, ah, in,
But, equally populated. Mm.
Asu- Asuncion is not, ah, Asuncion is a city, it's a small city. Eh, then, I, in truth, bei- being there, eh,
yes.
you know many more people from the countryside, let's say. Eh, I have family that has a,
yes. Mhm.
and uncle of mine is from, he owns a sugar cane plantation.
Oh, wait a second, it's that I can't her, a second.
yes, yes.
Hello. And what, and the city where you live now is it a small city?
yes, yes.
Ah, Philadelphia. No?
Co- eh, do- yes, I'm in Philadelphia now.
And that is very similar, right? to Asuncion, with respect to size.
No, no, Philad-, eh, Asuncion is very small
What?
Compare- eh, Asuncion is small in comparison
yes
Eh, Asuncion has
Pardon, pardon
I think, about three hundred thousand people, yes, yes
Hi, Hi, I hardly hear you. Can you speak louder?
Oh, sorry. How about now? Do you hear me better?
yes, yes, I thought it was the cell phone but no, again, I can't hear you. Well, now, yes. So, the city, which is bigger?
Ah, no, eh, Asuncion is very small, Asuncion is only three hundred thousand people, four hundred thousand
yes, yes
But, the so called Great Asuncion , is about one million people. But that basically means Asuncion plus five or six cities around it
yes, yes. mm. I see. Small towns annexed, mm, I see, And the plave you live in, are you satisfied with it? would you like to move?
I am, mm, I am alright, eh, downtown Philadelphia, in the
yes
it can't be more downtown than that, basically
Mm, I see
Eh , eh, it's like if I was in Manhattan, living, living in, in Battery Park. It would be something like that, eh
yes. Mm, I see. Is it very crowded? or noisy? how is it?
No, I don't, that's something I always liked of that city. Because I know, I know, for instance, Buenos Aires, eh, I know
yes
some big cities where it is, it is very noisy, there is a lot of noise, eh
yes
vandalism, mm, how you call it? I don't know the word, crime
oh
crime, and so on, that is something that
oh, yes, I see, the usual
it's something that here,
in big cities
right. Usual things of big cities, inc- including, unfortunately,
yes
Asuncion, although it's not a big city compared to
yes
eh, compared to, but talking about crime and things like this it qualifies, let's say,
And would you rather move to a rural area? or do you prefer big cities?
I am, I am, eh, I just, I just moved here about one and a half year ago, more or less, here downtown
yes
Before that I was, not in the suburbs, but in a district that, a much quieter district, much more, eh
yes, mm
Even more with the, eh, houses, that have courtyards, back courtyard and, and front courtyard, and grass, and
yes. Mm
with, of this style, which is something I have always found very nice
yes
Eh, but being here in the city, in the city downtown, I find it much better
Hmm
I can walk to school, walk to, walk to my workplace
yes
eh, my husband also, he also walks to his workplace
yes
I mean, the child goes to school, eh, that is right here, about four blocks away
Mhm
before he used to go to a daycare, eh, a daycare
yes
that is across the street, in front of our Hauser, and everything is so near. One think we have realized, the big difference between being in the city or being in the suburbs, where
is the va- my wife's family, for instance. People walk from the door of their houses
yes
to their car
Mm, yes
To the car. From the car they drive
yes.
ten miles, or five miles, or where the parking lot is, from there walk to the door.
yes.
After that walk from the door to the car, and from there all the life, is around the, the car.
Hmm, yeah.
Eh, while us, now, we are used to, walk. her family comes, for example, and they want to go somewhere, and yes, we go, and the car, or this, or a taxi, no, is near here.
yes.
Of course, for us, near here, around the corner, to me, it looks like if I were crossing the street, there are ten blocks.
yes.
yes, eh, ten blocks, ten blocks is a, very near here, it is  around the corner. Eh,
yes,
while a, a person from the, from the suburbs, comes walking three blocks, and, and, and almost has a stroke, it looks like.
It is very far, very far. Hmm, yeah.
yes, is is, is an issue of being used to it. We had a, we have a child, he is five right now,
yes.
and when a year ago he, year and a half, when he came to the city with us, eh, he was not, he, that thing to climb to the
the, the car and get sit in his, his seat inside the car.
yes.
Is that, now he walks a couple of blocks too,
Of course.
in the beginning, he asking please lift me, lift me, please, no he walks and gets used to it. And now, he walks the ten blocks. That's little for him,
So, conclusion, you are fixed, satisfied
I am very satisfied, eh, with myself, I grew up
The ideal place
I grew up, as she grew up, in a place with a large courtyard, I grew up with a German shepherd
yes
I don't like the idea of having a dog
yes
I don't like small dogs, and I don't like the idea of having a big dog at home, enclosed
yes, yes. That's not a good idea
No, to me, eh, although many people do. It is, apparently, here in the city, you see people walking
walking their dogs, their Great Dane
yes
They are, where are you keeping that Great Dane? I'd like to know. That is something that, it's like if there were courtyards around here, eh
In which conditions does the animal live?
yes, right. And that is something that, I would like to but, I guess that once we have, after the baby, and
yes
a couple babies more, I hope, eh, at least, eh, we may be able to retire somewhere with a larger courtyard, somewhere I can
Sure
play with an automobile, eh, playing mechanics with the automobile
yes.
Eh, we sold our car a year ago because, we didn´t like it anymore,even, the idea of having a car. Because,
yes.
it is so difficult, in a comparative way, as I say,in the city everything is so near.
yes.
that, so, that way at least you feel.
yes.
And, there where you are living,
No, where I live, is, eh, I work far away, I had to take two trains.
aha.
Then, eh, sometimes, well, I am a computer programmer. And, sometimes, I have to give maintenance very late at night, or something, and, and even when the train service is good, at night it is very,
very, it is not too good. right? Then,
Yeah.
well, I always, New York, you don´t need a car because the train transport service is very good, hmm.
Yeah, yeah.
But, where I am living now, and I came from, in my country, I was used to going  out on weekends to eat, to go around the city.
yes.
Then, I bought a car a year ago. Hmm. But I am tired of it, because the parking space is limited, I am always looking where to park, where, to fix schedules,
many tickets, but, at the end, it gives me freedom, anyway, of, of going out from one place to another. Right?
That is true.
yes, I´d like to go to a smaller, quieter city, hmm
Something that is getting very interesting, now, it´s something they´re, city carshare, that, the, uh, Philly Car Share, and things like that, you basically pay
a monthly amount, an amount around 100 dollars, I think, more or less
Hmm
and you pay, I think 15 cents per mile, or something like that, and basically, they lend you, let´s say, you´re renting
really, but they give you a car, all of them are hybrid cars
Hmm
hm, you , they have certain points in the city, and for example, here, we have like three points in a 3 or 4 blocks radius from our home
Really? No, I don´t, I don´t know about that here
and basically, you walk there
yes
and they give you, they give you an electronic key
Hm
and the computer in the car knows it´s your turn, let´s say, that you have, uh, the schedule
yes
names, schedules, you go to the car, you get in and use it
hmm
It, and, your time ends, where, you, you park it again where it should be
Hmm
and you leave it there
Ah, it doesn't
Each one, each person has an, an electronic key that, sure, only in your time is when the car opens,
yes, Ah, really?
and, eh, it comes, comes with a card inside the car, so that you can, eh, fill it up with gas when you need to,
Mm. Interesting yes
Already, already everything included, and, I find that interesting. Because, the idea is to assign a car
Mm.
when people come to, to, to visit, for example, they ask us,
yes, yes
they ask us, Where is there a place to park? Ah, no, this is Philadelphia, there's no place to park
yes, is hard in the big cities.
if you want, if you want, if you want to find parking, stay out of the city, In the suburbs there's places to park. There's none here, there's none here.
I remember,
Hello, my name is Wendy.
Hello, good morning. My name is Carolina.
And, ah, well the topic is, ah, That that, oh where do you prefer to live? In a city or outside of a city?
Aha.
Is that right? So, ah, where do you live?
I live in New York. And you?
Ah, really? Okay, yes, I live in ah, Arizona, but I visited New York, yes. And I have friends in New York.
Oh, really? Ah, how nice.
yes, I like New York but for me no, I can't ah, live in New York because there are so many people
Mm.
an, ah, I like to have a car and is very hard to have a car in New York, too much traffic.
Mm.
Here in Phoenix is the city is really big, but there aren't that many people that it's impossible to drive and here there's no subway system like in New York
so, the people here have to drive to work and
Mm.
other places
Okay.
What do you think, what do you prefer? To live in the city or outside of a city or
Well, for example, I that live in New York, I already have more than three years living here
yes.
so then what happens, see that I got a job in Midtown, Manhattan in the mere center of New York But I in the suburbs
am working and I like it a lot I prefer it having to take the public transportation
yes.
to go to my job
yes, when I was there I also used the subway
then Mm, okay.
It was very easy going to the places
Yes, sure.
on the subway yes But in many cities, they don't have a good subway system
Sure.
that's why people have to drive eh, that's why in Los Angeles the traffic is horrible, because everybody has to drive and
and there's no subway system
Mm.
of bus yes, but
Yes. Well.
is more, ah
Here with
How do you say it?
like here then the transportation is very I mean, one gets to places better on the subway than the private car
Mm yes.
so, the truth that, eh, to me the city is good to work in, no?  like, during the day, the working hours, and there are many
shops, there are many things, and you can rest because you have the weekends, the suburbs, no?
yes, exactly.
Excellent.  I really like what they say, what would be the city or the place of your dreams, eh, the house of your dreams
really, since I have my house, it's really comfortable, big, eh, I feel really good here on the weekends, because everything, during the week, what could be done?  Nothing.
You get back from work, you're tired, if you have some activity
Hm.
you come ho- and, ah-
So-
hmm, what can you do, no?  In the summer I use it a bit more because the day is a bit longer, so there are many more things to do
so yes
yes.
a city, well would have places to go but if not, I come to my house, I have things to do, tend the garden, fix the house, no?  like things
that really, like, for me, I find working in the city from Monday to Friday and the weekend to spend it in the ci-
it's much more comfortable, no?
Yeah, yes.  In what part of New York do you live?
In Queens.
Ah, yes, that's where my friend lives too
Hmm.
yes, yes, I visited Queens yes.
Aha
Like me, I live outside the city of Phoenix, in a suburb, it's called Tempi, that's where the University is
Oh
from Arizona, yes. And I rather live not inside the city, but outside, right? See, my job is about ten minutes from home
so I don't have to go to Phoenix where the traffic is so heavy
Mm
so usually, I usually don't have traffic problems, because my working hours are usually from seven in the evening to three in the morning
because I work in a bar
Mhm, oh
yes, So it's fine to me
Oh
I enjoy living in a big city, but not too big
MHm
but mmm but I also prefer living in the outskirts
MHm
because I know I won't have the problems of the big cities, that have too many population, right?
I see, overcrowded cities, right?
yes. And Phoenix is
Study
a big city but not as big as New York or Los Angeles
Mm hmm.
Atlanta
Yea.
but yea, there's more people here who are uh, arriving here, well, yea, it's also got a future
Oh, yea?
there's still not really a big city like Atlanta or like that that city, but now there's so many people that it's really hard to drive to places
Mm hmm.
to do things you want to do
Yea. Mm hmm.
Oh. Yea, yes, when I was in New York I took the subway everywhere and it was really easy to use the subway
Right.
I didn't want to, I didn't want to have a car there to live if I live in New York
yea.
because people drive, or I think the people drive uh uh crazy there. It's dangerous to have a car in New York.
Ah, because I have, I'll tell you I've felt I feel really comfortable, my house, to go out on the weekends
Ah, yea?
yes, no. No, I've never had any problems, I hope I don't have any God willing, right?
Yea, it's because I think you're used to driving in New York because in my experience
Yea
to say the, the people stop in the street and yea, for me it's strange, people here don't do that, they can't
you can't, here, oh, stop in
Mhm.
the middle of the street to let someone out of the car but in New York, it's pretty common, yes, people are used to it
oh, to some things but to me, it's not
Sure, aha.
yes.
Well, not only that, I also believe that, for example, in the suburbs, the value of the homes is cheaper than in the city, isn't it?
I see.
Are the prices high over there, for houses, too?
Mhm. Oh, well,
How is it? What's the value of homes over there, for example, in Fenix?
Oh, well, it depends on which part of town you want to live in, oh, you can get a nice house for oh, oh, mm, around fifty thousand
Mm.
yes, that's not, prices there are kind of, oh, it depends, if you want to live far away from the city
Oh.
you can, you can buy a really big house for little money, yes.
Mm.
But, if you want to live close to the city you have to pay more, but all things are big around here, they are not
small like in New York or Chicago, most of the people here live in houses and not in apartments
I see, aha.
Yes, How, how are you in New York? Do you like living there a lot?
Oh, yes?
yes. I like it a lot to visit
Oh, okay.
I have a lot of fun there and I like the food a lot
Mm.
especially yes in. Queens my friends take me to Colombian restaurants, Ecuadorians of those, right? yes.
Mm Mm where are you from?
I'm in Phoenix Arizona
No, but where are you from?
Oh, Oh, I've spent most of my life in Texas, El Paso, Texas.
Ah.
and but I'm from the United States, yes.
Mm, Okay, aha.
Ah, have you spent all your life in um New York?
Pardon? Pardon?
Oh, have you spent all your life in New York?
No, I'm from Peru.
Oh Really?
I'm from Peru.
My mom visited Peru. Oh, yes, my mom visited Peru
Oh. Oh. really?
like one two months ago
Mm. And did she like it?
I want to live, eh, I want to visit all the places in South America
Mm, okay.
yes, well, also Peru and yes, one day I want and
Mm.
Like backpacker. You understand?
Where?
The backpacking I want to go on a trip as a backpacker
Oh, okay.
do you understand or not?
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Aha.
backpacking yes.
Yes, yes, yes, mm
yes, to South America, yes.
Mm, okay, aha.
My fri-
Eh, good afternoon. From New York. I'm John.
Good afternoon. Is Lurdes.
How is it going Lurdes? How are you?
Hello, how are you?
Fine, thanks. Where are you from?
Eh, I'm from Puerto Rico.
Oh, yes. How nice? And where do you live?
yes. Here in New York.
Ah, also. Ah wow. We are neighbors then.
yes. yes.
Well, what do you think of today's topic?
Well is like that, I think that any type of assistance should be linked with the economic and educational development of the people that are receiving it.
Eh, the assistance.
Mm. Mm.
Because. Eh, assistance without help to get out of the situation, well no.
Mm.
To give what there is what it does is convert the assistance into a crutch, in a crutch that doesn't help the person grow.
Right yes.
right? And then. It seems to me that assistance with eh that's combined with assistance to for example study or to develop a career or for training
that is, significant for the person who's receiving the help well it could have eh, I think that it would make more sense.
yes.  yes.
And what do you think?
Well, I think that we should be more like the systems in Europe.
Hmm.
Or in Canada.  No?  Because I see that here
Hmm.
they pay very little and there are many people who are older who are, are having a lot of difficulties.
Sure.
And so
Sure.
it should be a little balanced, in a system where a person is spending good money, well, they should receive a bit less.
okay.
No?  And if you're earning more, you should receive a bit more, because.
Sure.  Sure.
It's really hard, it's really hard here.
No definitely.
In, in New York, the system is, eh.  You're really pressed.
Sure.
No?
To me, I think that it's, for example many times they penalize the people who are receiving economic assistance
Mm.
for things that the system itself put in its place, because, for example
Right.
for example, one of my coworkers has a friend that received help, her program was
in training, she had a job through a help program and when she finished her training, she got a
well, we can't help you anymore so you should look for a job elsewhere.
yes.
And this was after she had already developed a, I mean, she had developed, she had opened up a bank account, she has so happy and proud
of her work and all those things and then
yes.
oh, the same system that she was in, it, it
Mm.
placed her to work with an agency that she was working
Mm.
it didn't, I mean, it didn't help her to get a permanent job, right?
Right
So, they do give them help but only to a certain point but, if there's no way to help them develop the
the type of jobs that a person is training on, well then, it doesn't
yes.
it's doesn't really helps them.
Mm. Mm.
no?
yes. I have, I just returned from traveling from
I don't know it
and a friend whom I was talking to. The wife has had ten operations.
ah, good grief.
in the foot. Imagine that, if the companies only pay eighty percent normally,
Ah good grief.
he has had to pay twenty percent of ten operations.
Oh, my God.
And you can imagine that the poor man already doesn't know where to stand because
Sure, sure
he can't, then
And with the medicine being so expensive nowadays.
yes, exactly. Then.
The medical care.
The poor man doesn't even know what to do because is his wife and he has to do everything possible but also the money he already, already doesn't have any. He doesn't know what to do.
Sure, Sure.
So I think that he has to
And he doesn't qualify for any type of help?
What?
Doesn't qualify for any type of help?
No. That's also the problem. If one If one earns a little middle class right? and if you earn
yes.
decent money well then you never apply for anything.
True, true.
Sometimes is preferable to be that they push you to be poor
Exactly. True.
right? So
True eh.
And that's the problem that
True eh.
that like that and well. Eh. One, one likes to work and one wants to get ahead but sometimes the systems forces one but I stay, I stay where I am and like this I can keep on receiving
Public Assistance and a bunch of things that
Exactly.
it shouldn't be, we should do something so that people improve their situation.
Sure that it's an incentive instead of eh a right?
yes. exactly. Exactly. So. I don't know. To me it should really be how it is in Canada that everything, that everything is free and no matter what and
Mm. Well ah over there is I agree a lot with the health insurance universal system.
Mm.
Is something that makes a lot of sense in in Canada the
Mm.
the health is seen as a right.
Mm.
same as here the education is seen as a right, the public schools and etc.
Mm.
Over there the health is seen as a right, no?
Mm
and I think that the problem with this country is that the, I mean the history of the development of the medical profession
Mm.
was very eh linked with what was the development like they did it as if it was a business, right?
yes.
Then being seen more like a business than like a human right to receive access to the health, all the problems that area associated with
Mm.
that if, the costs are very very high that if the eh eh the treatment um. When when they seem instead of improving. Eh, um instead of reducing the cost of
of the services
Mm.
the fact that the education in medicine is so expensive has made it then
yes.
that the medical care is treated more like a business than like a right that all people have.
yes.
he received the, the medical insurance.
yes.  yes.  No, I definitely agree, wait a second.
yes, of course.
Hello?
yes, of course.
yes.  So, yes no, definitely, like this has become a store so they want to charge people every day the companies are offering
less and eh, they want to take more benefits from people.
Sure.
And they don't want, they don't want to give these same people from transit
Hmm.
They don't want them to retire until they're seventy two like how they could retire at fifty five.  This is quantity.
Aye.  yes.
That and I think that and good, they should come to a compromise, no?
Sure.  Sure.
But.  I think that it's been like this for many years well imagine if you get there and you retire and they say that you have to wait seven more years.
Aye, my God.
wow.  That's a lot.
I feel like crying just imagining it.
Hmm.  Hmm.  So we'll see if tomorrow we'll go to work or not.
Eh.
This is another thing.
Ah, true that they're
yes.  yes, it's night.
well yeah in Queens they started with the
yes, with the, with the adults yes.
with the strike, no?
yes, in Queens it already started.
well.  Tomorrow everyone who has it will be close to the house.  I don't have to walk a lot.  So at least I will get there.
how nice.  how nice.  I don't, I work from home.  so.  Tomorrow, so we'll see if we last.  It can't last either because imagine if we're in the middle of Christmas,
Sure.
we have everyone, visiting outside
Sure.
everyone has tourists, this will be a disaster.
I think that what's happening is like.  The really bad experience that happened last time with the negotiations
yes.
was that the people of MPA didn't have money
Uh-huh.
and after the book appeared
Uh-huh.
fixed
yes, right
Eh, anyone would be disapointed and of course you will be able to  ask for more
Yes, And also the people who, like us, are paying, and now they want to increase it, now in two thousand seven they want to increase it again.
again, they want to increase it? how much will they increase it now?
Because they want to do a new building, and new offices and everything. That's not right, behind us who are the workers
Right, right, right
So, let's wait and see. So, about medicine, eh, I have also noticed that they are offering
eh, packs, right? I've seen them announced on TV
Mm
they cover you for the thirty percent, the forty percent. You pay about twenty-nine dollars a month
Mm
and the cover you for the forty percent, that's nothing because if you ever end up in a hospital you won't pay less than fifty
if it is something serious it may be one hundred or two hundred thousand dollars
Sure
just figure, you're broke
Sure
with something like this. So, there should be a something, not to affect people this much, because otherwise people will
the will all go broke, or will be afraid of going to the hospital, because if they go and are found something serious, it will cost the wife
eh, yes, the man, the husband dies or something like this
Today yes.
while he was at the hospital, now he leaves his wife with a debt of fifty thousand or a hundred thousand dollars, forget it, you have to
Exactly. Exactly.
So we'll see what happens there.
I I think that there is that there when we have to think in in medicine as or the as a busincess
Mm.
like to think mor in those like hm eh a human right,
yes.
that everyone has the right to receive health care
yes.
so we'll have a universal system of of medical care, no?
Mm.
and when we have a universal system of medical care, prevention will be much more important and then we'll be able to
yes.
for example to avoid having to be in so many hospitals for example right now, many people wait, they avoid, having to go to the doctor when they have something that bothers them
Mm.
and when they finally go then they cannot hold it any longer and they go to the doctor, they end up needing much more care care more expensive than if they had gone in time
Exactly. I also agree with you on that that is also
right?
part of what they have to do and I for example, I take care of myself I go to the dentist constantly and I am happy because I go because I've gone and the dentist tells me, I am happy that you came to get this cleaning because
if not look the roots will get worse, that's the other thing.
Sure. Exactly. Exactly.
So you have to do, have to do the maintenance
Sure.
constantly because if not like like you say, if you go at the last minute, already when
Sure.
Betsey
good evening my name is Marcos and you?
eh my name is Betsey, fine thanks and you?
hello Betsey how are you? eh everything good, everything good ah eh happy holidays eh
how nice
let's see your opinion about social assistance,
ah
eh it said something in comparison to the European cities and the truth is I'm not too familiar with how the European cities have it done, from what I understand several of the countries
do use even socialist systems eh
mm, hello
like yes yes sorry I put the the headphone eh
oh
for example I know that England has a socialized social medicine system eh that system of medicine that that that is
the system they use is socialist
mm
eh have you ever been have used economic assistance of the American social system being the welfare that they have here
ah no well because I live in Canada but
ah okay
when I moved to Canada, I mean I'm originally from Salvador
from where
and in, I'm sorry?
where are you originally from?
I'm from El Salvador yes
Oh okay okay
so, in order for us to get some help, to get some help,  we had to apply for welfare.
oh I see
but I think it's different in Canada than in the United States, I wouldn't know.
oh, and that's another country that I'm not familiar with, I don't know its system, I know the system we have here, I was involved in a
car accident caused by another person who had been drinking
mhm
oh and I had a really bad accident, I was in coma for five days.
Oh
I was in intensive cares for a month
mhm
and I remember that I had a bit of brain damage but thank God, I'm fine now
what can you do
and I got well fine, oh, I used the healthcare system, welfare/foreign that they have here in the United States.
mhm
for a while, I used it for a while, for about four or five months.
mhm
what I did when I went to eh to apply to be able to have the assistance
mm
eh it was a, it wasn't a very nice experience so to speak, eh the groups of the people that were there I went and I worked, I started to work soon again because
I felt useless sitting at home not doing anything
I can imagine
eh that bothered me not doing anything
mm
then I started to work even before stopping the assistance which theoretically is illegal but I did it anyways eh like they say here under the table I was working
yes mm
when, then when I tried the first time eh to get out of the system of social assistance eh, the people in the office, the people in the
offices of social assistance of the state tried several times and tried a lot to convince me that I didn't have to leave the system of social assistance
mm
that I could stay receiving checks indefinitely
really?
and that what they were telling me I really found it disgusting
aha
I'm a person that always worked a lot eh too much even according to certain people
mm
but and I see that and I know my job when I pay my taxes, I don't complain about paying my taxes I really don't complain
mm
I grew up in Paraguay, South America
oh aha
and I know that here tax evasion always leave the state without the money to do the most basic things
mhm
and while here we have for instance beautiful roads, we have for instance the social security system which is basically paid on the taxes of the citizens
mhm
and I think it is something worthy, it is worth it but I keep seeing every day people who abuse on the system
sure, also here
yes, they abuse the system, but I think the system is worth it despite those who abuse
mhm, I see
it is worth maintaining it because I for instance went back to the working world bounded
mhm I see
but, eh, trying to go back, that kept me, that maintained me, I didn't loose my apartment thanks to that and of course the help from my mom, but I had enough to pay for the food
mhm
I had enough for the basic things, even the eh, even a medical insurance
mhm, sure
paid by the state which was wonderful for me at that moment, it came like fallen from heaven
mhm
really, and that's something that is worth maintaining despite all those who abuse the system, right despite them is the right word
sure, sure, right
correct and I believe that it is worth it and I know that in the, in other cities and in other countries they have different systems
oh, the American system has a lot of, lots of mistakes, lets say, but it works.
mhm
and as they say, even when talking about stuff like democracy, it's a good system in theory but oh, the American system is not the best one I mean
it's not a perfect system but so far, for what I can see, for what I know, it seems to me that it works or that
mhm
it's not the best one because it doesn't work all the time and it doesn't work as good as it should the whole time
mhm
oh but it seems to me that it's the one that works the best and yes
I see,
you are from El Salvador, I grew up in Paraguay in South America and I was there when the dictatorship ended in eighty nine
aha
the dictatorship had been there for thirty six years and the country was under the hands of this dictator, general Alfredo Strossner
bla bla bla, every day I'd listen to it, but, like I say, Paraguay's system also has, they have a system of of of
social security but it's a beautiful idea the way it works here, everyone has health insurance provided by the state, they all have health insurance given by the State, they all have
aha, is it that way in Paraguay?
that's in paper but
aha
that's the idea
oh I see
in reality it doesn't work so much like that basically the idea is that there is an
really?
issue there's a system that everybody automatically has eh medical insurance from the state for being a Paraguayan citizen
mm
and that's true, the problem for example is there is not eh there's not enough, enough money to pay half of the patients that go to the doctors
mm
and my parents both are doctors where I know that system well
oh how nice mm
eh but there inside but and that dad for example works in the hospital the public hospital, what was the hospital called eh clinic hospital that was from the city
aha
eh and he worked there without without charging eh he's a doctor and the doctor he has how do you say it ah
and the state pays him oh
the state would pay him what
mm
is the equivalent I still remember that they would pay him one hundred seven thousand Guarani per month was his monthly payment and one hundred twenty and seven thousand Guarani
aha
in that time with the change to the dollar
aha
I think it was a total of approximately seventeen dollars
seventeen? oh
monthly that was that was what they paid him dad driving in the, dad drove a
wow
mercedes
mm
that in which he basically eh would go to the clinic hospital
mm, aha
several times per week to help his neighbors and ah the state paid him as a doctor a little less than what his gas was
oh wow okay
that's to get there but eh but all always did and is like I tell you is a system that exists but doesn't work the system here in the United States
exists kind of works in several cases
mm
while at the same time in several cases it doesn't work but like I said I think that up to now is a system that works a lot I had heard a lot of complains regarding the
social medicine that the English use for example
mm
but I know that in the Nordic countries eh they have taxes much more higher than the taxes here in the United States and those taxes but the people don't complain about that because in reality
they have eh free medicines eh automatic health insurance from the state eh the eh the universities also are all, there are several at least from the state and
Silvia
Hello, How are you? Adrian's speaking from Toronto, Canada
Hello good, ah, from Canada you say.
yes from Toronto.
Oh from Toronto, I'm from Indiana, I was raised in Laredo, Texas And there is where I learned my Spanish. Ah, what country are you from?
eh, I was born in Argentina.
Oh, excellent. And I forgot what topic, that was that we were talking if they told you
it was the health system or whatever, no but I have a question, you were born in Texas and were raised in Texas
aha
But your native language is Spanish.
yes, no in, yes well we were raised with my grandmother who didn't let us speak a word in English. And, forcefully we learned Spanish.
Mexican right, my grandparents are, Mexicans, my parents were raised in Texas and, I was born in Indiana We are seven and, we all speak Spanish, second language but,
grandmother was who taught us.
But the, the school was in English, the school.
Okay Oh yes sure, aha
When you went to the school it wasn't in Spanish
It wasn't in Spanish, yes, uh But we all spoke Spanish, in Laredo it was, we didn't even realize that there were two languages. It was natural that everyone spoke both.
ah, it became difficult, because we arrived there, I was five years old. And I stayed til tenth grade. And it was when grandmother, well she helped us a lot but,
already the topic, aha.
And the, and because of him you learned, do you know how to read and write in Spanish also?
Oh, yes, that too, right, right, it's more
And how, how did you learn?
Basically because my granny, well, she was very strict, well, she didn't allow English neither at home or in religion, she had us write and speak everything in Spanish
And it was, out of necessity, not even asking for the bathroom
No, not the, the question that, uh, it's something very common, right?, not only in Spanish
right
At least all the people, uh, all the immigrants i know that live here in Toronto, whatever the background they have, Spanish or
or what ever, not English
right
The problem they always have with the children is that, they might speak their native language more or less well
uh huh
but they can never, uh, read or write in their native language
oh yes
in, that's why i asked you, because it's odd
Oh, yes, sure, because
I believe you're the first person i have listened that, uh, lets say, from a second generation, because
Oh, yes, that's true
Uh, did you go to, did you go to, technically, from what i can understand, uh, if the school you went to most of the time, uh, is what they consider your native language
Traditionally, if you went to school in the United States, they will consider
uh huh, yes
English is your native language is, no, never Spanish
ok, correct
uh, that's why i asked you, because i know it's very hard, i don't have children but
Right
the
Yeah, extremely hard because that's how my classmates at school and work were, that, they couldn't communicate either written or read it
And to us, a big task was the granny, she was a missioner, we would understand well, but in paper, let's say, she made us write letters, and since she was very religious
well, she had us read the bible every day
that's in Spanish
And, well, in Spanish
At least it wasn't in latin, but well, yeah
Right, yeah, yeah, and the bible, well, it was hard for us to be able to understand what it was saying, well, i interpreted them, she asked us questions
But yeah, it's been, it's, it's been a long time since my granny died, at ninety eight years old, but she was a strong lady
No, no, but i guess, the, the way she did it, she had to make you all take a seat
I thank her my
Yeah, dedicating two or three hours a day every day
Exactly, exactly, that was, that was, she was like, we called her Hitler
Like going to another school, you got out of school to go to another at home
Yeah, that's it, but like that, we appreciate it now, when it was happening to us, well, we didn't think so, we thought it was, well, a horrible task
Torture, yes
insurance torture. But now I can communicate, I need my job a lot, well they are always short, well I sell insurance of,
of health, of life, I'm an agent. And my company, are several, because I'm independent.
um
And I travel the whole United States with a group of people that, that show the benefits to the big employers right, a big company has,
a need to show all the benefits that they get and we seat with them a whole week, for example right now I'm in Louisiana.
In the Bayou which they call it. And here there's a casino that has three thousand employees. And we are here a week and a half. and well is like a vacation because there's,
well they give you massages there, I already won two hundred fifty dollars in the casino
ah well you are lucky, that's good.
yes yes, yes, they pay our flight and, already the hotel.
And you have to explain to the, you have to explain to the employees how the system works.
correct.
In other words that you get the Latins.
I get them a lot, they give me all the Latins, they get in line. And the only thing that makes me sad is that the person is very scared that,
because he doesn't have papers and think that by giving the bad social security, they will get in trouble, they prefer to reject all the benefits. And already after talking to me they realize that is,
the life insurance is free, they don't have to be present in the United states to be presented with it, and to obtain it.
Is anyway, a policy that they will pay in case the employee dies. and they already understanding, already want it.
No, I don't know how it works, here in Canada is totally different. But if you don't have a green card, Can you have private health insurance? That's what you are telling me.
oh oh, no those are benefits of, yes, with the green card here well, since they buy the bad social securities to stay here and so they don't bother them.
And since they think that the jobs, if they realize that social security is bad, well
ah,okay no I was talking, the way that you say is bad.
Yes, they are afraid of being deported. Yes
yes, is, is that it's illegal or is, yes okay. The, the
correct, yes
bad in Spanish is like a quite light euphenism the way that it uses
Yes Yes True. And um, they pay twenty five dollars an hour more, in that job if one speaks Spanish, then,
Ah that's good.
Yes it is, where the rest pay them
eh, that you do talking through this crap of the university of Pennsylvania and I don't know what.
yes yes yes yes And how do you like, Canada in contrast to the climate there in Argentina,
Ah, at this moment it must be minus ten degrees and it's windy, which must be some more, it must be almost twenty degrees of
wow
windchill.
uh uh, uh, uh
And I don't know the truth is it's a change.
mm, I can imagine, I escaped from, I'm from Chicago right, there there's thirteen inches of pure snow that has fallen, and here the people want to see the snow, I said puff.
Well I get tired of it
No, my wife hates the snow.
mm And here there's pure Indians right because they have reservations, it scared me because here they all look like me, or me like them, And well,
Indians, Indians, red skin Indians, not Hindus.
red skin. Yes and I'm kind of yellow okay
what you mean with yellow, are you Chinese?
The person, kind of yellowish I look like, yes, like they say, have olive skin, so, oh, they have their own language, the United States
gives them their own nation, their own territory, it treats them differently, they respect them and I heard an old man say yesterday, he was eighty three years old and he told me, look girl
In English, he told me, I was the boss around here, all the  Indians used to work for me when I was twenty years old but look at me now, I work in the casino, who do you think is giving me my paycheck?
it all comes from Indian money, he said, who would have thought!
he was, he was the Indian's boss.
He was the boss, yes, he would order them to work for, to pick the rice, there are lots of
Burnt food.
I see, Cajun, it's Cajun in Spanish.
oh, no Cajun.
Cajun, okay the translation is Cajon
No, my wife would say that the food got burnt
oh I see, well it's greasy it has, it weakens them physically, many of them have diabetes and it could be a real health issue because all their foods are greasy, fried.
lots of rice, lots of bread, I once went to the store to buy some vegetables and I had to leave them because they all want to go eat out every day, they love it.
the, how do the call it, the alligator in Spanish.
Oh, the alligator.
Aha, crocodile, isn't it?
oh, no, it's not the crocodile, no, it's the alligator, isn't it?
Alecaman.
Cayman, a
Oh.
Cyiman is the word cocodrille is crocodile alligator is cyiman
Aiman
Cayman -c a i m a n - cayman like
Oh cayman. oh
like Cayman Island something like that
Oh, well here there are a lot because in the bayou here, everyone. What did you say?  And they are 12 feet, they're babies, they're small and
They go out, I still have never seen one, pero they say that if the male gets angry with the female, um, they will never be able to
Uhm to prove that, it's true that it won't be possible, this one defend because, he put's her so that they eat her, those animals.
So that the caymans eat here, they throw her to the caymans
Hi,
Hi, who's speaking?
Leticia
Lety, this is Ines
it seemed to me that it was you Guacha
what do you think about today's topic?
I didn't want to say anything but
I didn't hear either and then I say mm
No, no I knew it was you this is a truchada,
Do you understand, I was all nervous, I with whom will I end up talking
Is your first call
oh yes, is the first time, Lety what will it be
oh, really good,
yes, I was that I was dying of shame, I mean, ah, who will I end up with! A person I know to break the ice
no, no, no, mortal, mortal
that's good, did they call you?
they called me yes, I was about to call, but I said well, they called me now and
Ah, sure because I Sure, I went to the gym, I came back and I said, ah, that's strange that they didn't call and I will call myself and
yes, no, And didn't they call Pablo?
No, but Pablo put down only weekends, because he now you see that he works in the afternoon
Ah, you're right
so he talks on the weekends
ah, ah, okay and Sure, because when he arrives it already ended
And able, In reality is until twelve, so I figure that he could
the schedule
I'll tell him later because today I was noticing, since today my activation arrived, I was looking at the details and all that, I figure that he'll be able
yes uh, how good, you know that Mariano tells me when
no, yes how good
Why don't you call Maria Ines and tell her for her to call now
Like that you can talk,
like we talk, I mean, but we'll get to by chance
Besides is more exciting by chance, understand
Sure, that's why, but also I don't know, I heard you and said, is Maria Ines, but I didn't bring myself to it
Only by hearing you I realized it, by the doubt, see when you say: who's speaking?
No, mortal, mortal
how good, and you are, have you talked with Mariano?
yes, I mean, no, no
ah how funny,
No, because I was calling, calling, calling and I mean nobody understood me they had me waiting a long time, because sometimes is a schedule kind of
that sometimes yes, yes, the other day Pablo was also a while to try to get
No, no yes, sometimes they take long, I said well, I mean you call, I tell him, to see if they pass
Sure
So
Sure and you guys have the cellular also
No, no yes, yes, precisely yesterday we went to the faculty and then, well I said I'll call from there to take advantage that I'm on another phone
Sure and there was no problem calling see that
Then that's why
To get out of the line, you have to press the nine, no, there's no history, you call and is normal
No, no, no, nothing happened nothing happened, I dialed the number from where I had called, see that they ask you for it
yes,
And well I dialed that number and everything fine
ah,
So no, but no
ah, really good
No, no, fatal, fatal and the other day I talked from the cellular but now I want to talk a eh, I don't know one day from, from my laboratory
You already have two outside calls, of what's its name
Sure, I also really need from the other cellular
ah, ah,
so
Sure you already have several. Well, but since it's a one eight hundred you can really ask anyone for their cellular
ah, you have, no because the minutes
count
They count I think that even if they are, yes, I think so
ah, No and we are killing ourselves, on top of it
But well
eh, we have one phone for both of us, you see that you can't make more than one call per day Then like, either I call, or he calls
No, no, no, it doesn't matter we both call with the same phone eh,
Ah, yes and there's no problem
is the same, no, there's no problem, no, no
ah, it must be by code then, by person
Is by code because you put the
Put your pin
Put your pin, yes
ah,
yes, yes, so there's no problem because of that No and also I said well, yes with the code, I mean our code has the same phone no,
yes, I was scared when I joined of not being able, since it was the same phone, but no
No me too but no, there was no problem, no because, I mean I suppose in reality I don't know, they are studying the language
The important thing is that they are two different people, to register how they talk
yes, the issue is talking, I figure I don't know
yes,
Well, they're recording me and they don't pay me afterwords but
No, i don't think so, because besides, they give you a subject but, no, i mean, you can talk about anything you want
yes
yes, yes
Right?, sometimes you talk about the subject but
but, uh, if you don't know you can start, well
Not necessarily, yeah, if you want to, yeah, i don't know, if you don't have a subject and well, you say the subject of the day, what's your opinion
Sure
But also. yeah, it depends on the person who you're with. The other day i spoke to a girl from Panama that wouldn't stop talking, she didn't let me talk
Right
I mean, i think she spoke the whole time
That's funny
yes, yes, yes, and then i talked to another that had already talked to the girl from Panama and he said "oh, that girl from Panama talks a lot", and yeah, i say, "yeah, i couldn't say a word when i spoke to her"
And i send, Pablo, i sent him, look, so the... can show up at any time
Oh yes
at any time, uh, i don't know if he's going to sign up, but we sent the mail
One, oh, very good, no, that's hilarious
Hilarious, well, we all know each other
yes, yes, besides, this is the time at which i call so
Sure, what time is it, eight, nine?
yes,, this is about the time in which we always speak, I don't know, in general
Sure oh,
Well, I was called today but if I hadn't I was going to call them in a short bit
Sure, yes, until twelve o'clock isn't it,
No, until ten o'clock
oh, until ten o'clock
No, yes, I think it's until ten o'clock
oh, so Pablo is not going to get here because he comes back around ten, ten thirty o'clock
No, he won't be here on time, no, you are right, no, so, not during the week because I think that during the week it's from five or six PM
mm mm
So, no,
Well, they can call him during the weekends, what can you do
Sure yes,
The last one, well he'll take whatever he can
yes,
yes, well, and some news
No, yes, you are thinking, what news
We recently saw each other right? Did Pablo leave today, did you see her?
yes, no, he left
He left, he, today the life, the last time, he leaves tomorrow
No, yes, no, I mean I didn't see her today, no, no, no
mm
No, the one I came across was Estuar and
mm
I told him well we can have lunch one of these days I don't know, I tell him
yes,
Because in reality, they still have my cake mold and they never gave it to me and I never also went by to get it
ah, and the, you want it
And, and, and, and, I also wanted to give them a card and I think that is easier to go to your house or you come to mine, we'll see each other in Penn I told him
but at the end nothing happened, I don't know, where he always has lunch, where, in the laboratory
No, he I don't know, before he had lunch, it seems he had lunch in the laboratory, he always ate in
Sure, but with Lucero
But then he said it was too expensive, and it's too much So, it wasn't very clear where he had lunch
ah, ah,
No, No, NO, I eat eat in the laboratory almost always or sometimes I come here to the house No, No, No,
Sure, but you always take food
No, No, what happens is that I sometimes buy it and take it up to the lab.
And where do you buy it? ah,
And I buy it there, in wawa or or if not also in the Chinese that's next to it there
ah,
But, but generally i take, i try not to take money to spend
yeah, right?, and besides, well, i don't know if it's right, but the Chinese guy is selling a tastier food, but we, i swear to you that were we eat
i get sick of the food
It isn't attractive at all
No, hey, it's good, do you know what's going to the wawa?, a
No, the wawa, i can fall asleep
it breaks you, the only thing i can buy in wawa are salads, that, well, they're not tasty, but they're salads
Yes
And then, yeah, soon, uh, they kill, those things are delicious but they'll kill you
Yes, you can't eat there everyday, it's obvious, right?
Right, so like, well, i prefer to get bored with the cheap and i take a sandwich
Sure
Well, yeah, a sandwich, an apple, and i go like that, and well, at night like very
And, right, yeah, obvious, right?, it's just, i don't know, I'm telling you, i go to the Abranson, i look at the stuff and it's not attractive to me
yes
The only thing that's attractive to me sometimes, that's true, are the salads or the soup, the soup does
Um
but the salads because, well, some of the, i don't know, they have rice or something; well, they're salads, they don't have much, much mystery, so no, it's mostly the money
Dude, i only went there once and i liked it, but of course i only went there once, when you go there more than once, you must get sick of it
Yeah, i never eat but, i mean, we try, we try to take too, but  i don't eat because it's not attractive, because, well, if i said "i'm suffering because i see so many good stuff
you buy it
maybe one day one meal may tempt me, I won't say never, but it is not only that it doesn't tempt you, but that you realize that they are
very caloric, and that they are not good to eat, I mean you can't eat that everyday because
yes, yes, you'll burst like a toad
yes, yes, so
The time I went there, there were many of such things, I ended up buying a salad and a soup because I thought everything was like too much, like if I go to work after eating that I'll fall asleep
yes, that's it, I can't, I can't eat that day after day, so for lunch
Sure, no, I can't, specially because it makes me sleep and besides I get fatter and fatter, but it makes me sleep
Huge food plate
yes
So I prefer to eat something more light
Right, obvious, right. But the he sent me a mail because on Thursdays we can all go together to have lunch somewhere
Go on
We coordinate and go to have lunch with Stuar
Great, yes, let's go with him, yes
I didn't see him. Wednesday I'll be quite messed up, but I think Thursday will be a quiet day, and there will be nobody
And they start to
They will all leave
yes
So, I think so
Yeah, i don't have history, i have a week very... like that, that cells are growing
No, we'll send each other mails and arrange
growing up and a plate, and see if they grow up, i don't have experiments like that, of being
you can take an hour like that to have lunch peacefully
Nothing, yeah, not tomorrow, but the rest of the week is going to be very quiet
Well
So i don't have history
And well, so I'll send you a mail later and we'll coordinate with, with Stuart, because neither Lucero or Paula are there, but
Sure, yeah, bit if we go with him
Well, if Rocio is there and wants to come, where does Rocio have lunch?, where does she have lunch?
Oh, we can tell Rocio, i don't know, she eats out, i think she always goes to the Chinese or something like that,
Oh, well
She will surely get excited, if we tell her
Well, so we'll include her too and then maybe she'll be excited
Yes, yes, yes
Maybe at one, it's an hour more or less... for everyone
Yes, i think it's fine, yes
Well
Yes, yes, so tomorrow i, it gets kinda complicated, but every other day it's all good
Yeah, yeah
Even more, Paulo can go too, if we tell him were, because he's not working
Oh, very good, obviously
Oh, yeah, that
Obviously, so let's go with him
We'll tell him

Oh, and the sandwiches are phenomenal, yeah, the truth is it's delicious, and coffee is tasty, oh yeah
So we can go to "Ya Pronto" then

yeah, i already downloaded them, no, because i couldn't, what's that?, WWW leticia dot pruscino
dot com dot "ar"
yes
No, sorry, without WWW
No, well
before it was
yeah, but, Leticia and Pruscino with the first letter in Caps?
Hello, good evening, how are you?
Fine, it's Marcela, with whom am I speaking?
Hello!  Ever, where are you talking from?
eh, I'm talking from North Carolina
ah, okay.  I'm in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
ah, with the cold,
yes, pretty much
Well, we have to talk about the topic of social assistence
yes, correct, well
The truth is I don't know.  To me, I know that there needs to be social assistance of course, but, I don't know, I think that it doesn't work very well
eh, in reality, eh, I also think that no, unfortunately, many older people, who depend a lot on this,
ah, don't have the necessary help when it comes to, an, the quantities that they receive after they retire and things like that
yes, yes
Too low, too low, so
hmm
a low level, eh, that they call, the level, of being poor, no,
yes, of poverty, yes
poverty, and, it's like they don't have any, care with them, because what happens is that they can't, subsist, they simply don't have more help to give them
yes, no, this is true, to me the other thing I also see now is, now, with the system that they have, people have to work and if not
they stop your assistance and you have to try to find, this work, or else they stop your assistance, the
yes, I know
And then, the problem with that is that the type of There's not enough emphasis on the education Then you have, the majority are women, with kids, young
eh, young women that because they have kids don't go to school
yes, correct
Oh, they don't go to school to high school, or maybe they don't go to the University, then depending on how old they are, but then they don't have any training to have
A good job and then with those jobs they have to pay someone to take care of the kids because almost always these are single women
And I think that is not enough, sure that there are people that say and if, you keep on giving money to these people, then all the single women will get
Pregnant and have kids to live free But the human being is not like that understand They are very few, I think
yes, definitely there will always be people that will benefit from that, but
mm
not necessarily will it change the idea of life of eighty percent of the population just because of that
yes,
And what's more, like that how things are, there are many people that benefit, that perhaps should not benefit and people that need a little more benefit that don't get it
yes, I sometimes think that what they should do because those, those systems cost a lot of money And there's never enough money Because is not enough, and you have all the bureaucracy that has to be kept, to maintain the system
Then I think that What I would do is put all the money on a system like the people of, health insurances
So that everyone can go to a doctor a dentist, understand, like there is in other countries That if you for being, I'm Argentina, right, and then
My parents if they want go to a private doctor But if they couldn't pay a private doctor then they go to the hospital that they are supposed to go to
And there they have doctors, doctors that work, that have Private practices but are in a rotation, see, Every certain eh, amount of time they have to put this
eh, serve in the hospital for free. And then like that everybody Can go take care of their health, then the elderly wouldn't have the problems that they have now
yes, I think that
You know what I mean? and afterwards, with all the amount of food that is wasted in this country, I think that instead of giving the people money
eh, I mean, they could be directly fed and given a paid housing, I don't know. Maybe this is even more complicated, but I think that these checks they give
most of the people can't administrate his money, I, I am in the list, you know what I mean? and no matter, the less money
you have, eh, the more suffer if you don't administer it properly, you know what I mean?
yes, yes
So, I don't know, I think that they are giving this checks to these people, and what they need is more education, and some training on how to administer their money
For it to reach, and I don't know, maybe something more practical. Instead, all the money goes to bureaucracy
And the check, which is not enough
yes, I think that maybe, eh, well, eh, as I see it, the worse thing I've seen is the medical care that is provided
to the elder, eh, specially now
mm
with the change to come to 'medicard'
yes
that actually means moving from a public service to forcing people to get their private insurance
yes, yes, yes, they are heading in that direction, sure
and, eh, it is very complicated because most of that people are people without education, who can't, eh, obtain the different
eh, procedures for the new medical insurances, and it is very complicated to them, and
and old people are afraid
so difficult
They don't understand a thing
no, no
do you understand, he doesn't have the capacity to understand, as he is afraid, they feel, they feel that we decide, they are abandoned, do you understand, the,
oh,
They have a thousand things to chose from and they don't know what's best for them and on top of that, they want to take more money because, did you see that every month they take a certain amount of money for medicard
And in reality, I don't see how it benefits society, to do something like that, oh, many
elderly people would want to change their doctors, doctors that they might have had for twenty years
mhm
because they are doing all these changes and and oh, the private companies will benefit from it but the reality is that people won't benefit at all
At all, nothing at all and in the end, yes, if the system is not helping the society, all of it, then, in the end, it won't even help the
private companies, I mean, it will in the beginning because in the beginning they will receive money but then, everything is going to be more expensive because if they are not
thinking about the future, then the society won't value the elderly people.
and you can see that here in the United States, unfortunately, oh, every every decade, oh, the system gets worse for the elderly people
There are many of them now, with that, they will be the biggest group in the society oh
Because the ones that were born in the
yes,
sixties, seventies, there were a lot of babies back then
yes, yes, that's true
oh, so now
The babies, they call them,
the babies, yes, so, oh,  it will be too expensive for the government, too expensive and difficult for the federal programs to
to be able to cover all the expenses, but but, they do have lots of millions to waste on Iraq, to focus on
That's what I've always wondered why are they fighting there and how much money are they spending to help
yes, yes
and if they are barely, they are wasting the money, it's like if they were throwing butter to the ceiling to Iraq, like, not tomorrow, it turns out that they are there
oh, we don't have enough money, we don't know what to do that's why I don't understand it. There are cities where the schools suck, in this country
In this country, where schools should be the best ones in the world but they are not, no, no, you could find better schools in a really poor Hispanic country.
Sure
And, that's a shame for this culture, it's a shame for this culture, that there's people in this country, which is so rich, and it has so many ignorant people.
yes, and it's a shame because at least if we go back to the elderly issues, all the money is wasted in helping other countries.
mhm
They can't assign certain money for medicard or for doctor's expenses for old people because there's no money, but they do it for other countries because people are dying there
Well elderly people are dying too, they don't have a good healthcare, oh, many old people die because they don't have the necessary medicines, I mean people
oh, that's right, it's not just, but now, maybe you are right, this is not going to change because young people, unfortunately, they are not inclined to vote
Well
and the old people that do, and then you have a large population that has a common interest
and that's a huge number of voters, so, it's possible that maybe, in the next decade, we can see that influence, right
But it seems to me that until there's no insurance or a national healthcare system like in Canada, Argentina, France and England
oh, oh, like in most of the other countries in the world, until we don't have something similar here, this is not going to improve because we have to destroy that and start over.
yes, I think that they are scared, of
Tamara.
Hello, my name is Miriam.
Hello. My name is Tamara.
Where are you from?
Where are they from?
I'm from, oh, I live in Toronto, Canada.
And where were you originally from?
From Peru. Lima, Peru.
Oh, well, I'm from Argentina. Argentina.
yes. I see, where do you live?
In Boston.
Oh. Well.
Have you been living here in the  United States or Canada for long?
How?
Have you been living in Canada for a long time?
yes, ten years.
Oh.
I see
And how is health insurance and loans?
Oh they are good, social services? It's good. It's not that bad, yes.
And you have like a social security number like here?
Social security number?
yes
yes, we have, we have. For work, yes.
And do you also have to pay a health insurance?
it depends on how much the people earn.
Mm.
if the people earn more, then they pay like more taxes
yes.
And but that's something new. Before they didn't have that everybody had access to the medicine but that I think a year ago it changed.
And that the people that earn more, pay more.
And are there a lot of health plans?
No, it's bad, you know. Because we have a card and we go to the doctor. When people feel bad.
yes. And do you have to pay every time you go to the doctor? Ah, Because here every time we go to the doctor we have to pay like a
like fifteen dollars for the service.
Oh, look see. No, I didn't know. Is that in all the United States or only in the provinces?
I believe that in the United States
Oh, look.
eh but we have to, first to pick you pick a social that one wants there's like different companies And one can pick one before or also
each one is more expensive
You know that, here like there is eh, there are conversations about wanting to privatize this because now government is the one with control. So then
Everyone, everyone here has the right to medicine. They can do an operation, everything with your, with your card that everyone of us has, right?
but at times it's that the waiting list is very long.
Ah. For operations?
Yes, for an operation.
But, but if you need an emergency, you can go directly to a hospital.
yes, yes. You can go and you don't pay anything. Of course, for medicine you have to pay for it.
yes
It depends. But the hospital, the Y, in the night I don't know if everything is covered.
And how are the doctors of medicine, good?
It's not that bad, you know. Yes, it's good. More or less. I wouldn't say that it's the best, but neither more or less because here there have been many things
like the hospitals haven't been kept very clean. And there have been infections and
yes
bacteria and it has killed people and all that
Wow
yes, yes
Wow
You didn't hear about SARS?
SARS from last year?
Yeah, yeah, it was about two years ago or something like that.
I found out but I didn't think that in Canada. Didn't it happen in China?
In China but in Canada too. In canada, nurses died.
Wow, Nurses?
yes. Nurses died.
Today, no.
yes, it was tough.
No, I had never heard of that.
yes. And afterwards it was scary. Not long ago they also discovered, like they did an audit to the hospitals hospitals and
yes.
and they discovered that many hospitals had, eh, they didn't have their equipment they didn't clean them well. And they gave them a fine to many.
Wow, And how are they preparing of this new epidemic of
Because no.
of eh of of flu?
they are preparing well I don't know, they would It hasn't happened. Sometimes you know that things happen and they don't tell
Sure.
Until someone dies, what do I know, and then they become known. The bomb goes off and it becomes known that or in truth it's not
yes.
it was, it's not like they paint it
Mm. yes.
yes many things get discovered.
And that in Toronto is it different than in Montreal? Because in one they speak English and in the other French? I sounds like the same because it's the same government
it was a bit different.
Mm.
A bit different yeah
And
but I never went to Montreal.
How is the economy between one place and the other?
It seems to me that Montreal is a very big city they have told me once I went to visit
And Toronto is no?
Toronto is big but Montreal has a system well for example of Subway that is bigger and more advanced
yes?
A lines, Toronto only has a few lines and it's not a big thing that you can say
And do you also speak French or not?
No, no. I only speak in English, no. That one has of
And there in Toronto, do you encounter many people that speak French?
Right away, only English.
Mm.
English and the languages of the countries that
So it means that a person from Montreal that goes to Toronto is like a tourist?
they have to learn English.
Wow yes.
They are bilingual, yes.
Ah because I
Sure that
I work in a hospital and yesterday a person from Montreal came and spoke French.
yes, is true. They speak French as first language but yes, they don't want to be left behind or yes
yes
without knowing how to do their documents and in a day now they come to Toronto or to another part the people need to speak
Uh uh.
you need in these countries two languages. In other words French or our language. You need two languages.
yes. And are there a lot of people there?
yes, yes there's a lot, a lot, a lot.
In other words that you it helps you a lot to be seen?
yes, Cool, yes because. There is. Even though you don't find work in Spanish.
No?
One has to speak English.
Mm.
Yes
And, and
No, you don't find work.
What do you work in?
I'm unemployed now, but i was working a while ago, i don't know if you
Um
It's a communications company, Rogers
No
Ok, it's a
What's it like, like cellular?
It's a company, yes, and it also controls the cable, it's a big monopoly, it's a company that
Um
before it was just the cable
yes
It had the TV cable, but now they bought, they bought Canada, it's a big monopoly
Um
So i was on contract with them, they renewed my contract again
Yes
But now the job is over, just now, a month ago i lost it
Oh, and is it hard there now?
What can i tell you, yes, there are people that... there's a lot of unemployment
Um
Yes, there's unemployment, oh yes, you know, there are lousy jobs that really aren't enough
Sure.
There are bad jobs that don't raise people from poverty.
Sure.
Because it's it's a, what do I know, they pay very little.
Sure.
So it doesn't make for
Wow.
Yeah. And tell me
And has it been a while since? What?
Go ahead. yes, tell me, tell me
And has it been a while since you've gone back to Peru?
I went back on two thousand and two
Mm.
and I have not gone back yet but my mom came twice to visit me.
yes.
It's that it takes a lot of money.
yes.
to go. One trip requires too much.
Wow
And you? How long have you been there in?
Eh I recently arrived, recently arrived. It's been nine months since I arrived.
You arrived nine months ago?
yes, to the United States.
Oh look, you are new. And you already work in a hospital?
yes, I'm a veterinarian.
Oh, look how nice.
yes, but I'm working, I have to validate my title. So I'm working as a nurse technician. yes, also I was two months looking for a job, right?
So you are
Because until I got the permit and all, I was two months.
Yes. Well, I'm glad because there are many people many professionals that don't find, eh. And they become taxi drivers or cleaners or whatever
yes, yes, that's true. I was very lucky in that sense. I would like to work as a veterinarian no but
Sure.
Suddenly the one to work
Sure, And then you already found out what you need to perhaps take some courses or yes?
yes, I took the English exams that I had to take
Uh uh
and now I need to take the validation exams. And then once one passes that one Eh, then you register in the other one
but it's expensive, like five thousand dollars. Eh, I don't know how it is that changed there.
And you can't ask for a loan? They don't give loans there?
Eh, I met for five thousand dollars for a North American, very little to ask for a loan. There, there are plans, Eh, of validation
for example that one can do a year in a  hospital and pay twenty six thousand dollars.
Oh.
And there they do give you a loan. But I don't want to do the twenty six thousand dollars one.
No, that after you are in debt.
Sure yes.
Because they charge a high interest.
yes, besides I don't want to spend a whole year I mean I was already in a. The last year of a faculty is very
is like a residency of a person of human medicine, right? and is very exhausting. So
Oh.
I stay without doing it but pass it nothing. Know the exam and ready.
Yes.
But the dogs also have medical insurance.
Yes, Look how nice.
And is more. I think is better for a dog than for a human.
But you have to. Yes, they also say that here. I mean the people are the one that comes and are surprised here, about how they treat the dogs, say.
yes.
When
yes yes is Here, they invest a lot of money a day of incarnation of a day could be one thousand dollars.
Wow
And the people pay it.
yes.
And I work in oncology and oncology can, oh, radiation can cost four thousand dollars and people pay it.
Wow, you see. Mm. But are those normal people, ordinary people with a normal wage or are they rich people?
I really don't understand if they are rich or not because sometimes they don't look like wealthy people, oh mm. But, however, these people
you can see by how they dress that they are not poor but they don't look like the Americans, no, they are not well dressed and however, they pay whatever it costs for the animal
so, I really don't know how it works, so, if they have health care, if they are paying for their health care and maybe, oh, I've heard that the homeless
Oh, the homeless they do have a dog and they pay, they pay more than social security.
Wow, that's good
yes, I, oh, I don't know if I saw this or not but that does happen in England for sure. So, you can see homeless people with their dogs
They don't have money to eat or anything else but they do have money for their dogs.
Look, that's nice. That's interesting. I didn't know these things.
I don't know how that works in the United States but it works. I don't know, it's a lot of money for the poor and there are lots of them that live on the streets by choice.
I see, that's true.
It's not like in South America. Oh, yes. Here it's like many of them are drug addicts.
They chose
they are addicts or alcoholics. Or,
yes, that's true.
people lost their jobs because they didn't want to work on and I don't know how but in Peru I think it must be like that too
it's like in Argentina, there's lots of misery, no?
Really. And the poor, the poor dogs are really miserable too.
yes.  yes.  yes.  The poor dogs.
They're poor things from one extreme to another, eh, because sometimes when the
Hello?
Hello.  Yes, my name is Gloria from here in California.
He-Hello Gloria, I'm Paula, I'm Argentinian and I'm here in Boston.
Yes.
Yes, have you been in California for a long time, Gloria?
Sorry?
Have you- can you hear me?
Yes, sorry?  No, no, I didn't really hear what you asked me.
Have you been in California for long?
Oh, yes.  Oh, it's been seven, eight years.
Ah, a lot.  And what do you think about social security in the United States?
Hmm.  No, the truth is that, maybe in part you're right they don't give a lot of help to, eh, to make you self-sufficient, no?
but maybe sometimes there are opportunities where you don't have, eh, it's not the moment to be self-sufficient, eh, here there are many restriction
like with economic help, like with medical benefits.
Hmm.
We've, eh, suffered a lot in this way, well, because of the governor, right?  Who has limited a lot of the help for people who really need it
Sure.
so, I see this as bad, well because we're all human beings and we also have rights in my opinion.
No, not talking, I think that the system isn't very good, I'm here for three years
Hmm.
and with all sincerity, is not that understand perfectly all these services and benefits, but I have noticed, and also heard that there are many people that cannot access any type of, of
social services nor the medicine, right? and is
Mm.
I think that in a rich country like the United States
There are many limitations.
is horrible. Sure, like I think that the people should be first, right? and that of self-sufficiency
Mm mm
there not everybody can be self-sufficient in every
Mm. Yes.
in every moment
Mm
and No
The truth is that each day the close the doors more, on one as a Latin let's say it like this because I'm Latin, right?
Hm
and each day there are a lot of restrictions eh we don't receive all the benefits that we deserve, so
Sure.
eh, the basis for them is that you are an immigrant, you don't have any rights to this, you are an immigrant you don't have a right to medical coverage
Yes.
eh, there are many limitations, and I truly think that's wrong
Sure.
there should be improvements in that, right?
Yes, and the place where you work, they don't give you medical insurance?
I don't know which one No. Is a hassle here, eh, eh, they pay the minimum here
Yes.
and no, I'm not working at the moment because I have a, a baby.
Ah, how cute, how old?
Aha. The baby turned ten months.
Ah.
Aha, but she has been very sick with the flu, so
Yes,
eh, yes I'm a single mother and there to the extreme of asking for monetary aid and they denied it twice already
No.
and yes, mm
How strange. And that's the state of California, right?
The state of California, I got very sick of
Sure.
the heart, I had
Mm.
I was having a hard time breathing, I went to the emergency room
Yes.
they sent me a six hundred eighty dollars bill
I don´t believe you.
then, for that part, I have seen myself affected, how am I going to pay that amount at once? I look for a job, I am going to let applications in some places in
no place, eh,has called me or anything.
Yes.
I look for babysit eh, they want you to charge them ten dollars for eight hours.
No.
Aha, then I see that there are not benefits, well.
No.
Hmm.
No, it is ridiculous, I have a friend that well, she was not a single mother because she was married but her husband lived in India
Hmm.
so, lets say, her husband was virtual
Hmm.
and, and she got pregnant and had the baby here and the state of Massachusetts pay almost all the pregnancy expenses, the doctor and milk coupons, juice
and the truth is that I in that moment, despite that she , was not, was not American she was not a citizen, she was nothing, she was a student
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.
and, and in that moment it looked to me that the state of Massachusetts have been fine with someone that
Ah, it, it depends of the State, because here in California, the governor we have
Of course.
oh, it has taken a lot of the benefits
Sure, yes, Schwarzenegger is a disaster, isn't he?
He has taken a lot of mmm. And the longer he stays the worse, because he is cutting the, eh, medical insurance, he don't want them, and I've heard that the children born here will no longer have the benefits
they won't be, they won't be born in this country because they are sons of immigrants, they are closing us the door more every day
But that is so because it is a federal law
Mhm. But I don't know, to me it is not right, because although they say that we become a charge for the government, because that's what they say, that we become a charge for them
I say that at the moment, we, we also contribute with , mm, with taxes, don't we?
Right, right
MHm
Yes, besides, eh, I think that saying that the health of the people living here is a charge is quite sad and ugly
Yes
Isn't it? It is like eh
There is a lot of racism
going to invade Iraq and spending millions of dollars
Aha
there but it's not only the immigrants, there are a lot of Americans who can not afford
Black people, I see nobody working here, and, and, and if you come to have a look where they give the money aid it is full of black people
people who, men who look alright
Yes
who are able for working and so, but they are in the same
Sure.
Really? then eh
Sure, sure
on my part I, I see it as being bad because actually, eh, it's getting worse, there's no, there's no help
Yes.
eh
What country are you from, Gloria?
from Guatemala.
You're from Guate-, ah they tell me Guatemala is wonderful.
Aha, but eh, we are also like in one part, eh, I can't say is one hundred percent bad the, the state here where I'm at because it was the first place where I came, right?
Sure.
because yes, at that moment the people from there, the hospital they all helped me, they gave me financial help
Sure.
but it was a collection that they did amongst them which in my country they never would've done.
Mm. Sure.
Eh, they do give me the milk for my daughter because otherwise I wouldn't have money to buy it, right?
Sure.
Eh. Yes, they have helped me
Mm.
But, eh, what I am referring to is that each day they are closing more the doors, eh, they are taking away benefits that are beneficial to us.
Yes.
Aha, they are taking away a lot of benefits that in reality benefit us, I don't know if in all the states is like that, but at least here in the state of California, this is getting bad.
Yes, and have you thought of moving to another state?
The truth is I have nowhere to go, no because I would really like to if I had the support of some relative or something
Sure.
I'm going to go somewhere else, but already now is not just me alone,  I also have a daughter, right?
Sure.
and not anywhere, they are going to say come here and let's see how we give you a hand.
Sure.
Aha, I was working with a Salvadoran lady, I took care of her daughter, she would give twenty dollars daily
Yes.
I would go from seven in the morning and would return at eight at night.
Mm, no.
I had to clean her house, wash the clothes and everything and take care of the daughter.
That's abusive.
Yes, then, eh yes, since I arrived, I've been like this, it hasn't gone too well you could say
Mm.
and to say that I'm going to return to my country neither because my mom gave me away when I was very little
Mm.
eh, I have a sister in Honduras and and she's worse off because she has like eleven kids and practically over there is a country, the poorest country there could be in Honduras
Mm Sure.
then eh just wait to see what happens here because it would be a mistake also to take my daughter from here that here I know she will have benefits
she will have her studies and all, something I won't be able to give her in my country, right?

Yes
Hey, there's this dude there in New York, what's he called?, Howard Stern, right?, there was something
Oh
Where it's more like this week, i heard in the news that he's not, he ended up in the radio or something like that
Uh, a contract that ended but, uh, that's still going, the person he had pays me, the station he works for, they get a lot of money from his audience
That dude is something, something crazy
Yes?
Yes, because the guy's a pervert, i consider him a pervert
Oh
I don't now if you like his shows, have you seen his shows?
Yes, i heard it, i hear him once in a while, yeah, that's, is not easy, no, no
Yes
And they're not on regular radio, well, here in Canada; uh, i have heard him every now and the, and i find him kind of funny but nothing, when he's
Yes, no, no, no, what i mean is, for example, that the guy has, like, he doesn't, have... yeah, he's funny, his quotes are really
like very rude, uh
Uh huh
So, he kinda doesn't have
Double, but, double meaning, right?
No, not the meaning, he gives it the meaning he wants
Uh huh
That the people like the red ones, the teeth cantudos? of that one
Uh uh,
and then he has no respect, he has no respect towards anyone. Yes hes is a person that has no respect.
Uh uh
he he, he only does it so that the people laugh, understand. And that. For example he has a show that show of house he has a show of
that, that is is televised. But is about what he does in the radio.
Uh uh
And then the girls go and he tells them, listen but here. And they take it off in front of him. Okay. And the
And in front of the camera and I don't know what the man has, the girls go crazy.
Uh uh.
He tells them, oh take off your bra there. Let me see how they are, that if they are good. And he, he tells them Come here that I want to touch them and
they let him, they let him do it. And he tells them, take off your panty, take if off and they even do it. I don't know what it is that
Uh uh
I don't know I prefer, I don't know is I consider him a person like you know a person is a show But I mean, how can a man like that go to work.
And then go home and he has a family, understand?
Uh uh
Because, I don't know if you've seen the show, you've never seen the show?
yes, once that I was in the United States here was here in Canada what is it called E right?
Uh uh.
yes, here in Canada they don't have that E channel -E channel
Uh uh.
It didn't happen. I went once, I saw it once when I was there on vacation in the United States.
yeah. great. You didn't see any of that, what I'm talking about?
yes, well I I saw I think the episode that that I saw it was an interview with Arnold Schwarzenegger or something like that. And I think that if there had been a girl in a bathing suit and
And everything all of her bathing suit but they censored it. It wouldn't happen like
Uh uh. yes, yes they censored it but that is that is that was working like that. I don't know how they're able to convince these women to take their clothes off because there are wo-
I I used to have a roommate it was two women, sisters, Germans both, and I was always watching that and I I sat down and stayed watching it with them
and it was always today I'd say like about two months there were more than four hundred, had seen like about four hundred women and the guy was saying I'm going to break it that I want to watch how that is and
yep, took off her clothes in front of him and said, hold in, so that
those where they give out prizes or something like that, right? Or like a prize contest
uh? No, what happened was the super popular guy like I told you, the popular man that there are woman we cam they have like a certain level of popularity, there are woman that just go crazy
like it just gives them an inclination to do crazy stuff
uh uh.
for for you.
uh.
Understand? For example, I've heard that there are musicians ah here in in Manhattan that when they go do a concert that they're putting on the girls take off their panties and throw them on on
to the
uh uh.
And eh they're just stupid and crazy little things but they do it you know with people, men when they ask to do something they do it. Anything. They do it.
Happens
Then, uh?
With the purpose of coming out in that program, right?
With the purpose of his program well with the purpose of doing what he wants.
Uh uh
With the purpose of doing what he wants since they have him as an idol, you understand?
Ah, yes.
But, Leave me.
But there there each time for example. You have to see these Spanish channels where they do these things more the same. right?
Eh.
But in Spanish.
Well, I was talking with a  guy that there's a song called the mega and this station there's already two people that
that what is it called that they
Must be the same as Howard but in Spanish.
they are the ones that direct yes yes direct the show and they are almost the same as this man. But in Spanish because they really
Uh uh Uh. And but they can do worse things because they are since they are speaking Spanish
Oh.
they can say vulgar things and things like that, and nobody
Oh. Oh yes, they do it
yes, and they don't have for example the problems that came out that Howard had with with the FCC because it was in Spanish and
and nobody from this government cares what they say because they are talking in Spanish, right?
Yes, oh, the, the, he speaks Spanish here, loudly
Uh huhu,
But they have regulations, do you know what i mean?, always, people always know what they're talking about because there's always another stations that accuses you and everything
Oh
But no, they have, for example, they have a, lets say they have a keyword to say bad words, for example, when this man talks about the
the feminine part
Uh huh
instead of saying the word in spanish, they invented a thing that's called "foneta"
It's not
Yes
Uh huh
That means the thing, the woman's thing
Oh, the woman's thing
But
What i said, in Mexico it's called, "doing the cheese", i don't know if they say it like that in the United States
Uh huh, no, maybe the Mexicans still call it the "cheese" among them
Uh huh
But the chaforeta doesn't really mean anything
Really
But, but it's something they have
Yes
they named it like that so they can speak in public, uh, openly, without getting into trouble with the people who regulates. The words, so the words
Yes
They call it "calembo"
The calembo
Uh huh, and that, really, no country in Latin America call the Spanish language like that, but they
Uh huh
At radio level and as authorities they're doing that, and people laughs about the jokes they make, and they make songs
About the "chanfoneta" and the calembo, and their jokes are basically theirs
yes
They take popular songs and change them and put make like that, for example, they have the, the song that says "it lasts so long"
Uh huh
"Oh it lasts so long", and so they put a woman that's, that the woman is singing to the man
Uh huh
Because he has a very big calembo
Yes
And he makes her suffer, she says "oh, it hurts so much but it's just...", but because of the calembo, it explains everything, using that term. So, I'm telling you, the radio can't control it any longer
Yes
But your imagination, and you, you know that
Good evening.
Hello, how are you?
Who's speaking?
Juan, hello?
Juan, Juan
Juan from -- that, is my last name.
It seemed like very religious, is it a priest's name?
No, not at all, I'm a father but of a family.
Hm. Well my name is, eh, um, Rosa, how are you?
Very good, thank you very much, is today's topic.
The welfare system, if I'm understanding, right?
Of the system, really?
Here in the United States, and in comparison
Um, um
Ah, ah, to the European system, well look I don't, I don't have much knowledge of the European system I, um, and, and I also don't know much, much, much of the welfare here, however, well, so
eh, they asked the question that if it should be reduced, the amount of money that the government gives to those who depend on welfare
so that they become more independent or, on the contrary, continue like that or increase it more
Um, um
Well I don't think that just reducing, or increasing the moneys they give the people eh, can change eh, the situation in, which those people find themselves, no, I think that
the economic situations and social well being eh, they have like, their foundation in more basic structures of society itself that would have to be, eh, transformed if they wanted
to generate, a, a change in the economical activity of this, in this dependent families
Oh, oh, yes, we agree on that, I believe that this is not about giving them more or less money, it can be because of other things, no, lets say these, needs to help people, no?
For example, if they say, well, we are taking the money away, if they, oh, if they give the people less money, to make them more self sufficient, the question is, are they, yes, yes, really
the money hast to do with self sufficiency
Sure, it exist
No?
the structures exist or the means for these people to become independent
Self-sufficient, exactly
because you might take the money away from them and they might not have the opportunity to, oh, work or get involved in a, oh, well yes, in the job system
so, because of that, this wouldn't be solving the problem
Oh. Exactly, it's like, in that sense, the question has, it rather has a, lets say a background, that, of course, in, they give people money and people don't do anything, no?
self-sufficient because they have enough money and they rely on the government to live, that's the issue, no? That this question
yes, one would have to ask what type of people, what type of people is requesting this government help
Um, um.
an,d usually, the discriminated sectors of society, the poor, oh, the racially rejected, lots of times, oh, old people or women, and so on, and so on, the ones that are usually, lets say, the ones with
less benefits in the society, so this, um we would have to ask ourselves again, as I was saying in this moment, yes, yes, if the conditions exist for this sectors to
overcome this discriminating situation
Um, um.
I believe that the changes would have to be very, very different and not just relative
Exactly
oh, oh the economical size of the aid, oh, what's the name, oh, the institutions that are giving aid to these groups are just palliatives.
they are not providing them with the necessary tools to become independent
and I believe that it would be best to reduce the amount given to them, to have the same people do the same with less money, no?
They won't be,
yes, because the structure is not changing, they don't have other opportunities, if you say, well, we are reducing the amount of money but
you can get this job opportunity and only the ones that are working, the funds are going to be lowered and you see that we are going to check that
oh, you will get money if you work, and education and healthcare and this and that, and then they will
oh, they will be able to access all the opportunities and general benefits, oh, of this society, well, it's like a, it's like a multi-sectoral measure and not just a unilateral one.
yes, yes, in that sense it is, I believe, I think I read somewhere that the poverty systems, the ones that fight poverty in the United States have failed.
because they haven't been able to end poverty and they have just made people dependent on the government's help so, I mean,
with this, this way of social support, yes, they give money to the ones that need it, so that, lets say, they
They do, yes
can move forward in this economical system
but they can't, no? Oh, oh, unless you have, yes
Yes, when you just keep the population, stable
Um, um.
No? They are not changing the conditions,
Um, um.
That's what has happened since, eighty years ago, there were twenty million of poor people and now the number is eighty million
it's growing, so, it's the same population, nothing has changed, this doesn't let people integrate,  no, no, nothing is going to happen, they are just going to continue getting government help
reall- really as an expense
Sure, but besides, I think that the government does assume it as such
Exactly
Because, making more structural changes would be much more expensive, not only economically, but in social terms, also for this government
I can't imagine, actually, what kind of changes would be the right ones for this case, right? because, well, apparently, what could it be? it may have something to do with cultural conditions, right?
Sure, and racial
questions, rather than what kind of structural changes can the government make, I don't th-, I can't imagine it, I mean, we live in a world that is the way it is, isn't it?
so, in this world, the way it is, you have to look for your opportunities
Well, but, no, no, it's not the same for everybody
It isn't? You may have it harder or easier
Um, sure, because if you belong to a
these circumstances, but then you say no, but let me tell you, it has to do with education, hasn't it? and so, if there are schools there, I guess a lot of the population can access those schools
and however, I guess they may hace some attitudes, or expectations, about their education or something like this, right? I mean it is a very complex phenomenon, I don't dare to think of a
simple solution, right? I rather try to think about how in the conditions under which you have, apparently, several opportunities and paths to follow, but you don't
right?
Um, um
That's it, if you don't do so it is because there is some interest in your lifestyle, some interest related to governmental aids, because it is enough
from this point of view, right? why move if I am getting aid that gives me enough to survive? Acording to my group, right? to how the population is
right?
Well, but from what I hear from you, I understand that you are, eh, giving a very simple explanation to a problem that, initially, we agreed that was much more complex than that
because this answer that you're thinking about, or supposing, to say that the beneficiary of the social security system, well I think that it's too simple the way that you say, I think that there are also many more complexities
and many more explanations like cultural, like, eh, now it's a psychological history, cultural history, etcetera, I think that it's much more complex
yes, yes.
But well, in general, I agree.
yes, it's a simplification of an economic kind, no?  To say, it's a decision many, it's like an economic decision, well yes, I have more benefit, that costs
and like they say, here, hey, well I won't move and they'll give me one hundred dollars, well I don't move, one hundred dollars won't help me much, but if I move
well, I don't know, I say, who knows what kind of costs, of values, or things there are for the style, no?  For example a friend of mine told me that in Guam,
the unemployed are payed, something, seven hundred and fifty dollars a month, no?
Hm, um.
But the minimum salary there, for the rest of the population, is three hundred dollars a month.  So what people do there, they say, I work, I'll earn three hundred
Ah, yikes.  Um, um.
if I don't work, I get seven hundred, well I won't work
Um, um.
So it's, it's simple
yes, well, but yes yes yes it's
and so people declare themselves unemployed and so, well, since they can't
Hello, hello, yes hi, my name is Jenny, I'm calling from New York,
ah My name is Mariano I'm in Philadelphia, we are close by
ah, we are close by, yes
how are you? fine Where are you from?
ah, and good And how are you? ah, I was born in the United States, but my parents are Dominicans.
ah, Dominican parents, okay, you I mean speak English and Spanish the same way
mm ah, more or less, yes I feel more comfortable in English, but
more or less
I also, um, mutually feel good in Spanish, but not, as comfortable as in English
sure, in English you feel much more comfortable, with me is the opposite
yes oh, you feel much more comfortable in Spanish than in English
and sure yes since I was born in a Spanish country, where they speak Spanish
oh okay ah, from and from Where are you from?
sure, from Argentina
okay
from Argentina, What do you think of today's topic?
well today's topic is one that, that more or less is something that one always as a kid of immigrants here in the United States always
it has been present ah, this country was created on the back of the immigrants themselves
sure.
but nowadays ah people that are kids of immigrants want to make themselves feel better by throwing back the new immigrants. and I think that regrettably
is a terrible injustice.
ah, yes is an injustice that, that some times I don't understand where it comes from because we are
hello
oh yes, sorry that call waiting one moment
no, no, I really don't know from where
oh, can you hold on a moment sorry, is that is an important call on the other line, one moment I'm going to put you on hold
okay
hello, yes excuse me a moment Hector
hello
yes I'm sorry I was talking with immigration
yes, hello, they are not going to accept the call eh,
yes they will accept it, because it was just a small instance.
ah well, yes that is a, is incredible, no, I can't hear with the dog
yes, well if you want to cancel the call,
no, is that I can't hear with the dog that's why
yes, I took him to another room and they came in now, so
now he is there
yes
ah well no that, that is surprising that there are people that are resistant to foreigners because this country is basically made by foreigners
yes but unfortunately everybody thinks that because two or three generations of their family are born here they stop being from where they are
of course
unfortunately there is much ignorance in the U.S.
yes, right?
we must not allow ignorance follow progress
and yes
every time I hear something of immigrants, I always remember about their parents
completely
they also did an injustice when they stole the land and their way of thinking
we should all be ashamed.
It was a tremendous injustice
the immigrants founded this country.
we can not complain because we are also immigrants
of course, I think that's important and we respect foreigners.
yes
no matter what race they are from, they  also work very hard.
they work without asking for almost nothing
reluctance
Their purpose is to feed their families, and to have a better tomorrow
yes
for your family and your destination.
yea I, I I uh, I really admire them, the me- for example the closest one is Mexican that he's the one that I that there is no, but
yea yea
they're people that leave their families behind and they come here to work in I mean to start to provide for their families here and, and they send a lot of money back and it supports their family in Mexico
really you have to, you've got to respect them a lot, I I think that besides that Americans can be characterized as not working as hard as an immigrant does because, because of what I see.
no, no here the Americans let someone they know do it, whoever their family knows, whoever their fr- friend is
yea, they call it
through friendships, not through work
what they cal-. what they call networking
complete that makes you, I, worse than networking it's more the old boys club yea your dad studied with someone else's dad who has some important position in some company.
that's going to work in your favor to have known your dad they'll give you a job
right yea
and not because you have the highest grades in your class, simply because he knows someone from your family and that's how they help each other out.
yea, yea it's
and, and that's the problem, the, the closest example for me is that my dad in Santo Domingo he was a lawyer to the, when they had a war there
they had a civil war, he left everything he had, it was his family's
yea
good, they had a lot of land, he came here and with everything and his doctorate and his license to practice law, he came here to give us a better lif- a better
a be- a better life uh
yea
he worked as a janitor.
yes, yes, it's terrible, it's terrible
you know that, things like that don't, they couldn't even ah, give him the respect that he deserves being a lawyer and simply just to teach him English and change it, it wasn't easy for him.
no, no, yes
and, and that's why he made such an effort for us to study
yes
and, and we won't stop our careers so that so that we wouldn't have to make the same sacrifice that he did, and still today. There are people that they think that uh, we are less
because my dad wasn't born here.
no it's true for me as well in Argentina it's a little bit like here because that is basically how immigrants are treated, eh there's a lot for example
I would tell you that Italians they're like sixty percent, seventy of the population
yes but they immigrated a lot more to the east coa- Who immigrated more over such time?
the, the one in Argentina you said
yeah
and the Argentinians are mostly from the turn of the last century
yes, yes that's the problem ah
eh yeah
the new immigrants like they say, Mexicans.
sure, that is
ah, the Russians are just arriving, but I find also that cultures are different, because this one Russian woman that, that studies here, it's great that she came here and left her family behind
Don't ever forget that when a friend comes or someone they know they can get them a job
yes, yes, they're never forget
however me being from a Dominican family I've noticed that here there are many Dominicans that when they arrive they make the effort they get a job they get, a good
a good position in society
they forget about everyone
like they forget, yes
sure, yes, yes
they forget that in their town there are some people that are interested in coming, that they should help them, that, like I've never understood that
yes, yes is
no, I don't know how the people so easily forget about the effort
is terr-
and of all that they had to suffer
is terrible
and they don't help them nor do they give a hand to a person who comes
is terrible, is an incredible injustice.
but is an injustice that we ourselves create
yes, yes, yes
you know, no is like another time like I tell you, the old boys network here you know, an anglo person, American or, or from Europe
sees that a person from their town comes and gives him a hand
yes
eh, oh, they give them a job easier than giving a job to a Hispanic person helping one another however we sticking our nose up in the air and we don't know them, let him do the same that I had to go through.
for me, in reality here in the United States I had good experiences with the
and, mm mm
immigrants
mm
or the kids of immigrants that are Americans but that are of Italian origin
mm mm
that I let's say since I have they tell me that I look Italian.
oh, okay
and, and also my last name, and my family is Italian, but I was born in Argentina
mm mm
in general they have accepted me very well and, I mean they have made me feel like part of them.
mm
but because they are Italians, no, even if they speak English, even if they don't speak Italian, like they identify in something.
yes yes yes
I no, eh, I don't know if they are all like that but at least I had a good experience with them for now
I tell you in the, in the where - I've worked in the school system
aha
and I've worked, I'm now a researcher and I've realized that in both careers, and even in my studies eh, I've realized that is not like that with everybody, no.
really
ah, unfortunately I tell you again, I had a school principal
yes
that was Cuban um and was Cuban descendant and got married to a man from Egypt
from Egypt, look at that
and for her, she was not Hispanic, and nobody would talk to her in Spanish.
ah
she changed her last name to a way that she never wanted anyone to call her
she never again wanted to be identified with that
no, no, and, and she was doubly, harder with the Hispanic workers
sure
so, everything was like she wanted to erase that the family came, from Cuba, that her family were boat people when Castro got the people out of Cuba.
yes that's common in the young people, no
no, this was an older lady, this was a lady like
that, that no ah, a, oh my God
when I was twenty five she was like forty forty five
my God
yes she was a director of a school and I was working as coordinator of a program
my God
and she didn't want me to accept Hispanic children into the program, she wanted children with, with parents with high income who for the most part were anglos that are ah
yes
Hi my name is Yolanda
hi, how are you?, my name is Adrian and I live in Toronto, Ontario, Canada
oh, you're calling from Canada? oh, OK, and I like in, in Texas Texas
yes? Texas, in which city?
ah, yes, in the area of, ah, Dallas Forthword
mm
Dallas Forthword
eh, and have you been living in Dallas for long?
in Dallas, aha, yes, OK, and you live in Toronto?
mm?
Toro- Toron- Toronto?
Toronto, yes
Toronto, OK, and your name is Adrian, OK
exactly
OK, and d- ah, from which country are you from?
eh, I was born in Buenos Aires in Argentina
oh, OK, from Argentina, very good yes, and I, I didn't know that ah country, other countries, and thought that only here in the United States, ah, have you been in this study for long?
eh, no, n- one month more or less
oh, OK
I think they weren't getting people and they, they expanded it to Canada too
okay, very good, yes, okay, well, then you know little of of, tonight's topic?
yes I don't know, where were you born, were you born in the United States or in another place?
no I, I was born here eh, eh, I'm from, ah I'm Texan and my mom and my dad also were born here and, we have like five generations that have been here and after that
I think that we are from everywhere,
okay but ah, but they speak Spanish
well, ah, more or less when I was, my grandmother, she, ah she was the last one that spoke more Spanish now the, my relatives almost all of them speak English but
we speak a little Spanish and we understand Spanish also but here we do use English a lot here
but when you went to school, the school was in English, it wasn't in Spanish
yes, yes it was in English yes, aha
and, and how did you learn to read in Spanish?
ah, I don't know, just that
you learned on your own
yes well I, well I don't know, to write my, my grammar is not too good because I haven't, ah, they haven't taught me how well no, no
they taught us how to eh, ah that, the grammar and all that in Spanish, I always learned it in English, but, it's been a
but to be able to know if, a Spanish book attracts you, can you read it or not?
yes, aha I can read it, there are some words perhaps that I can't understand too good but ah because you see, from other countries
some use certain words for something and in other countries in others, ah Spanish that is, ah, that they call Tex Mex is, is Spanish with English and
mixed
yes of everything, yes but I make myself understood and, we can talk yes
I'm not in the, the, , I ask you the question in and eh, obviously here there are immigrants
aha
the, the, something very usual no matter what background the, mm, immigrants are from, but they share the worry about
aha
the, the second generation, the sons born in, in a country with a different native language
yes
from their parents, is that they never learn to speak the native language correctly or
yes it's alright, yes, because my little brothers, well the one behind me, he speaks Spanish just like me, but the two
the youngest two, they understand well but don't speak too well, they know some words
and, what was the difference between the brothers who do speak well and those who don't?
yes, well, me and the brother right behind me, we raised together with my grandma, and she did speak a lot in spanish, but the
youngest two, mm, well my grandma had already died, so they didn't have much contact with her
it's alright, but was that enough? just your grandma speaking to you all day long in Spanish,was that enough for you to learn it?
it was, but
or did you study?
no, I've never studied spanish, ah, just being around my grandma, all the people who talked to her talked in Spanish
and so I learned it little by little, and
because your grandma didn't speak english? was it so?
she knew English but she preferred to talk to the Hispanic people in Spanish
mm
mh, yes, and it was good for me because this way, mm, me and my cousins who are the same age, we all speak spanish, and my cousins better
oh, less, well, they had no contact with her, they don't speak a lot of Spanish, yes, it's very different.
no, no, but the, the, the, it is different, you try at home and, oh, I know a few Hispanic families
aha
that came here, the children weren't born here but they came here when they were very young
yes
and they don't speak Spanish, they can, they might understand it but
aha
only if it's a simple conversation, their dad speaks to them in a language and they answer in English.
yes, yes, yes, what happens is that
and when, when they speak between them, they speak in English.
yes
but oh well
aha, my nephews, man y times, they don't speak Spanish, they speak English and even my own children do, oh because I was married to a oh,
a gringo and he didn't speak Spanish so, how did you ended up in Canada from Argentina?
Oh, how did I ended up here?
aha
oh, oh, it's a long story but basically
tell me a short version
short version, oh
yes, aha
eh, basically the, eh for, for a bunch of, of, of topics
aha
of, of how is Argentina or how is Buenos Aires I think that since little I always had the idea that I was going to end up in another place
aha
eh, I don't know where or, or, or when but the idea laughed a little, the idea kept growing so to speak
yes, aha
ah, I remember that when I left I was twenty eight years old
aha
and I remember that I told my father and told him that well, I'm leaving, I'm going to go live to Canada and he told me
go, well, I already knew and how did you know?
ah
and because, ten years ago you told me I don't remember according to him when I was eighteen I told him, but
aha, wow
no no, I, the truth is that I don't remember when I told him or in
aha
why I told him or in what second I told him but for him it was like he knew
aha, yes
he, mm
and you already had friends or family there in Canada or, or just that place
yes, a, a, a, a few friends
okay, aha
basically in, in reality I was going to go live to Australia
oh
and and, when I was finding out and saw the topic the
aha
some friends eh that, that were living at that moment here in Toronto
yes
told me no, don't go to Australia you're going to talk like the crocodile hunter and I don't know what, and and it's very far
yes
ah, here is cold but is nicer, and I don't know what and,
yes is very nice, I, I, I've gone to, to Toronto to, I went once a few years back and I loved it, it's very beautiful the area of, of that
that state yes
and in, in, in, this moment is snowing
oh,
a lot, so,
aha well so eh, during the cold season perhaps is not as nice us here it was raining the whole day and it was like in the forties
middle forties, but tomorrow is going to be sunny and it's going to
nor the
be in almost sixty and that's how I like the weather
yes I figure that the sun here we won't see until March
until March until March
that's when my wife said that it gets cloudy
yes
that's what's cloudy in, in, in November
aha
sometimes is in March but
yes mm
no, there is where I don't know, the, my, if you want about the topic of the immigrants, my opinion will be a little subjective but
yes, aha
because you were born in the United States, you lived there, how fine that you are an immigrant
yes yes I tell you, what, what topic they give us of, of immigration and of, of religion and ah those topics that, sometimes but I, I think that
if the people ah have a desire to get ahead and, and are good ah, there's so much in, in this country and I think that
also in Canada ah, to to come and make a good life I think, mm
and of, why doesn't anybody want the immigrants in Texas?
well
what, what are those that patrol the border called?
ah
the other time I heard one in the, in the radio the minuteman or something like that
aha the minutemen is that there are a lot of things is, is, ah, they have many reasons and, I understand both sides but also eh is that
ah is that is very hard for the government to maintain, the hospitals and here there's a lot ah, of crime caused by ah, situations like that
many things happen
criminals are just criminals
not all of  them but sometimes the news talk about that
there are criminal that are immigrants
all mexican, yes
mhm, that is not good you know the border with all the drugs it is not very safe and that is not good how can I tell you?
that is not good for the country
something negative like burden
yes it is very hard for the people who lives close to the border. to maintain hospitals and jails
like I told you there are two ways.This is a seriuos situation
we need to have an opend mind to solve all this.
I understand the crime and all that but
mhm
the statistics say something different
okay, yes
90% believes that if the immigrants disappeared
mhm
Texas will have no crime, there would be no crimes
mhm
hello!
Hello!
Hello, my name is Luisa
Hello, my name is Aurelio, from Washington DC
ah, I'm from Miami, Florida
Miami, Florida, ah, how nice
aha, yes, yes
Listen look the topic they put today is a very hard topic, to talk for twelve minutes, is hard right?
Sure yes,
yes,
Very complicated, But Are you an immigrant, do you live here? or, you were born here
Ah, I live here yes, I'm an immigrant, originally from Venezuela I've been here in this country going on twelve years that I've been in this country
oh
mm
a long time, long time, I'm Colombian, it's barely been two years that I've been here
Ah, imagine that
mm
and how is it? how is it going? how did you come here to this country?
I, I mean I came legally, I came with my visa and all but I had to emigrate precisely for that of the guerrilla Because in Colombia, the guerrilla bothers a lot the people that
that are well off and that, and they killed my dad, they killed my little sister's dad
Oh, my goodness, the guerrilla
And then the guerrilla, and then they were threatening my mom, that's why I had to immigrate here, so I came due to political  asylum
aha
and now I am so, in political asylum process, waiting for immigration to respond
oh, listen, it's hot, wow, I came here to study. I came here to study, I finished mu studies and I stayed here
I met my wife here, she is American, and we married, while in the university, mhm. Yes, but listen, never under these circumstances, wow, this is great
yes, it i hard but
yes
Here we are that's what counts, safe
yes, sure, absolutely. Here, at least, you are safe, here at least there is no guerrilla
yes, at least there is no guerrilla
wow, figure. But look, about immigratio I think that, I mean, you can't stop immigration, it's impossible
Specially in a country like this one, that was actually founded by immigrants, you know what I mean?
aha
and second one, listen, that would be impossible, most of the people here have a family abroad,you know what I mean?
aha
so, it would be impossible to stop the immigration, I mean, no more immigrants or rather only immigrants who are somehow qualified, university graduates, that can't be done
Impossible, unfair as well
I mean, oh, sure, right, such an injustice would be unthinkable. Let me tell you, there are a lot of people who would love to do that
Who would love to completely stop the immigration
Sure so
I don't know if
I heard this past days that they were going, that they had approved or were going to approve a law to make a dividing wall between Mexico and, and
Well the border, of Mexico and the United States, something like that I heard
Exactly, yes, mm, yes.
I think that even if they do that the immigration will continue because look many are the Cubans that risk their lives to come here, and many people that are leaving their countries just to get here
Sure, exactly
Is very hard, is very hard of what they can do Starting with that we
yes,
The immigrants are like the engine of the United States how many of the immigrants do the job that many Americans don't want to do like
Exactly
cleaning, yes you understand me, in the hotels, restaurants, and everything, almost all of them are Latins who do the hard work
Sure Is the same here in Washington, is the same thing I mean the majority of the ones that do those jobs are Latins Are Hispanics, especially Central Americans.
People from Salvador, here in the area of Washington there's a lot of people from Salvador.
Oh, here in Miami there are a lot of Cubans
Over there of course a lot of Cubans and Venezuelans also, you understand me But no here the majority are from Central America, Salvadorans especially Salvadorans
And then Hondurans And look the great majority, I have many friends from Salvador And almost all of them have told me that they've arrived, of course they are already legal in the country
but when they arrived, they arrived as illegal immigrants
Sure
yes sir, they arrived like that Like One told me a story one day, something incredible. That he came in a truck imagine that, from El Salvador, they crossed all of Mexico, in a
truck, and they crossed the border here in a truck. They seemed a charge, yes, it's horrible. But let me tell you, stopping the immigration would be impossible
and unfair. And besides, like you say, the engine of, a nig part of the engine of this economy are the immigrants
You remember
Sure
You have been here for, how long? two years, so you were in Colombia when the September eleventh, right?
Yes, I was still in Colombia
ok, well, you know that I lived very, very near, very near of the Pentagon when that happened
yes
Mm, and actually, I spent most of my time there, in front of the Pentagon, and saw the destruction, something horrible. Well, the ones who did that building, that refurbishment of the Pentagon
most of them were from El Salvador
yes
yes, and there were voices for an amnesty for them, for the people who refurbished the Pentagon, to give them the citizenship
different people, but it wasn't approved, OK
I don't know, honestly, I don't know how all that ended, I think they were given something, some amnesty for patriotic reasons and so, but
but I haven't heard back from that, really, I mean, so much they talked about it, and now, I haven't herd back from it
Here they keep talking about that wall you mentioned, that they want to build one wall, but
That is impossible, I mean just figure, spending so much money in that
yes, considering that they can enter by any other side
Sure, of course
or, and no, no, figure, just imagine that they allow no more people entering, what would be of people like me?
That are leaving the country because they are in danger, to where they go the most it's where is the closest, okay one says well to Canada, but in Canada is almost the same, the same.
Exactly.
you understand me
True, true
I have an aunt that she came here twenty years ago, she came by, by Mexico. She first came, she crossed by bus
train, of everything to get here
Oh, imagine
And she came here twenty years ago, imagine she had to do  everything but thank God at this moment she's a citizen she's already an American citizen
She already has all her things in order, but it was like a lot of suffering what my poor aunt had to go through, when she came here
Well I imagine, imagine so many things, twenty years ago she came Things were not like that, so, let's say so tight as they are now,
yes, twenty years ago
Especially with this republican government, because this government Is totally anti immigration despite what they say that the republican governments have always been more of
anti immigration than the democrats This is a disaster Really this is a disaster, listen one thing, and what do you do there in Miami?
what do you work in?
I study, I don't work
Ah, you are a student, a student of what?
I'm a student, I'm finishing high school I mean I finished High school I'm going to start College.
Ah, imagine, but then you are young, how old are you?
Nineteen
If you don't mind nineteen years imagine
nineteen and
I'm thirty five years old, I was going to tell you thirty four, thirty five I'm a musician, I'm an opera singer
really, I study vocal technique
Ah, yes. Ah, how nice. where?
yes, I want to, no, with an independent teacher And did you ever see a program called "voices of America"
of course, sure
okay, Yacke Aredondo the teacher there, oh, she's my teacher
Ah, listen that's good, excellent, I congratulate you
yes  but But now that, now I'm going to study, I'm going to start studying music
aha
I'm going to start college for music, because that's what I want to do, that's my passion and is what I want to do
Sure, And you want to be a singer? or are you going to play an instrument?
Sure, yes, no, I want to be a singer
Ah, Ah, imagine that, I went through that already and that's a career that makes makes very good money when one works right
And is a career very, I mean, you never finish studying that, I graduated it's going on seven years since I graduated from the University
I graduated from the conservatory in Venezuela also
yes aha
Before yes before coming here and Look that's something you never stop studying, I still weekly go to my singing lessons and all
I have to do
And that's something constant
That, that is the word, the perseverance One has to be very, very constant because
But the nice thing is that that is one's passion, what one wants to do, and when one likes it, one studies it however
Sure, true you're right. To what, to what university are you going to go?
I'm going to go to the community college then I want to go but I'm going to start by the college first, which is better the College first
yes, sure
Really the same subjects as the university, only that a little more expensive
Sure, listen look how nice I congratulate you I tell you something, that's another, another area in where the immigrants here are let's say at the head
At the head
yes sure. If you see the great majority of the singers in the opera companies The ones that do the main roles are immigrants, are people that have names
Russian, or Polish, Italian, or Latins Especially in this area you know that here, the opera company, is directed by the maestro Placido Domingo
aha
yes, And he gives a lot of preference to the -To the Spanish singers so, because he is Hispanic also, he was born in Mexico and was raised in Spain
sure
yes, But you see, that's another example of the immigration, you understand me, you can't stop the immigration
mm
guy, it would be impossible Because there are people that come here, just to sing There are some that come and stay, there are some that come
And well, they return to their countries What's more I have a Colombian friend, eh, sorry, Cuban the guy he moved, he went to Venezuela, he fled to Venezuela
One time when the Havana symphony went to play to Caracas and he stayed there in Caracas and from Caracas
He came over here to this country And look You know, that sure, he who comes from Cuba, comes as a political refugee and
sure
They gave him his residence papers almost immediately, and they gave him his papers in less than two months
An incredible thing, look, and what are you?  A soprano I imagine from the voice, from the way of speaking, Mezzo soprano, ah now nice
hmm
and what are you
yes,
studying in music now?  what, what songs?  what do you do?
what songs do I do?  Well, sorry?  I didn't understand you
Like
yes hello?
Hello, yes, whom am I speaking with?
Eh, I'm Lorena. Whom am I speaking with?
Oh Lorena, Jorge's speaking, from Los Angeles. Where are you Lorena?
And hi. I'm here in San Antonio, Texas.
Oh, a pleasure. How are you? Well.
Fine, what a pleasure.
What an interesting topic today eh.
Absolutely
Absolutely
Hot, hot
hot super interesting and you that are there in in Texas, that
That's it. Well, And in Los Angeles too, so much immigration.
Of course.
And so impor-
How far is San Antonio San Antonio more or less from El Paso, what is?
By car, is
Yeah
is approximately three hours.
Is not much. The border is there in El Paso.
It's not a lot, it's pretty close, hm mm.
Yeah. And good and around here more or less, from Los Angeles to El Paso and that would to the border that would be an hour from Tijuana, two hours , it's not much.
A lot closer, a lot closer.
yes, well what a candid topic. Eh the only thing that I can tell you, for example, that honestly as a Latin, eh, it hurts me deeply that it
no it's not my opinion
Hm mm
it's what the president, it's what this government is doing. With
yes
with, uh, with the, the basically the treatment that this government is doing with immigration generally is okay
yeah
When I talk about immigration I'm not talking only about the, the, the, the, Hispanics, in general, for me it's very frustrating to see how
it's that this government is driving the immigration theme, when basically this country was, and is based on the Constitution and the origins eh, was based on the idea of receiving
and sharing, and of, of working and offering opportunities. To put it simply like that, Lorena, in a few words.
So that's how it is. From the beginning, but also currently. Even though they, eh they want to deny it, well, well immigration continues being the motor of the economy
Exactly
In addition to all of the other forces that already have for well for the structure of the country. But definitely I think that migration is a, a source of renovating energy
for good things. Definitely always the the, rich intercultural of the people is a, a rich offering. No? We cannot say that if we have eh, immigrants of other countries that won't we here
eh, receiving them as a positive energy and learning new things and this, well enriching us, hm mm
Without a doubt and it hurts me, I, I, I I eh the bill hurts, it's true. In this moment there are more or less, eleven million
undocumented immigrants in this country. It hurts to see
Hm mm
or it hurts to see that when you think when you are trying to put eleven million in that bag, there can be, you think that, well
there must be some terrorists in that group but most of the eleven million that are here, I think, are human beings that have just come here to
work and to have a better life for them and for their families, if they had had a good life where they came from, the wouldn't be here, they wouldn't have come here
Yes, one is where the money is, and
Exactly
because if you have everything and you are doing okay and you feeling fine, why would you leave?
Exactly, I believe you are right about that, and I also, well, regarding the mistreatment of immigrants, it's different
I feel it has changed, oh, oh, oh, right now I think that Hindu migration is accepted, for example, some ten or fifteen years ago
now, they still reject, lets say, the Mexican immigrants, specially the ones from Central America, no?
That is painful, that's unbelievable.
Like, no, they are hard working people, good people, and if they, oh, if we think about it, I say, I don't think the Hispanics are going to think about it
about doing any terrorist acts, no, it's not part of their culture, of their lifestyle, so,
No,
it's the same story, of all our lives, witch hunt.
Exactly, yes.
They are hiding it by saying that there might be some terrorist among them so lets get rid of the  eleven million, or ten million and ninety nine hundred thousand.
that are left
Exactly, it's unfair that because of a few, there can be, the majority is being, as you said, the ten million and nine hundred and ninety nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety nine,
exactly, I missed some zeros.
have to pay for that. It's terribly painful, right?, and you know that, when was it?, i believe last friday, or the, yeah
when the, the house of representatives basically sketched out this new law project that, uh, basically has the white house approval
that really has an incredible anti-immigrant spirit, did you hear what I'm talking about?
No, no, no
Well, well, i think it was until last friday, in Washington, they finished working on it until late hours in the morning
Right
and they came on friday, uh, uh, uh, the house of representatives, in English it would be the HR, the House of Representatives
Uh huh
Uh, they presented a sketch of law for approval, well, it hasn't been approved, it will probably need to be taken to the senate, but it's, supported at the moment
By, by the white house, which is outrageous. Up until now, those eleven million people are considered to be committing a civil offense by being, being illegal
Well, they are studying the possibility of converting those eleven million people in, that could be a sort of civil offense
to what we in Spanish would call a major offense
yes
A criminal offense
Oh my
being illegal, that is
Oh my
That's a, uh, another, like you say, a witch hunt. They want to rule out that even the settled
Oh, yes, that's it
of illegal people
Born here who have no right to
that, as you say Lorena, what fault is that of the innocent people born in this country
Oh yes
not to have the right
That shows this discriminatory attitude of the government and the society, I wouldn't like to generalize because there are a lot of people in this country
No, no
who don't exactly agree to that stance, but what the hell, always those fundamentalism
Right
Always those attacks against the minorities, against the week, eh, like if they thought this is the only way of showing their power, exerting the power on the
minorities, right?. Oh, it's outrageous, really
Another thing that, ok, basically this plan that the Parliament is preparing and that to that level, to their level
they achieved some treat, is, eh, not to give, not togive the nationality to those, well another thing
I've heard is giving a two year term to, basically to the companies, for them to have the time to check all the documents
and the social security of all their employees
Hm mm
To see what is the real situation of all the employees. Oh! and I almost forget the worse, the worse is
that this new one doesn't have any organized plan for those eleven million to pass neatly to a system
that allow them to legalize, eh, eh, normally. But the
Wow
the most interesting is that this measure to be taken by the Parliament
Hm mm
the house of representatives is never going to be passed by the senate. Well they planned to take this to the senate in February or March but yes, yes,
eh, they expected a eh eh, the people that understand that, and study, that ninety percent
but what
that this bill is never going to be approved
yes it's barbaric. But simply, it's been that
Hi.
Mauricio.
Hi.
How are you? Mauricio.
Ah, How are you, Mauricio, how is it going? Paulo speaking.
Oh, Paulo.
es, How are you? It's my pleasure. Where are you from?
Eh, no, I'm from Panama, I thought that you were Mauricio from, from Argentina.  How are you? I am, I am Jaime, from New York.
Ah, Ah, and your name is?
Jaime.
Ah, Jaime, Jaime, Jaime. Ah, Mariano, you were saying, from Argentina, maybe. Or not,
Mariano, yes, Mariano.
Ah, Mariano, my friend. He speaks all day long
yes.
by phone.
How are you?
How are things going?
Good, gooh, thanks God.
How is it over htere? Cold, no?
It's very cold. Same as there, No?
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, the same here
It's almost the same, we almost have, almost
The whole week below zero and
Well
And well, here we are inside, having a few beers, warm
Well, uh, Christmas is in the air
What are we gonna do about it?, so, well, i don't know, what are we going to do?, do we talk the subject?, a very hard subject, immigration and i don't know what
Yeah, that's a very delicate subject
Yes, yes, uh, let's see, i don't know, that if immigrants are necessary to the United States, well, yeah, i say let it get filled with immigrants here, the United States, well, it's complicated to work, right?
Very delicate, yes, it's complicated, and the problem is that, the problem, i don't think that there really is a, uh, any, uh, immigrants, uh
How can i say it?, a shock on the economy
Right
What they have done is helped, because there really are jobs that the locals don't want to do
Sure
you know?, so, immigrants are needed to shake the... a little bit, uh, how can i say it?
Yeah, cheap manpower, that's what we call it, i don't know how you call it
Yes, yes, for example, uh, a meat store, they don't want to work in a meat store, they don't want to do the, the delivery, they prefer to be in the welfare system to
before doing, uh, a cheap manpower job, like you say, manpower
Yes
Something that, unqualified
Aha
And, meanwhile, the only persons who, who do that are the students themselves, or the immigrants, for
It's the immigrants, yes, yes, yes
For need. So, I really don't think it is any economical problem, it's just competence, it turns out to be some kind of competence. That
eh, about, let's say, when the system, eh, you want to apply, mm, how you call it? when you are unemployed
yes, yes
unemployment, and they send you to look for a job, and you do
aha
of course, you won't talk about that you went to, well, looking for a job to, to a shop to do delivery and so
Sure
But, this jobs, yes, if it was nor for the immigrants, no one would take them
Nobody takes them
Exactly, nobody does them
ye, no, yes, yes, yes. No, I think this gives energy to this country, all the immigrants. Just look, all the food places where the people from Mexico are working
they get paid
Mhm
little money. Well it's alright for them. But they are
yes
I don't know. At least they have the chance to work, that, that, that in Mexico, and maybe also in our country is difficult enough
So. No, I agree that, to me, it is people we need here, eh, it and is good for the country because it is cheap labor. I was working in construction for some time also
yes.
and all that we are working here, it was eh, Spanish speakers, Latinos, or a lot of Africans as well.
Thing that, that the, the national doesn't want to do. You see? Because, he is too strong, or rather too, this
Sure. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
I, What I have, eh, I consider, for example, okay, the them-, the issue of immigration, how it relates to, they treat the amnesty issue of immigrants as it relates to
the illegal flow that comes, comes to the country.
Mhm.
Eh, that yes, they can, they, can control that about the borders.
yes, yes.
The thing is that there is authority, that clouds the vision, for for, because the traffic, also, eh, is beneficial to them. Right? The traffic of illegals,
Sure it is.
and the, the rest of them.
It's beneficial for them, yes, yes.
But, I would have to say that they can make, the authorities they should make, or, or, the government, of the United States, they should have a, a, this
to not say yeah, that's going to be, this, How I say it you? the right to stay here, that they register, taxes
Mhm.
Right? And, that they let the authorities know that, about what they're doing, the taxes that they give. Eh, the taxes that they could generate for the country.
yes.
and, and the help that this, that this could represent for the economy, well.
I think that now that's the plan. Right? I think now, I don't know, they've told me that, that you've already planned to do something like that, to not swindle the people. Or you know, to not give the citizens, to not give them papers, but
but yes they can pay the tax. But, anyway I don't see it like that either, there are people that are working for many years like  that. I have known a lot of people here
that for ten years, twelve years, they've been working and they haven't been give their papers, five or six years working to get papers. And they are people that are very hard workers and been behaving well day after day.
they've got to make it easier to get papers. Right?
yes. Well, I, I think, I think just like you. Right? As an immigrant, I think that these people
And well, in, in, in two, three years, you realize who is good or bad people, if they're a worker or not, and there you go. And then they have to facilitate getting papers. The other day I was reading in the newspaper
yes. yes.
that yeah if they, if you become a Marine, in four or five months they give you your papers
Really?
Yes if you do, eh, yeah you, if you enlist in the Army.
oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
in four or five months they give you your papers. And, a worker, a laborer, that's working, What do I know? Five years and they get get them
Well, well. Exactly.
It's like that, ah
The, the, the system of, for example, the system that you are talking about, they are there, they are going to monitor
Mhm.
to those, to those persona, and about the taxes, to what, to what kind of problem that gets you into,
and, all that. And with this number, you know, this, those people they can also, eh, report something, some cases of abuse
Oh yeah
or, nastiness like that, that they have the liberty, at least, of that, that they're not going to deport them, or, or that
you're going to have, going to have problems with the authorities. But, at least, the authority, they can monitor these people, without them really have the, the, the,
the rights of a citizen, the rights of a, of a, ah, a resident person
yes
But, that is already on survey, I mean, that has something to do with the, for instance, like me, I was working with a person here in the, in the
about abuse, mm, women's abuse
Mhm
Physical ans mental
Aha
In the, in, this same week, in the same survey
Oh, the system, really?
yes, but, eh, and then she led me to believe that she was a M- Mexican, and she led me to believe that she really
was living that situation
Oh
yes, so she told me, but really there are many people who don't report because we are afraid of
Oh, really?
we are afraid of the system because we are illegals
Oh
So, I told her, where are you from? and she told me, no, I am from California. So, alright, I have been in California, I know the amount
of, mm, illegals there
Oh, yes, right?
The working mass, yes. There are too many, too many, far too many.
Too much, yes, I was being told just yesterday
Them he told me, he told me, yes, there are people who don't report because we have immigration problems, and we are afraid, you know what I mean? Then
Sure, yes, yes
so, I say, with this number, with this social security or with this tax ID, or, how you call it?, this situation of the the person being here and payin his taxes,
he must have some privileges, some rights
Aha
but at least, the government is scanning and knows, he knows where, you know what I mean?
yes, yes, yes, it's alright
Because, because just dropping us like this, because there is no, there is no documents, to
to be abused, also. For instance, a friend of mine worked once in a pizzeria, a long time ago, and the man
yes, yes
worked for a week, that week was left in fund, then he worked another week, he got paid, then he worked another week more, he didn't like it much and he only got paid half salary
Mm, that happens often, right?
the thing is, yes, when he quilted
Oh
the man didn't want to pay him for the time he had worked. So he worked almost two weeks fro free
look
you know what I mean?
yes, yes
So, these people have no support at all, no, no, there is nobody who actually watch over them
Who are they going to complain to?, right
yes, who're they gonna complain to?, so, by fear of, of, of being, of being deported, or fear of, of not having the documentation, they don't make the report, you know what i mean?
Uh huh
And, i have found a bunch of cases like that. I have found a bunch of cases
that's horrible
yeah, once, a boy in a, in a discount store
Uh huh
A beauty, a beauty, uh, a beauty discount, um
Right, yes
He worked there, you know, supplying and putting the, the things in the shelves and for, keeping inventory
Right
And suddenly, he realizes that people comes and steal
Yes
Well, i don't know, he caught two guys that were stealing
Yes, yes
He took their articles and he told them, "look, they're stealing from you", and the owner came and "oh", he thanked him, but the guys were waiting for him outside at closing hour and they beat him up badly, they sent him to the hospital
Oh, look at that
Yes, right, so, the owner was the beneficiary, why didn't he do anything?
He didn't do anything
And he didn't, he didn't do anything, so the, uh, the guys took, the day they gave him the beating, they took his money
Uh huh
And they left him there, they left, they had to send him to the hospital because the man was bleeding there, someone found him
Uh
And, and after that, you know, the hospital sent a very expensive bill
Huge, right?, it was expensive, of course
After that, yes, yes, yes, big, big, after that, uh, every pay day, every pay day, they waited for him outside
Yes
And they stole his money
Oh, he had a really bad time
Bad, because of that situation
Look at that
And, I'm telling you, because he was afraid of, of not, of not, you know, not having where to report that, to the police, anything
He couldn't do anything
He couldn't do anything
He's alone
Exactly, do you understand?, if there's one, if there's one entity that can give them, for example, the tax register, that
that can help them with certain, not cert-
hello Vanesa's speaking from San Diego
yes Rafael's speaking from Vancouver, Canada, nice to meet you
how are you? Is it cold over there today?
no it's nice here we've had some very sunny days and the truth that we can't complain this December, it was the nicest December in a long time
ah how nice
of San Diego I don't ask anything because everything is said, everything is said so Vanessa I eh is like saying I'm going to the table and I know there will be good food in San Diego
in other words you've come here already
yes no I was there a long time ago, I remember and very nice I was traveling I was around all of California from the north to the south I went til almost the border
ah how nice what an interesting trip the truth is that the coast of California is incredible
yes yes is very nice, have you been more to the north?
yes I drove a little after San Francisco but I would like to go for sure that's one of my dreams before moving from here
well here I'm here I'm here by the accent, what part are you from?
eh well I'm originally from Puerto Rico
Puerto Rico aha, aha I bet you don't know where I'm from?
Argentina
very good how how fast are the Argentinians identified eh
ah but what a beautiful accent
eh I"m married, I'm married to a Mexican you know
pardon
and she and she, I'm married to a Mexican
ah
and you tell me that your are in love with the Argentinian accent
yes that is true to me from all Latin American accents it is the most beautiful , it truly is
Is it the most beautiful from all the Latin American accents to you?
yes
well thank you very much, thank you very much from my part because we are around thirty seven or thirty eight millions of Argentinians so
have a little piece of it
yes it is very beautiful
and, how long have you been in San Diego?
since two thousand and one
and are you going to stay there a little bit more time or are you
yes my husband is in the navy in the navy he is a sailor
ah he is ah working like in the navy but lets say you are traveling lets say you are like
he travels a lot yes he travels a lot but this is the base where we are now and if God wants we are going to be here until two thousand and seven
ah so after that he could be transferred to another place
yes before being here we were in Louisiana and I met him there
ah Louisiana and from there, from Louisiana base
yes in New Orleans
so what and where do you like most? I think that you like most California right?
Oh much more
and because New Orleans is not a city, I don't know how it is now but
it doesn't compare
no no is very anyway no no it doesn't tell me much as far as the quality of life
no the quality of life is not good but the only nice thing is that of all the United States I find that it has a lot of history, the buildings from the year one thousand
seven hundred, eighteen hundreds
ah yes yes yes
and you don't find that here in California it has many flavors a
yes
very nice city with eh things from when the French and Spanish were there
sure yes it has a lot of history that's true and speaking of history because I heard at the beginning of the conversation that one of the topics, the topic of the day
the topic of immigration
yes,
and I say well I'm also an immigrant so
sure
I've been in Canada for fifteen years
ah
so I'm already Canadian and I travel to Argentina to see my mother my siblings, nieces and nephews but I've already adapted here, I feel very comfortable, I feel
well like an immigrant right?
yes
and I think that Vancouver where I live is a very cosmopolitan city there are many immigrants well from many parts of the world we all share in some way each group with their
oh, its own characteristics, that's what has made him bigger and I believe that immigration in general, we are talking about a certain type of a more qualified immigration cause maybe
sure
there's people that I mean, are criminals all over the world, no?
yes
and that's something but we are talking about people that have a certain type of idea, of progress or of doing something, to plan something
and I believe they can give so much to the place where they arrive and I think that in our case, we all speak Spanish and of course, English of the United States is our second language
and that implies that this is important because our cultures are mixing and people want to get to know the Hispanics and so on, and so on.
and it happens the same thing here, I think, San Diego, how can I say it?  I think they all must speak Spanish, right? It's normal.
yes, many many Mexicans and I, oh, before I moved to this house where I'm living now, I was living in a city that is near the border and I would walk a mile in the beach and
I would be in Mexico and I was embarrassed because we as Americans or the United States, we can go into Mexico when we want and so, it's not
the Mexicans they, obviously can't come in here as they please and I don't like that.
sure, the problem is that all those controls, I'm no expert in this subject but at least, I see that the situation that we now see in our borders
is that there are many many problems and obviously, that's not positive and it doesn't show a good image of us and I think that the United States wants to change that image
to be flexible about not having to live under this psychosis regarding the immigrants because the immigrants, well, in the end, they were immigrants too, the ones that first got here.
to the United States, they were all immigrants.
yes
so, I don't understand why they now discriminate people if I believe that immigrants contribute or I mean, in general, immigration
it doesn't matter where they are from because each of them has its own culture and its own traditions and languages, but in general,
mhm
I believe they bring growth and a supply of fresh blood to wherever they settle, the immigrants.
yea I agree but and I'm an immigrant too right I I understand wanting to have a better life but so even to what point are they going to open the doors to the United States
because in reality people die every day trying to come here because right everyone wants the better life that supposedly we have here in the United States
well even the point that, even to the point that they could open the doors and it's not really going to affect things too much not just our quality of life here but for people that
that come here too like what's happening in Europe now that they're the European Union is opening their doors to other countries and
this is causing lots of problems
no no uhh I think let's say uh everything's extreme let's say I'd say may it's not the the most opportune thing but I'd have to do things with a certain set of criteria and I say criteria because in Canada for example they have the policy
on organized immigration means to uh that there are lots of them even every year there's even a minister of immigration and they could perfectly well do the same thing here. Does the United States have a minister of immigration?
uh yea I know they have different quotas uh I mean different amounts of people that they allow from each country I really don't know how they choose the different people
but that's that's the green card, you're talking about the green card
but yea uh yea exactly
uh well but that's a lottery what you're talking about
well uh uh unfortunately I don't know exactly what the details are about how things work here but I know that some countries just uh
they only allow a certain amount of people to come into the country uh that every year but I don't know the details now with NAFTA
Mexicans can show that they have a job in the United States and they can come here to work and sometimes to live but on the other hand they can't come in
but from other countries I don't know
I mean but but for example if they have, if they get a job and it's and you come into the country it's for the number of years it's been renewed
right? hello?
yea yea yea
it's been renewed they can't they can't allow yea they've already showed they're people who work that they're here because not because of the opportunity, I don't understand
yea no I agree, I agree
I think I think that I think that eh to put this in a state of xenophobia against foreign is not in general good
besides in America that in general is a country of immigrants of a so nobody can say I have not  drink from this water
so in this aspect we would have too to be a little bit more tolerant and the concept is that the United States should have too a policy
more flexible, there are a lot of people I don´t know how many who are illegal
yes
and I don´t know how many that creates too a very serious problem inside so to find a way that those people who already have or are working and have years, those people
they must have rights because they have demonstrated that they came to work and because don´t so they cannot be chased or been thrown away I think that
I think it would not be fair, you choose the place they cannot forbid because at last the man puts the border
but the world in theory belongs to all we can have we could always have access and when we have good intentions, we are persons eh lets say people without criminal eagerness, terrorists or another things
and well I think that there is where they should put the law and that is obviously they are going to give a renew
to approve in all sense so it is possible in any country, any country
yes
can have a better quality and lets not talk about qualified immigrants so people with a university degree right?
yes yes that
that yeah that yes yes I hear you
if not is is is a very difficult situation because I feel that eh I don´t know I really don´t know because somehow I would like everyone to be welcome
Hello, good evening.
Hello how is it going?, good evening.
Good evening. My name, Shaun, I'm talking from Toronto, Canada. What's your name?
ah, how are you Saun? my name is Paula and I'm in Boston.
in Boston, no, I don't know ah, Boston. I've never gone. They say well that it's a city with a lot of history and of
of a lot of culture. Is it true?
yes, yes supposedly, eh supposedly is like that, here is where all the independence movement of the United States started and it's where the pilgrims arrived
eh, so it is definitely a city with a lot of history, and is a very beautiful city also. How is Toronto?
Toronto is, is, look also, well, right now, I'm here visiting. Well, I'm from Toronto but right now I live in Vancouver there in British Columbia
Ah, they told me that Vancouver is wonderful.
yes, yes is, is wonderful but I returned here to Toronto for Christmas, to visit my family
ah
But Vancouver is well is different now in Toronto there's a lot of snow and is very cold but not there in Vancouver.
no?
no,
no?
a little bit of rain and some days of snow every now and then but, usually, it hardly snows there in the city of Vancouver.
mm
But there are a lot of hills, many mountains, where there is snow, that they are only a little bit far from Vancouver.
yes I, eh, knew a guy who was from Vancouver and he would tell me you could go skiing in shorts
yes? I, I don't understand, I still haven't gone yet. But, I think that, well, for example in, in these months, I can't but, they're there, this
for example, yes, yeah if you take a helicopter and you go to a hill where there's snow all year round yes, yes you can go.
ah yes, no, I don't understand what that was with the liquid but all that but here it's more when the summ- the winter
yes, yes, but up high
yeah, umm ahhhh
well, there's always snow, the snow on the highest peaks. But I wouldn't want to go wearing shorts because
yeah
for example, one fall and
sure, not that. No but I think that he's talking about how warm it is you know that you could
yes
ski or
mhm, yes it does, it's warm and for example, for example in Vancouver it's, for example right no like four, five degrees out
But
yes
eh, a little bit of, for example, one hour outside of the city you go up a hill and there's snow and it's like ten degrees below zero out
yes
yes, it's kind of strange how the climates vary, go just a little but, over well, by the mountains and, and, the and the sea, ocean also
mmhm
there's, this eh, variety of climates
Sure. I, And how come you speak Spanish if you're from Toronto?
Well, eh, I'm part Canadian, part Mexican.
ah, and you grew up in Toronto.
and so yes, from here from, from Toronto. And where are you from?
I'm Argentinian. Address me by "you".
from Argentina, ah.
yes, from Buenos Aires.
aha
mm
There's a desert I believe, I don't know if it's in Argentina of is in Chi- Well, there are parts of Argentina that are, is very closed to the border of Chile, right?
Sure, Chile and Argentina share the border, the Andes.
by the aha, that by the south of Chile there are many, there's a desert there called Atacama, or something like that, right?
and, is not to the north?
no? is not the north?
is not, ah is that, mm embarrassing I'm not sure
ah
yes
I worked, for some that went there to Chile to film, eh, by
yes
the border of Argentina, Chile, they were filming the, the sport of kayak
yes
in the I think is called the river. I believe is very well known
ah, talenfu yes
yes, uh, it's
of Argentina
aha, is from a- but they were in Chile.
ah
But I think that the, the river goes by both eh, sides, right? by Argentina, and, and by Chile.
ah
And it looked well
yes
great, that that is the river of, the kayak and of the white waters.
yes, I tell you, the south of Argentina and of Chile is also beautiful.
yes, which is still virgin land. That not, this is not developed.
yes, yes is true. But also as scenery
mm
is very very beautiful.
yes
So man, and we have to talk about, what do you do? what do you work in?
Ah, I , well, I'm I mean, I'm an actor, ah, artist.
ah, really?
yes Well, actor and, and writer so,
yes
I do several plays, commercials, things like that so, for no, no, well not yet a star, but
sure
perhaps, perhaps someday. But just an actor, because that's my, my career.
mm, and what, what, have you acted in lately?
well, ah soon I come out in a play that's called Tony and Tina's wedding. I don't know if there's in Boston one of those plays, it's call-
mm, Tony and Tina's wedding?
the weekends
yes, ah how nice
yes, there's a lot of, of those well, is like the same play but they do it in different places. Maybe there in Boston, I don't know.
sure
And, and some I did a commercial a few months ago and things like that so. To keep on is, is, is a is a, a struggle so, like any other
sure, right? is also a sacrifice
mm, yes, and are you a student there in Boston?
No, well I was a student up to last year and now, I do cancer research.
ah, are you working for John Hopkins or
No, John Hopkins is in Maryland
ah, Maryland
sure
Is Marylan far away?, but it's more or less nearby, no?
eh, no, Maryland no, it's not too close. I think that by plane it must be like an hour, an hour and a half.
ah ah
Eh, from
and you're in Harvard there or
well, yes I'm in Dayna Harvard which is like it's affiliated with Harvard.
in Harvard, ah.
So I've been working there since April and well, happy.
ah, that's good. And, and what, what eh research are you doing there?
About cancer.
ah, about about cancer. yes
yes So that
yes I- I had an aunt that died of of, of cancer in the lungs
mm
three years ago
mm, I'm sorry.
No, but, ah, well, the most bo- or the best rechers- research that you can do againts lung cancer no sm- is not to smoke, no?
yes it's true, eh, did she smoke a lot?
yes yes, yes she smoked a lot. But never mind. So that eh,
ah
but perhaps one day, well ah, that there are hopes so, for some types of of cancer that
That's why we are working, yes.
mm
And Shaun, eh, I think we have to talk of, of the rent.
yes We have to see, but I don't know, I don't know well, is like they've told me well, the, the organizers of that
of that research that they are doing that is a, is something suggested only, But if, if you want to talk about that
Ah, you don't have to? I thought we had to talk of the topic.
No, is not, is not completely necessary, is for example, they suggest the topic, right? is so that if one doesn't have anything to talk about.
Ah, then you don't have to talk of, let's say, no
yes, if there's nothing else to talk about you can talk about the topic. But
sure ah
they say that is, is only a suggestion.
Ah, well, better. And how did you find out about this program?
yes I saw it on the internet in, in the site of, of Craig's list I think.
Ah, they told me.
You have Craig's list there in Boston?
yes there is.
yes in well in every city there's a Craig's list right? and
yes
and, they said well that they were looking for speak who spoke Spanish and,
yes
only me, I hope it pays. that's the point, you will do your, your twenty-five calls and, mm, then yoy will be left without
I hope not, because I'm talking on my cell phone
nothing
So, I hope they pay
yes, me too. And they said they would pay some extra fifty dollars if you do five calls from five different phones. Did you hear that?
yes I heard that. I have already talked from two different ones. How many did you talk from?
I, it will the fourth, but I'll make the five, for instance I've talked from here in Toronto and my house in Vancouver already. I think I can make the five different places
Sure, yes, I think somehow, and how many calls have you done?
This one I'm doing with you will be number nine already
You are my call number two
Oh, the second one, right?
mm
ah
I just started. I knew through a friend of a friend who had done it
mhm, I see
Eh, but no, I don't know if he had finished and if he had been paid, or how much it takes to get paid, right?
I hope they pay for Christmas, extra money fro Christmas
oh, I hadn't thought about that, that would be nice
yes, me too. Well, but I've heard it takes from eight to twelve weeks once the study is finished
hmm, yes
Until the check arrives. But no matter it has to arrive
yes, sure, let's hope it arrives. Totally
even if it, it arrives
That it arrives just when I have to pay my cell phone bill
yes, yes, me too, fortunately I have a, a phone of, how do you say, how do you sa-, how do you say landline in spanish?
A fixed phone
yeah, where I can talk, but, sometimes I've received a call from, from the cell phone, but it was at night and during weekends, when it's, it's free.
Sure
yes yes
That's the best part. But well, I don't have a
yes
landline. So this is the only way I have
yes, me too, where, where I'm staying, where, in a girlfriend's house, where I am, I'm using her, she lent me her phone, I am
Sure
I make local calls, and, how do you, uh, uh, uh, toll free, how do you say toll free? ah
toll free, I think we don't have those
ah, no?
toll free
no
eh, toll free.
Well toll free, aha.
I suppose. yes, a call, eh free.
aha
Free.
yes and right now is there cold in Boston or is there snow?
There are many - Do you talk about Celsius, right? or Fahrenheit?
Celsius.
Celsius, because  In Celsius, eh, I think we have it is felt like minus seven and there was like minus five
Ah, there is snow too.
is not, eh, no. It snowed when was the last time it snowed? Friday last week.
ah
No,last week it did not, the one before that one. But it was so cold that there is still snow. Then what we have is
a little of snow but there is too much ice.
aha
Then all the houses are covered by ice.
Lets see if, hopefully it will be a white Christmas. Oh, right?
Hopefully. It looks to me that it will not, besides I saw that
Hello, this is Vanesa from San Diego.
Oh, hello Vanesa. My name is Elena and I'm in Miami right now but I live in Boston.
Oh, that's a big change of weather!
That's so true, I just got here and I'm so happy here because the cold in Boston is terrible
yes, I've heard that lately, it's been pretty cold in the East.
Oh yes, we had around eleven degrees and well, not here, my siblings live here and they told me it's cold in here and to me, it's just so good, right?
I, my grandmother lives in Miami and I do like Miami but in my opinion it's to hot.
Sure, it is during the summer, the summer is pretty hot here.
yes, well, I used to live in the South, in Louisiana and the weather there was also hot and humid.
Sure and in San Diego you have like the perfect climate, isn't it?
It's perfect, that's right, it's amazing how pretty it is, right now we have around seventy degrees and during the nights it goes down to sixty
I live close to the beach and we have the same weather throughout the year.
Oh, that's nice,  I sometimes think that, although I have a job, quality life here in Boston is not good because of the weather, right?
Mm, oh, and speaking about today's subject, housing, is housing expensive and hard to find in Boston?
It's quite expensive, sure, you end up living in an old small place with rats. My sister used to live in Boston in a small apartment and the
Mhm.
with rats and nothing, lets say that no, she couldn't have a washtub and spend two thousand dollars
Oh. Oh.
and now here, she lives in a private neighborhood, with two bathrooms, one in each story, it's unbelievable.
yes, it's amazing, here in San Diego it's also like that but I don't know, for two thousand dollars you can get a decent place, I mean, I do think that Boston is more expensive.
Ah, look, yes, no, but the truth that Boston is really expensive.  And I no, the truth, with the topic of today I don't know what to say because
I've been here a year and well, I'm renting and I don't know if I will stay living here, I don't think about buying.
Ah, yes, well, we here, when we came to San Diego, let's say that a house that's two thousand square feel, something for a family of five, pretty comfortable
was about three hundred thousand dollars, and now you can't get, in five years it's gone up so you can't get anything of these size under seven hundred thousand
like the prices have more than doubled in five years.
Ah, yes, I got into, it's amazing how they went up but so, what are you going to do?  Spend your whole life renting?
No, and this money putting it all
yes.
in a credit to buy a house
yes, I prefer to rent because here renting is much cheaper than buying, obviously, the rent is much cheaper and buying isn't on-, I mean
buying isn't only the price, it's the taxes you have to pay and so you have to repair it if something breaks.  I think that it comes out much more expensive
to buy
sure, sure, it's incredible, no?  It's really difficult here, it's really, really expensive
yes but well, you have to pay this, at least here, I know because the climate is so nice and it's such a pretty city, people are disposed to paying this amount of money.
Sure, and how long have you been living there?
Since two thousand and one.
Ah, and where are you from?
eh, originally, well, I was born in Spain and I grew up in Puerto Rico and I'm in Louisiana, in the United states since the eighties.
Ah, okay, ah, wow.  From Puerto Rico so, yes, everything, right
yes.
I talk most to Puerto Ricans.
Are there many in Boston?
I am from eh, How?
Are there many of us there in Boston?
yes, yes, there are a bunch of them, there are a bunch of them.
Ah.
But I say that with this of the telephones, these calls too with the always talked to Puerto Ricans
Ah, yes
but, ah, no, I talked to an Uruguayan I am Argentinian too, I don´t know if you notice it by the accent
yes. yes, yes, I notice it, I have talked with someones from Argentina, from Venezuela, from Mexico I think that one from Colombia. With many. yes, I have been doing this
for a time. And you?
Of course, yes, yes, the true is that it is good, to talk suddenly, right? you get informed about another things, and we earn some money.
yes, yes, it is very, interesting, I have really liked it. And Why are you in Boston?
And I, eh, I made a doctorate in genetics and well, I , I came to make a post-doctorate here in Boston.
Ah, wow.
In an university.
Which one?
In Tufts.
Can you say it?
Tufts University
Ah. yes, yes, yes, yes. Ah, how nice, how interesting, wow.
yes, the truth that
And you don't plan on returning?
And what happens is that I, I've been here a year already and practically no, the climate is not for me. I don't want to live in a place with a climate like that, so
yes, yes, yes.
Boston is not going to be that, I know
yes
later I don't know, I love Buenos Aires my city, my people, but there's no work, and no, and and I already, one here works, is very
easy to buy the reagents and and all and, mm, and over there is very, everything is expensive, and then is complicated to do research and work in what I want.
yes.
But
Well.
Sure. Oh, yes, I hear you.
It's just that, no, I don't know then well and then you are, are thinking of Miami, with your family, perhaps.
And sure, then here, come to a university and since we are here my sister with her husband also are, my nephew, my brother is, so then that's another thing because,
yes oh what happens is, that now I say this, because in summer in Boston is beautiful and the quality of people  and the
no, everything is very cultured and you always talk with someone who studies this, that works
yes.
is very nice, everything super interesting
yes.
but, and in summer you love it, but later it starts the minus eleven degrees, the snow, and that it freezes, that it rains and that and there you remember
how ugly it is, right? and everybody stays home and is a little unsociable, then, the city and the people are sad in winter and
no, it's not worth it to have a good job but to live that way.
No, you're right.
And the houses are small and everything is very expensive for, for everything to be so small dirty, with rats, and how can it be no?
Ah, I didn't imagine things were so bad there.
No.
In that regard.
yes, is that yes, I just rented with a friend an, a very nice apartment without laundry without anything let's say that, ah, I have to climb three floors by stairs because there's no elevator, everything is very old.
yes.
And mm and very nice, in a very nice neighborhood but, it cost us one thousand six hundred dollars
For each one.
and I'm talking of no, no, both, but is an, an apartment with two bedrooms.
Ah.
In the best neighborhood only
For everything fifteen thousand five hundred?
One thousand six hundred.
One thousand six hundred. yes, is a little expensive.
Sure. Without laundry without elevator, without anything. So, but, but well is that one is used to it because is what you see here. You can't imagine that
there can be something better, right? for that money. So then one starts getting used to it, sometimes.
Oh, yes, yes, well, so, then hold on there until you decide what you can do, because you already finished the doctorate and you are doing now in
The post doctorate.
Ah, wow.
Sure, perhaps later already
How interest-
I come here or I would also like to go to California, right?
Mm. yes, is, here is beautiful and there are many opportunities in, in that in the branch of, of
yes.
of biotech and things related to that
And what do you do there?
I work in an employment agency
Ah, look at that.
yes, but originally I was a civil engineer and I didn't like engineering and now I'm working to find people jobs
Sure, the eh, sometimes is good and sometimes no because perhaps someone comes and cries, I don't have a job, no, and it's kind of sad
yes, to me is very sad very, very sad, especially the immigrants from Mexico that come and don't speak English and want to work and don't have the necessary papers and I feel very sad, but is very
is very good when I can find the people a job and that
Sure, sure, yes, sometimes
And is
yes,
And is very interesting, is very interesting and the day flies by, and I like it, and is, I mean, you have to think but you don't have to think that much that I don't get home with a headache.
Sure.
I mean that eh, eh, yes, I like it I'll see if I stay with this, before that, for five years I was teaching.
Ah, and what did you teach?
I taught kids all subjects kids that are home schooled, I would give them Spanish or math classes
Ah.
and I was doing that
Are there a lot of kids that are home schooled and don't go to school?
yes. yes, I home schooled mine for four years
Why did you decide that?
because the schools here are really, not, not so good there's no, they don't provide good education to the kids and there's a lot, a lot of kids who
well, nothing, that I find that the kids are very spoiled, disrespectful and they don't really go to school to learn and I didn't want my kids to be in that
but now that they are in school, they are in a school that we found which is very good and they can be there
Ah, okay and then you would teach them you sat with them an hour a day, that's how you taught them, what did you buy the, the
yes.
book, the same book
yes, yes, and then, eh, I would give classes in my house and other kids also came to learn different subjects, depending and well like that I would make money and they also eh
could be with other students, not just be them only in the house all the time
Ah.
and I liked it a lot.
How fun, yes, that's good.
yes, I learned a lot. I really learned a lot by teaching the kids, I learned more than what I learned in the University, that's the truth.
I always say that the best way of learning is by teaching
yes.
because you have to, you have to understand and think about the questions they might ask so, you end up learning a lot.
yes, yes, yes, not me, I really  like it, all the subjects that I had studied in the University, I learned them and now I can write pretty well, I didn't use to write before
Hello
Hello
Hello, how are you?
hey, oh, hello
hey, we have already spoken right?
I, oh yes, yes, yes, I do recognize your voice, I do recognize your voice
it's good that we get a chance to talk again, oh
you are Juan from San Antonio
exactly, that's right
My name is Lorena
aha Branch
How have you been?
Fine, hey we are now to discuss housing subjects. What do you think? It's a very basic subject, isn't it? It's like they were asking us about food.
or about
Well, yes, what do you think about it? What are the benefits of owning a house instead of leasing?
It depends, I was once told that Jews never buy houses because if you have a lot of money you can lease a big house
for a lot less of money of what would cost you to buy one, build one
Buy one
buy one
aha
no
aha
It is simply a question of money, if you have little money, the impact of the rent on your earnings, on your expenses is very high. If you have a lot of money the impact of the rent is lesser, so that
like always things are relative it depends on the circumstances of each person
of course they are relative to the global income you have, no
in effect
monthly
in a
because it is another illusion to say, well I am going to buy a house and I will take out a mortgage I am going to be paying
well the same that I would pay for a rent to buy my house and I have always think like that like an illusion because anyway I paid and paid and piad
aha
and well in thirty years you would finish to pay the mortgage
in effect
eh, the, the psychological question is always more positive when you say I am paying  for something that is going to be mine. because if you pay a rent there is always the
sensation that you are wasting your money, no
it is like that That could happens but as you say there are thirty years of being paying and paying and paying and if for any reason you fall behind two or three months you lose everything
yes, they can take it out, yes that is such a terrible thing.
then that could be serious, right
hmm
aha the issue turns hard to have a plan
yes, it's, it's a very very serious commitment, if enter enter one and it's also that, no, the largest companies that sell new houses and that have furthermore
their own mortgage company and still no man well they sell you on the house like it's a facility, no, don't worry you won't have to put down a deposit, you won't have to pay closing costs you don't have to pay this, you, you, you enter it
yeah
and even though it's a house that's really pretty big and that at best the payments are going to be high and a pretty big effort for your level
well you enter into it because you're like, like this well deceived by all of the marketing gimmicks that they have you know to sell the house
yeah yes yes in effect that happens yes like always you go with the optimistic outlook that things are going to go great in life and that here the next thirty years are going to continue living and that you won't have any sort of setbacks for the next thirty years
sure you'll have a job, you'll have income, you won't get sick eh, none of this uncertainty for any reason, well yes actually
it's this, it's
well yes
it's double edged sword, right
yes, well it's that anybody could get caught up by this business, I tell you, I always
yes, now on the other hand, in the state of Texas, the price of housing are pretty affordable compared to the other state of , of the union, I mean the United States, not
well this
yeah
well here right now the housing market well it's at a truly impressive peak they are building houses as if they baking bread same house
that they sell I sometime say where are the people coming form that buy so many houses,
yeah yes, it's incredible and that's happening in a lot of places I think there is a large amount of internal immigration and, and international towards here
there's a way that there's a very interesting market for the builders of housing and in general for all real estate. Eh, I imagine for example that like eh
mhm
that's observable, a lot of people come from California and they establish themselves here easily
yes, me too
yes
I have heard that it is at least at half the price of what the houses were costing in California, here in Texas state
yes, I think that, well, I've heard it too and it is much more economic, I mean ,a house here costs, I don't know, hundred and twenty, hundred and fifty thousand, there it may cost
five hundred, I don't know, up to a third part, more or less
aha
so
yes
I guess there is a relation more or less interesting with salaries, with the income you can get in California, because they live much better here, right?
of what they could
aha
living there, and the same in other states or cities
precisely, precisely in these conversations, the other day I talked to a woman from Guatemala who lives in Los Angeles,
she told me that her husband was earning only nine dollars the hour, what means that there is not such a big difference, or that we also have to consider that
there are certain economic areas of the society that are always marginalized, and have more difficulties to reach, ah, those goods
yes, that may be true as well, eh, but well, I think that there is a sector who is in that situation, but I guess, from what I've heard, from other professional areas
in a certain level they earn much more in California than in Texas
mhm
Maybe that person is working-class
yes
unqualified people, I don't know there's a low level of employment and in this case well yes if you get a pretty low salary
yeah
there's no reason for it to be very high, but the professionals they get such a really high salary in California, as I understand it.
well about that question that
and the percentage mhm
and then the question that are making us do they said that there's a little housing bubble here in the region eh what do you think?
well the stats they show that if there is a bubble eh, there is there is a notable increase in prices, fifteen per cent per year in price of real estate
yeah
ah which it isn't a very elevated bubble I think, that's not such a great growth as a high that shot up like what happened in California or New York or other cities
en those well they doubled or tripled in price every year after year in the case here prices they were growing about fifteen percent, to mean that that's an increase
very good for investors, but it's relatively small when compared to other locations, well I guess that some investors  they should of been in California instead of trying to sell something here in Texas
no but it's something important because also the other day
yeah
was reading some news that was indicating that there had been like one thousand almost one thousand five hundred houses available last year that hadn't been sold
to, yes
ah, you know that were here like they had already came the, already, yeah
returning back here
market, it seemed that I no, no, it would be so important as a business but it's not the same situation here in, in this area San Antonio anyway
according to all the forecasters it's going to keep on growing at least for the next four years. Anyway that would seem to yes be good and anyway eh yes if there had been an inflation bubble with the housing prices on a national scale
a lot of people discovered here that this area is growing and is going to keep on especially, because of our region's economy more people are going to keep arriving even though it's so spread out
it go slow, right
hmm, hmm
and it is a growing that will spend another four years not with the actual tendency
aha
if they do not stop it in four years this is growing. that is the point while on average across the country the prices have stopped.
on average, like in another regions, no, that could be growing
hmm, hmm
average How does it looks to you?
well yes, very, very interesting eh, is, however is also very interesting that for example compared to other countries, lets say Mexico eh, the cost of a family house here
is inferior to the cost over there in a country with less economical development, no then this
exactly
well always is contradictory and interesting
in effect it looks like that this situation of the housing this reflex many is a general condition of the economy when in some places it looks like they have lower prices, they have higher
hmm
at last those are surprises. things of the market
hmm
but but as it is said, there are some capitals that define and move the things in a way that they are always try to earn, the big ones, no
in this case I think that well the way the big companies are building here, it means that the signals are, good for the region.
Must always be aware, to see what the big ones are doing so the small ones
yes
ones can do something, mm
on the other hand
James, from New York
Hello, yes, who am i talking to?
James from New York
Oh, how re you?, you're talking to George, also from New York
Hi, how are you?
Fine, thank you, what else, what do you think about the subject?
Uh, first of all, i don't understand what's that bubble that's
oh, i imagine we're the same, i really don't know, i imagine that's like sudden elevated prices or something like that, i really don't know
Um
they, they surprised me with that term
Yeah, because it depends on the area, it depends on what house you're thinking about, in which area, because if you go to
yes
North Carolina, you can find a house for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars, that's a mansion
Um
Right?, if you're here in New York, it's rare to find an apartment there on the Bronx
Um
for that price, do you know what i mean?
Yes, uh huh
Uh, to me it's important to have, uh, like i said, a piece of a house
a property hmmm
or a property, yes, because really with the housing prices going up, and the most important for, for example, for my
yes
that like I told you, eh, after you, sure, after you, after you, indenti- indip-, how do you say?
independence
are independent from your parents or are independent you have, you have to look for a way to find a property, a housing for, and you know when this
what you think changes this has a value and
but like an investment or like
that like, yes, like an investment and to live also because with the prices in New York
the rents
the rent is really expensive
yes, what they ask, hmm
you know, so you have something like a a strong
but what do you think of the costs of maintaining an apartment, a house here in New York
because yes, yes, you start to think you can pay for an apartment we'll put, to say, a price of two hundred thousand
two hundred thousand dollars to say the cheapest, a good apartment more or not in a very good area but two hundred thousand dollars, eh, a maintenance, let's say
five hundred six hundred dollars and we'll put a mortgage that puts you in total and a thousand, five hundred dollars a month.
hmm
between maintenance, the rent right now for this same apartment you will pay around one thousand eight hundred, one thousand nine hundred to two thousand dollars
yes
understand?
mhmh
when you stop paying, the place is no longer yours, you must leave, and find some other place where they will charge you the twenty percent of what you were paying before
yes, I show apartments for a company called Manhattan Apartments
yes
here in New York and let me tell you, honestly, there are no properties for rent, eh, in a good area, a good place for less than
let's say, mm, two thousand three hundred, two thousand, two thousand five hundred, for something decent
yes, in what area?
what you find for less are mouse holes, something that, that is not, is not worth, it's not, it is profitable, but it is not worth it
yes
not worth it, it is not worth it, you know what I mean?
yes, I have seen apartments around here for one thousand six hundred but in houses, almost basements
yes, yes, exactly
this kind of things, and the average for one room is about one thousand two hundred, one thousand four hundred, almost
yes, I
I am talking about Queens, I don't know, in Manhattan it is much more expensive
there there are some on that price, you can find some more, but really, in Manhattan at least, there are no
no in Manhattan it is impossible
there aren't, there aren't, it doesn't exist
we- I have an apartment with an stable rent, but that is really hard to find
aha, Where do you live in what part?
no I live here in Manhattan
in Manhattan yes but that is like
two bedrooms
that as you say is a privilege
yes because next door, the same apartment cost almost two thousand dollars
you see
in the building next door that, that they fixed up not too long ago, they remodeled it
okay
but not the rest, the common, no forget it, if you go downtown sectors like this are very expensive mm yes
yes, so then let's say that you, well that you don't have the luck of having this apartment
yes
you yes you have, for example I managed to get an apartment by the grace of God
hm
eh the apartment right now is valued for let me see, one, two, three, four one, two, three, three times the price that I paid
Where do you have the apartment?
I have an apartment in Iverdale, I don't know if you are familiar with that area, the street is called Lakeview the apartment is lakeview that would be like two hundred sixty four by there
mm yes Yes, the advantage of having a property is the appreciation, really
but the yes, the apartment when I bought it two years ago
yes
I paid fifty thousand dollars for the
mm not but any, any apartment right now cost almost four hundred thousand dollars, no.
right now the apartment yes, the apartment, right now is valued in one hundred eighty
no I think that more, how big is it?
is big is big remember that
yes I think it's worth more
remember that is yes remember that the more uptown you go
mm
the bigger the apartments are
yes mm
then eh, with that
no but with two hundred thousand you don't find an apartment here in New York, nor in the Bronx nor anywhere.
no, no, you hardly can
very hard mm
you can find it, but hardly, no
last four years I think it has increased
aha
tremendously mm
then
tremendously
by you having a property for example you feel calmer that the property is yours
mm
if you have any sort of problem you can put in on the market to sell it
I am, I'm very scared to buy especially in a condominium of a building
you see and get money out of it
I don't know how people respond with the maintenance fees and all those types of things. Because here any repair is very costly, let's say that it gets damaged that it gets damaged
yes
one of those things, if the people are not responsible uh
mm yes but when for example if you have a house at least
mm
that's more more dangerous still
ah no of course and the inspectors and that it is in bad conditions and that
yes when you have a house for example
mm
the oil which is very expensive, a repair like you say
the water
you already when you have a house are every week inside home depot buying and that
yes,
you know you spend money you understand me, when you have an apartment for example the maintenance is fine eh the repairs are done through the
the board
mm
eh, the apartment does have good funds, what you have to worry about is that they don't decrease too fast
yes I think that
and
I think that the key, key here in New York, that's what I've learned, that in my country is very different what I've learned is that if you have a good management
set, but if you don't have good management in that building
aha
you're dead mm
yes you are,  you're right
the insurances
you're right
maintenance obey the construction laws
for, for example a friend of mine bought an apartment also in Brooklyn like two years ago.
mm, yes
and he bought it in fifty thousand dollars
yes
the day he bought it let's say, that the day he bought it, the day of the closing.
business ah
the business yes, the eh came a person from a co- a real estate agent
yes
and come and say that if he wanted to sell the apartment, because he had sold one down
yes
and even, he had showed it to some people, then the other one who didn´t buy it
hmm yeah
got interested and then wanted, was looking for one in the same building
yes
and offered, two hundred sixty thousand dollars
how come
can you believe it, two hundred sixty thousand dollars
yes hmm
aha
right now the same thing is happening, I was reading that in new Jersey is happening the same in New Jersey where the people is selling and the next day the one who bought is wining two hundred thousand dollars
aha, in all, not in all places too because I have a friend
no, no it depends of the area
yes I have a friend in Arizona
hmm, ah it is not that it is very cheap right now
yes but eh
everybody is going there
aha, he, he bought a house in two hundred fifty thousand dollars
hmm
But only bought the plans, you know, of those houses that
uh huh
that they tell you how it's gonna be
Yes, yes, uh huh
And in three, four or five months the house is ready
Yes
Well, in, in six months, the hose was supposed to be ready
right?
And they stalled a little, because re-financing, it seems that people wasn't buying homes a lot
Yes
But when the house was ready
What's it gonna do?
Yeah, he sold it
There, yeah, a lot of people are taking them there, it's very quiet, i don't know what that is
Yeas, and he went to Vegas, he ended up going to Las Vegas
yes
That, with that money, look, with three hundred, i, with four hundred and fifty thousand dollars you get a mansion there that you can't almost buy here, but you can there
Yeah, no, it's very hard here, and you really need to know where to buy
Right, uh
Yes, i was looking at that for two months, but no
For this I tell you, that always, for me it's important that you will make a home, even if at the beginning you are going to be a little bit
because I, I'm going to tell you, if I already have a man with a large family
of course
I grab it and sell the property that
yes
and I go and take this money and put it into a Downpayment or on a large property
yes, mm
then the payments are going to be more comfortable
yes
then anything is going to be more comfortable, I'm not going to put all the money into the property only that I take it and leave it in, leave a
a part in the bank in case of an emergency. You see
of course, to quit, give it
but that if you have a property, that's what I'm saying, like if you have the luck to have an established apartment
it's very economic, mm.
it's economic, but I've seen people that are paying a, look, right now, the hundred, hundred and fifty, there is one, one uncle of mine that his neighbors pay three thousand dollars in rent
if it is going to be, not everything is impossible now
if then
many people are taking to the Bronx because people are leaving because they can't pay
and it's for this reason that the, I mean for Manhattan, we are doing it in Manhattan, let's say right now for, I tell you, for the, the number of people that I have showing apartments
yes
Hello

Hello. Hello, good evening.
Good evening, Aurelio from Washington -DC
From Washington -DC. My name is Sean, I'm calling from Toronto, Canada.
Toronto, Canada. A pleasure, What's your name, again?
yes, Sean.
Sean. How are you?
yes, Fine, it's a little, cold here. There's a lot of snow. That's why I came. Well, I, now, I live in Vancouver, British Columbia.
Aha.
But, I came for, for the vacatio- well, I came for Christmas. To, to Toronto, to visit family here.
Ah, how nice. Where are you from originally?
Well, I'm, I'm from Canada, well, I'm half, half Canadian and half Mexican.
Ah, okay-
And, I was born in Toronto, but I lived in, in Mexico and in Canada, and right now in Vancouver, so. And I came here to, to visit, the race, so.
Exactly. I mean, spend the vacations over there.
yes, and where are you from?
I'm originally from Venezuela, from Caracas, Venezuela.
From Venezuela.
Aha, yes.
They say there are a lot, they say that Venezuela has, is the, the capital of beauty pageants.
Ah, sure, yes, They say is one of the most beautiful in the world.
They said yes, I say that there are, there are, many of them win, right? The, the  Miss Universe, the
yes.
they are from Venezuela but, it is true that many have surgeries to
No, that rarely happens unless she's an actress or something, but, if she's not, then no
Oh.
No, no, no, it might be pretty common nowadays, isn't it? With
Plastic surgery, aha.
yes, well, yes but, no, not so much, yes
Oh.
and so, where would you like to go on vacations?
Well, I, I'd love to go to Europe because I've never been there, I've traveled through Canada and the United States,
O-
and Mexico but not Europe, I still have to travel there, Europe, and always, oh, it's like, oh, well, like they say, it's, it's, it's the old world.
Sure, the old continent, sure, yes, yes.
Aha.
Oh.
I'd like to but, last night I was speaking with one of my friends who was in London
Aha
he was showing me his, his pictures of London and, and,
Did you like them?
aha, yes, It has always, grabbed my attention, more, England, and England and Ireland, also.
Ah, how nice, yes.
yes, more, more than, I mean, also, France and Spain, but more, well, ah, for, for a single trip, it would be too much, to know all of Europe. Right?
Sure. No, yes, I can imagine, mm.
yes.
Well, for me, I tell you, me, I've been in Europe many times. I've been in,
And you?
not too long ago, precisely, two weeks, two weeks ago, we arrived from Italy my wife and I. We spent a week over there. In March we were also in Italy, again. I was in France.
And, I've been in England, also, in London, for example. London I think that it is, the capital of the world.
Mm.
They say New York is. No, no. Not true. I tell you already, that that's a big lie. London is the city.
London.
That's the city of the world.
Ah.
There you see things that you don't see anywhere else. I mean, is something, eh, a city which culture is always awake twenty four hours,
restaurants of all types, people of all types. Mm. I mean, is an incredible thing. It can't really be described with words. One, the people have to be there to,
To know, and,
exactly, to, to see it.
and realize, what it is, so,
Exactly, yes, yes.
culture, yes, I remember being, mm, reading the, the problems they have nowadays in Paris, with the mm
Oh, with the
the, the Muslims, well, the
Sure
But they say, well, that it has nothing to do with being a Muslim, that it is related to, noth- nothing, eh, for instance, kids who have, mm
whose fathers don't take care of them, mm, who don't have two parents at home, and are only into the culture of
violence and rap music, and all that
Sure, mm
And so
yes, well, it's horrible what happened there. Mm, it is a real shame for the French
aha
yes, specially them who, you know, pretend to be an open, peaceful and civilized culture, and look what they went into!
Aha, yes, yes,
yes
No, mm, I don't know Paris either. But, mm, I've heard that, well, that it is just like it looks like in the postcards. Or you see, well, many African people who went there
mm, who went there as refugees. Eh, apparently they are all hidden in the outskirts of the city
Sure. Look, when I was in France, eh, you can see a lot of blacks, certainly. But not more than in London, let me tell you.
Ah
It's the same, I would say it's the same. I, that's what I saw, you know what I mean? Maybe it was my, I mean, I was several days in France, in Paris specifically. We stayed in Paris for more than two weeks
Aha
and I have also been in London for one week. MM, but I think it is rather, mm, I don't know. I think it was a junction of things
of many negative things
Aha
in ,in Paris, definitely. MM, because in London there also many black immigrants. From Africa, specially from the countries where
Engalnd, well, was the, was the colonizer. And the same with France
Mhm, yes
But I think that they are, it is also a part of the problem of, you know, those immigrants haven't had any chances
Aha
You know what I mean? MM, and I think that the English have been, let's say, the only country that has colonized and has let, somehow, that the country's culture,
for instance in India, em, as you can see the Indian culture, the Hindu culture has always maintained
MM, it was never destroyed, you know what I mean?
Aha, yes
Mm, they didn't, the English didn't do like it was done in this country, right? where they really destroyed the so called indians, because here in this country
Aha
Mm, it didn't happen in other countries, no, I don't know why actually. But I think it is a part of the problem that France had
and Spain had, also, when the Spaniards where the colonizers
Aha, so, then
They went, right, they went to destroy Mexico, figure
yes
Mm, and, even nowadays I don't think that Spain makes many concessions to the Latin American immigrants
There are, so, eh, immigrants that go from, from Latin America that go to, to, to live in Spain. Are there many?
See, there are many Venezuelans
Aha.
that have gone there, And, because, well, I have known, in the years after second world war, there were many Spanish that went to Venezuela as immigrants.
Then, of course, that people was set there in Venezuela, had children in Venezuela, business and all that stuff. And then, well, in some way they are related to Venezuela.
Aha.
And, of course, the children of Spanish born in Caracas, or in Venezuela, or in any part of the country, have relatives in Spain. Then, they have to, you know, traveling
round trip. Now, the last I knew was that Spain, now is requiring a visa to all Venezuelans to travel to, to Spain.
To Spain?
Yes, and it was not like that before. Before, ah, Venezuelan citizens could travel to Spain without needing a visa.
Hmm.
And, now they are requiring the visa.
It could be because many of them went there and stayed, or nothing else, well, are there, are there?
I could not tell you. But, that, there are, I come again to that issue, Spanish have not given, lets say, plenty of opportunity to immigrants,
so, to Latin American immigrants. Do you understand me?
yes.
I don´t think so. They have never give an opportunity to anyone. I think because what I see, that Spanish culture is a very closed one, since,
since they, establish as a Catholic State,
Aha.
since the 1400 and so until, until Franco, remember they expelled all the Muslims, all the Jews
Oh your God, aha
all those things
yes
After Franco failure, after Franco was gone, it was when they opened them a little bit.
Aha
But, the same, the culture, I think is still closed. It's not, like English people. Do you understand me? English people is a little more opened.
yes, ah, on the contrary, what's its name? the phenomenon I say, the multiculturalism. This, has worked, has worked against, ah, ah, against the, their, the system in Eng- in. there in England because, also
Right
the, the, the in immigrants remain closed, hm, no, I don't know, I don't know, no, no, there's no, I don't know, there's no, ah, the , what, how do you say?
Ah
They don't assimilate
Aha. They don't assimilate, aha
Exactly, yes
And there it grows, for example, there, there is an example that the, the, the terrorists, there, of Al-Qaeda, have grown there in England that
Aha
they have the mosques there where, where they go and say, well, that that, that is too much, hm, the eh, the, the po- and, and, they take the poverty as an excuse to look for
their soldiers, well, in that war of, of terror, that exists.
supposedly yes, yes, yes, yes. You know what, what other thing I saw in England? Well, that, well, I don't know, but, we, we diverted from the topic a lot, because supposedly they were vacations. But, when I was in England,
well, I discovered that, that there exists, actually, races mix. You know that here in the United States they say we are,
American people say, that this country is a, a blending pot, literal translation, melting pot
Aha. It doesn't matter, aha.
And really, this is not a melting pot, if you compare it with England for example. Here we do have lots of groups.
yes.
The blacks are with the blacks, the Chinese are with the Chinese, the Japanese are with the Japanese, the Hispanics with other Hispanics.
yes, it's the same as in Canada, aha.
Exactly. It's hard to see them mix, do you understand? You watch a commercial, for example,
¡Hello!
¡Hi!
¡Hi!
Hi, my name is Solanne
Hi Solanne, I'm Solanne [Alicia]
Oh, Alicia
How are you?
Fine, thank you, and you?
I'm fine too, here in Atlanta, Georgia
In Atlanta, I'm in the Bronx, New York
There, hell, it's cold there, isn't it?
Yes, yes, yes
Oh, i think so
yes
It's a little cold here, but nothing so terrible
Ok, it's not as cold there as it his here right now
Usually no, i mean, likewise, obviously in the winter it's quite cold
yes
yeah, but for starters, it almost never snows, so that's already good
Ok, i thought i was mistaken, i thought it was the opposite, i thought it was colder, uh, here than
mm
that, there, that here
Ah, no because we are more to the south
But yes, the other day someone told me, no, no in Atlanta is not as cold is like
Sure but also is not as nice as in Florida that like is never winter there, then
Ah, yes, Okay Then the topic we have today is, eh
The trips.
The trips, well
Precisely
Precisely
And now you, Wouldn't you like to go to where is not cold? That's where I would go.
Sure, where is not cold, because I'm from a tropical country, I'm Dominican
Ah, yes so
And I like, I like my heat
yes is true. And there in the, in the Caribbean, how did people live? like there's never winter Right? or no?
yes, eh, never, is never winter, like here there's no winter but is very, very mild only a little cool, a little temperature there but no very little, you can wear normal clothes, what you wear here in summer.
Sure, Good, because spectacular
In fact is not winter, for the winter here, no, is never winter there
Luckily
mm
Yeah, right?, it's like, uh
Yeah, right?
The other place i would like, uh, i would really like to travel everywhere, i have been in China, i have been in Egypt and I've been in South America, in Europe, so
I really love travelling
Oh, yes, that's good
Um, the part i would go to now, i would love to go to Bolivia right now
To Bolivia, yes
Yes, because a lot of interesting things are happening now regarding politics
Like what?, OK
So, i find that very interesting
Ok, ok, i would like to go to a place that's not too far away, because first of all, i don't like planes
Oh, really?
I don't like planes too much, but i would like to know, uh, another place
Uh huh
But that's near and easy, because I'm lazy, lazy
oh, sur-. sure, sure
I like to travel, i like to know, but i don't like
the effort, lets say
No, planes, planes, i don't like them because... many hours
No, yeah, it's true, it's a bum, and, where have you gone that you liked, i mean?
I haven't, i haven't, i have gone to another Puerto Rico, an island that's near Santo Domingo, but no
Sure
Another country, just here, the United States
Oh, yeah, i mean, and you don't care much about planes, lets say
Right, i would like to meet, for example, i have a curiosity with like Jerusalem, those places
Oh, yes
Uh
anyway
But, it's pretty far, and i would like to know Europe too, but i would have to throw out the
Sure
the fear towards planes a little bit
It's true, yes, it's terrible
Yes, my brother has invited me to Europe a lot, he, regularly, my brother travels regularly
Brothers?, oh
In his vacations, he goes to Europe and all that
Oh
And he's invited me several times but
It's not that
I still haven't decided, i can't, i haven't decided
Like if someone invited me to Europe, I'd be happy
Yes, he tells me you're going to love it if you go
And yeah, where does he usually go?
Uh, England
Oh, yeah
He visits several places there, you know, because he does love to travel, he loves it
Yeah, good, to me, the truth, planes do, for example, i go back to Chile approximately every two years because i am originally Chilean and i have family
You're Chilean
Yes, and i have my family there, so every two years or so i go there, but the plane trip is awful because
Since they go through the Caribbean and the famous Bermuda Triangle
OK
There are always horrible storms, so you're there in the plane and the whole plane moves like that, horribly, and, oh, you get very nervous, horrible, like that
¡Hi!
Uh, it's like, I'm getting a call here
Oh, right
How's the temperature in Chile?
It's very good, Chile is something like, i don't know if you know, it's a very long country
Yes, yes
So it reaches many geographical areas, so in the north
Uh huh
It has, yeah, it has a desert that's like an absolute desert
aha
And there's where it's hot but at night is a crappy cold. Because there are no, there are no clouds whatsoever
Okay
to cover, so then there it almost never rains and that's true; then in the the central area is like really moderate I mean there's a like hot winter,
but dry
mm mm
and I mean, not winter I mean summer, summer is really hot and is dry but in the winter is like it rains
mm
and, and is, is like
Okay
will get to zero degrees
mm
Celsius I mean thirty two degrees Fahrenheit but it doesn't, doesn't get too cold but then going more to the south
yes
it already starts to get cold and for example I lived in a city that's near the Antarctic even
mm. Okay
And there it was horribly cold, it even snowed like for three straight months, it's something horrible
Wow
Sure,
Wow
So then there's like everything, that the
yes, yes, yes
interesting thing of Chile, but
Eh, is like Colombia
Colombia
I think that Colombia has, yes it has those, those same characteristics, that it has parts that are cold, parts that are mild, other parts there
yes,
in the mornings is a little cool, then is cold at night
Sure, It must be that, that makes sense. Oh, they say Colombia is a beautiful country and I haven't gone
yes, they tell me is beautiful also
unfortunately
give me a second, give me a second Oh, I don't know who's calling there. Eh, What did you say your name was?
Alicia.
Alicia, right Alicia

yes, yes
Eh, Okay, then How many years have you been living here in the United States?
Oh, I would say that, fifteen years already
Hello Fifteen years yeah, okay
Then since I was eleven
Oh, yeah,
yes,
But then you have travel a lot for your age Alicia
Is that I am very interested in traveling and so people that, have asked me, how do you travel so much, And I, I am the kind of person that
yes
I never buy new clothes, and never buy an I pod and things like that,what I do is to save all my money and
Okay
and then I go on a travel,
Okay, okay, perfect, I do all the oposite
Of course
I buy a lot of unnecessary things
Of course
Like clothes, shoes and stuff like that
Sure
And, and i travel, yeah, i travel a lot, but to my country
Sure, i mean, oh
Not, not to another place, i go two or three times to my country, i have been there four times this year
Oh, that's very good, and, uh, you have
And yes, i have my family there, i have my daughter here
Uh huh
And all my brothers live here, my dad and my mom lived here and they went to live to Santo Domingo again
Oh, they have gone back
But yeah, they retired

Oh, of course
I always go to them, i have been there four times already this year, i wanted to go again in December
Lets see, wow, until Easter, of course
but yeah, but because of the money thing, like i said to one of the questions, if money wasn't a problem
Is true.
I would've gone again to Santo Domingo.
mm
My daughter is going now, to spend the new year, thirty first in December
She's going over there, how nice
She will be over there, not me
Sure, is, is even if perhaps you had the money, perhaps you would even live in Santo Domingo
Of course,
I tell you immediately, if I had money I would live in Chile, I don't
Sure, Sure, sure, sure, nothing like your country, your land If I had money I would live there
Sure, is like that, unfortunately that happens like that But no sure I like to travel I mean the last trip I made was to Egypt, it was last year, it was in June
To Egypt, wow. Egypt sounds interesting.
Sure yes, it was
Ah,
But oh it was hot it was one hundred thirty degrees.
Wow
Fahrenheit, one hundred thirty in the desert and we were also in the river, in the Nile
In the Nile
The Pyramids, all, all the typical stuff
yes the Pyramids, yes that must be really pretty really interesting
yes
You are, are eh, motivating my curiosity
yes, And, and nowadays is very easy to travel, I mean is something of Look it could be I mean well the same, eh, three thousand dollars Perhaps is a lot of money but is not
so much so to speak, I mean one can save up and, and
Okay
you can find a tour to go to any part of the world, I was seeing they were offering some what is it called some promotions for cruises
aha aha
by and, by Asia, South America, by Europe, by all parts and All those
okay
what is it called they were offering ah, For one or two thousand dollars one could be Eh, let's say two three weeks in a, in a ship like that, traveling all over, or Asia, or Europe, or anywhere.
Listen how good, how good,
so is really easy to do so to speak. But is also a matter of time is the other
yes,
For example I have now been, I'm in a relationship now let's say. And, and ah, that's why I haven't been able to travel much
mm yes, yes
For example this year I haven't gone anywhere
Okay, what do you work in Alicia
Well I was working in the Atlanta newspaper before, Atlanta Journal Constitution in what refers to, to Advertising but I quit not too long ago and I started doing things

ah yes
aha accompanied by my family and
why?

I don't know it's been one of my biggest dreams, more than anything because of the history that I've heard, eh
yes I lived there nine years
Pardon?
let's see, I lived in Israel nine years
oh yes,
yes, I just arrived from there, in fact
aha I would like to visit another country which is Spain but sometimes your financial situation doesn't allow it, no
yes
and yes
the truth, you are a believer
Pardon?
Do you believe in God?
yes of course
And because you would really like Israel a lot
aha
is very emotional for the people I mean all the believers and
mm
for religious people in general
mm
all the religions and the history is very nice
yes it has been one of my greatest dreams to visit Israel, but eh more than anything I'm giving time for my daughter to grow a little more because she's one nine months old
ah how little,
mm
like that she can also enjoy
yes then
and  your daughter was born here
yes it is one of my biggest dreams, and save most of all for a trip of those
of course much money

yes, aha
And do you have family besides your husband here in Los Angeles?

they are helping you right
only we three live here in a place named Vallejo
an no the truth is that I don´t know it, still not
aha, yes it is very near San Francisco, California
don´t travel if
San Francisco [is also] a very nice place
Yeah, and what are you doing there?
Oh, I'm mostly here because of my family, lets say because of my husband, right?
Yes
Uh huh
Because he had to come here on work
Yeah, on work
Uh huh, and what, what does he do?
So we have had to travel a lot, mostly, we've traveled to Honduras
yes
to Nicaragua
Wow, is it nice?
Oh, yeah, i liked it
Uh huh
Because it's part of Central America, right?, part of my places
Yes, yes, sure
Yes, i did like it, but the places I'd like to meet would be Spain, and Israel, my biggest dream is to meet Israel
And, is there many people from Guatemala that go visiting to Nicaragua and Honduras?
Uh, yeah, there's a lot of tourism over there
Uh huh
hmm there are many tourist over there
And in matter of money, is Guatemala, Nicaragua and Honduras more or least the same currency exchange? Are they similar or is one more expensive that the other one?
the, lempira is the currency of Honduras, that currency is the more
hmm
degraded you could say it is not worth much so
yes
Guatemala´s currency compared to that of Honduras is much better the change
of course
aha and now in Nicaragua the most widely used is the dollar
ah, yes
hmm, it is like in El Salvador, now they changed the currency to dollars and the Cordoba was from there, the Colon now is the
yes I knew that it was like that in El Salvador but didn´t know it was the same in Nicaragua.
aha, lets say that the most widely used is the dollar because it is the most worthy currency, right
of course
hmm
ah
yes so we have four years of being here in the city of Vallejo
yes
one season and to travel after that to travel again, so I have satisfied my wishes of traveling, right
ah good it is fine
but now as a tourist I would like to go to Israel mm
yes eh, ah that, in Israel is nice because there's no winter, I don't know how it is there where you are at but here in Boston is too cold
Here is raining, yes it's already been raining for a week
and in Israel there's, no ah no at least there's sun but is very cold
mm
and in Israel the winter is very, very short of one or two months
mm
and one can travel from April until November that it never rains
oh how nice
it will always be a nice day and is, is very nice and the evenings are very nice also
mm And which would be the place that you would like to visit or how?
and I um think that Polynesia, I don't know it was always a dream of the beautiful beaches
mm
but in the Caribbean, I've also never been there I don't know eh, Guatemala that - The beaches are nice right?
yes there's a lot of eh Mayan culture
yes
mm And what's the obstacle, so that you can travel to those places that you would like to
and and the money and the time
mm
eh also is too far, Australia, New Zealand is too far
oh
so, I don't know if here there are flights eh, I mean if living in the United States you would have to go up to California which is quite far from Boston
mm
and from there a trans-pacific trip which is called
mm
they are very expensive
oh yes is true
those tickets but I imagine that at some moment from here to thirty years when we are old
possibly
yes, when we are retired
oh yes,
And in Guatemala is Antigua?
antigua Guatemala, there are the ruins
yes
there's a place that is called they call it the Saculeu ruins is a very beautiful place but cold enough
yes
there are many ruins, there's a lot of Mayan culture, eh the truth is nice
because I, I read a book from a Chilean writer, Marcela Serrano
mm mm
and it's called Antigua my love
mm
the book and it talks of old, and I felt very much like going to visit, it looks
is very beautiful there's a lot of tourism there, yes everything is expensive, because of the demand from so much tourism and all that
sure sure
everything is very expensive there
and the tourist treat the locals good?
yes
yes
more than anything the ones that visit old Guatemala are the Americans
mm
there you will see Americans with their backpacks, I call them on their back
yes
and as if they were from that place there, very
adapted
aha, yes

yes And do you miss the Guatemalan food?
no, I make it here, I find here everything they have over there
ah yes you do find everything
yes
ah but how nice, and what
aha I prepare the tamales and all that, eh
ah and the tamales, but don't you need fig leaves? no, not figs, corn husks
of bananas eh we use banana leaf
ah because in the, in the north of Argentina they use corn husk
of banana, I don't know what you guys call it oh
for the tamales
is the leaf, How is that leaf?
is a thin leaf as if it were eh, you know the corn? the corn, that you eat
aha oh is different
is like the leaf that covers the corn
ah okay, yes the Mexicans use that leaf a lot to wrap their tamales
ah well it must be from there then
aha, yes
And, what filling do you put in the tamales?
eh yes we cook the dough and in the middle it has meat, mole
mm
a little gift that I call it
And tapioca? tapioca is like a, like a potato
Oh, that too, but they use it more on the Nicaraguan and Honduran tamal, they call it "nacatamal"
Oh
nacatamal
nacatamal
Right, the Nicaraguan and Hondurans call it like that
Yes, and, does your daughter like it?
I make it a lot here, i mean, i have met, i have met lots of people from different places like that, through the sales
Yes
Right, so, i have met a lot of people through the internet, that's where i travel mostly to places to meet, usually to a place, i still go to the internet and then i imagine I'm there
Oh
Right, so yeah, they're some of the places i would like to visit, and i hope some day god will help me with
Yeah, it'll work out, it'll work out
the economic thing, so that my daughter can meet other cultures, other things, right?, uh huh
Yeah, sure, unfortunately I'm not there, but i could have taken you in
Right, thank you
If i had gone to Israel

And, and that, don't you eat like a special kind of meat, like some chili or...?
Yeah, that's more in Central America and in Mexico, yeah, they  use spicy things a lot
Yeah, and they don't in Guatemala
eh yes but is different the, the way of preparing it with the Mexicans, my husband is Mexican
ah
and I had to adapt to his customs
uh And you like the tacos and those things that they eat in Mexico?
mm the truth is that I'm on a diet, I don't eat a lot but yes at the moment that I ate them I liked them but too much fat
And ah your daughter what do you think she's more Guatemalan or Mexican?
mm no that one is more Mexican than
and will she talk with your accent or with your husband's accent?
I don't know since here they are other customs no, than in our countries
sure
aha
And do they have a big Guatemalan community, where you live?
yes there's a lot by here
mm and
mm I mean that I don't feel so out of place, yes
sure, you have friends from Guatemala
yes, the majority that buy tamales from me
yes that, that's the best, to feel accompa-
yes aha here in Boston I've been like some eleven years
wow it's been a long that you live here in
aha yes I liked it a lot
Have you been living here in the United States a long time?
eh yes I'm going on, twelve like fifteen years already
wow wow yes Boston is, is nice but is very cold
then is cold because the little times we spent there it was too, too cold
yes, yes
we passed by Las Vegas, a beautiful place at night, I liked that place a lot
yes
that since that time, since that time I haven't gone there again until now for the new year we might go to
wow how nice and
ah aha, to wait for the new year over there
And you go to the casinos?
I like the casinos a lot
hm
but all the money, is what makes everything
yes the truth is that I don't like to bet because I'm scare of losing the money
no, no, I'm not the type that will stay without anything because I like to play like twenty dollars, but yes I've always had luck when I play
ah great
aha those two years that they made the dinner for my husband from his job, we've always won, this year we won an organ, last year we won a
yes
-DVD player
wow how nice
I mean that we have been lucky in that But yes, it would be nice to know other cultures, I like a lot that of the cultures
yes and well you have to go to Israel, the truth is that culture is different, is like is a culture like from Middle East, kind of rough
mm mm
eh but the historic places are beautiful
mm
and there's a lot of contrast between each city
mm
in other words one goes to Jerusalem and is a historical culture and
mm
the architecture the city old something that you can't believe
yes and
hello, oh, this is Mariano from Philadelphia
hello, how are you, this is Luisa from Miami, Florida. From Philadelphia, how are you? very good yes.
How are you? Where are you from?
I'm from Colombia, aha
Colombia, you have the cutest accent in Latin America.
And where are you from?
From Argentina
I can tell,  yes, yes
I can tell, yes, I can recognize the Colombian and the Venezuelan accents, those are the cutest ones in all Latin America.
yes
yes, that's nice, have you been in the United States for a long time?
I arrived here two years ago, I was two years here yesterday
oh, two years, I've been here for eight months
oh, that's so recent, oh
so, yes I don't know that much
a bit of time and
a bit, a bit
and but, are you bored, do you want to go back?
not now, I'm studying a Doctorate and a post-doctorate here in the University of Pennsylvania, so, I'm busy right now and I do miss things from my country but some other things are better here.
so, in general, I'm happy.
of course
I made many types of friends Colombians, Mexicans, Argentinians, Uruguayans
oh and you traveled here alone or you traveled with your family?
no with my family, with my wife
with your wife okay, good
yes, yes also we are getting to know a lot, which is precisely today's topic
yes
that we are traveling a lot, there are many places to get to know and that for me is one of the things I most like to travel
I don't know if
travel and what places have you traveled to
look
besides Philadelphia
no and I was in New York, Washington, Boston eh Virginia, New Hampshire eh I was in Florida a few years ago that this this thing let's say I know a little
quite good so to speak I've been in a few places and New Jersey and and now well now for the holiday break that there is between Christmas and new year
eh we are going, I'm going to California
to California
that I have some friends so I'm going to start knowing a little that side over there
sure and what has been the place that you've liked the best
that I've like the best I liked, well I like Philadelphia a lot
yes
But the cutest to me was Boston, it's very nice, yeah, New York is an impressive city, but
and crazy
Boston seemed to me... yes, yes, do you know New York?
I know it now, yes
Yes, that's very... i like it but i think it's crushing
Yeah, like very accelerated, like everything's so fast
If you're, you're in Miami
I love it, i live in Miami, yes
you live in Miami
i live in Miami more or less since i got here
Well, i love Miami because of the weather, the people, i don't know, Miami is very good
Yeah, it's quiet, even though it's a little bit more expensive than other places
Yeah, right?
Because it's touristic, yes
Sure, sure, but i, one of the possibilities i was considering, because i love the weather, i mean, the problem with these northern cities is the weather
that, for example, it's awful in Boston, even here in Philadelphia it's a very tough, very long winter, and i don't know, the truth is that in Miami you're fine the whole year
Yeah, it's cold right now, but it's tolerable and you put on a sweater and that's it
It's... but what's the temperature for example?
Oh, i don't really know what's the temperature
But a sweater and it's done
yes, with a sweater that's it
in other words that eighteen, twenty degrees something like that well
I think that if it doesn't manage to go down it doesn't manage to
well here last week there was a day of eighteen degrees below zero and that you die of cold so no yes yes later
I would like to apply for some position in some university to be a professor or something like that perhaps I would leave more to the side of Florida
ah yes here nice how nice
that is
but that and then as far as today's topic to what place would you like to travel and with whom, tell me
well one with whom with my wife obviously
obviously,
yes I really don't have many options really but
oh with your wife oh with your wife
and with let's say I would really like to go to eh eh what do you call it to Europe
to Europe
yes but Europe it's very expensive but really Europe there's a lot to see eh and then something that I liked a lot that let's say I want to continue to get to know is
all the part of Central America that even Colombia no eh that while is not in Central America faces the Caribbean also but I was in Guatemala, the south of Mexico and I liked it a lot and
and I want to know Costa Rica, Puerto Rico the the Colombian Caribbean which is in Cartagena of India
Santa Marta, San Andres
sure all those places that are beautiful
yes
so you are from Bogota
no I'm from Pereira
from Pereira, that's, where's that?
it's between Bogota, Cali and Medellin
aha
is all in the center
aha, and is it dangerous there
eh no is a small city, is a city that it's barely growing there's no guerrilla by there or anything like that, no
there's no guerrilla
no is a peaceful city
where is the guerrilla, in the jungle
more in the jungle yes like by
more by the side of Brazil so to speak
yes more towards there, more like to the south like towards the amazon and all that
sure, sure, sure and is a big problem right? there in Colombia
yes that's a big problem, every day there you see kidnappings and in the news that they killed such person that they killed the other
how incredible
but thank God with the new president that we have he's putting a hard hand in the country and things are improving.
really mm
I don't know if you've heard that they approved the law so that he could run again as candidate to the presidency and they are going again to well like to re-elect him like that you understand me
of course, of course and and where eh
yes madam no my aunt talked to me I am embarrassed
ah and where would you like to go
I would like to go to Germany
Germany Why?
yes, I don´t know I am so interested in Germany because of the things we hear the Nazis and all that stuff, movies, I don´t know if you saw that movie
yes yes it happens the same to me yes yes yes

to Chine well I can tell you Argentina it can be very cheap now
with no but it is
Argentina , was devalued, Argentina is very beautiful eh
yes I have never go there

I am a student
student

ah, ah you're young
yes I just turned nineteen
ah look, I'm twenty nine

sure and you, what instrument do you like
well, eh, I sing
you sing, ah wow
yes I sing, this is why I want to study music
ah very good
even if obviously to study music you are obliged to learn an instrument obviously
no sure, sure, at least one, no?
at least some, yes, at least pianos, organs, so
yes and you have to think about applying to a place to study music like Berklee, some of these
for now, no well for now I will start at Brawer Community College which is public
aha
eh to do the same credits that I would do in the university but cheaper right? first two years later I do plan on transferring to the
sure
that have a good
sure there would be good for you
sure
sure, you feel like
sure and with that career I can travel all around the world I certainly could
and you probably feel like and feel like returning to Colombia some day or do you plan on staying here
yes no I have the hopes of returning to Colombia but I don't
you're with your family here right?
me yes yes with my mom and my little sister
good
what happens is that I can't leave the country because of that of the guerrilla, I'm here on political asylum
ah look at that
so I can't leave the United States for ten years
and for asylum because, because something happened to your family
eh yes
oh, how terrible
exactly they killed, killed my father and my sister
wow, how horrific
yes very horrific then well
and your dad was in politics
my dad no my dad, my dad
ah
and my little sister's dad was ex-military
mm
then that's why they killed them but well thank God we're already here and we're already safe
well I'm very glad that you are fine my God what a terrible story, the stories of
but I swear to you that I would love to return to Colombia
yes yes I imagine that the people there are so warm right
yes very
although I don't know don't know in Florida but here there are a lot of Colombians
here no here in Florida there's a lot of Cubans
Cuba yes is full of Cubans but there aren't so many Colombians
there are Colombians but not that many
not that many
no
no and the nicest place if you had to recommend to go to Colombia, Cartagena
the nicest place is San Andres
San that's, that's in front of Cartegena, no?
San yes is an island in front of
well the San Andres island because, you know what happened to me several times with Colombians, I said Cartagena and they said no no, San Andres
yes it's the same
that it's prettier
because it's an island so it's like there's more, I don't know, I don't know how to explain it but it's nicer
sure, it's sweeter, San Andres of Cartagena
eh no it's the same
it's the same but well no
it's the same, because they're both tourists so they have the same rates
one day I'll go there
yes,
I hope I don't know, if I get my goal in life, it's to travel everywhere, it's what I like the most, I have a lot of fun
I would also love to travel to Brazil
I've been to Brazil like five times
yes, and how was it, really nice
wow, great, it's really great, it's something that won't surprise you much because you come from a Caribbean country, a warm sea so
it will be different because of the music of the food, but for example a country like Chile or Argentina that has this whole southern part
you will find really different landscapes, you know?  sure
yes, what countries has San Andres, seeing that in San Andres, in Argentina
no and the south of Argentina that's called Patagonia
yes
is eh is very cold is mountainous is is like if you see
Hello?
Hello?
yes, Hello?
Hello.
Hello, Manuel from Orlando speaking, with whom am I speaking?
With Blanca from Arizona
Ah how are you Blanca?
Fine thanks.
Very good, well I'm listening, tell me about your travels
Uh.
and after I'll tell you
Ah well I love to travel.
yes.
Ah, this year I was able to go to places, well, yes, two place in Colombia and Guatemala.
Correct.
I went to Guatemala for a month and two months in Colombia. I'm Colombian.
Ah, very good, me too.
Sorry?
Me too.
Ah, yes?
yes.
From where?
from Merechi.
I too,
Ah what a coincidence.
I'm also from there and I love to travel.  I love to travel, if I could I would travel all the time.
Well we agree on this, what we need is time and money.
And money.  Hmmm.
Because to me it's so relaxing, so revitalizing.
Hmm.
And well, I've been able to visit some countries some cities, as many as I would like.  But here we have the right that I can mention that has really called my attention.
It's one time that I was in our neighboring countries, I was in Ecuador, Bolivia.  And above all, the part of the Sierra.  Eh, Peru, Bolivia, all that.
Macchu Pichu, Titicaca.
Hmm.
This was an unforgettable trip.  And I did it for forty five days.  And then, well there's the beach and all that.  In the Caribbean that's called Granada, some islands.
And eh, there people are spectacular, really really really nice, really honest and the beaches are really beautiful.
yes.
Eh.  Well, before telling you where I would like go to, tell me more.  In Guatemala, for example, where I haven't been, how is it?
Well, the truth is that I say really bad luck now that I went to Guatemala.  My husband is from Guatemala.
yes.
But then we had
That is true.
planned to go to the duenas and all that historical part and from the Mayan culture and visit all that part.
That´s correct.
But we arrived in a season when there was a terrible winter There were many landslides every
Ah of course.
we wanted to go to the ruins eh, that a bridge had fallen, that there was a landslide, this or that. There was always something in the middle.
Ah that was because of the hurricanes season.
Exactly, yes.
Ah, yes.
And and I do visited Guatemala, it looked to me as an incredible place and the
It looks like, yes. yes.
The volcano in front of the city. that is spectacular.
I have seen it at the television on documentaries, that is a beauty.
That is a beauty. It is beautiful. There is a hotel, a very old one that was left as it was after the earthquake and the flood. Because what happened there with the volcano was a a
Ah yes.
that there was a volcano but it simply as in
Like in Colombia it caused a and after that a flood.
like in Colombia. That caused a flood. Because there is not snow at the top but it was
Uh uh.
flooded it was full of water and was like a point
Ah, yeah.
flooding the city.  In such a way that many people and many things were lost.
yes.  And, and the costs too, did you stay there or not?
But it's pretty.
There in the
Eh, eh, no.
Oh.
Since we're close to here, like an hour and a half, we didn't need to.
Ah.  And it's true since your husband is from there you didn't have to pay something, sure.
Hmm, yes, my mother in law, my father in law are living there now, there also North American but they went over there.
how nice.
They were tired of being here,
No, no, these places are beautiful and really nice.
yes.  Well,
yes, yes.
and more, I really know very little, I know Canada and it seems pretty.  Already this year I went to Canada twice.
yes.
Because before moving here I lived in Boston.
Uh-huh, you were very close, no.
I didn't live, yes, we had the chance to come and go and I also have family living in Canada so we were able to go and come often.
Oh and sure, that's the reason why. Which one is the dream of your life, have you been able to make it true yet?
Oh, I wish to go, I dream of going to the pyramids.
To the Great Wall of Chine, or which one.
yes, yes, the Great Wall of China.
Uh uh.
Oh, the pyramids in Egypt. Mm. And then, then, there was
yes.
But before that, I think I wouldn't want to go to the Middle East, they have so much problems there and it seems to me that it's all part of their history.
It's really interesting actually.
yes, yes, yes, yes, I think that that's why everywhere
Greece too. Mm.
that's right, I agree with you, I'm interested in the way in which their people, of course, going to the pyramids and the Great Wall
Uh uh.
oh, traveling to Greece and to the Italian civilization.
Italy.
I've only been to Spain in Europe and there are lots of things to see there but you never have enough time. I'm very interested in Italy, imagine
Time and money.
And Europe it's particularly expensive nowadays because of the exchange rate, right?
Mm.
When i went there i still got the other coin and you changed your dollars the way you wanted somewhere and you got them multiplied, not anymore. Now you take your dollars and they give you less
Yes
Because the Euro is worth more than the dollar
The euro, yes, that's true
So, it's also harder because of that, because the costs have risen, but we have hope, and of the neighbor countries, which one interests you?
yes, i would, i would like very much to go to Mexico, to the Pyramids of Mexico, i would like very much to go to Peru
Uh huh. Yes, yes, they, there's a lot to see there
Yes, and
The south too, Chile, Argentina
And i would also like very much to see the falls of
Yes
of the Iguasu
That, and Brazil too, that's another destiny that
Because i have seen documentaries and there's a point where it unites, I'm not sure, correct me if you know it better than me, Argentina, Brazil and Chile
ad Paraguay, right?
and Paraguay
Yes, yes, in a specific point i think those three countries
Uh huh, and there's, there's a point where the falls are and that looks so beautiful
That's a marvell, it's a marvell because there you have
That immensity, that, i don't know
Each of those is two hundred and sixty six
Um
Little and big, there it's two hundred sixty six separated
Yes
In one place
It's that, i do know the ones from Canada, I'm open and i know  it from both sides and i think it's incredible and nice
Yes, it's a beauty, it's a beauty, oh, and speaking about jumping and waterfalls, i would like to go to the
yes
Salto del Angel in Venezuela
In Venezuela, uh huh
Sure, it's the highest in the world, there's so much to know
What?
So much to know
Oh, so many things left to see, and we lack will, because the only thing we lack is that, will
So much to know, that, no, but look, we're lucky that we get the desire to travel, there's people that don't
Oh, i do
Even having the means, they don't want to
I'm telling you, if i had the way, that would be the only thing I'd do, dedicate myself to know, to know, to know
Me too. Definitely me too, and stay here for a while in every place, no eight days or,
yes
Wait here until I don't want to do it anymore.
yes, sure, in the place that grabs your attention the most obviously.
yes, yes, I want to stay there a month, well I stay there a month.  In the other only a week, only a week.
yes, it's true.
But without worries, no.
yes.  Now speaking of tourism.  We're prone to wanted to always know the outside that we almost never know our country.
Ah, with all the marvels that are here.
yes.
Well, believe me that when I lived over there in Columbia I traveled in the west and on the Atlantic coast.
yes.
I traveled on land to many places.
yes, yes.
But I still missed a lot because I don't know the east.
Aye aye aye and there are many beautiful things to see
I don't know anything about the Llanos for example, I don't know anything about these departments in the east near Alcalde and all this.  Maybe I'll go there.
yes.
There's a lot to see there.  But the problem, you know, it doesn't scare me.
Well sure, there are failures like the failure of security.
Now that this has gotten better and it's scary, so.
yes.
But hopefully, hopefully everything will run.  A beauty, really pretty, and, and, and.
And we also have a bunch of nice things.
And above all playing, it's good to play.
Uh-huh, yes
Well there's a town, a little town, everything.
Now that I went too to play for a bit in the park in the east in Tio Queno.
Ah.
Amazing, we went for a walk several days.  This was great.
This is a marvel, you really like knowing what you say.  That one here goes to play, if there's nothing to do, they're all commercial centers.
No, and here all the towns or the cities are the same.
Exactly and they all turn around the commercial centers.
They're like photocopies.  But I say, and now here that I came to Arizona, and Boston and Massachusetts for example there's a town called Rock
yes.
that's a town of artists and it's on the seaside and is really picturesque.
Ah, it must be really pretty.
It's picturesque, the most beautiful thing, and there's another little town
yes.
um here in California the name escapes me but I went this year too.  It's in a European style, it's like if you were over there in
True, it must be really pretty.  But a question, and why, why the change?
Scotland
Why from Massachusetts to Arizona?
Because of the cold.
Ah, well I also lived in New York yes, that was the cold that I endured, yes.
Because of the cold, because of the cold, I mean and besides here my husband had family and so we took advantage of that also.
And have you guys already adapted?
Well yes, I am, I'm here.
Sure, they say the weather there is very good, very benign.
No no
Well,
yes, during this time by mid-year is very hard. But then it's two three months of unbearable heat, well but
But if one gets in the shade the same because you tell me there's not much humidity.
there's no humidity whatsoever. It's a dry heat.
Ah, that.
you go out and you see the dry vapor.
yes.
but it is tolerable. If you have a bottle of water with a hat you're fine.
Ah look.
That's true. The humidity there in Florida is very bad.
The summer is terrible, is terrible. Around this time is good but the summer is terrible.
Mm. I have family in Florida and I've been there many times and over there I would like
yes.
Hello!
yes, eh, Good evening.
yes, good evening, this is Jorge from Los Angeles, California.
Hello!  I'm Rafael from Vancouver, Canada
wow, that's interesting, how's everything going over there?
Well, here, eh, it's fine, let's say, uh, doing what we have to do.  Every day.  Eh, casually, casually because we have the same, the same hourly usage
So there, it's six in the afternoon there.
Sure, we're eh, oh, it's, exactly, because we're both,
Sure the same
we're both, on the coast, on the Pacific Coast
yes, exactly
Exactly, and, let me say something more!  Let me say something more
yes, of course
You're Argentinian, no?
Well, the truth is that I, eh, it's the third call that I've done in the system, and I'm a little surprised because there's
I'm new, I'm a amateur, but evidently they discover, they find me, I can't pass to the other, to another place.
yes, eh, I'm right, No?  you're Argentinian?
yes, yes, yes
Me too, for this, No?
Ah, also
but of course, yes, yes, yes
But, but, but one moment, but
yes, the, yes the, yes, yes, the, the accent, the Argentinian accent

yes
You have I mean it's a bit mixed Because probably Well, Eh, speaking English, so probably and in a medium maybe, like
Los Angeles possibly, because there is in, in the, in the, let's say the tone, in the color of, of you voice there's a
A small difference from the traditional
Well, sure, but you are right
Now I've been here in Canada for four years, eh
How long have you been in Canada?
Fifteen years

I love traveling, I love love traveling but imagine Rafael, eh, eh, No, Canada still not.  I haven't been.
Well, to Canada, you have, I, I went here to Los Angeles eh, so I know it.
You went to Los Angeles?
yes, I was in Los Angeles.
you came here?
I was there five or four years ago, I was five years ago in San Francisco I went all around in a car from Vancouver up to San Diego.
Well, where okay, where I really live is in Hollywood of course I know Hollywood
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Well, I, I live basically like six blocks from Do you remember the Chinese Theater?
Let me see, let me see a little that
On Hollywood Boulevard The Chinese Theater,
Hollywood Boulevard, yes I'm placing it
The Chinese Theater is famous
yes Exactly, yes okay
Well, I live six, or more or less eight blocks from there
Ah, well, well, Speaking of Hollywood
Tell me, tell me!
you know You know what Vancouver is now called?
what, what do they call Vancouver
Eh Hollywood North
Exactly because, because basically all the producers from here from the United States many go film
yes
And exactly, much in, they are right.
But,
They are going to film Vancouver
It has been transformed here, what Hollywood proposes it remains as number one, but number two is New York and the third one is Vancouver in this thing
in this moment: it is amazing, I am hmm, I am a tourism guide.
Great! how wonderful, how interesting
And, What do you do Jorge?
I, I basically work in the, the, the, what in English is called Customer Service
Customer Service
Yes,
I
How amazing, Tourism guide.
Eh, going around the city, because I have to work with tours I permanently see in a day three four places that are in the
the buses with all the equipment to film and well
Of course, because it is cheaper.
So yes
It is cheaper for United States producers.
but
Work and film get, everything is cheaper if it is done in Canada
yeah, but there's a catch
¡Say it!
and there are other things, that maybe aren't related. We're not only talking from the dollar point of view, or other, other costs, but
this place, and they go meet the surroundings, it has multiple landscapes in a very near radius, which means that here we have a city
an ancient city, a modern city, a Chinatown, uh, we have, uh, snow, we have mountains, we have forests
That's wonderful
we have rivers, we have lakes, we have beaches, uh, i don't know, something more, i don't know if there's something else out there
it's, it's really beautiful, that
So, that, that
that's very nice
That makes a, a producer call you
Hi, hi, hi, hi ,hi
Hello?
Hello Good evening, how are you.
Oh, good evening, how are you, how are you. Ah, this is Vicente, and I'm calling, I'm speaking from New York.
From New York, ah, hi, we're close by, my name is Edo, and I'm in Philadelphia.
You're in Philadelphia?
yes right here.
Aha, aha, where are you from originally?
Eh, I was born in Guatemala, but, my family came here and I was very young, I was seven when we arrived in Maryland
Were you born in Coronara of Guatemala?
yes
So you have lived all, I imagine all your life here?
Well yes, the majority of my life I've spent it in Maryland it's only been three years since we moved to Philadelphia.
Ah, Philadelphia, aha.
To Phila-
Ah, very good, very good, very good. Well, I'm here in New York, and the strike just ended, we had a strike.
Ah, is true, eh, ye, they were really, like if they had to walk a lot no.
Oh yes, the strike is in New York, which is serious, because New York remember, is not like many other cities, other people
so close so separated, for many that use cars.
Sure sure
Here, here we use a lot of public transportation. Because a car here to park a car in New York, can cost you, can cost you a lot of money
yes, yes, yes but then to have, to have a contrac- if you have a contract all right, you will get paid monthly, two hundred, three hundred
pesos a month
I know
That is what people, most of the people pay for rent, understand?
Oh ,the most
So, it's very expensive, and, and the fines, oh. The fines are really expensive in New York, and they take your
Oh wow
car, mm, if you park in a forbidden place, when you come back, after going into a shop or whatever, be sure that when you go out your car is already gone
Oh my God
It will cost you like two hundred pesos to get your car back
Oh, and where are you from?
But that's life, see. So, we should be talking about, what? travelling
Trips, no, actually I haven't traveled a lot in my life, I think
Me either, I only traveled when I was in the army. You know, and I was a soldier
Oh, in what arm where you?
yes, and it costed nothing, because of course, I was travelling with the army, right?, to some countries in Europe, things like that. But no, when
when I was in the army, the thing was that when you get there, i didn't have much time, I had to be in the army. I couldn't
go out to visit other things, most of the things, eh
Oh
Wait, wai a minute, ok, just a minute, OK
yes, sure, OK
Oh yes
Well, eh
I, I don't work, I haven't travelled a lot, I would like to travel, eh, to other countries in the world, Europe, Africa, and so, Japan, those places, you know
yes, I have, I would like, maybe before going abroad, I would to know a little more the rich and famous places in the United States
Oh, you would like to know more about the United States?
Eh, eh, yes, I would like to know a little more yes, how you call it? for instance, over and above having been to Maryland, and Philadelphia now, well
I know New York, and Los Angeles but not so much, and, how you call it? I would like to know, eh, eh
Las Vegas, San Francisco
Maybe, yes, but rather than the Yellowstone Park, that is in
yes, yes, yes, aha. The nature, I know what you mean, eh, and I, I would like to do a little more of that. Sometimes I go to Miami
but in Miami it's very urban, understand, much of a city. My brother lives there
yes
And the Cuban, oh, the Cuban have, eh, they own Miami. Oh yes, there are so many Cuban, eh, in Miami, and all the business and stuff in Miami
And, most of the thing s depend on the Cuban, eh, because the Cuban, eh, the Cuban were like, eh, they were like the Jewish of the Latins
And he liked money. I am very, or, or , ah, money, right? That's why, eh, Castro started the revolution, eh, because
Cuba, before, had a lot of capitalism, understand?
yes
Very few had a lot, and most of the people had nothing. And then started the communist revolution, understand?
yes yes
And that was what happened. That's why, that's why Cuba left like that, because, you know, since it belongs to everybody
but the, the rest of the country, the other ninety percent don't own their ass
yes, However you would like to visit Miami
Right, yes. Miami, that takes you there, Miami is the, the thing is that Miami, and, and, San Franciso
they have, uh, I had things, like, I had things, like in Latin America, eh. I had trees and things, that, athat are kind of tropical, you understand?
Yes
Eh, like in, in Miami, you see, palm trees and all that. And sometimes, when you see the palm trees, you think
yes
Central America and  Latin America. But there is a lot of that, in Miami, orange trees  and all that stuff. It's like
Yes
it's something very, very beautiful. But I would also like to go out to, to visit Europe also, you know what I mean?
yes, eh, that's what I thought. Now, the part of Europe that probably attracts more my attention is Italy
eh, maybe because when I was studying I took a course on, on Renaissance art
Oh yes, arts, arts, in, in, in in Italian, yes
And, eh, yes, what you call it?, eh, I liked quite a lot the things I saw, I would like to visit some of those cities that are so old
Aha, yes
maybe, eh, eh, see, eh, see for myself what, what I saw on the pictures we were shown
Hm
And get to know
And most of, most of the arts stuff is old, you know, like in, like in Italy or Rome, right?
That's the capitol
Oh, yes?
Uh, sometimes, many of the cars, the big cars, they can't or won't, that, to see the big cars over there because everything's very old and
And the streets are still small, you see
Oh, yes?, i didn't know
Because, of course, Rome is, its if you read or if you read the bible, Rome is't like they say, in the English of, the eternal city.
Oh yes
Uh, uh, do you, do you understand that?, the eternal city, that, that Rome is a city that, you read and Rome is in the bible
And it still exists, you know, the same city exists
Right, right
Lik-
Um, yes, it's very ancient, so much history coming from
Yes, they are, its very old, and sometimes it, the big cars, i don't know, a building, sometimes the, the very streets are
like they're breaking up, sometimes. Because there's, they are always fixing something in Rome
Um
they're always fixing something. We were talking about the Michael Angelo painting, right?
Uh, yes, about the, about Michael Angelo's paintings, the structures that, that, what's it called?, that he helped build, uh, the sculptures that
Donatello, uh, and, and, i would like
Uh, of, of, what's he's called?, in the, in the Church, Chris  thing, Christine, what's it called?, like
the, the Sixteen Chapel
This and that, and I have to, to, nowadays they are still passing it, they are always passing it, day after day. You see, it's years and years
trying to conserve it, understand?, because it's so old. And sometimes, the paint is coming off, and sometimes the chapel itself has to be repaired. I've heard
United States and many countries around the world, make donations for its maintenance, understand?
yes, yes
Because it's so expensive to maintain those paintings. It's just different, the chapel is interesting. They were in the, here in channel thirteen, here in New York, I don't know what channel it is there in
where you are, it's called the public channel
Aha
They were talking about this things. Paintings, and music also. In Spain there are a lot, a lot of paintings, a lot of very nice paintings
yes, I guess Spain is another nice place to visit
Yes, oh, yes. I was in Spain for two days, I was in Madrid, but I didn't have the time to visit everything, museums and all that, eh
I was there for only two days
Wow
yes, um
yes, um
I was in Madrid for two days, also, just like you. Ah, but I didn't visit much of Spain. But there are, in the
culture, Spanish culture, eh, eh, has a lot of Arabic influence
Oh, really? Arabic?
yes, in ,in ,Spain, because just remember, the Arabs conquered Spain for seven hundred years, a lot of people don't know that. For seven hundred years the Arabs controlled
Spain. Until the Cid arrived, remember the Cid? Have you, have you read the Cid?
Aha aha
The Cid, the Spaniard that pushed the Arabs out of Spain. But yes, they kept the architecture and the
painting, the Spanish have many influence from the Arabs
oh, yes
Understand?, yes
I didn't knew that
yes, yes. I saw it, I read a lot about that. It's like, I don't say the word " ojala"
Have you heard any other word that say "ojala", I hope this happens, I hope this is
yes. yes
Well, that's Arab
Oh
That's it "oajalá". That was Arabs said, the Arabs to Alá, he Arab God, right
Yes
and everyone says, if Alá gives me permission of that happening, if Alá wants this to happen
Oh
But, now there is a word in Spanish
Sure there is
But it's witten different in Spanish O-A-J-A-L, something like that, do you understand?
yes, yes
But it's interesting
yes, in reality I didn't knew that
That's really interesting, there are many things that came from the Arab, that are in the Spanish, and the architecture, oh, the Spanish architecture
The architecture is more Arab that Spanish itself
Mmm
Because the Arab had the numeric system we use, the numbers we use now, they are Arab
Sure
And well, many people don't know that the numerical system that the United States and Europe and the whole world is Arab
7,8,9 that's writing Arab
Mmm
And it's really interesting, I would like to visit Latin American, but I have to be careful, there is a lot of crime there
That's the bad thing. Latin America is one of the most beautiful places, but unfortunately the situtaion, as it's now, with all the crime
With all the kidnapping and gangs, well, you don't travel really secure, and visiting all places like before
Can you talk a little bit higher, talk a little bit higher
Oh, Sorry
Yes
Well, unfortunately the crime, the experience is not as nice, when you travel Latin America, so
of being able to
yes, yes
or other countries, I would have done it, more easy. But, why taking vacations if you are worried that something can be done during that time, no
yes, and the thing is just starting, in Panama and other country also, but as I was saying, I talk to so many people
many people from Latin America now, and
Hello, My name is Celiana.
Hello. How are you? My name is Adrian. I live in Toronto oh Ontario, Canada.
There, How are you Adrian? And where are you from?
From Buenos Aires, and you from where?

There, look how near. The first time that I talk with an Argentinian.
yes, Where do you live now?
Now, in reality, I'm vacationing here in Miami. Because my brothers live here. But I live in Boston, near of let's say I die of cold like you.
A little less that in Boston but yes.
yes, eh.

I suppose that a little less but the only thing that makes me feel a little better is thinking of the people that live in Canada.
yes, There, that is worse yes more snow also and colder.
There, less you.
is going to be colder.
It is true, it is true too. It is not true. yes, and What are you doing? have you been living there for a long time?

There, a lot, a lot.
Of course. eh?
Many Argentinians? Are there many Argentinians?
No. Not to much. Neither there

Me yes almost a year.
There, then yes.
Well, in January I went to live, yes I work too.

Something.

And I do all that in Boston. And drink more
The mate and the milk candy, yes
Tell me.
eh?
Tell me, what did you said?
The, the mate. I ate breadcrumbed steak and more milk candy.
No, No. Milk candy eats my roommate lets say. I don´t like it very much. I drink mate everyday and yes That is not weird but I miss those moments
the hot That kills me. Weather kills me.
Don´t worry is like with my wife she is never going to get used to that but
Uh uh. And yes, the truth is that I don´t think so because of that because of that Buenos Aires Are you going to come back or not?
That is what makes me, what stops me to think about staying here or not.
yes, but why did you went to Boston?
well, Why did I went to Boston?
yes, Why not to , why not to Miami?
Because I had a good job. Possibilities of
There. yes.
growing and all that lets say but I don´t know if that is better than Buenos Aires with the family and its weather. But now it will be seen, it will be seen.
For now, I am living this that I like, I like where I am now, what I am doing and everything.
Are you happy?
yes. yes. I am Happy. yes, very happy. And you, how are you doing?
I don´t, I don´t have many complaints yes And what I miss most is the food. Eh
yes.
and eh and I miss it almost daily.
Do you miss a steak?
Not, not in a special way, is the flavor eh the, the American plastic food and everything is tasteless or it is to spicy.
Or.
Total. Total.
The, the pizza left my mouth swelling because it is very hot.
yes, did you see that everybody. The world eat practically  too much spicy but I think the spices are meant to sleep the mouth so they cannot feel
the food flavor. Right.
yes. yes. because they get used to it and after a pair of generalization it is a form of but
Of course.
yes. I don´t know how is in Boston, but here in Toronto is like kind of zoo. A
yes. yes. The same than in Boston.
Eh, The, And they complain, I don´t know about the people the Argentinians but many, many nationalities complain about the spicy food and that kind of stuff
At least they are Hindi or Pakistani, for them is good. Another issue with the food, but.
Sure. Um. Irish Restaurant and ask please, no spicy, no spicy and they say, no no? I said no, i said no a bit that spicy
Oh my God, that really gets my head. It's missed a lot. And the tourists that go to Buenos Aires love the food. So it's there when it's good
no?
Why don't they do it here?
Sure. Like that. Like that. I know.
From the from the eh, Is meat very expensive in Boston?
And
Good cows meat or?
There's only one restaurant for example Argentinian that the that if you buy the beef it's twenty three dollars.
Oh shit. Twenty three but it's a motherfucking restaurant in Boston. in the Neighborhood.
And that is like a little restaurant tango it's called Argentinian that it's not in a very nice neighborhood or anything and nothing no, very quiet.
Uh uh. that's good.
yes it's expensive. The truth is that it's expensive. But
He, the they make the grill and it's a good grill.
Ah yes.
but the on Saturdays yes one for two must cost no si sixty, seventy, eighty Canadian
So, ten dollars?
yes. No no.
There. Oh, ah good. It's a bit expensive as well.
yes, but I see that like that. And the the worst is that in the evening they have some Latinos there to singl boleros and
There, really
sing shit, that's unbearable
Yes, well. There are things you have to stand, I guess you too, working from home
No. It's just that I have not working bad in Buenos Aires, and now all that shit, and it was alright
yes
I was fucking sick of it. The overall situation and
Sure
the day in aprticular. But
Sure
I remember when I went to see my old man and I told him I'm leaving, shit, he said I already knew
I asked, how did you know? Because you told me ten years ago, he told me
Oh, really?
I don't remember when it was, but he told that when I was eighteen he started with that 'this shitty country' 'I'll send it to hell' and so
I don't remember but he told me, I guess he did, if he remembers I guess it did happen
Of course he was chewing that for ten years, it was not just like that
yes, it's quite peculiar, but well. Another detail
Sure
he
my sister lived in Boston, my brother there. So I came to visit them, and found this job, and now we are the three of us living in the United States
At the end, I came to visit them in Miami
the cold like this is the truth.
Totally.  Totally.  yes, the truth is that, it's great.  My sister says here, how cold and I'm like no, it's a little hot, how crazy.
But I don't know how it is now.  I don't know, twenty degrees.
twenty degrees as such.  it's it's crazy but it's winter so that's why it's cold.
Do you get to go to the beach?
yes, just got back from the beach.  We were at the beach all day.
yes.
This is good, eh.  The truth is that good, to live like this too.  To me I realize now that winter is returning to Boston and that
climate is really important, people are in a totally different mood.  Perhaps in Boston people aren't really sociable, I don't know but
Hmm.
we Latinos aren't made for this cold.
No the, no this the other topic but I just saw the truth and eh, they go skiing and not in
Sure.  Sure.
It was a culture, on the part of the culture, now we have the culture, and all this shit too, but in this, between this and and
Sure.
be in the car for half an hour to go skiing or snowboarding and pass the winter like this so
No.  I'm going to start snowboarding because last year I skied.  And now I'm snowboard
No, I only skied once in my life.  No, no, no I wasn't very good at sports.
Ah, really?
yes, no, no not with sports.
Oh, look, look, you know, it's the only way I can spend the winter doing something, so yes, I'm going to start snowboarding
You bet
I have a friend, I have a friend who has been living here for about three years, he used to ski in Argentina, but since he arrived he started
yes
snowboarding, and he became psychotic, he goes every weekend. No, no, I know he does go because he is not that simple
good evening Nancy's speaking
yes good evening Patricia's speaking, whom am I speaking with?
How are you Patricia?. I live in New York, in New York.
hello Nancy what country are you from and where do you live aha yes what's your culture, what Spanish roots do you have
eh I'm Colombian, yes
okay I live in Wilmington, Delaware and I'm from Panama so we are neighbors
yes
geographical neighbors
yes yes very true
what do you think about music nancy
well much in many senses unites people because when there's been disasters enters competitions right? and music also relaxes you a lot
exactly
its messages like that
I totally agree, at the beginning of this recording they gave us a quote from an ameri- poet, eh a British poet
mm
ah Long Just that it says that eh music is the universal language I totally agree with that
yes because one suddenly doesn't understand let's say the lyric or something but
is if
but it like reaches one
if you don't speak the same if you don't speak, if you don't speak the same language sometimes is not necessary because if you have music in common you can
so have full assurance that there's communication
yes that's very true one communicates there's no need of being with
totally, what type of music do you like?
I listen to a lot of romantic music
ah yes mommy
yes, and I love Alberto Plaza a Chilean singer, he's a Chilean singer who's all his songs are
I've never heard of him I'm a bad Latin
yes, are about his wife of how much he loves her all he feels for her
ah my God but you are so romantic
yes and now since I have a baby then I'm devoted to listening also to baby music and I play him Mozart and all
aha you've begun, ah how nice, how nice, I like to listen to music
so that he relaxes
eh primarily I listen to whatever is on the radio
yes
I like to listen from reggaeton to classical music when I'm traveling
aha, yes because he doesn't let us sleep so
eh by the highway ah very relaxing exactly right? you forget the stress and everything.
yes
ah I don't  know many of our Latin singer songwriters
aha
Oh, i know more of what's contemporary in the reggaeton
yes
and i know, i also know, in my mother's time, i said Los Panchos
Right
things like that, right?
yes, of all those i know that if i finally get the music i listen to it, but you kinda get melancholic every now and then
oh girl
if you listen to it long enough
um, i like it
yes, that's good, because, lets say, its a ways for you to relieve the stress, you relax and you feel comfortable
no, definitely, definitely
that's the best way you can rest at home
and, and it's also good for, and it's also good for sending social and political messages
uh huh, yes
right?, there's, secretly, in the background they're telling you more than four things
yeah, but, yeah, that's very true, I'm here right now
have you heard any composition or heard our singer Ruben Blades?, uh, Ruben Blades
Uh, yes, right, yes, i love him
well, his career, in his first career he is a lawyer, look, the baby is no fool
right, he knows the, he know what he says
and he writes when there are political situations in our country, he writes songs right? depending on his point of personal view and that's personal
yes about
and look at the things that my daughter comes up with from these musical intrigues
yes yes is very true, yes that's exactly how Ruben Blades sings, mm
Does the same thing happen in your country, that the songwriters, do national songwriters sing?
yes yes they are also singing them that's why I've heard Juanez also
yes Juanez is very famous he's gone to Panama a million times
works, aha yes so he's been in Florida also
and he's very good looking also
aha, how he wants, yes
aha is the one that comes in girl give me your money
and yes, yes
ah for example eh what type of music do you like to dance to?
eh I like salsa and I was learning to dance reggaeton
ha yes ah
because reggaeton it's really hot here
and you think that we could, could music be used to unite people
yes
me too, you know that I eh I read
yes yes
no I'm sorry I saw the television -CNN that they did a study I don't which university in California did a study that the kids that take music classes
in grade school especially when they start young
mm
eh if they learn to play a musical instrument or are involved with the music in anyway for example chorus
yes
that those kids their mind eh eh learn more, they are more intelligent
it develops normally, yes
mm so you already know you that already have a baby
yes
think, start thinking musically
yes I put it and I hum and she gets there and kind of moves her little mouth and I love it
imagine, imagine, imagine the power of music Nancy that makes a, how many months old is your baby?
five months
imagine that the music has the power of making a five month old baby react
mm yes because they immediately come look and
I believe that God gave us the music
yes yes then by that medium, that's an incredible communication medium
it has to be incredible, is incredible and is look that I've been eh saw a documentary about an eh American eh from a relatively famous band
in this country, eh I would say in the seventies he and his band went to Africa
aha
to learn about those of the wrong that, that I'm thinking in English now yes many many of the African drums
well yes ah yes
no?  What we call swing
eh swing, there they're removing itt
aha and so he was put together with a really famous band and I don't know where in Africa they made an album, you saw this combination Nancy, it's look
spectacular
from hell, there's another dark girl too who's called Sade
aha
she's African, her dad is English and her mom is African and she's so cute
a cute dark girl
cute and she has this song, the swing that the woman is, is international
aha and it's from
now from Latin music you think, for example, because I know that in different countries the native music, the music from the countryside for example, no?  Not what you hear in the city but in the countryside, we call it
yes
what we call this in Panama, ah, what it's called in Colombia, you, cumbia
the cumbia
what they hear, what they hear in the countryside in the little towns
hmm now I don't remember
they hear everything
yes, yes they make a mix of all the music, of everything
oh typical, typical music
aha
typical music which is completely different from the one you can hear and dance in the city
yes, absolutely, and to them it is something completely new
but, despite that, despite that, see how it is opening, and that amazes me because I think much of it is in the culture, it is very important if you don't have
culture, you are almost like a beast
yes there is much of the person in that
and music, and music has a lot to do with that, it's involved and even, for instance, the singers from the inside like we call them
that have come up, and are now listened to all over the world, just figure Panamanian from the inside now being listened to in Europe
I had never heard them
can you imagine that?
yes because I had never heard about them, where did that come from?
right, right
yes
and it's something tat, to me, to me it's a wonder and it affects me in a very positive manner, sometimes it makes me, like you said, melancholic, right?
aha yes because it's like, look it's nice, it's not too late for them
oh, but I don't want to hear those things
yes ,yes, because here came Carlos Vives last year, and when we went to buy a ticket it was too late
I can't believe it
and you go, God we noticed too late!
he goes to Panama every once in a while
Carlos Vive yes, he comes here, is the first time I hear he's coming, not in New York
in Miami it's the first time, ah in New York ah the first ah so that tells you
yes
that they are seeing his musical geographic field.
yes
he started right? in Colombia hopped over to Panama, Mexico, now he's getting in the market and look let me tell you music is a huge business.
the video production and all that, it's big business there's money
yes yes because at least they would tell D'yankee
like crazy
that a boy was asking him that how did he do it to get the money
exactly and PDiddy, P'Diddy
and yes yes he would say, he would say singing counting with
multimillionaires my love
aha
but they are, look I act eh I do, I do the eh part in back what people don't see when they are watching movies
aha
and ah is very hard the other day I had the opportunity I wasn't forced because when they did the feature film eh the feature film it seemed that the audio was poor
mm
because there was enough money for one or the other but not both so then I had to go
ah
had to go to do the audio
to do everything well, oh, oh
at once, speaking at once and I saw, no?  I will tell you girl, this is hard and so I started thinking about people who are doing this musically
when you see them in the video recording in a studio
yes because they play
you know what this takes
and they play record and record many times and there are stops and
and and it has to be, it has to be, exactly Nancy
yes if they make a mistake there they give
you know I thought, I thought that the trick was to learn to read my lines to see the la la la ti ti tin pa pa pa
and finish and
I gave myself an end, I said look girl, I think it's going to be a half hour of this
Oh my god
and I did this for two hours
like, it took you double what you
aha, no it took them
yes because the truth, you imagine, no for them it's easy to get in a recording studio
Hello, good afternoon
good afternoon, Marcela, whom am I speaking with?
Hello Marcela my name is Niky, nice to meet you
hello, nice to meet you, where are you calling from?
I'm calling from Florida, and you?
I'm in North Carolina
ah, well not to far
not too far, no, no
no, are you Argentinian?
yes, I'm Argentinian, and you?
ah, I'm from, I'm Dominican
ah, look, the first Latin person I met who was not Argentinian, that I met in the United States when my parents emigrated was a Dominican lady
yes, oh really? how nice, how nice
yes, yes but I haven't met many,
I've met many Argentinians, that's why when I heard your beautiful accent, I already knew
ah, thanks,
yes well, what do you think of music?
and, I love music
me too,
and it seems to me that while people listen to music and dance they don't fight, isn't it true?
it's true, yes
So it's a good thing, that of, that you can, uhm, I don't know, we export enough music and still fight each other
yes, sadly, I, I love music when I was a little girl I thought I'd be an artist, but I don't have the talent
ah, yes
I buy a lot of CDs, and, there are a lot of movements in many countries about music and bringing peace, I've seen
for example, in England with Africa
yes
but, I haven't really seen a deep change, sadly
no, no, and I also think that this, uhm, this exporting music thing, it depends, I mean, music doesn't export itself
yes
and then, when you have big companies like the ones in this country
yes
then, there's a lot of music exportation, the music that, that's made here
yes
and not all the music, just the super popular music
yes
and the super popular music is super popular because these companies are selling it and pushing it, and they have money to promote
yes, yes
then, uhm, other music from this country, or from another country that doesn't have the, the money behind to promote it and
and export it, it's not listened to or exported, we have, we have to
yes,
to be like an archeologist, looking for something new
yes, unfortunately yes, I've heard that many artists, when I listen to them, in a concert or buy a CD, they are part of small independent companies because they want to
have some freedom, I mean, to make their own music and not be part of a corporation, it's hard for them, really hare
yes, yes, yes, yes because these people, they live, I mean no, these people, they don't have the, oh, contracts with big, big money, these people, well
they work, for every, they work for every penny they get.
yes
what type of music do you like?
I love all kinds of music, I mean, specially, I don't know, I'm not old enough to say music from a
mhm
I mean, like,if I tell you, for example, I collect music by Carlos Gardel, I mean
oh, you do?
that's before my time but I love it, I really love it and also music from the thirties, forties, ballads from the fifties, all kinds of music, I studied music, so, as I said, when I was little I thought I would become
oh mhm
well, I also collect classical music, merengue of course
yes
but, all types of popular music, in Spanish, in English, all types, I really, really like it, I mean, I do find it hard to listen to hard rock
but sometimes, there are some rock bands from Spain or South America that I do really like, so it varies
yes, yes, yes
and well, I also like jazz and I don't like, you know, rap is very popular among young people
rap, yes
and I think that music is very violent, but sometimes there are young people that are, there are artists that so, that are playing but they have positives messages for the youth
yes, yes, yes
but because of that it changes, and you?
the question is to try to understand, I don´t understand them, but I think that it is because of my age too because I am fifty one years
ah, yes
and then this is what, not to me, I don´t know, my mother is like, I like it, so, I like every kind of music, but
my younger son who is seventeen years old, he loves to hear music
yes, oh yes?
old, music from the sixty and the seventies and he, he loves the old rock, and
wow, that is unique for that age
and, but from very young, he was a little one and he liked to hear rock from the fifties, and he knew the lyrics
oh, yes?,
and we don´t know how, so I say that in another life, and now he plays the guitar, he is a guitar player and
how good
he plays classic, plays jazz, plays blues, plays everything but to me, I don´t know, sometimes to hear music from my era, you say, ah yes, I remember that, but constantly
it bores me, is like that, I have hear that, it is over, I was,
yes
Do you understand me? or it has to be much more - something more, older than me, or this, or something that is happening now
yes
eh what happens is that my husband is also a musician, he, he
oh, how nice
eh, plays, eh, piano and writes, and then
listen, how nice
then I tend ah, ah, to listen to what they bring, is rare that I bring something home, sometimes, sometimes I find something and I, I bring it, if not
What are you listening to, what are you listening to? and, and, I listen to what they listen to and especially my youngest son, I like all the weird things that he
sure, sure
that he brings as long as they're not old things
yes
but it would be, I don't know, it would be a good thing for the music to bring peace, but
yes
no the truth is I haven't seen that, I mean, we can look at, at, at Bono from U2
yes that's why I think of him, yes, he tries, but I don't see
but is not necessarily I mean the music, and it gave him fame, and it's the fame
yes, yes is true, is true, yes
what he is using to, to achieve what he's achieving, I mean, is not that he went over there, played a song and the people were transformed
sure, sure
you understand me?,,e
but at the same time, I also think there's someone from your country that is, I'm forty two years old and discovered well discovered this singer already,
in the eighties and she perhaps you can tell me if she inspired people in the seventies and it's Mercedez Sosa
ah, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes she really, ah, inspired people, inspired people who were against
eh, the military
sure
ah, she w-w-was an inspiration so they could continue with the work that they were doing.
sure
so, against the military, so, hmm, eh, yes, this woman is a barbarian, I, you have to know that I was born in fifty five and I've lived here in the United States since I was nine.
wow
and I've only returned to Argentina in seventy one when I was sixteen in eighty five, when I was thirty
and now, we went with my husband, eh, the summer of two thousand four
wow how nice, you've really seen the different stages of your country
yes, yes, you can see, you can see the difference
interesting, I don't know Argentina, bu- I've traveled a lot and I also grew up in the United States, in New York
it's- hmmm
ah, and I came really young, so I completely understand
yes, it's a, it's a rare place that we're in, because we're not from here but we're not from there,
yes, I call it between two worlds
like, you know?  and yes, yes, yes that's it
or more, be- between many worlds
yes, people sometimes ask me and I, what do I know?  It seems to m- I like being in this situation, because it seems that we can look at the world with a very objective eye
yes I agree, I agree
this, I mean, we can as Americans look at our American culture
yes
and, and really see how it is we function and at the same time we can look to our countries from, where we came from
yes
and since we have that idiosyncrasy because we were raised by people from that country
yes, yes
eh, also understand that is, in them, that we also are
yes
how that works and how it is - why that doesn't work
yes
I don't know, and sometimes I get in trouble with people but
I like how you say it, I agree, because like that we have the power of like choosing choosing, things
yes
that one really. I understand it is part of oneself, but things that are also perhaps not for me I think many times I've visited the Dominican Republic but many times I think
when I go there is a much smaller country than yours and one, well I feel it's really hard for the professional woman, I'm an attorney
mm
and, it's such a small country, although the city is big, my family comes from Santiago and it's a city of a, a million people, but
even then you really can't, is like the rest of Latin American where you really know the last names is a society thing, what family they come from, and
ah
and, is, there one feels, like the duty of the family more than in the United States, it's a much bigger country, one can choose his
His profession, and is not, is not hindered the duty of the family and the woman and all that, I don't know, I can choose, I can say, yes I love merengue, I like Spanish it's a part of my soul, but besides that I am a professional and I'll stay in the United States
and so I choose music as well
no, it's just that I, I think that also in a small country where the purchasing power, the power of menoey
has a limit
yes, yes, yes
virtually, do you understand? so, if ,if you come from a rich family, the you can have more money, but if you come from a middle class family, since the country is so small
yes
you have no chance, I mean, once you have sold to the hundred people living there, you can't sell any more
yes
you sold already, so, in a country with a bigger population, there are more opportunities because unfortunately, money talks
yes, yes
then it doesn't matter what class, eh, or what family, right? not even what class,or what family, or what's your name, because
eh, what matters is if you, if you can produce and make money for me
yes, yes
understand? and then since there is many people among whom I can choose, then everybody has the chance to stand out
yes, sure, sure
that's why my, my dad, in Argentina, Argentina is such a rich country, and he says
yes
the difference between the United States and Argentina is one zero, we have a little more than thirty million inhabitants and the United States have almost
three hundred million
yes, yes
and that makes a lot of difference and we will feel it, the power and the monetary powers will move to
Hello
Hello good evening. How are you?
Hello, How are you? I'm Alicia
what yes I'm Ever I'm calling from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Where are you?
ah, Philadelphia, I'm in Atlanta, Georgia.
ah okay, we are still in the, in the east coast no
yes, yes precisely here is quite hotter that in Philadelphia
how nice, how nice oh, yes, you are more to the south, I suppose you have good weather, we are here putting up with the cold, though today is not that bad, today is like forty degrees
really ah, it's good in Pennsylvania is colder, how funny.
But we are awaiting some snow this weekend, I think
Really, just in time for Christmas, how exciting.
it would be nice a white Christmas like
sure that's never happened to me, in fact.
yes
yes, never, I've never had snow in Christmas.
you haven't seen snow
yes, yes I have, I mean, when I've lived
white Christmas
but never for the twenty fifth of December it never snowed so then bad luck
well, the topic seems to be the music, no and
yes, the music, exactly
music helps unite different societies or different types of people, no?
mm I think so, yes, no, only because there have been revolutionary or cultural movements in which music has played an important role for that movement, for exampl
in Cuba, the troba, Rodriguez, Pablo Milanes and all those people, oh, the messages, the political motivation through music.
It's like in the United States with the hippies, right, music was a fundamental part of their
their movement, their messages, so the problems is that nowadays, people listen to stupid music that has no meaning, the songs are, by the way
very boring love songs, I'd say, so, sure, this music has no message, so, obviously it doesn't unites people,
it creates a space between them instead of uniting them, do you understand?
yes yes nowadays the music is based in romance, relationships and not in
Sure
there are no political or controversial
Sure
between the Hispanics I know, maybe Ricardo Arjona
Arjona in some way yes, but he's too posh for these things, but sure, Arjona has a
yes, well
oh he does have political messages and all of that but he's more general, he's not a revolutionary like Silvio Rodriguez, it seems that
maybe, he's older or was a bit older, how can you say it? Well he is less idealistic and he has more existentialist subjects, I love Silvio Rodriguez and one time
I went to Mexico City to watch him play, it was fantastic, I was eighteen years old and I went to Mexico, Mexico City just for three days to watch them play.
wow, was it good?
Oh, it was excellent, he had some really good new songs, really good ones, the guitar, oh the music, he played the violin and the guitar, so
I´m interested in technique, and I noticed that his style had, had changed. Uh, uh, the guitar was more, was less "folk-styled" than in the seventies and now
definitively more guitar
wow
hmm, yes. And you?
I´m not that talented in the artistic sphere, I have no talents
What? oh
I mean, I do appreciate music a lot, and I like, I like espcially the ones that have a message
Sure, good messages, I mean
eh
instead of
I think you´re right when you say that in our history, in crucial times, music has been important
Right, exactly, and now, well, music is always the voice of a generation as well
yes, you´re right, eh
What kind of music do you like to listen?
Well, generally I like, oh, Hispanic music, most of all, Latin music
sure
it has more, uhm, kinds
But for
more emotion, more passion, but, how do you call it? but, I also like americ-
But for example, what kind of Hispanic music? Latin rock, or more like .. I don´t know, cumbia, ranchera, more like, ballads, I think they´re called, what style do you
I really liked the Salsa
Salsa, yes, it's true
Salsa, I think it's my favorite, how is it called, after that, I really like Arjona's music, I really love it
Arjona is really good, really goof, I remember
And now there is a rhythm really fast, but
eh
is reggaeton, but sometimes, the messages from that music are not necessarily the best
What kind of music is reggaeton?
yes, the reggaeton, have you heard Daddy Yankee, Daddy Yankee?
No
Daddy Yankee
No, I don't listed, hello, hello?, what happened?, that's weird
Hello, I don't know there was some kind of interference there
Yes, that's weird, I haven't listen, Yankee dale, it's his name?
it's called Daddy Yankee, also well, Don Omar, Tego Calederon, Ivy Queen, They are the most known inside that genre, it's like Reggae, but, it incorporates something from the merengue, some house
Oh, it's really moved
yes, yes
So, it's nice to Dance, it's entertain, I'm into listening Juanes at this moment
Oh, yeah, Juanes, he has a little nice music, and well, he has some messages in his songs, right?
Excuse me?, yes, but generally only humor and I can listen some romantic and then, I get bored, because, there must be something more in life
so, in a way, I do like Juanes' songs, specially because they have rhythm and he has a wonderful voice, I mean, I love how he sings but, after a while it gets boring
you know, I'm dying for you and all of that, do you understand, I mean, it's a bit
corny, isn't it.
sure, it's corny, that's right, I had forgotten about that word. Hey, where are you from?
I'm from Guatemala.
Oh, Guatemala, that's interesting, I'm from Chile
Oh, you are from Chile, okay
you know, there are some good Chilean rock bands that I really like, I don't know if you've ever heard of Luz y Vela (light and candle)
No, no, I haven't heard of them but yes, there are lots of bands, South American groups, Rick, that are very good, right
Like the Petineli, have you heard of them?
No, no, I haven't, there's a group called, I think it's an Argentinian band, it's called the Mosca (the fly)
Oh  no you haven't heard them, those must be kind of new, right?
I don't know if they are new but they have nice music.
The Mosca, is that Rock music?
it's kind of, yes, it's like Rock but oh oh, yes, it's similar to Rock
I'm going to have to listen to them, there was an Argentinian group that I really liked, the Suite del Garabat, that was the name, it's very, very, the music is like
it's entertaining and it's now in Chile too, the three, I loved that group, I don't know if they still play but they were very good in the nineteens.
Do you like American rock?
even, I do like it, in general terms but the old American rock, for example, music from the sixties, Bob Dilan, oh, British bands too, Pink Floyd, I loved the Doors, that type of old music, I love it.
and now
And the group, the group Queens?
Queens they're good, yes also, from
And Creedens, the group Creedens?
Queens, I never liked queens because I don't know is the same as the stones /foreign, I never liked them too much.
no
For some reason.
for a group that is more a little more modern, but that was good, was Guns and Roses I don't know if
Ah, Guns and Roses were very fun but they did have music like heavy
yes, but also they sometimes had romantic ones and they were very good.
ah, sure, like that one, yes I remember the video even the November rain but well, or also that song called patient that song
I don't know I loved that song
And do you like the group Mana?
Mana are also good, I haven't heard it much but what I've heard I like, let's say.
is, very, quite good Mana
They are more, like laid back yes, from what I've heard. But oh at least
mm Not necessarily, they have
no
The last angel of love Well is not the last but is one of their newest.
recent ones ah that will be faster perhaps oh
Are there a lot of Hispanics in Georgia?
Yeah, plenty, they're usually like, uh, I'd say people from Mexico
Uh huh
But also a lot of people, there are allegedly three thousand Chileans in Atlanta, um, and a lot of Brazilians too
oh, yes
there's a little bit of everything here, it's very interesting
i knew a boy that was from Atlanta
Yes, oh yes
Yes, we met at a University we were in, West Virginia, a few months ago, and... what's it called?
Um
uh, he told me he was from Atlanta and told me it was a pretty diverse place, but i didn't really know
Oh, yes, there's even a Hispanic newspaper publishing, i mean it's like
from the Hispanic world, how much?
Hello! Good evening, How are you? My name is George, New York
Hello! hi, my name is Paulo, I'm here in Philadelphia
Okay, how are you Paulo?
Hello, how are you? how is it going?, good, Where are you from?
Fine, fine, what did you say?
What country are you from?
Ah, Colombian.
Ah, from Colombia
yes, And where are you from?
Ah, yes from Argentina
Ah, nice to meet you
Aha, how are you, man what music you listen to there?
Good and Music!, music from my country, I like salsa a lot,
Ah, yes
a lot the ballenato typical music from Colombia
Ah, you know what's more typical.
yes, I don't
And the reggaeton is from there Right?
the reggaeton also now the latest because you have to be in fashion
I don't like it, do you like it?
And I was last year there in Venezuela and I have 25 yo daughters, 20 yo, 19 yo, 18 yo and they like this
They loved it
They learn yes, and what music do you like
yes, I like, I listen to National rock, which is Argentinian rock
yes, tango
And I also have, yes many tango also, and well, other music called Samba, which is more like country music
yes
From the country, in Argentina, so, most than anything else, Tango and National Rock
And from here, do you like any
from here?
some kind of music?, yes
No, not much
Oh
Not, really, I'm not that
You don't like any
Not really, I don't have idea, of what's being listened recently, I mean, I stayed with music that
yes, from our countries
From, yes, it seems that happens to all of use, did you when when they are
Mmm
Once I got here, I started to listen more music from each country, many people said me that, Chilean, Mexican, they told me that
that this had happened and able to listen to international music, when they were in their countries and when they came here, they listened to native music.  I don't know if this will be true or not, it happened to me
No, yes
So good
And what do you think about music?  Is it a bringer of world peace or?
No,
what's one of the questions, certain?
No, I think
I don't think so because
I don't think so, look at the things that happen and there's music that
hmm
Eh, how many thousands of years and the things keep happening the same, they're things, I love music, it relaxes your soul
sure, but there's
But it's nothing more than for this.
yes
So, eh, nothing, no, well, it wouldn't me, I repeat, I love music, but, no, the world wouldn't be nice without music, but I don't think it fixes anything either
No,
Just ask John Lennon
yes
it complicated his life
They killed him
what?
John Lennon, he was killed when he was 25, right?
He was killed, right
yes
He was killed too
but the one who ki-, the one who killed him was
yes, some nut who said he was a fan of the beatles' or John Lennnon's, I don't know
he said, no, he got a message and had to kill him, but didn't kill him out of hate or anything like that
yes, a nut, a nut
Well, he went crazy in a minute, the guy, and killed him just reading a news article. About the man
yeah
he got like a signal that he had to do it, and just did it, uh, a lot of people kill, but no, he really didn't attack him for the music or anything like that
No, I think music helps in every way, right, a concert help to increase brotherhood between countries and all that
Maybe it's not enough, but I think it helps something, right? at least is therapy for many people and
another way like you say it calms a lot, uh
hm
It's weird, I think that, not like soccer that for example creates passion, music doesn't cause that, at least, no?
hmm
it doesn't cause fights, or turn people against each other, like the passions caused by an event such as soccer, right?
sure
You more than any one know it since you are Argentinian Right?
yes, yes
There the bars are fierce, for example
Amazed yes, yes
how about the music The music does, in something, in something in fact contributes, no
It contributes something to peace.
yes I think so, anyways, right?
yes, yes
And what do you think of classical music? do you like it? it's never caught your attention or?
it catches my attention but in reality I don't know anything about classical music
yes, no, no, you don't listen to it or anything, I'm also not a Every now and then when I pay attention, I listen to it a little bit, but no, I'm not such a lover of music
mm
of classical music or anything like that. Our country has a music an incredible amount of music, diversity of music
A lot of rhythms
yes lots of rhythms that we have in a lot of regions, very different
mm
We have regions that are Flat, mountainous regions, valley, coasts so then the music
ah, goes changing there yes, yes
Uh, the music is very diverse, very diverse
It's very diverse
mh, it's really diverse
Right, just like in Argentina
mm
Just like in Argentina.
The tango, the tango, in Medellin we have, I don't know off the top of my had where Gardel died it's, uh
Right
they love the tango
Ah, yea
uh, that area's, it's a tango are right, Medellin's been known for tango
Ah, really I had no idea.
But Medellin is a, let's say after Buenos Aires
No, I didn't know, that's great, how interesting
yes yea, when I get a chance I read
Uh
About Medellin and its attractions
uh huh
And, and Gardel died there, I think in an airplane accident
yes the air accident was there in Medellin. Yes,
yes, no they love tango they really like it a lot, there's a part of Colombia where they really like it
look at that, and isn't Gabriel Garcia Marquez Colombian? Yes he's Colombian
yes, of course
Is Colombian Right?
Yes, yes
Ah Ah just a while ago I was reading the book  The Bio, the last book that came out "The Biography"

And as he started changing that he would get work in different newspapers
yes.
like always the music would
would accompany him
would accompany him, yes that book is very interesting. Very good,
yes the coastal man is very famous in Colombia, in the cities and in the interior for being loud I mean one identifies him by saying there goes
a coastal man carries a tape recorder or a large radio on his shoulder
Ah, yes
Like here the blacks necessarily have to sometimes do Right? That's how it is over there in Colombia. In the capital is cold, cold land
how nice, how I would love to know Colombia.

Aha, Juanes is also Colombian, now there's a lot of music
Ah, Shakira also, but Shakira they don't, don't like her in Argentina
ah,
Because she got married there to

Ah, well that's another thing
So she lost a country to sell records.

She'll continue with that.

We don't know, is she still with the son of who used to be our president
yes it appears she is no?
I don't know,
yes she still is, but ah, that time always ends relationships.
yes, so in Argentina no
mm
Since it didn't go over well with people, they had to erase a bit of the map
that will make
A little, not much but still
And that music
In a moment it was furor, everyone was listening, listening to Shakira's music.
yes
And when, since people didn't like the president, since he fixed the President's son
yes,
They played it a bit against
what happened.
poor Shakira
And what music is popular in Argentina now?
Popular now
yes, What music is fashionable?  or, What singers?  What group?
And, and well, since I listen to national rock, I don't know anything more than national rock groups, nothing more
Ah, yes, hmm
yes, they're called "Los Piojos" and "La Versuit" but
But they're not well known internationally
Sure, no, no they are groups who sing national music, above all it's music that if you're not Argentinian you don't understand much either because it has a lot,
yes, hmm
codes and
very local
and very local, and they talk about the political, economical and social situation that, look, if, if you´re not Argentinian you won´t understand what they´re talking about
hmm, nice, and
they´re very local things
I know the situation
Sure
and it´s been very delicate lately, right?
yes, it´s complicated, yes, complicated

Oh, are you friends with Mariano and Leticia?
Yes
The other day they told me, "look, i just got to talk and my friend from Boston picked up", they said, that it'd be hilarious
Oh, it was me. Because, the other day it happened to me with a friend, she gave me the info. So with a friend from Argentina in Boston, she says, "hit it, should we call?", so each one called from our cellphones
yes. And you talked amongst yourselves
And we talk amongst ourselves
Sure, Mariano told me about all that. We see them really often, yes, yes, yes
Ah, look at that, that's good. And what are you doing in Philadelphia?
that's funny. I'm also a biologist, and I'm doing a post doc here in, I'm actually in a different department from Mariano, but well, we have a common friend, and that's how we met each other
Ah, uhm, I'm doing a postdoc in genetics in Tufts University
You? ah
And the other day, well, Mariano and Leti came here. Now a friend of ours from the faculty is coming. A very close friend coming to do an internship for 3 months, so we talked about maybe going to
Ah
So I guess we're going to meet at some point, yes
And maybe we'll meet then, look at that. Well, at least we already talk on the phone
Sure, that's nice. And how long have you been there?
A year, more or less, year and one month, year and two months, something like that, yes
Ah, look at that. Just like, well, no. I came here in january, so, ok, a year too

Sure, yes, not even a year and I'm now
Ah, okay, I came here in October
Ah, look at that, how nice. And are you happy?
Well, yes, yes, yes, I don't know. Well, I like, I like, well, they city, more or less, because of Mariano, you know
What?
is not Boston, is not Boston but it is cute and
Yes they were fascinated with Boston, that, that Philadelphia is not so beautiful, I don´t know. But I want to know it either.
yes, no. They have another. So, I went to Boston once, too. I went for a weekend, I have a friend there too. And I loved it. It seems that Boston is like a toy, is all cute and clean,
And Philadelphia is a city like the Argentinian cities, Do you understand? they have cute things but others things are a disaster and
Ah, look, of course, He said the same. The noise they make. I am going to
Of course, yes.
the supermarket to buy meat for, for Christmas because
Ah.
My siblings live here in Miami then I come to spend holidays and feel a little of hot weather.
Ah, look how good. What? Do you have all your family in United States? No? Your brothers.
Eh, my sister, my sister and her brother in law and my little nephew, and my brother, they are living here in Miami.
Ah, look, what a luck to have them near you. Lets see
yes, of course.I really found this work because my sister lived in Boston, I came to visit her and that is how I found.
Ah
But later they came to live in Miami.
Ah, ah, ah. An well, they went to look for a little bit of hot. Boston, cold right? terrible.
yes, terrible. The truth is that it was terrible cold and it was nice too. Here I am, I was at the beach today
Great, how nice.
It is incredible, the same country and there is snow, everything, is like, I don´t know.
And it is different. I went to Miami some time ago, to a congress and, and the people is different, at least. Most of them speak Spanish. You feel like you were not in the United States when you are in Miami.
as it, as it, all of them. And I went to Buenos Aires Baker and I ate some invoices and oh, che, I was listening the conversation of the other table
Sure, not here. Philadelphia I believe, it's even worse than Boston.
Amazing, that's amazing.
because there's no, I mean, we do have Hispanics but, there are no Argentinian restaurants, nothing from Argentina.
Sure, well, we only have one and it's a bit far away, I've only been there once
Aha, and how was it? Was the food tasty or  not?
yes, no, you eat well, that's right, you do eat well and you can have a Quilmes beer.
Oh. Oh.
that's good and oh, I was going to ask you something but I forgot. Are your boys there? Oh no, the boys left for California.
No, they went to California, yes, yes, yes, yes, they left, when did I last see them? On Thursday, I believe they were leaving yesterday, yes.
Oh. I'm going to call them tomorrow, that's for sure. What about you, do you have friends in Boston?
I have one friend but she doesn't know anything about biology, she's a friend from school, she went to Harvard for a while and then she married an American man and she stayed there.
Oh, that's fine, so, she has nothing to do with it, then.
Oh no, nothing to do with biology, no, I hope I get to meet some. I also have one friend, her name is Ana Avalos, do you know her?
Sure.
But she works, I don't really know where she works, I think it's Tufts or in Harvard, I don't know. Ana Avalos.
Ana? No.
She's the only girl, was, she's younger than myself but oh yes, oh, oh, she's in Boston. Some other guys are from Mar del Plata but I barely knew them because they left a lot of years ago.
their names are Liliana and Eduardo.
No, no. No, I haven't met anyone from Mar del Plata in Boston.
Oh, No, and they're the only ones. After that i don't, i don't know anybody else
Oh, look at that, that's good, that's good, so we will surely meet
Yes
And the next time you come to Boston, call me
Just like that, how funny
Yeah, there's no problem
Look, that's very good. It's a very small world, four calls already?
Its, yes, and have you spoken to any
yes, and four less one, that i got a Mexican girl that i didn't know, well, one for you and the other Leticia and the other Mariano, i was laughing my ass of, I'm telling you
Oh, you, you got to talk to them about
I got them, but it was just a coincidence, it's not like we agreed on it or something. Yes, yes, yes, really funny
Oh, look, i haven't. Well, i got this and no, yesterday i was talking to an Argentinian that lived in Toronto and after that no, Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, to tell the truth it's really a bit crazy
Uh
to speak, it's interesting, meeting other people, talking a littler and
It's good, yes, it happens so quick, you see?, like you're left wanting to ask about everyday stuff
Yes, of course, just like that and afterwords, and you make some bucks too
And yes, and while you're at it, uh
That, obviously, and is it very cold in there or not?
Not here, it was really nice today. The truth is that it doesn't seem like Philadelphia, i went out, every time i go out, since there is heating in here because it's an old building, you see, it has air-conditioning heating
Yes, yes
You preserve the heat.  This is why when I go out I put on eighty layers of clothes and I go out.  And today I was too hot, I had to take off the hat, the gloves, everything because it was
There was a bit of sun, it was good.
Ah, how nice.  Yes, I was talking with my roommate who's from Argentina and she told me that it was fifty degrees
Ah.
Fahrenheit, obviously.  No?  What is it?  Ten.
yes, yes well, And there are, yes, it's minus thirty two I think it is, like nine or ten degrees.
Sure, yes. she has a method, good.  Thirty, and, forty makes eh, it's five, forty and five, ten, fifty, fifteen, like that.
Ah, that's good, because I always do minus thirty two divide two but no.
And after, Sure, no, like that is good.  She made the calculation, it's great.
Great.  Sure.  How is it?  Forty you add five, forty five, ten and fifty, fifteen.
Sure, just like that.
The, the rest, you don't add.  No.
Sure, exactly.  Sixty would be twenty.
Yes, there, there, there, there.
There it is, how nice.
Blink, blink the math.
yes, so, no?  We study so much
yes, yes.  And with inches, and with pounds, don't they make you crazy?  I, I, no no no
Ah, I still don't know
Now recently I've started to lose a bit, they say everything to me in miles, in inches, in pounds.  I keep looking at it like they're saying, for it to add up.
yes, I still don't know how tall I am, let's say, in feet.
Ah no, in feet, no, no, no, no. Because even the differences are very small because a person who is five feet is really short, but someone who's six is like
Sure, as such.
But it's like I don't have the, like it's five and something that you should measure, but no, no.
Sure, yeah,that's it.  And, how many calls do you have?
And this is the fourth I think.  Yes, I started a little while ago.  yes, yes, yes.
Ah.  Ah no, this is my seventh.  Ah, I'll tell you something, have you seen that if you make five calls on different phones you earn fifty dollars more?
yes.  yes, yes, yes, yes.
How is this?  It's within the twenty eh the, the twenty five calls or after?
I don't know if it's in total.  Sure, it wasn't very clear to me either I ha-.  Like in reality I was missing a lot and I didn't give, but
And think that it's five plus the twenty, I think it's like this.
Ah, okay.
But I'm not sure.  But seen that when your profile appears, the maximum number of calls appears, twenty.
yes.
So, I don't know, I had a doubt because it the maximum is twenty then it would be within the twenty.
Ah sure well, this, this.  I will write, I will send a mail and I will ask them because yeah I'm already at seven
I want to find out.  Besides here I have my si- my sister's telephone, my brothers, all to do this.
Sure.  And keep doing it, all after the last one is left.
Sure, it's I don't know, five in a row.  It won't be five in a row, it doesn't have anything to do with it.
No, no.  It shouldn't have anything to do with it.  No, no, not for.  No, no.  I don't think so.  Inc-
Sure. Sure, you see. Now, Lau- Lara, is Laura your name?
Me? No, Maria Ines.
yes, oh, quite different, I don't know why, that's so funny.l Well, I'm sure, well, maybe I'll be there next month or something, I'll take a China bus on the weekend and and
And you'll come here. It's on.
and I might go visit my friend.
yes, yes, yes, yes, oh, you are going to like it. Philadelphia is a beautiful city, it has it's ups and downs, it has interesting things to see and
No, I really want to visit, now that we are here right? We should visit places.
We better, yes, I'd have to travel a bit far away, to all the cities that are nearby. I'm still missing New York, it's the first one in the whole world that I saw
I don't really like the idea of it but
So, no, you know what? Go there in the summer, it's completely different
In the summer? yes.
yes, it's really nice, I loved it in the summer, like two days, full, two full days, you sleep there oh, but are you coming back?
In a hostel, I can go back during the day because I live quite near, it's one hour away from here.
Hey, you've never been there yet?
No, no, no, I don't know, I know, everyone hates me for that, but the ones from Argentina too, they tell me they can't believe it, they say I'm an idiot, how is it that you've never been there? And I'm like, no, I don't know why.
Sure, how long are you staying?
Oh, I still don't, my contract is valid until October of next years and then I don't know if I'm going to renew it or not. I don't know yet.
That would be two years. Sure, it's all right.
yes, yes, so far you, I mean, five years top, right? For a post-doctorate but I think that my bosses subvention has it
Sure.
for the pay I receive, she has it for more than a year. So I think that until July two thousand and seven, something like that, well, and
Ah, of course, what a shit
nothing. Now I am looking for a scholarship, but, I am not to excited because I don´t want to stay here for three more years, so let see if
Of course, I am going through the same thing. I have two more years of work in this place, but
Of course.
But it looks to me that I want just one more year, nothing more. Lets say to learn what I wanted to learn
yes.
then I prefer to learn other things. Lets say, I have to make this place.
Are you here? yes, yes, yes. And would you go for the postdoc to another place?
Of course, that is, a thing like that, but I don´t know, lets see. I am happy, lets say, I am happy living this situation but is not the right place for me, for my life.
No, you don´t like it. Do you want to come back to Argentina? right.
I would like it, I would love it, I love it, I´m in love with Argentina but I don´t know. We scientists are jerks. How could you be a scientist in - being Argentinian? Right? We are.
Of course, no. No, no, no. we are big jerks, but well.
And well, see it.
No, I think I am going to come back. yes, I don´t, I don´t
Of course.
Hello
My name is Miriam.
Hello Miriam, Marcela.
Nice to meet you Marcela Where are you calling from?
Well I'm here in Salem, North Carolina.
Okay I'm here in Toronto Canada
Oh, you're far
You're already far, yes.
Where are you from?
I'm, I'm from Lima, Peru.
Ah, I'm from Argentina.
yes, I noticed the accent
you can always see our true colors
Yes And tell me Marcela, Do you travel a lot?
Honestly no, travel, I've traveled, of course the first big trip that I've had, was when I was nine  when my parents immigrated to the United States.
mm, mm
And Then In the summer I'm fifty one so this is old history
mm
in the summer of seventy, of seventy I was fifteen years old and went to Europe. For the summer, yes that was fun, and then the next summer of seventy one we went to Argentina.
In the whole time that we had arrived since sixty four that we hadn't returned.
wow
And this, after I didn't go out any more until eighty five when I went back to Argentina.  I was already thirty and I went back with my three year old son,
hmm
for three years.
aha
And after this, well, I moved, my husband had entered into the army and we moved from Los Angeles to North Carolina
aha
and after I didn't travel again except to go to New York because my older son was at NYU, and now lives in Connecticut
aha
And so, eh, these trips, and to Miami to see my mom and my father when they traveled from Argentina because it's cheaper if they
come to Miami, so I go to get them.
aha.  Oh, how nice, and you travel by plane, or by bus
Well when I go to New York or to Miami we go in the car.
aha, aha, oh how nice.
in the car, yes, but after the summer of two thousand for I traveled with my husband and my older son, who's seventeen, we have two sons, that's all.
aha
And we went to, to Buenos Aires.
aha
And it was the first time that my husband went to Argentina because he couldn't go in eighty five when I went.
Oh, your husband is Argentinian too.
No, no, he's American
Oh, that's nice. And you? you didn't lose the accent
no, because I never spoke English at home
Oh, your husband speaks, uhm, Spanish
No, not at all, because at home, we all speak english, my, my kids are bilingual because when they were little, I speak to them in spanish, it feels weird speaking in English
yeah, yeah, sure
but once my son was nine, and the eldest, was three, I don't know what happened, we started speaking more and more English and now we communicate more in english
yeah
It's rare that we speak spanish, but when my parents are here, everyone speaks spanish. Except Rene, my husband, who doesn't,  no, he knows a word here and there, but he's never made any effort
oh, look at that
And he's said, he has said he's going to learn because he doesn't want to go back to Argentina without understanding or speaking, but he hasn't done anything yet
Oh, nice, but then, you, you have the accent because of your daddy, right?
Sure
Because otherwise, if it's not in the environment, or sorry, in the country, it's very hard to keep it
yes, I think it is. But I don't know. I don't know because I, I haven't met any other people, from Argentina who've been here for a long time
and my sons have both an Argentinian accent
Look, how nice, how interesting
Especially the youngest, the eldest has it a little more mixed up
yeah, yeah
because when he was a student he worked for a long time in a restaurant, and in restaurants he spoke Spanish with people from Mexico
Yeah aha, aha
And so, he has a touch of Mexican that makes him very nice.
yes, because sometimes one can spread it.
oh yes, yes, yes, oh yes.
Without wanting it, one goes around catching it, leaving it here, leaving it there.
yes, yes, yes
And the accents don't mix.
And this is good but, but the little one especially has an Argentinian accent, mixed with the American accent, but it's an Argentinian accent.
aha, how interesting.
this, it's funny, that they still don't have the accent.
And your Spanish is really good, really pure.  Yes because there are people who are like you, true.
hmm
So the English, true, there are people who
yes
whose Spanish isn't that great.
yes when I speak English I speak totally without an accent.
aha
I don't have any accent when I speak English
And you will speak like an American because you learned English since you were really young.
from when I was really small, yes, and in
Yeah but, your Spanish is really good too.
oh, thanks.
yeah, yeah, how nice.
yes, your
Look, I'm a coward, I pretty much don't like to travel.  I, eh, before nine eleven happened I was already afraid of planes.
with nine eleven I'm a lot more scared.
Ah, but you're
I don't like planes much.
you're losing opportunities,
It won't be, because look, I came to Toronto.  And here I stayed, I traveled by car to Montreal, to Quebec, to Ottawa
hmm
And these are my travels, nothing more.
Ah, well, you have to get up because, the truth is that it's much more dangerous in a car that in a plane.
That's what they say, yeah.
Understand me, because the statistics.  And besides I think that when you enter, when you enter with the exit ticket, you know?  It's marked, the exit ticket, if it's your turn, it's your turn, and this is the day and there's nothing you can do.
eh, and in any moment I think, because this can happen also in the safety of my house.  This really happens yeah.
yes, yes, you can go to unplug the iron and there you are.
Yeah, and, it's true.
So this is why you have to get inspired.
yeah, yes, I have to get inspired, and travel there.
yes I would like to go to Barcelona, because my grandparents are Catalan.
oh, look, how nice.
And I have family in Barcelona, but I've never met them, and they haven't met me
aha
They know I exist, but no, nothing else.
mm
And then I would like to go to Barcelona, because when I went to Europe, I went to London, went to Paris. I went to Switzerland, Florence, Rome and Naples, but we didn't go,
to Barcelona, we didn't go to Spain at all.
oh, well look how nice, you've traveled.
And then, eh, I would like to travel to Spain, but specifically Barcelona.
right how nice.
And I'm also curious to go to India.
Oh, India wow, that is so big.
yes and always here hoping for the opportunity to come, I'm not going to see it, what a shame because the issue is going to China,
aha
Oh before because it's changing so fast
aha
so fast everything, that in five years the China that you will see, is not the China eh, that one, go to the China of your fantasy you see.
Of the western people, that we have certain fantasies of certain countries, of how they are,
mm, mm
Uh, like it's going forward so much and it's capitalizing so much, and it's the whole society is changing, it won't be the same China
Uh huh, and, why don't you travel?, what stops you, the money or the job?
Cash, cash, yeah, money
Oh, the money, yeah, well, the money is terrible, yeah
Money
But, and a
Yeah, the truth is that the money, and the children, now  the youngest one is about to finish high school, so next year, when he's at college, i will have more freedom
Uh, but my husband has a more steady job
Yeah, right
And so, you can't just say, "well, let's travel"
Right, right
Do you understand me?, but if i had the money, i would be travelling, because i love to travel
Oh, that's good
I love to travel, if someone has to travel, i say to him, uh, do you need a ride to the airport?, I'll take you; because i love airports.
The train stations, the airpor- i love it, it gives me that feeling, you see, of anticipation, like if I'm about to get on to something that's gonna take me to some place
Oh, look at that, how nice, oh, how nice, you have an adventurous spirit, you were born with a spirit like that, right?
I love it, look, when i was sixteen years old, i had done
Right
a whole plan, to travel through train from Los Angeles to Buenos Aires
right
I was going to go on the train, I went on the train to Los Angeles, to San Diego, from San Diego to Tijuana, from Tijuana to Mexico City, and I had everything,
you can do this?
oh yes, yes you can, you can and my parents,
wow how interesting.
Didn't want me to do it, but they closed their mouths, they didn't say anything
oh
But after the mess happened in Nacaragua,
yeah aha, the
And and so there, in the seventies.  And so it wasn't the same, it was dangerous, a young.
dangerous
eh, a woman alone,
alone
eh, traveling.  I must have been crazy, but when you're sixteen, seventeen, you think you're invincible.
It's true, yeah.
And after when my husband was in the army.  And he came here, my older son, well my younger son wasn't born yet.  He was five and we were,
so happy because we didn't have to come with a van that we had,
aha
has to cross the country, and we had to wait a week, and visit places and things like that, well it happened that, they stole the van.
Aye, what a shame, aha
And just days before leaving.  And when they found it it was totally destroyed, they had taken everything.
aha, aha,
So well, the insurance paid us a little money compared to what the van cost.  And we came by airplane, that adventure was stolen.
Ay, what a shame,
They didn't steal my car, it's not that they stole my car, they stole the adventure.
The adventure, what a shame, it's never too late, now, like you said, your son will to to university, you'll have more free time,
yes, yes, I think that I'll have more, more opportunity.  Now what I have to do is get some money together.
Sure, and don't get scared of the bad guys, the bad people along the way.  I don't know, I've changed my thinking a lot about
You know what crossed my mind,
ah
It crossed my mind, sure when I go to New York or something like that.  I make sure, like, since I'm taking my wallet.
eh, I'm in the middle with a lot of people around me.  You know, eh, I'm conscious, even when I went to Buenos Aires in two thousand four, I was conscious, I didn't go around with my wallet.
aha, aha
Because sure, they saw me with my husband speaking English.
And they think that we have money, aha.
They think, ah, they come from the United States they have money.
aha
And we didn't have money, we were dying of hunger.
Yeah
But this, everyone said don't take your wallet.  Don't take your wallet, don't take jewelry, don't take anything.
no,
Because since the times are hard, there's much more crime in Buenos Aires.
there, there they take your wallet, the
yes, yes, yes
oh, it's like Lima, Lima is terrible, until
Hi, this is Vanessa from San Diego
Hi, this is Carlos, from Houston, Texas
Um, uh, from Houston?
Houston, yes
And, how's it over there, cold?
Uh, here?, no, not at all, it's beautiful here, uh, in the seventies, uh, super cool, and there?
Oh, that's interesting, i thought it would be chilly
No, thank god, the last days, uh, days, uh, uh, we wore shorts and t-shirts
Uh, well, it's the same here, it's always around the sixties, sixty five, maybe at night it goes down to the fifty five, around that.
That's good
Yes, uh huh
Where, where are you from?
I'm from Puerto Rico, and you?
Uh, likewise, that's like
uh
The voice told me
How long have you been in the United States?
Uh, five years and a half
Oh yes?, do you like it?
I, i love it. I mean, I'm here for college more than anything, so i don't have, i didn't have much choice to stay in Puerto Rico
Uh, oh, what are you studying?
Uh, virology, i work with viruses
Wow, that's interesting
Yes
Are you doing a doctorate?
Yes
Wow, look at you, can i, then I'm going to ask you something: there was, reading a while ago, well i, i'm very interested in alternate forms of medicine to, uh
help with diseases and viruses and i was reading about the, uh, coconut oil, have you studied the, or the, what the coconut oil does for killing certain viruses and all that?
Uh, no, i never heard of that before
Yes, a while ago i was reading a lot of that, that it helps for the HIV, the AIDS, the osteoporosis, hepatitis and many things more, and that it's a
a, uh, something, oh, they say it's almost miraculous
Wow, that's good
So, look, so let me, what do you plan on doing after you finish your doctorate?
Uh, i still haven't decided, research, uh, teach, i don't know, we'll see
And what's your specialty then?
Pardon me?
Do you have any specialization?
Uh, well i mean, uh, viruses. I mean no, not in particular
Oh, nothing in particular. Oh, that's very interesting, Hail Mary, that's good, so i imagine you're not going back to Puerto Rico
Uh, no, i mean, i go there every year, i mostly go there for Christmas, uh, stuff like that, but no, in Puerto Rico there isn't, generally there isn't much work for me
No, well I'm talking about the topic, I haven't returned to Puerto Rico since ninety eight and things were like so I don't know, so bad, when I went over there that I have no interest in returning there.
And I hardly have any family anyway so I don't have much reason to go.
Okay Listen, I mean, I always go because here five and a half years. I always go every year at least for one or two weeks.
But, I mean for me, I mean I think that in San Juan, I don't know I don't think that, I've never had any problems, never
the family, has never had problems with anything, so, thank God.
Aha are you in San Juan?
yes.
Ah, how good.
No right now I'm in Houston. I was there two months ago.
Ah
Eh usually, when, the time I have to travel that's what I do.
Ah, I don't, I don't like
Go to Puerto Rico.
traveling too much because I'm terrified of planes
Ah,
and I try not to ride one unless I have to, ride it by force.
Okay.
So
if that wasn't the case, where would you like to go?
I well, In May God willing I'm going to Spain, Italy, to Europe. Ah.
What a good life, what a good life!
yes, yes
Eh, I was there, I was there in May. Eh, I was in Holland
Oh, how nice
And I really loved it, it amazed me. I'm crazy to go back
And you went there to study?
yes, to wo- to work. I was, I spent one week working and one week on vacations
Oh how nice, I guess it was interesting
Oh yes, beautiful, beautiful. Travelling, relaxing, not having to worry for the work, it was basically like I go somewhere, sit down, give me a beer, I am going to
some other place, another beer. No worries at all, that is divine
Oh, how good. And are there many Puerto Rican in Houston?
Eh, right. Eh, for what I am seeing people keep coming here. Eh, when I first arrived I didn't know too many, and the last years it's like people keep coming here, like
Oh
in the medical centre, so there are a lot of universities. So many people come here to study, so
Mhm. Oh, how good. You know what? In San Diego I haven't met any Puerto Rican
Oh
And I've been here about fou- four fi- five years, and not a single Puerto Rican
Oh, sure
Mhmh, yes, so things don't look good, but obviously there are a lot of Mexican and that's all I've met. I haven' met
really, no one else here, only Mexican
Wh- when I moved here there were two Puerto Ricans and, well, eh, the next year four more came, and the other year, and every year came about three or four
always, eh, it is so
And do you think it is because of the working situation in Puerto Rico, that it got better?
No, it's rather because eh, here in Hous-, where I am, in the medical center, there are so many hospitals and universities that many people come here for that
Ah, I have a lot of friends, a lot of them in Florida. It looks like everybody enjoys going to Florida. In Orlando
Eh, basically in Puerto Rico
yes, and specially, by, I think by Orlando, in that area it is, there is
yes, my brother moved there last year, my brother
Who, who? Oh, does he like it?
yes, yes
And is he also in school and so?
No, mechanical. I am the only one in my family
Oh, yes, yes, over there in  Southern New York. And it has also been long since I went to New York and New Jersey
But I also have family there, that's life. No, I don't travel often, now I camp a lot, and I try, I do try to travel along the California coast
and, you know, eh, visiting different places here in California because there are so many things to see, but the so called big trips I haven't done any for many years
And where else would you like to go besides Europe?
Eh, no. That's the first I would like to do, but besides that, I would like to travel the whole coast of California, go part Oregon, Washington
and afterwards Canada, and get to Alaska if I can. But I would like to do that by train or car to see everything
I am crazy to go to Austarlia
Oh yes
because it has caught my attention
yes, my husband, but I have never,I have never had any interest in going to Australia, no. But, what would you like to see in Australia? Because it is in another continent and the difference, but
Eh, a little of everything. Number one, I mean, I have seen documentaries about such things in the TV and it looked very nice, the beach, the
surfing, nature, I mean, you can go camping, backpacking. Uhm, and besides I find the Australian accent fascinating
Do you camp a lot? Do yo go backpacking and so?
I love it, I'd like to do that, travelling. I like going on the Appalachian way
yes
that goes from, I think it goes from Georgia to the very North. All of it. I love everything that is somehow related to nature. I love camping, going to
One of my favourite places, I lived some time in Tennessee, in Nashville. And I used to go there quite often to camp eh, I used to go on river rafting, eh
Things like this. Here in Texas there are not many places to go camping. I like one place, in Huntsville, about one hour far from Houston.
There I can go camping, ether is a lake to go kayak. And I can also go paddling. I love all these things
look, we have a lot of that here, you know. If you have heard about the Appalachian trails, then you must have heard of the Pacific, haven't you?
yes
Well, we are into a group, it's like the boy-scouts but its called Venture Group, it's for both men and women, and we
go on excursion to the Pacific
OK
Eh, backpacking and so, we go for two or three days and try to do little stages, but it is very interesting and hard as well. You would never say it is that hard, carrying those
big backpacks, weighting sixty pounds or so. Very nice. Here the climate is always comfortable, so camping is easy.
I heard San Diego is a perfect place to travel to, you don't need no air-conditioned or heater
No
It's always nice, the weather is really nice there
yes, the weather is really nice, and beautiful, there are beaches, lakes, mountains, deserts, everything
So, if you drive an hour in one direction, you arrive to the mountains,the snow, if you drive one hour in the other direction, you are in the desert
You know, other site with lakes, There are really everything to
Like I was saying
To do, I mean, you can, mmm
Like I was saying, in Puerto Rico, you can be
Really yes
A little low on beach, a little low in caves, or dry forest
Really yes, In a larger scale here, but Puerto Rico, it's the only site I've visit that has that much
topography
And where you would not like to travel?
No, I'm not interested in going to Japan, my Husband has travel to Japan in work, he really like it, but he says is
all that different and that many people, I don't have any interest in, and you?
I mean, nor Japan, nor Chine, Asia in general, it doesn't interest me, maybe a little bit
Good day. Good evening
Yes, Good evening, eh. I'm Gloria from here from California
Ah, hello Gloria, I'm Marco. I'm in Philadelphia and let's start with "Merry Christmas"
pardon?
Eh, I wanted to start with "Merry Christmas"
Oh, thanks, likewise
Thanks, thanks Eh, Let's see, trips Eh, I, grew up in Paraguay, in South America I mean I came from there, I came here to the United States, Where do you come from?
I'm originally from Guatemala.
Ah, from Guatemala, okay
And, yes my biggest dream is to know Jerusalem
Ah
Eh, all of it, and its surroundings,
yes, yes, the Middle East in general
mm yes, eh, but the main thing, the most important
yes
Would be the money
details, details, eh
aha
One thing I had seen in the, we are already in the twenty first century One of the things, for example, communication Which includes, what type of phone are you using? A cellular or?
it's a cordless is from the house,
ah okay, wireless.  I, I for example am talking with a cell phone, eh,
ah
I make my connections, when I call from my house I use the, the telephone company that uses, eh, that's basically a line
hmm
Eh, through the Internet, is the telephone connection
Oh,
I see, I can still talk with my dad who's in Paraguay, eh, family there, I have a brother in San Francisco who I've been to see a few times, some times
hmm
It seems that the communic- it's so, it's easier.  I go to visit my dad once every year more or less
hmm
And I go in twelve house, I go from here to there, Eh, I go Philadelphia - Miami, or Philadelphia to New York, from New York to
San Paolo, Brazil, from Brazil to Asuncion in Paraguay
hmm
Eh and come from the other side to go to Europe, for example, where up until now I haven't been.  But this, this is the place I want to go to
I'm compromising now to, me and my fiance we want to go, we would like to go to Europe, being in Philadelphia it's really easy
oh,
The flight there costs less than two hundred dollars
hmm
from here to Paris, a direct flight
hmm
In one jump, and a few hours, eh, it seems to be that our ability now to be able to travel, communicate, to send, eh
hmm
send, eh, things by mail, by fedex, or by, whatever
hmm
Eh, changes the way of seeing the world.  Everything seems a lot closer.  Eh, from here, I, for example in case of an emergency
Eh, I could practically go to any part of the world in less than a day
hmm
And can go whenever I want
yes, it's like a power
I, I like it a lot
to visit other places and more when you have the opportunity
Sure, sure, I've always realized that, the details, like we said, for example, the money
yes,
Eh, even though, traveling is much cheaper now than before
Yes, but
Yeah,
for me it's not,
cheaper, it's not
To not
No, cheaper isn't the same as saying cheap.  This is, it's less expensive than before, that's all
yes true
yes but traveling still, still cost Eh
yes,
Even if you drive
I would also like very much to know Spain I more than anything have researched a lot but like on the internet each place that I think of on the internet and
yes
I imagine like I'm in those places, no that's the only way that I can do it, otherwise no, my economic situation is not
Not enough for now
It doesn't allow me, yes
yes, that is definitely I wanted to go to Paraguay for example, I remember when I had just gotten to the United States, like ten years ago Eh,
Eh, Calling on the phone to Paraguay, it cost approximately a dollar per minute Eh, And me being young, back then of course I would call home and say hi to my mom
I would talk with my dad
mm
A while: hello, how are you! twenty dollars, it was a while
yes. Now is much easier, right,
Now is much more, that's much more cheaper and back then I would pay more than one thousand dollars. It was the trip from Kansas to Paraguay
mm
Eh, now I'm in Philadelphia, the last time I went, it's been already like two years
mm
it's been already, almost three years that I don't go
mhm
However, the last time that I was there, I remember that I had to pay around five hundred and sixty dollars
mhm
Instead of the usual thousand, eh, it's so much easier now than it used to be
mhm
But they are still, it's still five hundred and sixty dollars that
mhm
and earning per the hour, that's a good deal
yes, yes, if you make some numbers, how many hours, you many hours you work
yes, exactly, exactly
to be able to give yourself a little treat, I mean, to be able to be with your family, no
I remember the last time that I was in Paraguay, some friends were there and they asked me about it and I remember that at that time I was earning about two thousand dollars per month.
and I was working so hard, and I was like a computer technician, eh, eh software too
mm
and I, when, when I said that I was earning two thousand dollars per month, that's
mm
twenty four thousand per year, that's something, but it's not fantastic
Not here
Here, exactly, not here,
aha, aha
I remember when I was there I was wanting to say to the person, to the person I am making good money but I'm not a millionaire and well then
ah, I know some from Paraguay, a couple and I like them a lot a lot of them talk like that
yeah,
It calls a lot of attention, it looks good I like it well, the tone of voice that they have there, you're able to understand it very well
Thank you, thank you ah, one that I remember is that I told them I only make two thousand, two thousand dollars!, over there two thousand dollars
Eh, it's it's well, they would have said a million dollars practically, it's
mh
a ton of money for them. Especially now that they are in an economic recession, with all that, it's difficult to try and
yes, there are a lot of places that you know people would like to see, right? but there's a lot of obstacles a lot of things that they don't allow anyway
Sure,
It's worth it to dream
yes, no, eh, I have a, I have a brother in San Francisco yeah and it's being in San Francisco he also works in IT eh,
Network Administrator and one thing that I know that he can do each time, the new Sony PSP comes, the PSP, it's a thing that is a, the
Like a little toy practically
mhm
what's it cost, I think like three hundred, four hundred dollars
mh
yes, he bought one he was complaining that he doesn't have any money, that he can't travel, he can't come, I couldn't sorry, my mother is here in Philadelphia also
Eh, my Mom doesn't, he couldn't eh, this year he couldn't come to visit because he didn't have the money
mmh
But he had just bought a new digital camera, but an expensive one, he also bought a new laptop too
hmm
expensive,
hmm
because it was the latest, it was the latest one to come out
hmm, yeah I imagine
But the thing is that he for example, with the last one, the new one came out, of this, he had the last one, that had just come out of the factory
hmm
eh, it's still hot, and he has it
hmmm
He's happy with this but, this left him with no money, he almost can't do anything more than this
yes,
hmm, this is a decision that, for example, he made the decision, he preferred to have a new device
He's always so avant-guarde
Ah, exactly, avant-guarde in anything having to do with technology
aha
But, ah, this cost him, this cost him the power
Aye, no
to travel, the power to do things he wants to do
hmm
other things, eh.
hmm
if you have to choose, either this, or you do this
or it's one or the other, say,
One, or the other, it, it can't be both
aha
And this is something that, I think it's stupid when, seeing that he complains that he doesn't have money, but after he talks about his new PSP
hmm
you choose one
People like this don't grab my attention, you know, because more than anything it's like, like I told you, more than anything like always excel, no?
yes,
Even if after like we say, in my land we're snapping our fingers there, because he does it, or now I need
For example, there, I buy things, things recently are pretty expensive but I take care
hmm
I gather every bit, with care
hmm
And I have it for a long time
hmm
Eh, for example, my telephone, my telephone for example, it's an iPod that's expensive, but I've had this for a few years
Eh, in technology, when I bought it it was cutting edge, the latest one, but now, it's already showing its age,
mhm
But it's still useful to me, I need to have the very last
mhm mhmh
I need something that is useful to me. Eh, that doesn't mean that
If we analyse it, the times are not to be in the vanguard but to somehow survive, right? that's how things are
Yes, even, what I am doing is, I am studying now to, to be able, to be able when I finish studying to find a job and get paid enough
mhm
enough to keep in the vanguard, without, without worries
mhm
Without, eh
yes, is New York,
Well my name is Claudia. Ah, sorry. With whom do I have the pleasure?
yes is New York. What Claudia?
Yes, my name is Claudia.
Where are you from?
Ah look I'm from Mexico City, and where are you from?
Eh, I'm from Panama, but from where where where are you calling from?
Ah look I, I'm calling from, the state of Idaho
Oh. You're from the potato.
And where are you at? yes, and where are you from?
In New York. New York.
Oh, look, from the other side. yes, well so
The stat- yes tell me.
yes, listen, what do you think about music? Does it play an important role in your life?
yes? Is that music fills the, How do you say it? The lonely moments of my life. Always when I'm alone that I need to hear I need something to give.
And fill me spiritually. I always choose music and How do you say it? It transmits the, How do I tell you? Information, which I need to continue. You could say that.
Wow, look also for me, well music is something very important because, for example, I like to be cleaning my house and all that and doing for example
and I put the radio on to cheer me up or to finish sooner, faster the truth is I do like music a lot, and, and my favorite music is
Aha.
is the peaceful one, the music that's not so loud em that keeps me for example, um, I don't know with a calm spirit.
Like instrumental.
and something like that, like instrumental, but also for example, sometimes um I put on music for example cumbia, salsa, music because I also like that music to dance to.
Aha.
that's to, for example if I need to hurry faster, for example when I clean the house I put that type of music
Aha and
and woo I hurry faster, than if I put an instrumental one yes, I like it a lot, and what type of music do you like?
yes Okay Well eh, in reality I don't have a preference.
uh um
I like instrumental music, I like jazz music, eh. I like the, I like any type of music but I like
aha
To listen to I like Jazz and I also like instrumental which is almost like repetition.
oh.
And, I myself fill up the part, the spiritual part with my thought, the part of the music that doesn't have, doesn't have words like my thought. I listen to reggeaton I listen to any type of music.
yes aha
Eh, the salsa, the cumbia, I listen to anything I like it. As long as it has a message. And the, and the song that has a message I like much more, understand.
oh um
That just listening to something that it's just noise for the ears, understand, that something that has no message, that doesn't have something
yes
constructive, for example, there's music that always talks of eh, of a man than of a woman or a woman than of a man that the feelings failed, broken feeling, broken heart
aha
that I'm going to cry, that I'm not going to cry. That, that type of music doesn't attract me to much for the sense of reason of, sense of reason that
that instead of cheering you up, it depresses you.
yes, it gets you, yes true, I don't like that type of music either is bad normally the music, for example, there's country music which is from my country
and it talks a lot of that type - sincerely I get to listen to it but is not really my favorite, really almost the same like you say, instead of cheering me up it gets me sad and, and no, then I like happy music a lot, the music
that wakes up a good spirit, the music that has a good rhythm to dance if it's the time to dance
Aha.
The music that keeps me in a good mood and, and for example in the house now I listen, to children's music now because my son is now almost two years old then he also likes the music and I also put children's music
Children. How nice.
And I also like it, and I'm singing it, the music that I remember the songs that my mom used to sing to me when I was little and I sing them to my son and then
there's always music in my house, and then, we can live maybe without the television but, without the radio honestly, like I don't think I could live so much.
Aha. Likewise I likewise get
Because yes, yes, I use the radio a lot
yes, me too, the radio, I depend a lot on the radio almost that, I'm always listening to the radio, in the car, in the house, I'm always listening to music.
Aha.
And I like to feel it because it really cheers me up, it cheers me up, it cheers me up and when it cheers me up, it makes me faster, it accelerates me, like you say.
yes yes.
And I also learn from it because, I tell you, there are music songs that have a message and it's an important message for us, for me
yes. yes. yes is true, look that's true, honestly I think that the music plays a very important role and even for example um, for example there's folklore music, music from other countries
Aha.
that sometimes, for example, you don't understand it too much, but for example, you see that the people are dancing and they are playing this folklore music and that
The truth is, even if you don't understand it, you feel, oh, well, you feel a peace so great and it starts to get your attention because people is dancing
And so, i think that it, the music can help you, most of the times, to unite other cultures and other countries.
And you're watching how people is enjoying it, you even want to participate, you want to be there and dance if you can, uh, i don't know, i mean, i think that music is very, is very good actually
Sure, like everything, there is music that's, i feel that it's destructive, like there are a lot of people that have a lot of satanic music, so, the music is... well, i personally avoid that, right?
Right, yes
But i think that music, just as it can help you, it can destroy you, because that kind of music leads you to a lot of drugs, vices, i don't know
And other kinds of music, it kinda helps you get away or forget about that sort of thing and vices, or what do i know, what do you think about that?
Right, yeah, no, yes, you're right. There is music that really, uh, help you, it touches you, it washes your brain effectively, your conscious
Right
and transmits, it transmits to you, uh, negative ideas and thoughts
Yes
That without you knowing, it's there and there comes a time when you can't, uh, how do you say it?, toss it out in the air
Yes
Without knowing that, that really, it's a whole feeling of destruction, it goes inside you. But after you have gotten it, well, about, about the
Yes
The music, for example, there are lots of people who, when they were children, the family told them "oh, you're dumb, you're stubborn, you don't understand"
Yes
And that remains in your [sub] conscious, that they really think they're worthless
Yes, it's true
Uh, their, their, their, uh, [sub] conscious, not their conscious, but themselves, unconsciously think they can't give, uh, much, they can't give much
yes, yes it's true.
Well, this remains in- The music plays the same role. A song can play the same role as far as, certain information can be received and stored
yes.
without you realizing it, there comes a time that you eh, don't explore, eh, make it digente, you do it you throw it out
That yes.
And unfortunately it results in, in a catastrophe well hell that in eh mm he takes to a destructive level, for you or other people, understand
Yes, yes it's true.  Yes, because for example, and notice that he, the type, depending on the type of music that you listen to, eh, you start to dress, you start to behave.
You start to to style your hair, your appearance starts to reflect it
Ah.
I have realized that, for example, in Mexico, if you listen, for example, rock emm Mexican rock um Um, yes, rock in Spanish, and such, usually are pants eh jeans that fit really tight to your body with fonders and
Aha, Spanish rock.
And other type of clothes.  If, for example, you listen to dark music, satanic music, music like that, you wear black, you wear black eye makeup, and you wear your hair long if you are a man and
and you are like really mysterious, always and if it's, for example, you like salsa, you dress with, I don't know, with colorful shirts if you're a man or woman and
Aha.
And, I mean, like many times people can tell the type of music you listen to by the way you dress or how you behave.
Then, I think that the, the music plays and important role in your life. And it can help to, to improve your life
to have it, I don't know, more peaceful mm. Have more coexistence with the people or distance yourself from people, to be a loner, to be, I don't know, like very mysterious
and to destroy you many times. So then I think that, I think music plays a very important role. More, in the young people, nowadays that, that the type of music sometimes
yes.
Um is not very suitable and there comes a time when they start to listen to another type of dark music and in a month they've already changed, all their life
so, in a very short time
Yes
so, i think that music is very important, very, very important. what do you think
yes, because, like you say, music is a, music is a universal language
Uh huh
So, the same, the same song gives you a message, whether it's positive or negative, but
yes
Uh, if it's going to be handed to another person it's like a, me telling you that you're not worthy or you are worthy, or get up
Yes
Uh, rejuvenate, you're going to, you're going to be alright or if not, everything's over, die. You know, there are some things
Yes, yes, it's true, yes, because
And, uh
Yes, because i also realized that people, um, for example, young, uh, old people, well, of all ages, that listen to their music
uh, there comes a time when, for example, if the artist stands in every concert, they also stand at all times. Um, if, for example, they
Right
Uh, sometimes the kind of music you listen to, thy say that the drugs, uh, you're not going to
Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! How are you?
Hi, how are you?
Fine thank you, fine. This is Vicente and I am speaknig from New York
I am Luisa from Miami, Florida
From where?
Miami
from Miami, oh, Cuban?
What?
if you are from Cuba, originally from Cuba
Me Cuban? no
well, Miami, that's the first thing that comes to my mind, that you may be from Cuba
No, no, I am not Cuban. I am Colombian
Oh, Colombian, aha. Well, I am from Panama
From Panama, oh, we are near
yes, Panama was originally a part of Colombia
and how long have you been here?
Oh, I've been here, I've been here for about thirty years now
Thirty years! wow, a long time
yes, yes, yes I've been here for a long time. Ahmm I came from Panama, to study. It's called high school here but
in Panama it's called Second Cycle
Oh, I see
to High School, ok. And, well, here I went to school here as well. But we should be talkning about, what? music?
About music, yes
Oh, yes. I wonder how is music nowadays, but I heard recently that Reggae-ton comes from Panama. I don't know if it's right or no
I don't know. I don't know, but I heard it comes from Dominican Republic
What?
The Reggae-ton was born in Dominican Republic, that's what I heard. I'm not sure
Well, I heard Panama, I heard it in the Latim music TV and I know it was Reggae-ton. But I don't know
And this is what we know, right? I thought , I thought it was Dominican also
Aha
Because, because it has a lot of Reggae, that's from the island of Jamaica
yes
And Reggae-ton is like a combination of Rap, Sepa, eh Latin Rap and things like this, eh
yes, yes
But I heard that this and that, they showed it, I was watching something there. But the thing is that nowadays music
I don't really like Rap and all that. But the influence of Rap, eh, specially among young people, eh, what can I say?
Because I heard some, not here, in New York. Before the only Latin you could find in New York were Dominican and Puerto-Rican
now in New York there are from all over, from Peru, from Argentina, from Ecuador, Salvador. There are a lot of Ecuadorean here, a lot of what I call 'Incas'
from Peru. There are so many here in New York, right? and Mexican, Mexican music is, looks like Rap they go: 'lalalu, lalalu' they talk, you know what I mean?
But no, look you are talking to a Spanish, a Sapnish, right? from Spain. And in all the clubs
yes.
In all the clubs in Spain, Eh, eh, the reggeaton.
Yes, now that, that music Is very popular everywhere, here too the only thing you hear, Reggaeton, Reggaeton even in the Clubs
That are only of well, I mean
aha
Anglo-American I mean let's call them "Bad Gringos" Is that they are people that only that always put Hip Hop music only and no Latin music, they are putting Reggaeton
And everything, is very normal. Everybody dances to it.
yes, yes, yes, is the Music from Miami, the same as in Spain but the thing that one day, I was here in, ah. So then we have a China Town here in New York Right
Aha, yes
There were no Chinese in China Town and today today I said. Hey that's Rap. I didn't understand the word but the way they were
talking Chinese in the background music Right
Aha
I knew immediately that it was Rap. You understand?
yes.
What happens is that you were in and I said: Listen that's Rap.
Robin Chinese
And Chinese yes, the Chinese guy told me that yes. Exactly. I imagine that that Rap is in all the crap in all the world, in all parts. Because, what can I tell you
But, still, I love the Boleros, for me from the Latin Music, I like the boleros more than anything else. No, but Boleros are
soft, Understand? Love songs and things like that.
Sure and to dance or something, What music do you like?
and to, to listen to also, to listen to also.  The Bolero is more for listening.
No, no, I asked what kind of music do you like to dance to?
To dance to,
yes.
well to dance, I like American music
American
yes, yes, because it depends, Salsa is good too.  Because I put on the, the CD
Aha, but you don't
Huh?
but you don't like the Latin rhythms.  Like: Merengue,
Ahhh
Salsa, Bachata
Merengue, no.  Merengue is a bit too fast for me.  yes, the Merengue, the Dominicans, the Dominicans have two passions: Merengue and Baseball
yes, for Dominicans, Merengue and Baseball are the, their passion.  But Merengue is a little to fast for me, I don't know.
I find it a little bit too fast.  But I like old rock and roll, to dance.
Oh.
Like, like, disco, something like this.
And have you listened to Vallenato?
You know?  No, I listen to music in Spanish too, but, but to dance when I go to the disco, something like this.  You see it, nothing else.
That the disco music. How is it, this was very disco, eh, dancing, you know.  Any time.  Well, seventies, eighties, the disco.
and, yeah.  Music to dance.  It had a rhythm.  No, Latin music also has a lot a lot of rhythm, but I like this more.  But Merengue, ahhh
Sure.
A bit too fast.  I like to listen to the-
And no.
Latino, Latino songs too.  No but hey.  What I can tell you, music has changed a lot, eh.
Sure, yes.
The future, the future of music I can tell you, I don't know, I don't know what comes.  No, if it will b- music, or if it will be the Banda all the time, I don't know
you KNOW like Rap Rap.  They speak more than sing, you know?  Eh, it's speaking more than singing.  I don't know if this is he future or not.
But you like, what?  Latin music.  For you, for you, what, what do you like about it?
The music
I like all Latin music.  I love it.  Salsa, Merengue, Rettaeton, Vallenato, The Colombian Vallenato.  I like it a lot.
aha
Eh, What more?  Well I'm explaining to you that my Vallenato is Colombian.  I don't know if you know what that is?
uhhm, And how long have you been here in the United States, in the United States?
It will be two years.
Ah?
It's almost!  No, two years, I came here two years ago.
Only two years.
Yes, just two years.
Hmm
I'm new around her.
Ah?
I'm new around here.
Aha, yes, yes And in, in. For not going to Miami, there are so many well there are so many Latins in Miami that you will think that the Latins dominate
dominate the United States.
No.
Well No.
No, I know is not like that, because I used to  live in North Carolina before
Aha, Oh!
Then, yes. I know that the Latins don't dominate the world.
Okay.
See, they don't dominate the United States, but you do find many Latins here.
in New York, yes the Cubans and all those, I have a brother, that lives in Orlando.
yes in New York I, was also living like three months.
Aha,
And when I, when I was little, I would come a lot, would go a lot to New York.
You, you
Then, I know it.
You lived in New York, you said?
Three months, I was in New York. And before when I was younger, my mom would always bring me to New York. That we would stay three months, we would return to Colombia.
We would come here on a trip.
To which part of New York, would you come, where?
To Queens sometimes I would go to Queens Queens or sometimes I would go to Manhattan
Ah Manhattan, yes, because I live in Manhattan. I live in Manhattan, but you are from, When was the last time that you came to
New York?
To New York it's been like? Three years.
It's been like three years.
yes.
yes, yes. well, well it's still the , almost the same. Well, now we see already that there's a lot of Latin accent, like you say Right?
And Latin in all parts of the world.
yes,yes, yes.
And, there's influence, because here, there's a lot of the things they put, eh the things that are written,everything is in Spanish and in English, but I tell the Latins that look : When you come here
Make sure to learn English understand? And I say that, you are already, look that nowhere
Sure.
No, don't talk nonsense that you don't speak. No, talk and learn English because when you return to your country When I go back to Panama one thing I find is that,
all the richest people, and the people with most influence in my country speak English.
yes.
Only rich ones
Sure, is very important. if one has in their hand, the possibility of learning another language. The possibility of growing as a person, you have to take it.
yes, yes
Obviously, if you live in an English speaking country, you must learn to speak in English, no matter how many Latins you find around you
And not only, well, one thing, one important thing I can say in my life, when I left Panama I learned a lot more about my country
More about my country outside than when I was insdie
Aha
I'll tell you what, I learned more about mu country when I was outside than when I was inside. When you are inside,
aha
you, you, how is it? they feed you with politics. And falls, your country, loves you, and the, but when you go out, maybe you learn to observe
To observe and to think more, understand? About your country, the things that, you know, what happens and what does not happen, and things like this
And you can compare it to other countries when you are outside. Because in the Latin countries, the poorest people are fed with politics to eat
Sure
They tell them, they tell them that the United States are to blame for everything in the world, eh, and that makes me laugh
Because I tell them, I say, ah, ah, to me, seventy percent of your problem is internal. Thirty percent external
You know what I mean? Because they think that all the problems
yes
The problems of their country, are due to the United States. So,this is the policy of the rich and the middle class, tell the people
most of the people there. And they put the blame ob the United States, for everything. For instance, if you go out and observe your country
you will see that seventy percent of the problems are internal problems. And the other, thirty percent have an external cause
Ah. you know what I mean?
yes, yes
But you can tell them, you can just tell them because they won't believe you, specially the poorest. The poorest are fed politics
all, all, yes ,yes. And that's why Panama lives out of the most rich and powerful. They are all citizen, American citizen
yes
yes. Remember that in many Latin countries you can have two, what you call it? two citizenships. You can be a citizen of, Colombia if you are from Colombia you will always be a Colombian, right?
yes
You can go back to Colombia and vote, tomorrow if you fell like.
Sure
You will be a Colombian, even if you come here, and you become an American citizen, right?
You will keep your citizenship
yes
your, your, your what you call it?
Colombian citizenship
for all your life, understand?
yes, sir
It's the same in Panama. Understand? but I tell you, I see that all of the richest people and more powerful
in Latin America, and not only LatinAmerica but Europe and the rest of the world as well. I have travelled, I have travelled the world. All the rich and powerful people speak English
In addition to their natural language, you know what I mean? If I go to Egypt
yes
if I go to Germany, right? they speak German, but the most powerful, the richest they speak English as well. The international language of the richest is English
And most of the people don't speak it. When you see, business things, contracts and all that, written, between one country and one other
It's always written in English. If Argentina is about to, to do a contract, right? with Japan, what do you think
Hello Jose.
How is it going, Manuel, I'm in Orlando Florida.
How are you, I'm in New York.
Fine, eh, sorry, where?
In New York.
Ah, hi Jose, nice to meet you.
Likewise
Eh, well, so I hear you. You talk first.
oh, em. I think that on one hand, is good, sure that there's a system of handling, I don't know of controlling eh, what the
the kids can watch, or the type of movie or material that, they are making for a type of um, of particular audience, but
yes
eh, if we are talking about kids also part of the responsibility is also of, of the parent
Correct. Well, look that in that we fully agree. Eh, I think that those classifications are indeed necessary.
Aha
But but definitely, the most important and definite part, falls on the parents.
Hm mm
Because they are the ones who should be aware of what their kids are doing,
Hm mm
and, more or less according to their, their maturity, because well
Hm mm
no all the kids at twelve or fourteen are the same, the decide what they can and can't see.
Hmmm
This, I agree with.
And you, hmmm
Now, they ask, they asked something like this, eh, what was the question, they said the moral question or I don't know.
I don't remember, the PG, blah blah, I don't remember the classifications well.
yes, if they agree with that there should be a, a chip or something
Ah, yes yes, thanks I remember the
the chip that they're putting in the television
This
so the parents can control
this, great, this is really effective.  In fact all the cable companies now
Hmmmm
are offering this, this helps and I think it's really important.
I think it's like a po- aha.
But we come back to the same thing, if the parents don't use this, well we win nothing.
Hmmm
We don't win anything, so, aside from the class-
yes
from the same classification, that's a help to a parent, they also need to be aware of what to do, or better, whoever's watching the kid, and decide himself if it's appropriate or not.
Sure, but on the channel, uh, Univision, forty one, there, em, they had a report on this, of the games the games
Ah
kids' games, how they made Nintendo, or like Playstation
But we're referring to games, the video games, yes.
that, video games have categories too, and that
It's this.
sometimes the parents let them, because the kids want the game that's the most
No, and, and they don't know the contents.
Hmm
But in reality the topic of today should include this part that I think it's the most problematic for today.  The video games, more than television itself
Hmmmm
All those that are, all the, that's coming now with video games is incredible, and one or the other, well most adults, well I don't know about you, but
Hmmm
most adults, we don't even know what it's about.
Exactly.
And, all the contents that are sometimes so violent and so
Hmmm
racist, too.
Hmm
The internet too, they're also using the internet a lot, since they're little, and sometimes the parents don't supervise them.
yes yes This, I remember that they came out with the, ah, with a protection when the Internet came out at the beginning, so the parents would buy
a system to be able to control the access that the young kids have to, to certain Internet pages. And
yes
And I don't know if it's more like a business, or or, or, if its' really a system to be able to prevent, eh, eh
that type of content.
Well I know that -AOL, which is where I have the subscription, has a very effective filters program,
Hm mm
and, at the time of registering, of opening an account for, for a kid, they ask the age, and if is
Hm
under twelve, has
Hm mm
certain filters, and is oh until fifteen others, and then the adults.
Hm mm You have kids then.
No.
Oh, you don't have, okay.
No, but I've been aware of that, and nieces and nephews, and I've been close to them.
Hm mm
And so I know what it's about, and I've opened accounts there There, well, once again we go to the same thing, the parents, well,
Hm
eh, the parents are definitely the ones that play the determinant role there.
yes hm mm
About cinema, that was the initial question, well honestly I find the qualifications very clear and
Hm hm hm
the way they are, then it's up to every theater who they let in and who not. The control is effective
yes
But there is a problem. Many eh, youngsters, kids and youngsters, have access to the DVDs
Hm mm
yes, they don't need to go to he cinema to watch certain movies
Hm mm
You know, the advanced world is confused to the extreme, and the supervision is definitely the parents duty
yes
unfortunately they are not doing it
Yes, but maybe, em ,the system could also help when they do, how is it in spanish?,
eh, some programs, like that program with Janet Jackson in that show,
Yes
she sung and showed a breast on the TV, that was pre-recorded
yes
and shows also. Maybe that would help a little to set a, a classification of what kind of
show or movie also
of
that, inlfuence
yes yes yes, that is also right
Aha
It's easier t do it when they are prerecorded that if they are live
yes, right
But, definitely, what you just said, education, education and more education
Hmmm
Now, about the contents themselves, despite classification, what do you think? About what we are seeing, or what is being shown.
On TV, let's say
Well, on TV they are showing much more than they showed before
It takes a lot, yes
And, I don't know, children are learning more explicit things that, that when I was a kid
yes, absolutely. That is another part, eh, or another subject of, of
E-
another part of this subject that can be touched, and there
Hm
the government does have to act, the contents,
Hm mm
have definitely changed too much
Hm mm
No, in fact, I've sometimes sat down to watch the cart-, the cartoons kids watch nowadays and was stupefied. I didn't watch that
yes
The, the cartoons I watched were very, very innocent
Hmm, Innocent. It's not
Now, in cartoons and
Hmm
TV or internet, you only see violence, you see incredible things
yes, more aggressiveness
A lot of aggressiveness, even racism, insults, and it's supposedly geared towards kids from six or seven
Hmm
They're going to grow up seeing that as normal
Yes. That's transferred to the attitude later, to behaviors in school, uh, yes. They've made studies about that. And there's, there's a connection between what they see and what they do sometimes
yes
Sometimes, in
No, the point is that, the point is that I read, I don't remember where, that a singer, not so famous, I don't know, that underground music
Hmm
in a show, he gouged his eye out, I don't know, and after that, one of the fans went home and did the same thing
hmm
I mean, they follow
Hmm
or they have their idols and they really see them as Gods.
hm mm
It's incredible.
That mm, also has, that, a , a little complicated, problem, in general, because there's also like no supervision, sometimes, the parents, there's no, um
knowledge of what they are listening to, I don't know I don't want, don't want to just blame the singer in that case, right. Because I think that
a teenager or something like that, has a lot, eh, has a low self esteem, well, that too, it's partly influential what is
yes
what's happening also in the house, or or in the type of advice that kid is getting. Or not getting
Is true, is true. yes, is that, it all leads to the same, the parents are decisive, and many times they leave their child's education in the hands of could be, the television, I don't know.
Hm mm And the control, how much, how much television they can watch or not watch.
And especially the quality. Because yes, the television, and especially in this country, is very rich, there's a lot to see.
For hm, hm. yes
There are plenty of channels, and there are some very good ones, and very entertaining. I for example, well I'm happy watching channels like Natural Geographic or the History Channel
Hm mm Hm, hm mm
Eh, in all these travel channels,
yes, hm mm
that are very good, the documentaries, or kids, if the parent sits down with him to watch it, and to explain what he knows, the kid will feel very entertained and fascinated watching those adventures with real animals.
Hm mm, hm, mm.
But no, they put them to watch the same cartoons as always, and they think that's the only thing there is.
Sure
That
No, uh, it's getting list, that, also, that contact, that relationship here, i believe more in the United States than anywhere else.
Yeah, believe it or not, that's gonna have a world wide influence, and they
with all this stress, with all this, it's all
uh, all those shows about, about, aimed for children, the massive ones, they are in the whole world.
Yes, uh, there is little attention, i think, at home. But it's, it's trending, uh, it's, it's getting harder to keep that relationship
with, with the, with the children at home
Exactly, exactly, and the movies, it's the same. In fact, i was reading that there is a crisis now in Hollywood, the box offices aren't responding, well, they don't know what's happening
Well, i, i think the answer is simple
Uh um
That they're starting to [they need to] show something else, because yeah, we are tired from watching the same thing. All those
Yes
Adventure movies, and fantasies that don't ultimately transmit anything, they don't teach anything
Yeah, of course
We have to, we have to search for more educational contents
Right
That's it, from there
They lack a lot of education, even though they say they're educating the, uh, uh, father with, with the, with that kind of
of codes, like PG-13 or etc, they
Hi
Hi, how are you?, nice to meet you. Luisa, from Miami, Florida
Ho, what's up?, Paulo speaking here from Philadelphia
How are you?
What's up, how are you doing?, fine?
Well, very well
Where are you from?
Colombian
Oh, colombian. Yesterday i spoke to a Colombian boy, or the day before, i can't remember. Yeah, what a coincidence. Uh, well, did you understand something about the subject for today, about the movies?
Well, i tried
I didn't understand a thing, a lot. The truth is i have no idea, the only thing i think is good is that they're blocking
uh, the violent programs for the kids, nothing else, that's the only thing i understood, after that, the rest of the acronyms i have no idea what they're about, do you?
As far as i understood, it was the specification of the movies, when they say PG, PG fourteen it means that they can't be seen if they're not older than fourteen, and if they are violent or what do i know. But that's true, i didn't
Uh
i don't understand a thing
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, very well, no, no, not like, the truth is i have no idea about that, so
Of course
Well, also
But we should talk about something similar, what kind of movies do you like to watch?
What kind of movies?, see, i like the Argentinian movies very much, the, well, from all Latin America, all of them, i like adventure movies
the war ones I don't like at all. What else? Everything that has to do with, I like a lot the ones that have to do with travel you see? Or
Or the characters that are traveling around the world. Like that I can see some scenery. I like those movies a lot. So well. And you?
For me horror movies.
The horror movies? No
Yes, and the comedies also, the funny ones. I like them a lot, yes.
Ah really. Look at that.
The ones I like the least are the action ones, ah, one gets too bored there watching unrealistic things and things like that. No, I don't like them.
Yes, no no. I only like adventure ones, of travel.And I like a lot I tell you, well the Latin American ones I like a bunch.
No, nothing. But, ah, is more than anything because I like to watch the problems and the
The Latin American ones
scenery, but is more than anything for that, eh, just for that. So well, every time that
Mm.
rent, try to rent when I rent something like that where there's something of traveling.
And the Latin American ones from what country have you seen? Only the ones from Argentina or from another area?
I saw some Brazilians, I saw one Colombia that, now I don't remember the name.
Maria, full of grace.
That one is good, I saw it.
Aha.
Look, did you like it?
I loved it.
And it's, is it similar to reality?
A lot, yes, that's the reality, yes
Yes?
It's just that girl, i mean that bitch, this young lady reflects poor people, they are the people from Colombia that live in poor areas
that have a very hard time to survive, do you understand me?, like the people from the streets
Yes, right
That's, that's it. More or less, like people from the streets
Is it hard to live in Colombia?, is that how they showed the movie?
No, it's not so, it's not, that's why I'm telling you
It's not so, sure, that's the kind
What they reflect there is the poor class, the lowesr class.
The lower class, the marginal
Exactly
Oh, right, oh, oh, oh, well
But
Well, i saw that one, and then i saw another that i can't remember what's it called, that this... worked there, this model, Maria?, uh, I'm asking my wife
this model, what's her name?, she's colombian, right?, the movie we say
Oh
That was there with this boy that, with Diego Torres, do you know him, Diego Torres?, yes
Oh, Angie, Angie Cepeda, right?
Ah, the one singing? Angie Cepeda, there he is. A film we watched with her.
Oh, Pantaleon and the
Pantaleon and don't know what. It was good that one, I enjoyed it.
I didn't watch it, but I watched the trailer on a Peruvian channel.
Yes, it's a good one. Pantaleon and I can't remember what else. Really good, like from a story. Very good,  I liked that film very much. It's the only two I watched.
Yes.
And and later I've not watched much more, I don't remember the the names very much. Er ah Well, later I watched that one, motorcycle diary, that one that's the story of. Yes, did you see it? Yes.
Which one?
That one about Che Guevara, from when he just did the trip from Argentina to don't know where, to Mexico. Motorcycle diary.
Oh, no no. Never
That a Grammy won the song, the musical theme won a a Grammy, didn't it? Or an oscar, I can't remember, an important prize. So I watched it.
And and well, I don't know, a lot. And now I don't remember all the titles but I've seen a lot. And then from Spain I also watched a lot, too.
I
No, I'm all day watching films.
I watched a film I really liked which was based on a real story from the Dominican Republic. It's called In the time of the butterflies.
In the time
with Salma Hayek.
Oh really?
Yes, have you never seen it?
Ah. No, I'll take note right now. In the time of the butterflies.
From the butterflies, with Salma Hayek.  It's a really great film.  It talks about something that happened in the Dominican Republic.
Aha.
And a rebellion that happened there against the president and shows a lot of things.  Really, really, really good.
In the time of butterflies.  Well, I will rent it.  Really good for the date.  Aha, so good.  And what's the temperature there now?
Ah.  Right now they said that it was going to drop to forty nine, at night.  More like at nine, it starts to drop to, they said, like fifty or forty nine.
Aha, oh.
But it's not as cold as in the north.
No, yes.  Well, here it's been pretty good, eh.
What temperature is it now?
No, now it's forty something.  Let's see how many What temperature does it say in the machine, Maria?  You don't know what the temperature is?  Yes, there.  It's forty som-
But in Fahrenheit.  We're talking about centigrade.  Thirty something, ah, yes, One or two degrees centigrade.  Yes, thirty something.
But for us that's little.  In the winter it gets pretty
Ah, good.
good.
And how long have you lived there?
Only a year.  No, a very short time. You?
It will be, it will be two years on the twenty first.
Two years?
Yes.
Ah, not a lot of time either.
No, it's not much
So, well
But, well
Yeah, a year, so, well, are you working?
It's usual. I was studying, i just finished high school
Right
And now I'm in, i'm going to college, but not until February
Oh, that's good, that's good. I'm working here. I'm working in cleaning now, in cleaning
Right
And well, i was working as, i was working in the construction and nothing, because i
And in the, and what you're working in now, isn't it hard?
At cleaning?
Yes, no, i mean. But the thing is, my mom was working with a thing called, that were the recently build apartments, that they had to clean them before they handed them to the people that was going to live there
Right
So, my mom came home very tired. She told me: "that blows", because she had to remove the concrete from the walls and everything the... left
Uh
the painters and all that, isn't it like that?
No, no, no, no. The truth is that the job i now is very, very easy. No, not at all, it's offices
Oh
Offices, so it's really easy. No, i have to do the
Ah, good.
the vacuum cleaner there,  mm and a bathroom, the desks and nothing more, because all that. Everything is clean, everyday you have to do the same time.
Is even kind of boring, but is very very peaceful.
Listen, and you how, I'm sorry to be so indiscreet, how old are you?
How old am I?
Yes.
Thirty three.
Thirty three, oh okay.
Yes. And I was working in a job like the one you were describing, like that, cleaning construction stuff and all that. No, that is
a killer. Killer, terrible. I was removing cement and all those things.
Yes.
It was terrible, I would get home exhausted, but well. Well, it paid well, so at that moment until I found this job which is easier I was working in that.
Aha, oh really how good. And are you working in anything right now?
No, at this moment, no.
Vacations.
Vacations.
How nice. Beach?
Beach? No well with this cold, what beach.
Is too cool right?
Yes, it's too cool. Too much to go to the beach. One goes and freezes.
Yes.  Sure, sure, sure, of course.  And what's there to do here aside from, there's a lot who go to the beach, what's there to do there in Miami?
In Miami, hmm, there's a lot of things, there's museums, there's parks, there's
Sure, that's good, eh.
there are clubs, the best are the clubs.
The, Aha.
at night, on the weekends.  There are really big malls on the side of the bay and there are many things to do, many.
How nice.  No, here in winter it's really boring.  Here winter is terrible.  It's to eat and drink beers.
Yes.
And watch TV and eat and watch the TV.  You always put on some kilos here in winter, because there's nothing to do.  It's not nice to go out, like
we don't go out any more than necessary, you know?
Yes.
So, no, not the same at all.  I would really like to go to Miami, the truth is we're going to see if we can.
Really, oh.
I would really like to go to Miami.  We'll see if my wife and I can have an
You should
escape.  Yes, yes, yes yes,
And it's really pretty, it's really beautiful.
Yes, yes.  No, here it's nice too, it has it's good parts, it's nice parts, but
Yes.  Is it small or big, what's it like?
No, it's big here.  Philadelphia is really big.  Huge.  What happens is that there's a terrible climate because in summer it's incredibly hot, but so hot that you can't go out
And in the winter, it has extreme temperatures, and during the winter there's a cold... with continuous below-zero temperatures and it's not good at all. The only good thing is that it has a beautiful spring
And a very pronounced autumn too, very nice. But winter and summer are very pronounced and ugly things, i mean, mostly the summer, the summer is terrible.
the summer here is terrible, you can't even, if you don't have air conditioning, a good equipment in your home
Uh huh
you're in for a bad time for sure, yes, yes, yes, it's very important to have good air conditioning
But is there humidity or not?
Yes, horrible, heavy, super heavy, yes, yes, yes, i mean, it makes me remember Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires is like that too, all concrete, heat, humidity all day, crushing, that you have to be with
with the fan on, the fan all day in your face because you can't do anything. But well, it goes away, you live it, it's nice anyway. I'm telling you, it has its charm
I'd like more to be in Miami, to tell the truth. Yeah, we're from an Argentinian city where there is
Yes
beaches and, well, nothing, we just miss that a little, the sea and all that, we miss it a lot.
But, you know what it's not good about Miami?, that you earn more, you earn little, and everything is very expensive
You earn little there?
Do you understand me?, you earn little
Yes?
Hello. My name is Celiana.
Good evening, my name is Nancy.
How is it going Nancy? How are you?
Fine, thanks. Celiana, where are you from?
From Ah, from Argentina and now I live in Boston and now I'm in Miami.
Oh, I'm from Colombia and I live in New York.
Ah, how nice.
Good no
And in what part of New York?
I'm in Manhattan.
Ah, how nice. I like it a lot. I like it to go visit. I don't know if to live.
Mm. Suddenly visiting, is nice. One already.
What?
Like for a visit, one lives here because of necessity.
Sure, okay. yes, It's true.
that today's topic is housing.
yes. I just honestly don't understand when they say eh that is a
Uh uh.
what does it mean?
imagine the benefits, ugly, the guarantees there are of buying or renting something I imagine, no, I don't know because I understood about the bubble.
Ah, I also never understand when they talk to me. And the truth that a lot of
yes.
the topic I'm not, not too aware because I came to live here for a few years, to work. I'm not thinking of living here, so I'm not even planning on buying so I'm not aware, I don't know if you are aware.
yes I'm a little bit aware of that but at the moment because I'm renting I rent an apartment
yes.
but all of a sudden one does have to think in that, instead of paying rent you will buy to get something for yourself. Because you will paying something that's yours.
Sure.
yes. But, as far ah, let's say the finances it becomes hard because if one rents an apartment you don't pay the water, and at least here you don't pay the heat
Sure yes.
If I get a house I have to pay the water, the light, the heat. Absolutely everything.
Sure.
My insurance and all of it then.
Sure.
It would be, it would be the best. But who do you rent from?
Would you live here? Are you going to stay to live here in the United States or is just for a short time?
yes, No I am staying
Sure, then you would have to see what's the best for you, right?
yes the possibility of looking and saying well what are the benefits and
Sure.
because you see a lot of housing of duplex for two families.
yes, your family
yes, then you don´t know why suddenly find a bad, a bad neighbor
Of course.
And the situation get complicated.
And with so many Hollywood movies about neighbors, you don´t feel like.
yes, no, you don´t know that
You get scared.
then you don´t think about buying there.
How?
Are you going to stay here for a while?
Of course I am renting a place An if, by now I have a three years contract. my idea is not to stay here.
Uh, uh.
Then that is what I am going to do.
yes. yes.
But But no, but if you want to stay here to live like in any other place in the world, to me is that if you can is convenient to buy
yes.
And pay like if you were renting.
yes, and you have something for you, for your children.
Of course like a credit and paying a loan and all that stuff yes, it is okay because tomorrow you will have your own house.
yes. yes that is true.
And
Is that girl the location and all.
sure the problem is that one has to be very sure of everything because is one time and that's it. The sames as after when once, once is yours
you can buy it and rent it and you rent something else with the same money.
yes, yes that's true. It seems the rents here are very expensive.
yes, in Boston also. They are very expensive.
yes?
yes. I live in a good neighborhood in Boston in a two bedroom with a roommate and we pay one thousand five hundred and sixty.
Mm.
It doesn't have a laundry or anything
Well.
three floors by stairs
yes.
and
I also live on the third floor and there's no elevator well there is a laundry on the first floor but is not from the building.
and in ah. And by what part of Manhattan do you live?
Is in the one hundred twenty fifth.
Ah, that's where one takes the bus to go to the airport.
Uh uh. yes. Before it was really bad around that area but no it has already gotten much better is commercial and there are a lot of remodeled housing.
yes.
yes, everything is much better because before it was really dangerous.
Ah, And you have a little son, did I hear?
Hmm, yes, here he his.  I was giving him little things to eat.  But he's here with his story, eating his things now,
Ah.
yes but the housing, it's true.  And the rents here are expensive too.  Where I am it's cheap.
Ah, how much does it cost, for example, a two bedroom?
I have one of two rooms and I pay seven hundred or six hundred dollars.
Ah, good.
Hmm.  But we say that it's for my baby and ofr me.
Sure.
For just one person the rent is difficult
Sure.  Sure.
like this.  Suddenly they exist one morning to have the, where I go and in my old age and in his youth,
Sure, but this you have to get out of the city and travel a lot, then, to work.
yes.  No we say that here there's a close part that's called New Jersey.  It's pretty.
yes.
And I was looking and yes it's expensive where I looked.
Sure.
But, but yes, I wanted something small.
Sure.
that it's safe and all that. it's expensive.
Right, that's in here like my sister lives in El Doral that's like uh thirty minutes from the beach
Mm.
in Miami. In a neighborhood with a fountain and all that in a in a duplex home. It's really big with a yard
Mm. It must be expensive.
no, ninety thousand.
Wow, no it's not too expensive.
Right, it's much more accessible here, New York, Boston are the most expensive cities in the United States.
The most expensive ones, yea.
But well the salaries are higher too.
yea a bit. Here's it's well not much just the minimum wage. They raised it a little while ago. Eighty five
Right, yea.
Mm. Yes but I
And how long have you lived here in the United States?
Five years.
Ah, a while?
And I've been here for five years.
Ah. Is it cold right now in New York?
it's pretty cold right now. Yea, on Christmas day the twenty fifth it was raining all day.
oh,
Already the temperature is going to go down again.
Ah, okay.
This covered.
Ah.
Because in Boston is also quite cold, right?
yes, yes, is colder than in New York.
yes.
It snows more. But well now I'm in the pool. Today I'm here in Miami is
yes, well.
Another climate one can say. how incredible how the same country is.
And the, yes the climate is totally different.
The climate, the language, the
Oh.
yes, and here only Spanish is spoken.
I uh. That's good. Only one is missing.
yes. yes. Sometimes one needs it, true.
And your sister is thinking of staying to live, yes?
No, no, she doesn't know.
Neither? I'm still doubtful.
yes, for the issue of raising the kids.
yes
Is not that what I also think, some other day, if I'm having new children, I don't know if I would like to raise them here
Well, I'm starting to raise this one here, let's see how that ends
Sure, how old is he?
It's 5 months old
Oh
it's a little baby
Sure he is, and sure, you take care of him any time?
I'm working two days per week
Sure
And well, to help with something, because, it does not survive with two days, It runs out, it gets mad
Sure
problems when they run out of, and then I was paying, Because it  would make me move, because I work in New Jersey and I found a home in New Jersey
Oh
And to get anyway, a babysitter and all that, is so complicated
yes, right?
yes, because you don't know to whom you are leaving him?
Sure, that's complicated and daycare is really expensive
Uff, like $300 per week
yes, here my friends, with kids in Boston, is like $1500 per moth
Mm.
yes, is like something like that. It's really expensive.
Is not enough. It's easier for me to find housing in New Jersey and live there.
Sure.
as if, yes but in reality all this is expensive.
Sure. yes the truth is that is very expensive and one sometimes thinks where do you live better if in Colombia or in Argentina or here, right?
Uh uh. Here there are some guarantees that you don't have over there, work, here you can find, not in Colombia.
Sure.
But everything is that one also has to look because
yes.
you have to think of him. That's why I'm looking at a little house, but a small house. Not a big house.
Sure.
yes.
yes, well. But something is something.
yes, also. yes, yes, because I have to to think of leaving something to him.
Sure, one also thinks that.
Mm.
that leaving a property is something secure
yes, yes, at least one is not going to be thinking about where you will leave your stuff or from here to tomorrow one never knows.
Sure.
yes. yes, in reality I didn't understand what they said about the bubble.
me neither no I tell you, what Spanish was that. To whom are they speaking to,
Bubble?
Mexican, to Puerto Rican, to whom? Because I didn't understand.
To me bubble is like I don't know, the soap makes its, the bubble, something. Or one
Sure.
a car but I don't know if it is
yes, we also use it for the same thing but sometimes we say you live in a bubble like to say that
Something very beautiful, very special there isn't.
sure and that you don't know any other thing but your world, your school, your country club
Mm.
and your relatives, right?
Oh.
That's living in a bubble to us.
For. yes.
No? Because sometimes. Ah, I didn't know this happened in my city, well you, what' wrong? do you live in a Bubble?
Oh.
No, We use it this way but just the same I didn't understand
I didn't understand either, if I return the call that is about the bubble they already didn't stay as such
yes, but the same I think that the topics are so we know what to talk about, there's no need to talk about that the whole time
Um, yeah, because it's not
sometimes, so i start talking and i don't talk, i don't talk about it, right?, because the other day, just the other day i spoke to a girl that lives in Philadelphia, Argentinian incidentally
and she knows [mutual] friends, and we stayed talking about that. And how we work in the same, so we didn't even remember what subject we had to talk about
You know, you started talking, he's Spanish and keep talking on your own. But it's nice because I've met other people
Sure
yeah, different cultures
Yes
Yeah, i
Yeah, super interesting. It's fun to me, and, well you can also make a little money at the same time
Uh huh
Oh
yeah, it was necessary
Of course, it always come in handy
No, nothing, even better
Uh
Yeah, so, right?
Yes
And how long will you be there in Miami?
Yeah, I'm now here with my sister, she has, i have a two years old nephew
Uh huh, so sweet
And now he's called Oliver and now my sister is expecting her second child and that's where it gets complicated.  So my mom is coming
Next week and she'll stay here for a bit.
Hello How is it going?
How is it going this is Paula speaking? What?
eh,
How are you?
Manuel's speaking, I'm in Orlando, Florida. Where are you?
Boston.
eh, in Boston, Massachusetts.
Massachusetts
I believe that
aha
I believe that we've talked once. But well, eh, getting into the matter, getting into the matter, tell me your impressions on today's topic.
yes Today's topic renter or buyer, and look, I think that if you have, enough money, is much better to buy than rent.
yes
It seems to me, no, I think that too much of my money is wasted on renting, that's money you don't get back. in
Correct.
yes, I definitely think, it's more advantageous to buy, the thing is that until last year I was a student. Here in Boston the prices are super expensive, then it's also the lack of possibility to do that.
yes.
No,
aha
I don't know what,
well, no, yes, yes, finish, I'll be right there,
yes, tell me, that's my opinion, if I could buy it, as I said, I don't know how long will I be staying here, I don't know if it'll suit me
what do I know, if I'm to stay here for a long time, sure, but I rather lease it
sure, sure
and you,
Well, I completely agree with you, the truth is that it'd be better to own one and see how can you do it, to capitalize something.
In this case, real state, but the truth is that the, the prices are unaffordable, where I live, well, everyday, I'm sad because I can see that they are inaccessible.
They are charging huge prices for the properties.
Oh yes,
Look, I lived in New York, where, as you said, those are big cities where housing is really expensive, so I was never able to
yes
I thought that it'd be different here, I've been here for a year, for over a year and this is happening again
yes
It's a bubble, as they put it in the entrance, well
that's right.
a bubble, I don't know when it's going to burst but for the moment, this bubble is growing everyday.
so, do you think that it's not okay to buy right now?
No.
because of the bubble.
exactly, prices are so expensive, I don't think that the houses are valued that much.
yes
and any day the bubble can burst and go down, all the prices hit rock bottom and then look that, that the one that bought so expensive, all of a sudden will find himself with,
with the fact that he's losing money.
sure, sure, do you also think that you lose more money than the one you are losing renting.
eh, well renting hurts a lot every month.
I don't know why
But, but is that, but is that, eh, not only by what can happen when the bubble busts, but, How do you do it to give a down payment now?
when you are going to buy a house and they tell you that the cheapest one, it's two hundred, two hundred fifty thousand dollars.
mm
Then you need to have handy at least some twenty thousand, dollars, thirty thousand.
Sure, sure, sure.
So that you don't stay, because that's another thing, there are those, that finance you that part of the initial payment or down payment but that, you'll see later those mortgages because I know people with mortgages
or amortizations of three thousand dollars people that are working, twenty four hours, practically to be able to pay that. oh,
Sure.
people that are not really enjoying it that are living in their basement practically and the house is rented to be able to pay it. Which that doesn't make sense.
Sure, Sure.
Because it's sacrificing yourself too much, the quality of life deteriorates a lot.
No that of the, I had a roommate that she was the owner of the apartment she was young, see, and since her parents helped her.
yes
and what she did was, she had a three bedroom apartment.
True.
So we rented two places, and she was in the third.  And with my rent and that of the other girl, we payed the mortgage.
Ah, good, even, well good the advantage that she had, well also it's that alone, no.
Sure, sure, you don't have
So, but, but, well it's not ideal, and there are more dramatic cases still like I told you, and they're real because they're not so,
so, stuck in.  People who are there definitively, well,
Sure.
go crazy because they can't pay these high mortgages.
yes
So it's when you start to do the account, and see where it comes out, at least in my case, for the moment I have to comply with
yes
keep paying the lease and they we'll see
Sure and I don't have an option either so I don't worry too much.  No, I tell you, it's more, I tell you, living in Boston is so expensive.
yes
that I have to live with a roommate
definitely, and the big cities, New York is the same, I also had a roommate, it was indispensable because,
Sure.
and and well any small one-room apartment, something like that, one thousand dollars.  Really expensive, really expensive, so
Sure if one, one bedroom can be two thousand dollars there.
Exactly in these big cities it's very difficult.  Now that I'm speculating a bit, if you had the option to buy, where would you like to buy here in the United States?
here.
Lets,so lets have a fantasy.
eh,
there in Boston or, or in another place, in another city.
I tell you, I tell you, the question is that Boston is too expensive. Then, with the same money I could buy something smaller. over ther,
with the same money that I buy one bedroom here in another place I have a five room house
That is correct.
Then, that, is the doubt. Eh, but otherwise, I am a biochemist, no, and right now I am doing investigations in Kansas.
Really.
then there are not many places where I can go to do biotechnology. Then it must be here or in California.
ah, look, of course.
And, and the question is that California is the same or even more expensive than here.
yes, yes definitely.
Then, what I would do, is, and I have not a car either, then I would have to buy a house in the outside of Boston,
In the,
and buy a car.
yes in, those states is necessary. necessarily you must have a car.
yes I would need it.
because everything is far. Well you see it, you say something that is true. sometimes you cannot buy where you want but when things are easier and the profession is determinant.
Of course.
yes, that's true, that would have to be there or in California, well something I would point, and has to deal with  today's topic is that the government does so little
to inform and inform in a side to new buyers, at least the ones buying for the first time
yes
and well, to put in rule, as they say, or well, being in touch to the sellers, with more strict laws, because I think the market is to open
yes, in the Massachusetts State, for example
And in the last, the
they help to buy, the ones that want to buy a hose and they make less that $70000 a year
yes, and let's say that information flows and people has a hand, because, where I live, in Florida, it's
yes
I don't have an idea, and I have even look on the internet and I can find the general things of the central government, but here exactly in Florida, I can't find anything
yes
I mean, we are lacking some promulgation, because they must do it, and having specific programs for first time buyers, they must
they must install that, wait, it does not appear, because it must be a help, at least in the first house you buy
Obviously, I totally agree with you, Manuel, you told me, not
yes, Manuel
I agree, and that's impossible, but,from other side, are you Mexican Manuel?
No, Colombian
Colombian, well, I don't know how Colombia is, but in Argentina, also, the apartments in dollars, they are expensive, the same or less than here
Well, yes, in Colombia there was a real state boom and well, it ended in a recession
sure
But it can't compare to the prices here, definitely not. Never
ha
Never, because
But, anyway, buying an apartment there would be difficult right now. At least, there are no credits there, here at least you get thirty year mortgages
If you know you are going to stay here, I don't know which are your intentions, but if you are going to stay long here
It is like somehow the dream of owning your house is reachable. I think that would be almost impossible in Buenos Aires
yes, yes, suer. This is another consideration, because we, almost all of us have one foot here and the other in our origin countries
Sure, yes
So, sometimes you think in the two places, buying there and buying here, to come and go
that would be ideal
yes, and many people make it, actually
I see
Many people do that, they invest there, and also here. I wish I could, I would like it myself
yes
eventually buying here, or buying in
yes
I mean, in any of the southern states, that are warmer, because I run away of New York because of the weather
Oh, wait a minute Manuel, hold on a second, yes, hold on a second
yes
Excuse me
Yes
the food's ready
Oh, that, that
Yes, and, well
No, no,
And how long have you been doing this Manuel, the phone calls?
Uh, i, i think that almost a month, i have done like fifteen calls
Oh, that's a lot, yes, i am doing only one a week
Yes, i have had some luck, because you see, sometimes they call you just four minutes before six, and they leave you there on the phone, and "wait, we'll get you a "
ah, and i hang up, because since i only have my phone, i like to talk nine minus five
To a partner, a partner, and i to, i too, i hang up too then, but then, sometimes i forget to dial back and i stay there without calling, and other times
like today, i dial again and well, i get lucky, lucky, and i get in touch with someone immediately
Sure, sure, excellent, yeah, me too, At first i called until seven, but now since i only have my cellphone, it eats a lot of minutes, because in the end it ends up being like fifteen
Right
So, i want to call for nine minus five, so it's only five minutes
Yeah, yeah we're, you know, yeah I'm like at fifteen
very good, and did you know that if you do five different phones, they
James, New York.
Hello, Hello, Marcela, from North Carolina
Marcela from North Carolina?
Yes.
Marcela, but there are no Argentinians in North Carolina?
There are a few
Really?
yes, yes. There a few.
Wow, in what part of North Carolina?
I'm in Fayetteville.
Oh, it must be over there, because I was there and I was in a few towns there, there were, I hardly saw any Hispanics, much less
eh, Argentinians.
yes. Ah, well, there are many more Hispanics now. How long ago was it that you visited, that you were here?
Oh. Last year.
Ah.
yes.
Well, yes, because comparing it to New York, because you said you were in New York
yes. I'm in New, New York. yes.
Well, and compared to New York, yes, no, there's hardly any Latins but when we got here in eighty seven, there was no one. You could speak in Spanish that the only ones that understood you were the soldiers that had gone to Panama.
But not now, now, there are some.
Ah, yes? By coincidence I'm from Panama.
Ah, look at that.
Look, what a small world, right?
yes, yes.
And what, tell me, do you own or rent?
No, eh, we own.  This
Ah, sure, from eighty seven.  I imagine.
yes, yes, we never thought that we would be able to own a place because we came here to Los Angeles and we are both artist, even though my husband, crazy, musician, had been in the army,
even though now he's not in the army any more.  But
Aha.
we never thought we'd be able to have a house, but, well this house, we rented it, and after the owner put it up for sale
For sale.
and I said, well, what would be need to buy the house?  And we started to look into it and it ended up that we could buy the house, so we bought it.
Really?  How nice, thank God.
yes. yes.  But now it's almost there in this bubble that they're talking about
Aha.
here in North Carolina y es, no, it hasn't finished yet.  Many people who have moved here.
Aha.
This, many people from the north, especially who are coming to North Carolina.
Aha.
In a way, it's sad because it was all green and now, we have each time, less gree
And well, and also
Because, they build and build and they don't stop
Wow
yes
I have being with, well, I don't have the experience of what's really is construction and that because,
it's different to be in a place to replace something
yes
and you keep watching, are they building that new thing? or when they are doing other project, do you understand, right?
Yes
But, the bubble, I don't see it clear
That means that, by artificial ways, people is exited, because there is many immigration, from a place to other and
the value of proprieties increases in some places, goes up and up and does not stop, do you understand?. and then it's a bubble because at any moment
puff, the bubble blows and then the prices go down and then , people looses money and well, let's say, in North California, near San Francisco and you bought a house in
three million dollars
Yes
And once the bubble blows, that hose that you bought at three million dollars, maybe, if you are lucky, you can sell it for a million
Mmm
Do you understand?
And the interest you paid for the house also
Sure. Eh, the places become popular and the prices go up and go up, the go up because the people start to, they don't care, the issue is to live there, and then the people pay whatever
and that, and that creates artificial values that sooner or later
Aha, here
everything goes down, everything normalizes.
yes, here in New York you are not going to have that kind of problem, because it always increases, increase it always increases though there's no, the time I've been here I haven't experienced any type of bubble.
You understand?
yes, yes. Always everything goes up, except after nine eleven that the properties went down a little.
Because always here, it went down, went down, and yes but for the worst because they've gone up terribly.
yes. I know, and we are, we
And right now must be more expensive than ever
We would love to live in, in, in New York, I would love to live in New York, but
yes.
How do we live? What do we do? Ah, you understand? Is, is, very hard.
Mm, but like that I see how you started North Caroline yes is to New York.
And, yes, My husband now works again one one of emergency
Aha.
So maybe he, um, could do some sort of transfer, right? I don't know
Aha, yes
he would have to find a eh, job there.
Aha.
But everything is so expensive, the cost of life is very expensive there
Yes, when, when was the last time you were over here?
Look, the last time i was there was on two thousand?
Uh huh
three, two thousand and three, yes, two thousand three. Because or older son graduated from Tisch, the one in NYU, the Art School
Right
And so, uh, that was the last time
Oh, well, then
But we went there twice a year, more or less, the three years he was in college, because he finished it quickly
Art School, uh, my, right?, school, house of artists then
Yes, yes, yes, yes. The, unfortunately not, we didn't, uh, any veterinarian, any dentist, any profession that could help us a little
Well, maybe if you, uh, if you wanted or need the family then, you still have time, you still have time
I don't think so, i don't
It's not, it's not hard to convince a boy of what, what you really want
Uh, but it's, he's earning, uh, he's a dan-, he's a dancer and he dances with a company called Pilobolus, and it's started that famous art, uh, modern dance
Right, here in New York
And i, yes, well, they, the company is in Connecticut, but they dance in New York every summer for five, six, five, six weeks in that theater named Joyce
Right
Joyce Theater?, and and he earns well, and he travels all around the world.
Right, yes, uh, well, you see?
And it was really well, and the oldest is 23 yo and the youngest is 17 yo, and he is a guitarist
He plays classic, jazz, everything and he will keep that, Is what he loves, what I would have to say?, Go and do something that bores you?
yes, exactly
Meanwhile he is going to college there is no problem
At least you are not worried, because they already built their life and now you are resting in North Carolina, even if there is not much to do there
Yes, that's the only thing I would like. Being in New York and going to the theater, I'm an actor and I produce, I work here but
Here, also
it's far, far from everything
And you see, because you have a house there and she
yes, and we can't complain, but it's boring sometimes
To much and well, I lived, I lived, but
Mmm
yes, to see
yes, and where do you work?
I'm
Hello?
And I had some accounts there in cloth
Mmm
But then I stayed, a day, next to them and then I stayed other day to return quiet
so, you entered and then left
then
Hello? What?
So no, no, eh.
Is, are you talking to me on a cellular?
yes.
Ah, yes, because every now and then, I lose you
yes, eh, is a, is a cellular I'm talking from.
yes.
Although, ah no, I'm not home, that's what happens. You are talking to me here and so
Uh um. Ah, well, yes, every now and then, I lose you.
Are you talking from a cellular?
No, no, I'm talking on my house phone.
Um, what do we talk about of all, eh, at least of the, the, yes, is it necessary that you have your house? It feels like realizing
yes, the truth yes. We have something.
Aha.
yes, if something happens, we have something.
yes, and then one feels better, for example there's already uh
A, a place.
Not just the fact that I imagine that the difference between renting, to being an owner is really, is big.
And yes because, eh, the only thing is that when you rent and something breaks, eh, you call someone and they fix it.
And yes and
In exchange, as an owner, if something breaks, you have to fix it or you have to pay
You have to exactly.
and you fix it, so there you start
yes, but since you have insurance, that this is your, eh, you know
ah, ah, yes yes yes yes yes.
That, it's not, the day when you want to really go to New York, you're going to sell this, and take the money and bring it there and buy a little apartment or a house.
yes, well, I'll buy a place.
You don't have to study, yes, a place exactly, uh.
A place, because there things are worth a lot of money, I can't imagine myself
yes.  But you don't believe, if you look you really have the opp-, every now and then there's a good opportunity.
No, this is true, this is true, and yes and
yes.  For example, I had the opportunity to get an apartment and eh, it's now worth three times what I payed for it
Uh, you were really lucky.  Fantastic.
Yes so, this was only in two years.
Uh, what a short time.
Yes, the person, in a year and something, in went up twice, and now it's three times more expensive.
Ah.
And yes, the bubble didn't break, like you say.  That I don't think, because here the value never goes down.
yes, it only goes up.
Here things have always been raising, I have never seen them going down
in what part of New York do you live in?
Eh, I am where Manhattan ends, at the very end of Manhattan. more to the north of
Oh, yes, yes
But the district is named
Uhum
And it's an area populated by Jewish and is quiet and clean, so
yes, yes, then properties rise
eh, peop- people who used to live there were older people who wanted, really closed apartments
Uhum
And I got to know it, and they told me, well we want this much but if you pat that much it's yours
Because they have a house and had no need for an apartment
Um. It had to be
Aha. Beut the feeling of owning is different
You were lucky
of owning and renting, you understand?
yes
Uhum
Besides, when you rent you are always, ah, at the expense of what the owner may want. If tomorrow he decides he wants the apartment, that's it!
Yes, right
At most they give you a month, three months, or whatever to move, you don't have an option, you have to go.
Uh-huh, yes, he, eh, and it's a
Hello?
Hello?
Is this Jorge? Who am I talking to?
Oh, My name is Blanca, I´m from Phoenix Arizona.
Oh, How are you? happy holidays
Oh, thank you, The same for you.
None
Mhm, Mhm. The weather is great.
Very good, I was born in Argentina
Mhm
Your accent sounds like you're from Colombia. Am i right?
Okay, yes, I´m from Colombia
oh What part of Colombia?
None
Oh, very good, yes, I know that place, It is Medellin they play more tango than Argentina.
Argentina Okay.
It is beautiful, Medellin is beautiful.
okay, Gardel died there.
I was there a few years ago.
Yes Garden died there right?
Yes, yes.  It's a really beautiful city.
Aha.
Well, the topic of today is housing.  They want us to talk about housing.  And I've never been to Phoenix, Arizona.
No.
Never, still.  No, no, no, no.  I've almost been to a place nearby to visit, that's called Scottsdale.
Scottsdale, aha, it's a city close to here.
Yes but, but after I couldn't go.  How far is it from Scottsdale to Phoenix, if you
Maybe a half hour.
That's it?
yes, no, it's right next to here, it's a city here
Close, yeah.
next to, to, to Phoenix
They say that Scottsdale is really pretty
Hmm, yes.
Yeah.  Well, so the housing in Phoenix, eh, how do you see it, Blanca.  Is it expensive to rent in Phoenix, Arizona?
Okay, ah, a year ago I came here to move to this state.  I lived in Boston, in Massachusetts,
Today in the east, on the east coast.
on the east cost.  So I moved and everything seemed so expensive that we decided to move here this year.
Look at that, look at that.
But without more or less everything went for the clouds.  A house that a year ago was worth one hundred thousand dollars is not worth two hundred and forty, fifty thousand dollars.
One hundred thousand dollars more.
Ah sure because you and your family are trying to ah, are trying or have bought, that's why.
yes, we bought.
Or are you trying to buy? Ah.
We already bought, already bought but ah Look, there's a huge difference between the states here, right?
It's incredible.
Because we had a house in Boston that what's worth five hundred sixty thousand dollars.
Ah, and you have ah
For that, we sold it for that amount.
That's good, very good
So, so No, but is is they are houses, they are old houses, old houses from many years ago and houses that have not been fixed but
they are very expensive. Housing over there is very expensive and what  you find a house here for, even though it's expensive again, eh the acquisition is more
more easy. The acquiring power here for the families to buy a  house is bigger. There are more possibilities in this state, at least,
from what I know that in Massachusetts.
Sure. Well, but then you bought a house for approximately one hundred forty thousand, you said.
No, no. We looked into it and it would costs us one hundred forty six thousand a year ago. In August it was a year. And we came here in May
and it already cost two hundred twenty three thousand dollars.
Eh. Two hundred what?
Two hundred twenty three thousand.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, From May to August.
From august to may
Oh, I see,
Then
And did they bought it?
Well, yes, because then, what do we do?, Do we keep paying rent to another one?
It has no sense
No, it has no sense, the
Well, but they kept their good profit
And, what I pay to someone else I can pay it better for me
Exactly
My rent, my own convenience
That, when you can do something like that is marvelous, that's really nice, it's perfect. Now you can see in Phoenix, the rents, How much can it be, for example?
in a really safe zone in Phoenix, Arizona, like an apartment, one bedroom
Like 800 pesos, 600, depends on the place
Depends, okay, exactly, well
Now, I'm renting, at this moment, I'm renting, I'm renting, because I will get my house now in May, more or less
Oh,
In fact my house is not even built
Oh, your house is on construction
mmm
oh is it under construction now or are they going to build it?
No, they are already building it.
Oh, how nice. But already in a couple of months you're moving into your own house.
Yes, and at this moment I pay for a house, and it's a new  house and it's a very good area and the house has three bedrooms, a living room, its
dining room, its kitchen and a little yard and a double garage. I pay two hundred dollars for the house.
Oh, but that's very good. If you go rent,
Mm.
that here in Los Angeles ah, oh mother, please
Ah. Yes.
for no, that I think that for that it would maybe cost four times more or something like that here in Lost Angeles
Mm, aha.
because California is very expensive.
California is like Massachusetts. My cousin lives in California. She bought an apartment, a townhouse with two small rooms for three hundred twenty thousand dollars.
In what area of California?
And already, and already used. She lives in Arcadia.
Ah, yes, yes, yes. As a matter of fact I spent the weekend, the night of the twenty fourth with some, a family, friends of mine from Ecuador in Arcadia. And look that, I don't know, Arcadia is
very big apparently, but the area I was in is very beautiful. Very pretty. Have you ever been in Arcadia, Blanca? Arcadia is pretty, is a residential area.
Very pretty, it's very peaceful but California is very expensive. I don't know. Oh look. Is very expensive, you're right. I don't know, it makes me
think, maybe I'm mistaken, is the climate perhaps, is one of those things. Eh, I don't know if that has anything to do with it but the
climate you have to see that here in California. You know that, well, if you like it, maybe you don't like it,
you know that we have a very beautiful climate here in California right?
Hm Hm.
Very I mean the climate are not, are not extremes like you know in Massachusetts
How I know it here in Phoenix.
Exactly, do you realize? Then it could be that I'm mistaken, but perhaps no. How is it?
No, because Florida, Florida is very humid. The climate in Florida is very unpleasant. But the houses there are better, the cost is also cheaper.
You can find a good apartment with a pool and that's six hundred dollars. And in some nice places,
Sure.
so I sometimes don't understand.
I also don't understand too well. What makes me think is the climate here, the closeness to the ocean we don't have those extremes in climate as big as you guys have in Arizona,
in Massachusetts or in Florida but it's a climate usually very beautiful the whole year in California. That's what makes me think, I don't know, don't know, don't know.
Hm. True.
But there are people that like, there's a taste for everybody, you know. right? Eh, is like everything, eh There are people that for example don't like
eh this totally this type of climate. There are people that like eh the four seasons, isn't it true? There are people that like the cold, like we say
the autumn, the winter, the spring, and the summer. And you in Massachusetts and in Arizona the four seasons exist more than in California.
yes.
For example you in Massachusetts the four season exist right?
yes
They are almost very differentiated right?
MM.
But in Arizona the seasons of the year aren't very different, no?
Aha.
Isn't it true?
yes, this is true.
Um, in Arizona you have basically, how can I say?  A lot of heat and a lot of cold, don't you?
No, no, right now it's never cold but I thi-
No?  It's not cold?  When, when is the hottest part of the year in Phoenix?
Hmm, July, August, September.
From July, let's say, until when is the hot period, good
September more or less.
Three months basically
Basically.
it's a really hard time in Arizona.
Really hard, haha.  It's only three months.
It's basically hot, and it's dry heat?
It's dry.  Yes, there's no humidity.
Dry, there's no humidity.
At all.
It's a heat that, my god, well, at least, at least it's dry.
yes.
And you go, inside your house, start the Conditioned Air and well, you can live with that, right?. Is not that heat that
moist that gets you cold in Arizona, right?
Mmm
Hi, this is Leo
Hello, my name is Blanca, where are you from?
Oh, hi Blanca, I'm from Washington, DC, how are you?
Oh nice, I'm in Arizona, in Phoenix
Oh, Phoenix, Arizona, that's nice
Oh, yes
And well, how are the real state prices there in Phoenix?
Oh, it's better than those northern places
Hey, I tell you, because there is a well, they called a bubble in English, pretty big
yes
And sure, we bought this house where my wife an I live, in this house
Yes
And we bought it two years ago, exactly, figure that out, we bought it the December 28th in 2003, And we bought it in
yes
$130000
Sure
And we just refinance it, in this May and the price is $260000, figure that out
Okay, I tell you, here is similar, but it's positive, At least the same as there, Look, I tell you my story, I
I lived in Massachusetts
Oh really?
Here houses are in the skies
Sure, and well, I was working in Massachusetts. I was many time working there in Massachusetts
And we had a house and the selling value was $560000
Oh, figure that out
And we moved here because it was cheaper to buy a state, right?
Sure
The last year, we came in August and we checked some houses and they seemed pretty, and they were going to be finished in this time, the new year and all that, and the begging of this year we moved here and we went to check the houses
And from $146000 they were now $223000
Figure that out, wow
Mmm
Suddenly, like that
Suddenly, yes
Wow
And then, I think that real state is fine, but I also think we are entering in that
boom of the bubble
Exactly, the bubble is like a cycle, it happens some other time in this country, mmm
ye
In the 90s the house prices were low, but they are now climbing, I think that in some years it would drop again, it's like a cycle
It goes down and up
Yes
Yes, Listen Blanca and where are you from originally? You sound like from Colombia. Ah from, Colombia, yes I knew.
From Colombia. Aha. I'm from Colombia.
Ah, from from what part? from Bogota?
I'm from Colombia. Ah? From Medellin.
Medellin, imagine that. Ah I,
Where are you from?
I'm originally from Venezuela.
From Venezuela?
Yes, mm, from Caracas.
Aha.
Mm, yes, yes. This
It seems to me ah, anyways, here within the means of possibilities and according to the capacity of each one I
I think that is preferable to buy your house, even if it's an apartment.
Listen of course, yes. Better than renting, you mean. Sure, because imagine, you renting is throwing the money in the trash.
But Okay, look for example what has happened to us. If we were the ones that rented, we wouldn't have gotten any sort of gain from our property.
But since we've thought of buying property and we have the capacity, at least the capacity of indebtedness, even though sometimes you don't have it but you get into debt.
Sure.
buy your house and there you have one way or another a gain.
Sure, a very good investment.
Mm.
Yes, this is a wonder. When we bought this house, we bought it without a deposit, without putting down a deposit. I mean, we didn't put absolutely nothing
Zero down payment
Zero, zero deposit. What saved us is that my wife and I have this very good credit
Yes
So we got a mortgage to a, let's say, reasonable rate. It wasn't the best one, but it was much better than many other mortgages
That's another story
Oh yes
Sometimes, sometimes banks do abuse
Sure
According to the status of the person, his capacity of indebtedness and all that stuff. I've had to do it. As a matter of fact I am working right now
Mhm
in a mortgage company. I am a loan officer
Oh, yes, aha, figure
So I, I know that sometimes banks do abuse. Sometimes they abuse on the conditions and requirements. And when people can't fulfill all the requirements they still get the cerdit, but the rate is so high
Sure, very expensive. It's ridiculous
That's why there is so much crisis here now, in Arizona there are many people buying houses, but there are also many people in
foreclosure. The houses, many houses are in foreclosure. People is selling, refinancing because they are indebted to the neck
Oh because they, they can't pay, right?
because they can't pay, because the rate is so high, because their legal status mm determine some requirements they don't fulfill, then they get
enormous rates
Uh, imagine all that.
There are many things.
Well, look we bought this house that we have right now, we bought it in a foreclosure, mm. The lady that lived here She was already very old. She and her husband moved here
Yes.
many many years ago. He built the house. I tell you, eh he built it in the year forty six. He built it himself.
Oh, my God.
Yes, then, well, he built it, they lived here, here they raised their kids and they all, moved. The man died many years ago, like ten years ago
and the lady was already like eighty years old, imagine, she couldn't maintain the house anymore, and then
Yes.
unfortunately the bank took it from her. What I don't understand is
Aha.
why was she still paying that house. If, if her own husband built it in the year forty, imagine.
So long ago, how strange.
It was already so that Sure, so that the house would be completely paid off don't you think?
Yes, thirty years. In the seven- from the forty to the seventy it should've been paid off.
Sure. Suppose that they refinanced it, here her and suppose that the house had been completely paid off for the years ninety, but can you imagine, it still wasn't paid off. I think that they cheated her.
Ah, what a shame, hm.
We never got to meet the lady. But that was the story the bank told us.
Hm
Yes, well. We bought the house and as they say in English this is a
Yes.
Exactly, yes, even if we've fixed it, like, I wouldn't even have this kitchen cabinet, at all.
Yes, yes.
Or a washing machine, or a fridge.  Like, we had to all put it in ourselves.
Hmm.
Hmm, yes.
We had to organize it. But sometimes it's worth it because it's better to have your money invested in something.
Sure.  Yes, of course, I'll tell you, look.  We also had a lot of credit card debt.  And the first time that we refinanced, well
Yes.
look, all the debt was, like, we totally eliminated it.  And not only this, the student loan debts as well.
Yes.
This debt
Oh, yeah.
Was also eliminated, so that like
This, we did this with my husband.  Eh, the house, he, paid off his house completely, the one in Boston.
Aha.
He totally paid it off and eliminated all the debt, and here we are, well, buying another and moving ahead, no?
Ah, believe me, you have them as investments.
Hmm.
Ah, hey, that's great.
Oh no, no, as an investment, right?, this will be our first home. We sold the one in Boston and we are buying another here
Oh, ok, now i understand, that's, ok, ok, it's fine
uh huh, yes, yes
Hey, one more thing, look, here were we live, we have a two bedrooms house, I'm sorry, two bedrooms and an attic
yes
it doesn't have, uh, basement, that's the only thing, it's a house without a basement, but it has a good acre of terrain
Yes
how much does a house like that cost there, in that area of Phoenix?
Oh, how much?, a house of two bedrooms and an acre, maybe about a hundred and eighty, two thousand pesos
Oh, ok, yes, it will always be a little cheaper there than here in this area
here i, ours, we bought our home with three bedrooms, it's two floors. Uh, so it's three bedrooms, two living rooms, a kkitchen
uh, an additional dining room and uh, a yard. The hose is almost an acre, it's not much, it's not a full acre, and
Uh huh
And it costed us two hundred and forty six thousand dollars, and they still haven't finished building it for us
Oh, can you imagine, i mean, a new home, can you imagine, oh, OK
Right, yes
Uh huh, i mean, compared to the prices over here, that's not so bad
No, no, not so bad. Compared with the prices of Massachusetts, look, a rent for a home like that, like the one I'm living on right now, there in Massachusetts,
costs two thousand dollars, two thousand and five hundred dollars, and here i pay eight hundred, for a house of three bedrooms, a new house of three bedrooms
with a yard, with a living room, with a dining room, with a kitchen, new, all new
Tell me something, those eight hundred pesos you're telling me about, what's that?, rent or mortgage?
No, rent, it's just that I'm renting at this moment
Oh, because you're renting, because you're still, lets say in
That they haven't given me my house yet
Oh ok. Hey eight hundred dollars
That they're building it for me. Right
Eight hundred dollars
Uh, obviously. Without, without, without power, without water, it would be around one thousand and two hundred with all the
Sure, all the expenses you have to do
Uh huh
Hey, well, look at that. We lived in little apartment- an apartment, but that was horrifying, because it was a little apartment, uh, the living-room and the dining room together, a little kitchen there like
four by five meters for example, i mean, a really small thing
I know, i know the houses of
Right
of the part
Well, do you know how much we payed for that apartment?
Um
Six hundred dollars for rent a month, can you imagine. And we are paying one thousand and two hundred a month of mortgage here
But you're in a comfortable part
Of course, yes, yes, of course, i mean, no, uh, well there's no comparison between
Mhm
between being in a, let's say, rented house or being in a
Eh, Lurdes from New York
Miriam again,
Hello, Miriam how are you
Eh, fine and you?
Fine fine, thank God, here eh, the weather has warmed up a little, so everybody is very happy.
Ah, I think you passed the cold on to us then
Really? Ah I'm sorry.
Yes, everything is cool. Yes
Well Miriam, tell me. What do you think about, about that of breaking up with your partner
I think it depends on how long you've been with that person,
Hm
and, how much you love him. Because I recently have, I have a boyfriend, that we had been together years
How many?
Three.
Three, ah, three
Three years. And like two months ago- like some three months ago, I told him, that well no, that no, no, we didn't go out anymore, I already felt I tell him, I already feel old, I tell him, we have no kids, you don't take me out,
I never see you. You come home from work too late and, I was getting angry with the relationship. Yes so then, I told him that, that no, I wanted to break up, and and
and we left, because we lived together. So then I left to my parent's house.
Hm mm
And, later like within a month, he started calling me, that, that to try again, and well. The truth is I missed him the same too.
Hmm
Like the ex- but I tried to bear it.
Sure, sure
And yes, it was pretty difficult, I don't think that I could do it again.  Without being one hundred percent sure that
Sure, sure
that, I didn't want to be with him, but, um, now I'm sorry hmm, I think now that I should have had more patience with him.
Hmmm, hmmm
To give him an opportunity to take me out a bit more, and to be a bit more
To get, to- to fall in love with you again, no.
Yes, and, and then his work is something that, he works in construction, so
Aye, yes
it's difficult for him to come every day, to go out, or it's really really heavy his work.
Sure sure
So I tried to understand it, but a moment came when he came back at nine, ten at night, and I'm really tired, there's something to eat, and
and like, eh, it was a really routine life.  And, we already had a routine, aha.
Really routine, yes, yes yes
And do, this, but no, now, he' he's giving a little bit on his part, and the same for me,
Hmmm
So it depends.
Wow.  Well, now with this, I will tell you that for me breaking up with a partner was always difficult.
Hm mm
Eh, I think that, that when you are young, you don't see I mean young, I mean, you are, I don't know, in high-school or
I mean, when you are starting to meet people, then it is not so hard because you prefer freedom to the compromise of a couple
But then, when you, specially if you have been living with that person, the compromise, the responsibilities, well
it somehow becomes much more difficult, everything in the house, reminds you of that person, eh, your, the daily routine you have
Yes
whatever you do, if you used to share them with that person, then they remind you of that person
Very much, yes, and restaurants specially
So, sure, sure, you can't go anywhere without having a thought for that person, with you all the time, right? And then, while anniversaries keep passing, the first year
yes
everything, every anniversary, every little thing reminds you of that person, the anniversary of whatever, when we nought a
a tree together, I don't know, every little thing reminds you of that person, right?
Aga yes
So I think that the rupture is much more difficult the more history you share with that person, right?
Of my own experience I can tell you that, that when I broke off with my husband, on my first marriage
it was very difficult
Hm mm
We kept working together. So I could not avoid seeing him from time to time
Oh, that, that is true
and so
yes that's even harder, true
Sure
because, you have to keep seeing that person.
Exactly. And, and well one, one tries to be cordial, not trying to be a you understand me, a person that, that, that mixes the
what is happening to you with work, because then that's also unprofessional. But then trying- you know holding it in because, um, in my case it was that I imagined because everyone around me
knew what was happening. That in, in some places it was, was true. And that everybody, was paying attention to see what, how they act
so and so, when they are together, one near the other. Right because then since we were kind of a well known couple at work, well then
eh the whole break up was more or more like public
Hm mm
So, well the fact that there were third parties paying attention or that knew that, were part of the problem, so then that made it so
that the break up well was a little more uncomfortable, because it wasn't just eh, well nothing, what happened to one or the other, but also
how the people around one interacted right.
Yes, yes yes I understand. Yes I can imagine that it must be very hard.
Yes yes, but well thank God well well, those things happen sometimes, I think that, the most important thing is to see those
those moments as an opportunity to grow as a person right. Eh, is easier said than done, but
Yes, no, but for example my dad.
Aha.
With my first boyfriend, he was, very very jealous. And, with the second this guy had really, he had really won him over. He loved him, yes, he loved him.
Really?
And then when I broke up with him, well like I was going to leave to the university, and, and, we were going to be in different states, very far, we were not going to be able to see each other
Hmmm
so I told him, that it was better that, that
Hmm
that we should break up.  And he took it, he didn't want it but he respected the decision, and he understood that it wasn't going to work.
Sure sure
These long distance relationships.
Sure
And this, but this summer was pretty uncomfortable.  My dad is, always told us, for example he said, that he invited him to dinner or
Aye
or what do I know, sure, he invited him, until I had to say, dad, look, this is pretty uncomfortable for me.
Sure sure
Because I'm trying to forget it, yes, I love him, I love him but it, it wasn't going to work.
Sure sure
One, one of the two would finally say, you know what, I want to be with you, or I don't want to be with you, or could be tempted by another person
Sure sure
in the, in the area.  Because you know, when you're at university, or surrounded by people your age, you're you're always meeting different people.
Sure, sure, absolu-, sure.
And, and at the age of eighteen you don't want anything more with your first boyfriend, or the second.
Exactly, exactly.
You, you what to know what's out there, and
Sure, life is like a buffet, if you fill your plate in the first
hm mm
of the fist thing they teach  you, later when things come
No, not what there's more of.
exactly, exactly.
Yes, and that's why, for example, I right now well, with my boyfriend I'm more than good. Right now, he's already talking of, of marriage and all that.
Wow
But I'm a little scared.
well
No, I wouldn't want to right now.
You have to talk about, have to talk about what it is you expect from him, what it is he expects from you.
Because eh, at the hour of truth. As much as one says, whatever, a problem one gets divorced one gets married with the idea that, that you're getting married for the rest of your life right.
And, and of what
Hm mm
and, and And if one thinks that no, because when we get married, he's going to change, or she is going to change, and things will be different. Look, that doesn't happen.
But our parents, want grandchildren.
Things are the same as when
That I say that his parents already want a grandchild.
What? Really?
Yes
what, what he doesn't have any grandchildren?
Oh, they have enough grandchildren, but there's no male grandchild, that carries the family name.
Ah, well, so they can wait. There's no rush
And, and the, and it's funny because, Monday his dad came. Mm well, his parents came, they came to visit from New York
Aha
and they are here in Florida. And, the man is telling us that they're thinking of coming to live here, that ah, the houses are nicer, and
that the weather and all, all, all that
Hm mm
Then, he tells me, to, to let him know. When we are going to get married, so he can start saving. Yes, but I tell him, for what, I tell him, if we are fine like this. We go out whenever we want,
I mean, the ring and signing a paper is not going to change anything, how we are right now.
Hm mm
He says, no he tells me, is that I already want a grandchild he says
Ah
He tells me since his brother, he tells me, didn't point, didn't point well with, with the
Ah, that what he has are girls.
one, the the brother of, of , of my boyfriend
Aha
just had his first child.
Aha, ah, okay, okay
And they didn't want to know, what it was going to be, so then they made it a surprise and at the end it came out a girl.
A girl, aha
Aha, and, and is just them two who can carry the name.
Sure, sure.
So now on the brother's side, they are not going to have any more kids for a while.
Sure, sure.
But my boyfriend, I tell him look, don't even think about it I say. Because I don't want any kids. Is so nice I tell him, to get home and say what do you want to do now. Want to go to this disco or the other.
sure
And you don't have to, don't have to think who's going to take care of the kid, we ran out of milk, we have to go buy diapers, I tell him all this.
Listen that sounds like the conversations that my husband and I have, lately, because we have an eight month old baby,
Aha
And is like that. Since since the baby was born, we have gone out alone, I think that, if we have, we've gone out three times is too much, and like that just to
the movies, or to eat, and running home because the only think we could think about was the kid. So
Yes, and and I no, no. Right now I wouldn't have the mind nor the patience still I tell him, I still have
Hm mm
a lot of drinks to have and a lot of discos to go to I tell him. For me to be able to have a kid.
Eh, is what you have left to do you will have a frustration, and And you will always have the desire and you will always blame the kid.
that look, because of you I wasn't able to these things I dreamed of doing. Or travel, or whatever it was, or study, I mean
Hi
Good evening, and happy holidays
Same to you
yes, thank you, thank you
To whom am I speaking?
Uh, my name is Marco, I'm in Philadelphia, and you?
I'm Maria Ines, I'm in Philadelphia too
Ah
What's up? Where are you from?
Well, everything's well. Excuse me?
Where are you from?
Eh, I grew up in, uh, Paraguay
Paraguay. We're neighbors, I'm from Argentina.
Ah, okay. Okay, let's see, a little, uhm, couples and
Couples breaking up, we got an ugly subject
Yes. Out of all the options. I have to say I only have one experience of
yes, and what was it like?
Uh, let's see, a little, eh, classic story, my first girlfriend, we were stupid, and we just did it, just like that
Em, ah, i imagine it's definitively, some couples have it easier breaking up than others. One thing I realize, well, I'm in a relationship now
it would be, uh, we live together. She has a son who's five now. But we are together since he was 1 year old

yes, I think that it happens to everybody, I mean, not the same to everybody, but to a lot of people
who, who have eh
he figures out how she should be, and then tries to accommodate the person who is his partner to that image, and nobody is
Anyway, it seems that when a person shows a, a personal feature, eh, it is not, it is not something unique of that person, but something that
oh, and well, I like her, I love her very much, but I don't know, I can't think of a little stupid thing that the person thinks she has to bear
that she, just, just, she cuts her nails, yes right, you never see people cutting their nails in the movies
just happy faces, in the movie, they kiss and the end, after that comes the part
Right. No, no, people don't cut their nails. They don't cut their hair. Eh, they don't
Right?
How you call it? Ah, they never put on, of course. Because
No. No, no way
that, that would mean that they are not the size sixty ? sixty, eh, right. That's it
Ninety, sixty, ninety
eh, it's something that, I mean, I think, I knew many people
yes
I had a lot of boy and girlfriends
yes
who had a partner
MHm
and after some time they break off
yes.
And the big drama is, I knew it in some cases, the friend first, after eh, the other friend, when they started going out,
yes.
eh, or vice versa, knowing the friend, and after, you're friends with both.
Sure.
They then break up.
Hmm.
And no, you're practically, for example, if I knew him first, they he had a girlfriend, the girlfriend, and they break up,
yes.
I have the moral obligation to hate her and only talk to him.  That, of course, I'm not, not not like this.  I keep talking to her,
Well ok.
as much, as much as I talk to him, but I don't tell him that I talk to her.
Ah, look.  For this, because, because it's complicated.  Because, I know cases that aren't like this.
And, eh, I think, yes this is true, there are cases that aren't quite like this,
What's complicated is to take, I don't know, your birthday, you have a party, which of the two do you invite?
for example, a- Aha
Aha, there it's complicated.
Eh, this yes and no.  The worst is that now he has another girlfriend.  Ah no.
Ah.
This yeah, and and now I invite the other.  But, no, ah, it's really, really
You come, but you come alone, How do you do it?
yes, exactly, exactly. Is,
Is true, that's happened to me. But, well, I invite everybody, and I tell them who's going to go, then they can come or not. I try to do that. Because, if not, is
very complicated.
yes, it can become
I say, come, but your ex girlfriend will be with her husband. If you like it, fine, And if not, well, one day we'll go have some coffee.
In which case, the classic, the classic, eh, what a man would do, in that case, the typical male,
yes.
has to go look for the best looking woman that he can find. And, eh, go to parties with, with that one
with, talking, of course, of how happy you are, and of the,
And perhaps you just met her two days ago.
yes, yes, exactly, yes is, yes, is that they meet like that, in so much time. Eh,
yes, it seems that, that the Paraguayans are similar to the Argentinians, in that sense, eh.
yes, yes no, yes no, it's worse.
Look.
Eh, yes no, is worse. Eh, is, they are, they are, they are like that.
Very sexist.
Eh, one thing, one thing I know, that they are very, very in Paraguay, very sexist.
Look.
Eh, the woman, in addition to what I had said, has to clean, eh, cook, and of course, raise eh, raise the kids,
Mm
em, beside that, yes, ah, the, aha, yes, she speaks, and has ideas also. That is very,
Those, conflict.
eh, that is, in, in Paraguay, yes.
Ah, look, no, no. Then, in Argentina we are a little bit more moderate, I think.
The worst, is yes, I can imagine, no, I can imagine that yes.
There's a hint, eh, there's a hint of sexism, but I think is not as strong.
In Paraguay, for example, my parents, both, are Paraguayans, eh, they are doctors.
yes.
Eh, that specialized here in the United Stated, which was where I happened. Em, they, both are doctors, he, of course, had the private practice over there in, in Paraguay. And all
yes.
in, excellent. President of the Paraguayan Association or Urology, and the President of the Paraguayan Association of Doctors, of everything But, she, ah, at home.
Look, and she was also a doctor? Is she a doctor also?
We had, she's a doctor also. Eh, dad had two Mercedes, plus the American truck, plus the other. But mom, the minibus. Eh, he doesn't lend her the car, eh,
And it never occurred to her to buy a car?
No, because she didn't have
She doesn't work, right.
no, she didn't have the private practice, or anything like that, Then, eh, basically, she just stayed with that.
Ah.
At the end, eh, I came to the United States to study,
yes.
eh, she, being a doctor, represented Paraguay in the United Nations, eh, and she came, she would come to New York every year, and one year that she came to New York, she came by to visit me,
yes.
and the night before I was going to take her to the airport to go back to Paraguay, she tells me, You know? I think I'm going to stay.
Ah
The day before the flight.
And she stayed?
And, she stayed.
She just stayed?
She, now, has, now, she returned to her practice, here in the state, in, eh here in Philadelphia,
Look.
eh, she was working for the Association of Puerto Ricans on the March, for a while. Eh, then, she, now is working in another hospital, Eh, but she's returned to working here, and, she goes over there.
Look, and but, they as a couple, did they separate?
They separated, eh, but, dad didn't find out until much later. I'm not, don't even remember well if they notified him that she wasn't going to be in the airport,
But, how hard Right? Because, of the situation the limit that your mom had face because of the issue of sexism. Right? Because,
Eh, yes definitely- But, one thing I remember, mom was working for, also, for eh, what? in, ah, the eh, in the health ministry.
yes.
Eh, that was her in the, in the Ministry for Women.
Ah,
Eh, and one of the things I remember, she did a lot of work with, did a lot of work with the, eh, international organizations of, of, of development and that.
yes.
Eh, one, I remember when she told me that machismo is perpetuated by women.
And, that can be true.
For example, the mother is the one that educates the children and the way that she behaves with their father or the father with her,
well, children take notice.
yes.
So, basically, women decide on that, if we want to avoid machismo.
yes, it's so hard. But that's true, eh.
But it is hard.
When we are little, you know what they give them, I don't know if it's genetic or not but they play with dolls.
Mhm.
and boys play with little cars, or, I don't know if it is that way because we are conditioning them to play that way
yes, that's right, that's genetic. That's for example, like when I'm in, I, eh, in computer science.
yes.
I'm the, eh, computers, computers and this and that, em, I remember that we had a lot of articles talking about the lack of women in that field.
in the computing areas,
yes.
So, I think that, basically, the percentage of women working in the computer area is really low.
I see.
And I've also heard people complaining that the games, that all toys are for boys, that there are no toys for girls and
But, looking it in other way?, Who?
Hello, Jorge, from New York
Hi, Jorge, This is Nicky
Hi, Nicky, How are you doing?
Hi, what do you think about the question?
Well, it's a hot topic, you could say, right?
yes
I think that definitively, well, it's something really common this time
yes
and what do you think about it
Well, it's really hard to brake, I don't know, I think that depends in the person, like
you see your couple, I think that it's an investing in time, and well, for me, I had to brake with
someone and I always see the positive, and I think that that person is good and I want to be his friend, and as always, a common topic
Many men don't want to be just friends
Sure
And well, for me, it has been long, and sometimes, braking up, I do it. And there is always a time where you don't communicate, but
And I always communicate as a friend. Because I think that I invested time, and I know well his family and I want that family and love and all that
Sure, well, in my case, it has been a long time ago since my last brake up, and I practically don't know what is braking up, right?. with someone, I have
Yes
15 years with my wife, right?
Wow, that's nice
yes. So, well, we've been here for fifteen years, between us, we've broken up, we've gotten back together, we've had fights, we've made up the next day. But,
yes.
that hadn't happened, this type of break up like, the, the, in fact, the, the one mentioned in the question, right? As you just said, well, there are many people out there, definitely, in that sense, I mean, why can't they find their real match, or
or why aren't they ready, right? Or, I don't know.
yes.
Or they don't feel the need. Many times, one, oh, you get to, you become so independent that, sometimes, you feel uncomfortable about having someone by your side, I imagine, right?
yes, yes, I, I believe so. There's always people, men and women, that don't want to have a long relationship. But, this changes with age, I believe, and, by person.
More than by the age, by the person, I believe that in t hat sense, I'm, what happens here is that there are so many different types of persons, cultures, different
am, people from different countries, am,
yes.
in that sense, well, they have traditions, right? different. So, many times, that influences them to, suddenly, the person that you feel is right for you, well, after a while you realize that it's not like that because that person doesn't share your traditions, always, what do I know? your favorite foods, right? your tastes.
yes.
or your traditions, what do I know? Mm, your religion or stuff, simple stuff, right? Simple basic stuff.
yes, yes.
So, you end up being too different. Where are you from?
I, I'm Dominican, and you?
Oh, from Ecuador.
Oh, you know what? I realize, with this research, that they are bringing people together, I mean, they are linking people from South America or the ones from the Caribbean. I mean, I've never spoken with someone from the Caribbean.
And, I guess that people from South America haven't gotten a chance to speak to someone from South America, I don't know.
Well, no, and, I have, I've spoken with someone from Argentina.
I guess. Oh yes?
And, the other time, I don't remember, but I think it was someone from Peru, that I talked with
Ah
Yeah, well, it all depends, but in that sense. I mean, what I, uhm, for example, in this subject, I agree more with getting paired up with a woman, definitively. Because it's more
yes
it's easier talking about that. No? but there was one that
yes, that's true. I also think that it depends on, on, as you said, on the culture, it depends on, on how you were raised up. I, my
my parents raised me, in the Dominican style, but also in the 19th century's style
I see
I mean, they told me, never, never, I mean never, let me go out to meet, to find love, let's say, when I was a young girl. They told me, no, no, no, you get married first, and then you
fall in love. And, I, oh
And you, do you agree with that?
No, no, but I have brothers that, yes, they got married and then knew each other. That's why I was so
But, are they still married, have they had a long marriage?
yes? yes, yes. I have, I have a sister who's been married for 25 years, and a brother, 30 years already, and both, it was their first experience with love. They were very young, I mean, they had like 19 years
Wow
And, just like that, they later got to know their husband or wife, and they're still together. I think that's, that's fine. But I, didn't, didn't
didn't understand that tradition. But that's why it varies, no? But at the same time, it's difficult. I think people
Sure
When you last too much, I think everyone, when they're adults, have had relationships where, where they think, ay, that relationship lasted too long, lasted 2 years more than what we thought
And, is because they don't want to hurt, such person, or they think, or have hopes, maybe that person is for me, but I don't know, let's see.
Aha, aha, Mm, no, I don't believe that too much.
Eh, Really?
I, rather, what I think is that, definitely, you have to break that myth right? that, um, before getting married, or before living with someone, you can't I don't know? be with your partner or, or you can't
have any sort of relation. I think that the important thing is that you experiment all that before getting married.
yes, I agree.
Because from there, from the first day of being married, you realize a lot of things that you ignored.
yes.
I don't know, how your partner sleeps, how he wakes up, eh,
yes, they're the little things that
sure, how she cooks, what habits she has, if she's neat, if she's disorganized, ah
yes, yes
they are so many things Right? that, all of a sudden you were, you saw that person so pretty, when you went out as boyfriend and girlfriend, that you  would go to the movies holding hands.
yes.
And later, when you get married, the next day, you see, ah, a woman without any makeup that, ah, you get scared, or I don't know? anything Right?
yes, yes, yes
Or, in the same way, the wife. Right? I mean, she sees, the man, fixed up, all nice, but who knows, maybe, the guy is used to taking a bath every three, four days right? Is like that.
yes, many stop taking care of themselves. That why it varies.
Sure. Sure. But, in that sense, like I tell you, I mean, um, is, for me, in my years before. As a young guy, it was
easy, you could say, it was, it wasn't too simple breaking up. Right? Because, it's always a relationship. You get used to that person Right? especially, get used to having a relationship
yes, yes
One person at a, at a time
yes
But it's hard to break up with someone just like that, no? But here, I see people who break up with you, go to the next person the next day, then break up with that one
yes
and the next day, the next guy on the list, no?
Yes, that surprised me in this country. When I was in college, I saw people who broke up and were all friends
hmm
american, and they broke up. Then, they went out with, with their best friend's girlfriend, something like that. And I was   like How? and I also think that
it depends, but, in some Hispanic culture, co- for me, for dominicans, and for other hispanic people, when you're with someone, you know her, like, little by little
Sure
Seeing the whole family. And that makes the difference, I think, but that I see as investing time
Sure
And it's also key, in getting to  know your girlfriend or boyfriend, so that person will get along OK with your family
Well, it's that, he's a boyfriend, believe it or not, despite what they say, many people say, and I agree with that
I'm married with my wife, not with the family. But anyways, the inf-, the family has a huge influence
yes, yes
Because, yes, what do I know? if you don't get along with your wife's family, she's going to feel bad. Or, just the same, if she doesn't get along with her husband's family, he'll feel bad because they can't go to visit, or what, I go and you stay home. I mean, it's
yes
if you take your partner, you carry, not the burden of his or her family, but the responsibility of, of keeping the party in peace, no?
yes, yes. Or, I know when I, When I was in love, I always noticed the, the way my boyfriend treated his mother or his sister. Because, is you marry that person, yes,
yes see, I, I think, is the same way he is going to treat his wife. Or if, if the person is a woman, I have friends who say the same thing. They truly
see and study how their girlfriends treat their sisters, their dads, because, that was, that was our first experience, Right?, with, with men or women, they are our mentors.
Of course. Of course.
Because of that, it changes, changes. A trick for me, I am married, and my husband and me, we always say that we are in love. No, we don´t say we are married, and so, still we are not going to , I don´t know, to think,
no, we are not, not going to neglect too much, lets go to, go out, the cinema, or whatever, have a date, or a date,
Aha.
and so.
No, that is good, that is good. However, like I tell you, so,sometimes you are not careful about it. Right?
yes.
So, it becomes a routine, you are neglected, but, yes it is good, hmm. In that sense, to go out of monotony. Because,
yes.
there is the base of, maybe, you are fine, and continue fine, how was the topic, breaks. Right? Definitively.
yes.
It is so, so simple to, to do easy things and, and well. Then, that way, that way all goes well. Right?
yes, it is true. But, also, I know is different with each couple. Because life goes by. Right?, and if they have children, You know? it is more difficult to do it.
Because, life, gets more complex, more busy. It is more difficult. yes, like if you were, only boyfriends.
yes, I know, no, sure it is. I think that with th, with, when you have children, the, the situation is like more, more complicated. But, at the same time, it is
like a more, besides more complicated, it is more responsibility. Right? And it, like, suddenly, like that you are more tied to that person. Right?
yes. yes.
In my case we have a girl and we will have a baby the first week of January.
Wow,That´s nice congratulations.
OK thank you, it is more responsibility right? It is like the illusion that we will have another child at home.
that attaches me to my wife, right?
of couse.
I definitely get more attach, right?
that is great.
I have seen many friends who believe they have found the ideal partner but no.
yes.
how are you?
Hello, yes this is Jorge, I am talking from Los Angeles, California
hi, how are you?, Jorge my name is Adrian and I live in Toronto, Ontario, Canada
who am I talking to? oh, fine, fine Adrian, Adrian what has Spanish to do in your life? where do you come from? what's your..? how you call it?
background
your background, your origin, I didn't want to use English
mm, I was born in Buenos Aires, eh, Argentina, I lived until four years ago in Buenos Aires, Argentina
oh my goodness
that's why I have the 'porteño' accent
where in Buenos Aires? from what district of Buenos Aires?
eh, I was born in Villa de Boto, no, really
very good, yes, I am, I ,I am from Buenos  Aires as well
from what part?
well I am from Buenos Aires, I was born and mm, basically I was born and raised in La Nuz west, in a, in a place, a city called Valentina Alcina
have you vere heard that?
yes, yes, yes, yes, of, of
see, what a coincidence, I don't, I don't usually talk to people from Argentina, you are like the third one, well anyway, how is it in Ontario?
eh, cold yes
very cold, right? what's the temperature there?
eh, no, today it was about two Celsius, positive, so
my God well
it was, it was pretty hot, it should be cold but the snow is melting. It rained today, the whole day, so there's still a bit of snow, I'm looking over there
so, it's amazing, you've been in Canada for four years?
I've been here since four years ago, yes
very good, very good, I've been in the United States for eighteen years, very good, well, today's subject is why do people
break up, I don't know with whom
oh, they want us to be philosophers,
I don't know who is conjugating the verbs but this people is breaking
no, you are wrong, yes, yes, oh, what happens is that, this is what happens, this is what happens
I mean get a dictionary or something,
no, why do couples break up, okay, oh, well, I don't know what to say, couple stuff has no rules, basically, isn't it?
I believe that all break ups are
oh, break ups
are, yes, break ups are wrong because they are never good or easy, otherwise people wouldn't break up, right? I guess but
exactly, exactly
if everything is going on well, they wouldn't break up
exactly, exactly, exactly, exactly, well what happens is that, oh, there can be, there are lots of reasons why, a person, you know
you know, decides to break up with someone, the only thing that I can say is that those types of relationships are quite hard, oh
did you, did you leave Argentina four years, five years ago? Have you seen that
mm yes
And Well, the social situation in Argentina has changed a lot, when you left it, it has change a lot
when, I left Argentina, in march of 1986, well, we didn't even had a divorce law
divorce didn't existed and I think it started just like 14, 15 years ago, more or less
I think that was for
a thing, yes
I think that was for the time of Alfonsino
exactly, but when you left, people was divorcing a lot
Something like that, because people got married in Montevideo, in Paraguay and there was a parallel system, further than the formal, right?
really Argentinian, a parallel system, there was a song that way: let's get marry in Mexico or Paraguay
yes, I know about that, but
it was the tradition, in those times, before the existence of divorce
yes, but listed to me, there is people, that, let's say,
In Argentina, they got married in Paraguay, Uruguay, or Mexico, like you can choose and well, that marriage wasn't legal for Argentinian laws
Yes, do you remember that, Am I right about I'm saying?
yes, but I think that there also was
I mean, for Argentinian laws, that marriage didn't existed
Mmm, no, that's not my area
not my field
No
yes, but do you understand me?, I mean, many people was interested in getting married that way, but for many other people, they weren't interested in that
they were married, do you understand? but for the law, the laws, they were living, they were concubines, do you understand what I'm saying?
mm
oh but, mm basically, well apparently the laws of divorce, they were approved in Argentina and people is much more free now, to to get a divorce
to end their relationship, one of my cousins came here, I have one cousin who came to visit from Buenos Aires and you must've seen it, it hasn't been long since you arrived in Canada, but they say that the situation in
the economical situation in Argentina is so hard that basically, people now don't even get married, do you understand what I'm saying? oh
they have a partner, and so on, and so on, they have a certain percentage of people marrying but it's not a
because of the money
because of the, the cost, of what that costs, no? it's too expensive to get married so people, oh, they just decide and I'm telling you
oh, to me, I never, it's my idea I might be a dreamer but I'm a bit liberal and to me, oh, I will never get married in a civil registry, to me, that doesn't mean anything, do you understand what I'm saying?
oh, sure, it's not a guarantee, right?
it's not a guarantee, do you understand? To me, going to the civil registry or marrying in a church, is not a guarantee, there's no guarantee, it's not a guarantee to
no, that's no, that doesn't mean anything, the important thing is the respect that the couple has with each other, no? If they get along, the members of the couple
and the respect, no? If there's respect, that's that's everything,a signed paper is not going to guarantee or change anything, that's what I think, no?
it might be different for, it's different for some women, it makes them feel, oh
safer,
safer, isn't it? I don't know, I don't think that way. Do you think?
if he has, it has, it has lots of symbolism oh, to me, it's more about tradition and it's natural and a social issue and
exactly
oh, what do I know!
yes, that's it, yes, that's it, basically, it's a tradition.
the, one, it was one, yes, one difference that, that you wouldn't get between the cassette inserted in the head of an Argentinian
woman and an average Canadian woman, let's say, the average Argentinian wants to get married, the church and the wedding party, and has all that stuff in her head, and the Canadian one is somehow more concerned on the engagement ring
and the size of the stone, oh yes
the Canadian?
eh, they, they pay more attention on that, no, no, seriously let me say
that is not true, because it's the same in the United States
eh, but the cultural difference is big, the, the, they do care more about that than the party, the event itself
they do value that but like, like, somehow it is lighter because it's something quick and so
yes, yes, yes
and they marry at noon, have lunch at four o'clock and at eight o'clock everybody goes home and that's it
right
but the, the stone, since she will wear it all her life in the finger
right? it is true, it is true, so, that is what you have observed in the Canadian society, well that's a, that's what
happens, let me say, it is similar to what happens here, in the United States and
no, and not, not long ago I talked to an Argentinian friend of mine here, and he said, thanks god we didn't born here and had to marry in this country
we saved a lot in the ring
what? pardon, what is it your friend said?
I was saying that my friend he said  than god we didn't marru in this country, we saved a lot in diamonds, sure
in Canada, yes, yes but that is rel- you know everything is relative, isn't it? it depends on the person, Argentinians do care about that as well, don't they?
the ring, not so much, right?
yes, but, yes but no, it's not so, uh, no, there isn't a tradition of, it's, the size of the rock and
the rock
the, not long ago, a few months ago, a Canadian boy that works here with me got married, and, i, every time i had the chance i asked him
uh, about the rock thing and the size of the rock and the
..
he, the, with that, using the subject in my favor, that "look, it's just that I'm here and i'm a new comer" and i don't know what else
exactly
and, "explain me about the rock and the, the, the number"
Hello?
Hello?
Hello.
Eh, how are you?
Fine, and you?  I'm Alicia.
Alicia.
yes.
Hello and, where are you?
In Atlanta, Georgia, and you?
Oh well, I'm in New York.
Ah, New York, how nice.  And how did that strike go?
Sorry?
How was the strike, the transportation strike?
yes, yes, last week was a little bit difficult.
I imagine.
Like, but I didn't have that many problems because, well, I, I don't work very far from where I live, and my friend took me in her
Ah.
car to work.
Ah, that's good.
One time I had to go to Manhattan and I walked.
Ah.
And was, so, I last, from the place I work in Manhattan I last about forty five minutes walking. It was far but not
Wow, of course.
not so far, so, not like miles and miles.
No, yes, of course. Wow, how interesting, yes.
But yes. We are happy. I think that we are, we all are happy that the strike ended.
That is logical. That is logical.
And where are you from?
I am from Chile.
Ah, from Chile. What part of Chile are you from?
From Santiago, but I lived in Santiago, Concepcion and in a town called Los Andes.
Look, I lived in Chile for two years.
Right?
yes, in Chile, in Santiago. I
Wow. Of course.
I was living in Nuñoa and after that in Providencia.
Ah wow.
I was teaching English there.
How fun. In fact I know that place. I have relatives in Providencia now. How fun. And where are you from?
Well, I was born here in New York. My family is from Cuba.
Ay ay ay. Ay, Cuba, okay, perfect.
My Dad's Cuban.
Ah.
Well, my Spanish is the the the Cuban kind and
Sure.
studying Spanish here and being in Chile and all that.
Sure, from all around.
I'm a mix.
Sure, but a New Yorker in the end.
yes, I am.
Sure, for example I in fact lived in Chile  until I was eleven years old and after I returned. For example, I came back during high school.
I was there two years and also I returned the year two years back I was in Chile the whole year so that's like
And you have family there, family?
I try to go and come back and all that. yes, yes. It's that my father is over there, my mother's here, one of those
Ah, yes.
it's like, like today's theme.
Sure, no. I don't understand the theme very well that yes that yes Is it difficult to break up with your partner? Or rather, it's a like a dumb question well.
It's right, or you know, is it going to be easy ah, yes, yes
It's just a a stupid question. yes, I believe that it's hard to end a relationship.
Sure.
Even if the relation doesn't go too well, it is difficult anyway
And it's true, as a matter of fact I, eh
Unless, unless you really don't care. I mean, if you are with the other just due to boredom, then it may not be so difficult
Well, I was talking to a friend of mine, she, she called me by Christmas, eh, she called me and she had a boyfriend
they had been together for four years, and they lived together and everything, and it was the kind of relation that you knew that, I mean, as a matter of fact I only knew from it last year
Mh
Ehm and I could feel, on both of them, that it looked bad, yes, you could feel some
Mh
it was obvious, let's say, they were somehow different. He was kind of immature
Mhm
and she,  I don't know, you could notice a strange attitude, but anyway, they broke off in December, I mean last December, one month ago. And she is suffering and it is incredible because
even herself recognizes that he was not meant for her and that she doesn't know how thy could last so long, but she suffers anyway because she can't get used to it
yes. I, I think that sometimes difficult relations are even more difficult to finish because there are many, I mean, in an easy relation
yes?
Things are not going on fine and when you finish you don't feel so bad because the feeling was not so big. I mean, I was once with someone
and we did get along but there was not much passion and when we broke off it was not so hard
Oh, sure, Oh, yes, that's true
I mean, it's hard after all, I mean it was also difficult afterwards
Sure
And you missed him, but it was not that much suffering like other times
Mhm.
I do believe that that was the reason why we had such a good relationship but it was never so
Passionate.
But I do believe that sometimes, that type of relationship is hard, when you are always talking about those things, it's hard to end it because you
Oh, it's the same feeling. You get addicted to the emotion, that's right.
Sure, you are too involved, you are too involved with that feelings.
That's right. It's true, that's so true, it's like they say, that love and hate are two sides of the same coin, yes.
Sure, yes. I believe, I believe that when one
Like I said, it was too emotional.
mh, when you, when you are in love, it's like, you don't care, you can be so mad, you can get so mad with the person you love, even more than with any other person.
And it's also funny that oh, it's hard to break up with someone, or if they break up with you, I mean, I've been through that, obviously, twice and
in a way, I rather let them break up with me because it was a two year relationship, a bit longer
Mh.
but in the sixth month, it was like I was tired of him but he was like, no, I love you, I adore you, that's why
so, I felt a bit, we would say in chile, it became a pain in the ass. I mean, I felt
Mh.
pity, me
Mh.
I felt sorry for him.
yes.
So i went on with the guy for another year and a half
Oh, yes
I felt sorry after that
Sure
And i really saw him once a week only because i was going to college full-time at that time and working part-time
Uh
So, i was still busy. So i kinda didn't pay much attention to him, but i was still like, the last six months i was like
Oh, i want to get rid of this person, but it was so terrible, because he kinda
Sure
every time he had the feeling i was going away, he sort of felt despaired, so i kinda, it was very stressful to me to know that i could cause such pain to someone else
Oh
that, like i told myself, you know, i, uh, it's better to get kicked myself than the other
Oh, that's hard, it also happened to me once
yes, yes
when i was very young, i was very young, i was like fourteen when we started and fifteen when we broke up but
Yeah
likewise, like he was like too close to me, like always with me and very
sure
romantic, i mean a boy, really a boy, but still
Sure
and I wasn't too interested in him but
yes.
I had never had a boyfriend nor anything and I felt
Sure, the opportunity, let's say.
I felt like guilty, like leaving him and breaking his heart like I was
yes
guilty. I couldn't, couldn't, couldn't and I knew as you say I knew. After like a month of being together I knew that
Sure. Sure, like, what mess have I gotten myself into, yes.
but, well, after that experience like I realized that you have to end things more, more
yes, is true.
soon because I stayed with him like a year
Sure, from pure pity.
and at that age a year is like too much time.
yes, is true, well is everything in life already. Is like, the pure truth. No, but in fact it hurts the same when they leave you, they leave you but
I think both ways are hard, I mean
but I
that they leave you, one feels so bad, I mean one is like And I have friends, I have a friend that she just recently ended with a
with a boyfriend that they had already been together years and years. And he left her and she had like no idea no idea, like she didn't know.
She didn't know.
I mean no
I mean, what happens, did he stopped loving her, let's say?
He started to think things for the future, and decided  that even if he really loved her, for the
Mmm
future, it wasn't going to work, like
as a couple
They had been together a few years, and he felt that he didn't wanted to spent your future with her, and decided to end it because he didn't
Oh
He didn't wanted to marry her, I mean
Sure, and after 4 years you start to think, well, where is this relationship going?, I mean
Sure, and I think that that as, and he also was really worried, I mean, sometimes
And
That happens most to guys that to women, that
Mmm
And things start getting more serious, and
Sure
And people gets nerveous
Sure, it's hard, and that book that was presented a few time ago. He is no that into you, I was checking, and one of the things this book says, I mean, what this book does is like
He is not that into you was really popular in a season, last year, I think
I don't know it, No, I don't know it
But, hello?, No, It's a book that a dude wrote because the reason, the book, I mean, women are always complaining about how bad is her boyfriend
that the boyfriend, that the boyfriend the other but in reality, according to him, the boyfriend is bad and this and the other because he simply
he's not that into you, I mean, he's not in love with you. Because probably this guy, if it's that he, if a crazy is really in love with a woman is
is one hundred percent, I mean,
Mm.
he gives you flowers, tells you he wants to marry you, he calls you on the phone every day blah blah blah, because that's how men are when they are really in love like that
Sure. Well, I think that men and women like when they really are
Then
in love like they behave like that. But I think that many times is one person in the relation who's like that and the other a little more distant.
yes,
I mean, is like hard that both people are so like that, like so romantic, like
Sure.
Basically is one person, one, I mean, either the man or the woman that
Yes.
that is so
One hundred percent.
Sure, and the, and the other is like more distant. Maybe interested just the same, but a little more like
Mm.
distant, is like hard to have that intensity in both people.
yes yes, I've heard of that. Is true, or sometimes that, when the people are together for so long like there are changes, like for a year
he is more than her and the next year she is more than him, then
Sure
It's like a little dance that exist
I think that there is some kind of imbalance, I mean, there has to be a little of difference because there are many people
It's like you have to be hunting a little and it's like
Married
sire, like a hunter and
the prey let's say, right?
Mmm, Like some kind of game, I mean, it's not do it on purpose
Hello!
Hello!
yes, good evening, my name is George from New York. Whom am I speaking with?
Hello, I'm Alfredo, also from New York
Ah, how are you?
Pardon, I didn't understand your name what's your name?
George, George
George okay
George
Very good,
yes, How is it going?
You live where? You live in Manhattan?
yes, of course
okay
in Handen yes, Where do you live?
yes, also.
ah, good
let's go to the
Then, What do you think of today's topic?
eh, I've seen better topics. I've seen better topics but
on the topic
it's what you, ah, do you have a partner?
I've had three casual partners, right now I've been
ah, yes
Right, I've had quite a bit of experience on the topic, hmm
ah, yes
yes
and, eh, eh, and how long were you with her?
hmm, like eleven years.  I spent like eleven years with my third partner.
Ah, quite a bit, yes, I think that as time passes, like, the longer the relationship the higher is the level, I say
and stronger I say, No?
More than
Or, Do you think it's the same?  Do you think that, as we say, a relationship that lasts many years
yes
lasts more.  When did it end?
hmm
you see that it's proportional to the length of the relationship, or, No?
For the length of the relationship.
yes
Well
Oh no
no, I don't know I think that any relationship, whenever it ends, it's always always the same, I think that well, more than a year or two
I think that it's always the same.  Isn't it?  Really, well, what I think is that the routine is really rough, it's really rough, a lot of times you don't
you sacrifice yourself for your kids and there are some relationships that are really tormented, no?
yes, sure, Do you have kids?
so yes, I have kids.  I had kids in all three relationships and well, really well, I never stopped to look at, at how good
yes, well, there can be confrontations, I'm also a son of separated parents, no?
aha
And well, my parent's separation never really affected me.
yeah
that my kids well don't, don't suffer much but I prefer any way, sure, that they don't come out affected, right?
yeah
But I see many couples, I see that years and years and they're, ugh! a torment, I say no, I think that
it's a situation for the kids.  A, a couple that doesn't love each other, a couple that can't live together and put up with each other, no?  no more, no more than
yes, that what they've shown.
to not
this is, they've proved that it's more damaging.
yes, yes I think it's more damaging, I think that a separation sometimes is better
it's more
so well, this, this is my case and my philosophy, no?
Yeah
At least
and the other relationships?  Like eleven years.  You have three relationships.  Yes, eleven and this and, how long did the other two last?
No, one lasted about six years.  Really I, the six years yeah, why not.  I don't give it more.
yeah yeah
yes.  I don't know but, but the truth is that a pers- that after six year's it's so that, I don't know
yeah
Like there's no flavor in it.  Yes, and
Well, and what other things did they ask us?  Now they asked us that, another question was if with age one changes, the, the
the pain, let's say, what do you think?
I think that I think it's not so much age, but suddenly the stability, suddenly the economic situation and and the human situation.  Right?
yes,
Because for example many couples who have never separated and last twenty years and in many cases, and where the woman has never worked
This is a, a traumatic situation
Sure
yes, a person who's never left the house who's always been submitted, let's say to the labors of the house
Sure, it's
it's
invested everything in being house mothers.  like
Exactly.  So I, for example, I always, the relationships I've had, I always, I don't demand them, but I've always permitted them to have their jobs.
Always, always. Yes, that they have their independence, that, that they depend absolutely on themselves, right?
yes
that, that is my criterion, because I think, you know, I am not good for having a woman in the house
yes
That's it, You get home, just figure, you get home tired of working and so, the woman all day long doing so, busy and suddenly she wants
she wants you to attend her already, right?
mhm
And, and then, as I heard the other day, someone called to a radio station to apologize to her wife because
she had gone mad, because he had arrived tired and she wanted to go out
And no, that's not it, what?, repeat that
So, of course, what?
I didn't understand that last part
Oh, well, someone who called to apologize to his wife because the day before he had arrived late from work, he had arrived tired, the women don't work
and the woman had asked him to go out, and he told her: No I'm very tired, I can't, I don't want to go out I'm very tired
So it's a difficult situation, right? Because it's two, two completely different situations, right?
yes, of course
Because one is out and gets home tired, he wants to arrive to rest. The other one is home all day long, she is bored and wants to
Wants to go out, wants to do something, of course
Exactly. So, I always prefer the partner to work. She has to work, she has to be occupied with something
And have your partners been American?
No, no, never, no
Yeah yeah
This is another situation.  I think that he will have an American partner, good, but he's already talked enough and what is your
Well, look, I
your experience or point of view.
my point of view is that I think that it makes a difference, I think I could be wrong, but I think that with time relationships become cemented.
So, a relationships, let's say a year long one, is like falling one meter.
yes
A ten year relationships is a much stronger fall.
hmm
in my opinion.  Because I think that with time you even, let's say that being in love and the difficult thing is this part
yes
I think that if you get, for example a pet, I don't know if you've had pets that dies, but
hmm
when you live with a dog for ten years and
hmm
and it goes, like this I'm making like a, it's not like when a person dies but, love dies, and this is like a, a loss.
No, I understand, always
I find that the more time and the more you get used to someone, the stronger it is,
hmm well I think that if it's a break- well let's say that a moment comes to one or the other, one of the two gets to this point, no?
Uh huh
Uh, suddenly that one, because suddenly, when things are coming, they look like, like they don't, well suddenly people have to prepare, and suddenly it's because of lack of preparation from the people, right?
But, yes, obviously, obviously
That's, that's a good point
Obviously, with age, the habits, there are many things, it's obviously not easy, yeah
There are many factors, but we agree that a, a, a, a fact, uh, that's, they call it nail, i didn't think about that
what
Yes
sometimes i find it true, uh
Yes
that it's so suddenly, and, and
Yes,
It's the same in death, when
Yes, the, death
It dies, when it was already know that it was cancer and it was known that
Exactly, you say yeah, i was expecting that, yes
that was suffering, sure, it's very different to a son dying in an accident
Yeah, exactly, or like a pet, right?, or the worst cases that
yes
I mean, there are people that get affected, uh, enormously, enormously, because they love them so much, right?, yeah, i don't know, i think that
Well, I don't know, really
You say that when things end, they are bad
yes, I think that many things that when they don't work anymore, you should not stand that, I don't know, many fights, It's like there is not
there is not, there is not anything
I mean, I think that they might be
There is not
that they agree, because I know that there are times that they both realize that is not working
Mmm
But I think that there are also cases, where someone really stays
yes
more affected that the other one, I mean
yes, yes, I think that most of the time, right?, it's really weird to coincide both of them
yes
I think that almost every time one of them is more affected that the other one
I think that might be a huge factor, right?
yes
It must be really easy to be on the side that it's rejecting, not the rejected, right?
yes, I think that it's not easy, and there is many things around, right?, economical situation, children
loneliness, and finding a moment because it didn't had friends, all because it was completely dedicated to the relationship, right?
Mmm
as they say: "To start over again", it's not easy, it's really not
yes, and in the holiday season, that must have been a little
Ah, no
hard. No? why
yes, it's, it's, yes, sure
because
you have
well, I don't know how old the kids are, but
the
how do you do those things you do when Santa Claus has that kind of problems, I don't know
yes, yes, that's hard, it's running to one place, running to another
yes, yes, that excuse is, is good
I've had to do it sometimes, well, I go there I think he disagrees with it
yes
I know, I always, I feel that, someone feels offended, or someone is going to be angry always, to tell the truth
yes, you can't be in three places at the same time
yes, no, that's true, that's very true
You don't distribute it, you divide it. But, hey, I say, with the, the, the thing with your family, let's say current, I mean
yes
What they are, I also meant. They, are like splitting up, right?
hmm
How do they treat an, an issue like Christmas?  Like, do the kids realize that this is happening?  or
are they hiding it or did they tell them, or, how are they dealing with this?
well I'm really in this trance where, that I still don't
Yeah
no, let's say no, no, there are differences, there's a very big difference
yes
let's say it's talked about,
Yeah
yes, really yes, but it's very difficult.  Sure, obviously,
This is the difficult part, yes
But, it's really difficult, it happened to me many years ago between the first and the second relationship, it was really difficult
yes
it was really difficult, well above all, well, there are different attitudes of the people.  No?  Involved in this issue.
yes
so well, yes it's, it's not easy but I think that, in truth, like I say, I say, I told her
Hello
James, New York
Hello, my name is Miriam, from Toronto.
Miriam from Toronto, how are you?
Fine, and what's your name?
I'm James, from here from New York.
Oh, Hi James how are you?
Fine
How nice And eh, the break up of couples And, and well tell me what, what is your experience when breaking up with a person. Do you feel very bad?
How, how, how has it happened?
Well, thank, eh, thank God that eh, I got a woman today, because really the topic with a man is like it's more I wanted eh
this, this day that I got it, I said well I would've liked to have gotten a woman to see from a woman's point of view what it is that
that she has in mind, what she really thinks,
I mean, okay tell me.
really for me, I find it easy to break up with a person, as long as I've been with her a short time, and, I see that the relationship is not going to get anywhere, anywhere, instead of
prolonging it, well I like, I like then, to evaluate it and like that well, here, we are not going to get anywhere, mm
let's, let's keep a friendship better, that have her, string her along because of pity, or for any other convenience, or with another reason, another reason that
that that, could be a reason, or could be a motive to, to, to, prolong the relationship a little bit more. I think that if,
at first you see the person you realize what you want, and what the other person, you realize what really
expect from her, the other doesn't have it, you don't find it in that person Or the same, the same chemistry with, with that person well, I think that you realize that
you can decide if it drags on the matter
Hm mm
I think we will be better as friends
okay
you must respect yourself and decide which person you should be the one for you.
you know there is always an explanation about things
in your experience have you had many broke ups and you evaluate people?
I like to evaluate the person because they can always be different.
okay
often they broke up with me some other times I broke up the relationship
okay
sometimes you break uo with the person but
you better not be together when it does not matter.
you usually always and up missing  the person.
is it always?
we always miss the person.
Oh yeah, whenever the person is miss, you know, you get together with someone, then there are memories, moments together, and stuff.
you provided that the person is not always there when you really miss him/her.That´s when you realize what you want in your life.
for example my last relationship
was a little long with a girl.
Hm mm
The problem with this girl is that she was too, flirtatious.
Aha
And, also, the problem also that eh, yes flirtatious. So she was always flirting with all the guys. And she was also very pretty.
Aha
Then, we always had a lot And she always would go out by here by there, And, she was very dishonest.
Oh, but did you notice that before getting into the relationship?
No, not before getting into it no. During the relationship I realized it, I broke it off,
Aha
I broke it off and for, for missing her and all that, she called me, and she tells me, no I'm going to change, you know that I don't know what,
She changed for a moment, but then again, it went back to the same, and there was always this question that she was going to change. I always gave her an opportunity to
Oh, but, yes, the flirtatious person, doesn't mean that, that they cheat on you, but that they are like that, they have a happy nature. Or is
No, no
that apart from being a flirt, she was cheating on you.
No no, a flirt yes, she went out with guys, and would tell me that no.
Oh well, that's wrong, that's already wrong.
She would tell me that no, that that it wasn't like that, that, and then I would realize it because I would see her, I would see her I found her several times.
Oh no that's wrong, that's wrong, yes
And she would still tell me no, that it's a lie, that we only went to the movies and nothing else, that I don't know what,
Ah no
But after I found, I found out that if they really had left for a few says, and they had
thinking love, then
Oh, that's a shame, Why there are women like that, so
Well, there are loves like those
dishonest
Love like those, so
Yeah
Oh, I broke up with her, that's why I told you, I told to myself, she said, no, I will change again, and I said, no, no to this
it's a vicious circle
Mmm
You will never change
Yes
You will nave change, and it's not good for me, so  I closed the door, I missed here, sure, the
I missed to listen to her voice listen, some places, anything, but you really realized that is not for you, is not what you want for your life, a woman that is behind
A woman you have to behind her. Looking who she calls, who she does not call, who is by the house or who is not by the house, so, that is not for me
Yes, that's really sad, sure, sure, because you have to feel safe with your couple
yes, then you close it and I closed the door for her, and then, she, you realize that you can miss her
Mmm
Bur missing and being in love with that person does not meean, that you had evaluated inside you what was what you really expected from a couple relation, of a relationship
Or from a marriage, what is you want to have in your life, I had, I
Uh huh
I guess you don't want to go after a man that's unfaithful to you, or that, or that looks for relationships in other places, or that
uh, is always teaching [telling] others, the other girls, that he is always available
Right, right
You know
Yeah
And that's what she always taught [told], that she was available, that she was
Oh, that's a shame, well, and you got involved emotionally pretty much, i mean, you didn't like her because of her looks, or because of her, but you got emotionally involved, you took her
to, to love, i mean, to have a very special love and
Yes, yes, of course. But like i was saying, you
right
first of all, you can't love a person without loving yourself, if you, if your relationship is destroying you
Uh
right?, physically, emotionally
Uh huh
uh, you have to step aside form it. Because you, uh, you have to call [love] to be able to love
Well, well, it's OK
to love yourself to be able to love
Yeah, it's ok, you're strong, because there's people that fall , right?, into a circle, that they can't get out of
oh
Like you say, if they don't love themselves, if they don't have respect, self esteem, and
Yeah
and they let themselves be manipulated in this way.  They let themselves be emotionally exploited. Yeah, and it's really sad.  But now nice, how nice that you
yes
know what you want and and for you, therefore, it's not hard to decide if someone
No, while anyway, you respect yourself, your own self and you say look, this is good for me, this isn't good for me.
Hmmm
We'll suppose that I'm a woman.  And suddenly I find myself with a man that no man wants possession of me, and wants to have, eh
to control my time, to know who calls me, of my privacy, and I have this emotional abuse, who abuses me emotionally,
or physically.  You have to respect yourself, and say, oh this isn't good for me.
Hmmm, hmmm
You know, I'm going to get away from this relationship.  Even though this person, gives you some physical benefit, emotional, financially, you know, you have to respect yourself, and say I don't need this,
let me get out of this relationship.
Wow, well I'm happy, you're great, yeah.
And and so
how great.
um, I think that we've dri-, how do you say, gone off topic a bit,
No, because the question is, Is it easy to break up, something like that, and does age influence or not.
Oh, well, the, age, related to the age, I'm thirty, and, yesterday I turned thirty eight
Oh, happy birthday.
Thank you
The little hump, in Peru we say, the hum-, we'll get the little hump down the next day
Yeah
Oh, how cool
Yeah, but I don't feel, I don't feel, how do you say, like an old man, and I don't- and I feel like younger now
You're young, son, you're still young
Ah
And then you, in you life, you told me you've had many, but in your relationships are, because I don't know, I don't understand
I don't know, look. I'm 40 years old, and in my rel- in my whole life I've had four relationships. But I've never broken up with anyone. They've broken up with me. Because I get like very
yes
I get very attached to the person
Where are you from?
Sometimes, I'm from Peru
oh, yes?
And then it's like, sometimes I tell myself, it's not good for me, I don't like him, but
Where did you say you lived?
Toronto
Toronto, Canada
yeah, yeah
Ah, then you
Ah, that's why I tell you, I don't know if, but yes, when there's a break up is very sad, even though the relationship wasn't working, I stay sad.
are
For years.
are you with someone now?
yes, the father of my kids.
yes, it's going
And also I tell you it's just been recently that we've reconciled, after being separated two years
is it going well with him now?
More or less, but there's nothing perfect I say also there's no perfection, you have to put up with the person, don't you think, but we ourselves are not perfect.
Depends. where you married to him?
No, I've never been married to him.
Okay
But I always wait for many years, and
you waited to see how it worked out?
yes, because since, my son is five years old and since six years ago, I I have never been with anybody, only with him, understand, but he, it seems he has had
Hm mm
Like I tell you, I I don't break up with the person, the people break up with me. I'm very cowardly to break up a relationship. And well, I'm glad that you have that
Well eh, eh, I tell you, is a matter of self-respect. It's a matter of, self respect and loving yourself, like that well, I love, I love myself.
Sure, sure
And I think that to be crying or to be in this or to be sad or thinking, I had better
But not me, no, I don't know, I don't know, perhaps for the man is easier to find someone. Because I've been alone understand. The relationship that I have with my kids' dad is more apart, than together.
And I've been able to find another person
yes I hear you
well
hello
yes
ah, Silvia here, how are you?
ah, very good
how nice, what a crazy topic, right? the couples, ah, I already imagine that yes
eh, yes, true
they are, it doesn't matter how old they are to you, it has by experience the same as mine well, hard to break up but I say for other couples it would be ah, easy eh
depending of the circumstances, right?
eh yes, I mean, for some people is definitely easier, for others harder
mm, but I'm talking about, ah couples well, that have been together already a long time I've seen couples that have never gotten married and they still get along well
some that have, they have been married for fifty years and separate after such a long time, and I don't understand a lot of times why, why they continue to be friends,
aha, and then they keep on seeing the kids and anyways they keep on seeing each other, I mean, the only thing that, that happens is that
yes, daily
that they don't live in the same house right but, eh, they still see each other daily
yes,
yes
but, its' a ah, a topic that I don't know much about because my, my marriage failed after twenty years, but no, I got married too young
eighteen years ago and
Uh
Yeah, after twenty years my eyes opened up a little, i didn't know anything, well
Right
i didn't, i didn't know a, i didn't, everything was secret at home, what was important to know wasn't known, i mean, that
Right
there was people that drank, there were alcoholics, there were drugs and i didn't know any of that, and when it came out with, my husband had all of that
Oh
and i was going to change him and my family didn't want to, and that argument was, i, i got mad ans said,  i will stay there to prove that yes, this man can change
right?, that he was going to change, right?
Right, and he never changed
No, no, no, i realized that much later, but more than anything i wanted to protect the kids, i had, i had two girls and i said no
i will protect my family against this
Right
so that no other man will bother me and no other man will come to take my children because i have heard that a lot, the
in my parent's conversations, that the children were abused one way or the other
i mean, the reason
uh, so i said, well i won't stay like this, so since then i haven't had any partner, I'm alone, just me, my girls grew up a lot, they're twenty six, twenty five years old and
now i do want to search for a partner, right?, that a, a man that can, at least, uh, do some of the things that you do when you're old
take vacations, go out for dinner and to, to leave that subject of the children, but it's hard to find someone that have children that aren't
adult or that aren't problematic, right?
Yes, yes, some of them are Emilio's
i have, yeah, I'm telling you, i'm forty four years old and i'm not worried, but yeah, it would
but married again, uh, i can't imagine
yes
because when you're getting old, you have your ways and your, uh, the habits are, you can't change them and if they don't fit, let's see, i don't know
Uh huh
But, mom and dad were married until my father died and it was fifty one years so, and i think they were very happy, i saw them very happy, but
According to my mom, she didn't know him
uh, yeah, they spent a while, fifty years
Yeah, and where are you from?, no, I'm sorry, it's that
yeah, uh, i'm, well, I'm Mexican
Oh, yes, me too
yeah, you don't sound like a mexican, you sound more like, i don't know
Yeah, because i hear a lot of Colombian people, a lot of, uh, Puerto Ricans live here, in Indiana, where i live and it's a suburb in Chicago
Right
and a lot of Hispanic people from all kinds of places come here, and when i talk to them i get their, uh
you get their tone
the accent, everything, right
yeah, yeah, uh, no, here
uh huh
I mean, i live in Texas, so, well, i think most of them are
Oh, a Mexican of course
They're mexican, yes, so
I was raised in Laredo, Texas, until i was seventeen years old to
in Laredo
so, our granny, uh, forced us to learn the language, but she was tough, oh my god, i was very little, my granny made an effort for us to watch it daily so we would
learn
right
to be able to read, write and speak it perfectly, according to her, because it was going to do a lot of good for us, well yeah, it turns out that i get 25 dollars more in my job
per hour because i speak the language
Because you're bilingual, yes
Oh yes
What's up, in fact it helps a lot, uh, i, with my kids, well, the oldest, my littler girl is six years old
um
but uh, she doesn't want to speak spanish, i mean
oh yes
it's very hard
Right now I'm trying
it's very hard
the same thing happens with my grand children, they don't want to, they don't think it's important, or that, i don't know, the same i though when i was little, that
it was a, bother because, who, who was I going to talk to?  Aside from my grandmother, because my mom talked with us in English and my friends also
but she, thank God that she forced us
yes yes well yes it's the, it's what happens, like, here it's more that, that I hear force my daughter to
hmm
she doesn't want to, but one time when she went to visit her grandparents over in Mexico
aha
there, and she was skating, no battling that
aha yeah
that they didn't understand her and then, I told her, there the grandparents don't speak Spanish, I said, they don't speak English
hmm
you, you have to speak
hmm this yes but no, with this topic about the couples, unfortunately I don't know anything
well
no, hmm
I know very little of, well, I say, I also have been married, like for ten years almost
ah well yes, you have to know something, no?
and this, well, this is how it all goes, like, this
hmm
well anyway, for what I've seen, like, yes there are good things and bad things
hmm, hmm
like that how he says I mean, for some people it is very easy
mm
I imagine that, from what I've seen is that, a, once you break up with the first, the second, the third, the fourth already is
is much more easy, right?
mm
I mean, it's already like changing shoes
ah that's true
practically
that I do agree with because, of many friends that I have I've seen them keep on after a, eh, they already have the experience of leaving their, have to
see a criteria they want and when, when that criteria is not satisfied, whatever it was, ah, out, they already say
that they can't anymore
yes and I think that once, once they realize that the person let's say it's independent
mm
is when it's made easier
that's true, because
mm
I've seen my friends that suffer, with the same and, since I didn't let go of my husband for nothing, and every time that he would tell me
well let's try again, and I never said no
mm
it was always yes but, I think it has to do a lot with religion, because if one is devoted and since God always teaches that one should
Specially if you're catholic, any religion says you must do an effort, well, so the family that does an effort should stay together, but
but it can also harm the kids, because i mean, now they want to name the, the decease that kids have
they want to call it a decease, that they are children from a divorced family
Right
on the screen, uh, the TV
Yeah
i only saw pieces, there was a lady saying that yes, she was affected pretty bad because every time she thinks about marrying she can't
she can't, uh, do it, just because she has
that's true
she's very afraid that the same will happen to her, and she wants to have children but at the same time she doesn't want to have them outside the marriage, well, there's a
number of problems that she has done herself, but she's suffered because her dad left her mom twice and he left them
in very bad shape financially
yes
but when she wanted to do a, her, well, her dad's, communicate to him later on, it wasn't the same, so, she felt distant, but that's an example of many that
well, if the person is strong, she can overcome it, and maybe with help from a psychiatrist or maybe a group or, maybe the very person itself can do, uh
and overcome that problem, right?, because, incidentally, a  lot of things happen to a lot of children and they can
yes
uh, move on
Right, yes, well, and even though, well, many times, well they blame the
uh, the parents, well, yes
to, to the parents, yes, I mean
all the parents, are to blame for everything
yes I mean, I mean be it good, be it bad, well, easier the bad
aha
that's what always happens, that they blame the parents and well since the parents got divorces well
that's true mm
is that's why is that you already
a crutch
aha that's why we are, we are
mm
how we are, because the parents have, have divorced
is true but, mm, ah, a lot of combinations for having ten years because although I, I stayed married twenty years we were not ah, together, it was a constant separation because
ah I, I couldn't put up with it I would say look, if you are going to drink here leave already
aha
if you are going to take, like that, of friends and
ah
behave like that leave already
yes
then, he was out of the marriage more than what he was in.
more than
I'm only married on paper
uh huh
and, well
no well, at least I, I that's why I've always said I mean, no
mm hmm
uh, when I got married he was what, twenty seven years old? So well I said
oh, yea
I mean I'd already done all I wanted to do, I mean I already knew
more yea,
I'd already, I'd already se- seen and done a lot
yea
uh, a- before before it went bad,
mm hmm it's more my ma- my husband, my ex-husband always deals with me, he always says he wants to be friends, he always wants to get along well with me, he says, you're the only family I have, I said
ah, but I don't understand anything about being friends, no, but if he wants us to be able to talk in a civil way, well I can understand that
uh huh
but when he needs help I'm the one he asks, and I told him, and the friends you've had all your life? Where are they?
friends when times were good, they were
yea, no, yea it doesn't stop but that's how life turns out, so
yea
uh, you learn but I wouldn't recommend to anyone that they get married young because you're still getting to know yourself and you realize
Hello?
Hello?
Who's speaking?
How are you? My name is Adrian.
How are you? My name is Mara Ines. Eh, I'm in Philadelphia.
In Toronto, Canada. And you, what part of Buenos Aires?
Ah. No, from Mar del Plata.
Ah, almost, almost
You, from the city of Buenos Aires, no? yes?
yes.
Ah full yes, well. What do we do? Do we talk about today's topic? The boyfriends and girlfriends.  The courtships
Eh, I don't know. I'm  a little off the market, eh
yes, in reality me too. But well.
Is that
Except for the memories, I can't give an opinion, I can't give an opinion of how it is nowadays or anything, so and if not, tell me about Canada. How is it? Very cold?
Eh, it is, in reality, it is like too hot. It must be like in zero Celsius at this moment and all the snow we had melted.
Eh?
The little snow there was and, and for this time, in Toronto is like I don't know, but five or six degrees above normal.
Look.
It should be colder than
Also here last year at this time the weather was getting very cold as well as in Canada.
the cold is tremendous
yes the cold is tremendous about seven degrees Celsius below zero
still not cold, it is fine
it's cold, snow ice.
when it is ten degrees is too cold.
It was too cold.
yes the nose
Si. It was too cold to those who have you been there before.
For four years, this will be my fifth winter
Compared to Buenos Aires you must be better prepared me for the cold.
yes there is no point of comparison
At least we have wind, when I came here I wanted to kill myself it was so cold.
I had to buy new clothes
The street suerter of John B
Neither the knit caps ran Grandma's worked it was so cold
Is there a street call Juan B. Justo in Mar de plata?
Juan B. Justo
Where are the factories of sweaters?
it is not good because they are terrible and ugly.
but.
but the people go. It is like a tradition for tourists to go there.
my grandfather actually lived many years in silver sea.( Mar de plata)
Look.
h no, the image of my old woman and my other grandmother taking me
goos price
to buy sweaters putting me on the street horrifying Juan B. just
Yes, a few years ago was better, but these last ten years anything, everything is made in China.
here are some who do not. there are some that are very good, but, well few. They are also in the center, no need for Juan B.Where  are you?
Yes, is it work?
Why? I wanted to leave Buenos Aires, I wanted to go to Australia
Um.
Finish living a sort of holiday visiting friends here in toronto
Look
Um, Everything went bad.
I would never come back. Did you stay?
No, I did not stay but the trip was to take a desition
OK
to stay or not to stay.
Yes, Of course.
not bad in Buenos Aires not anything like that.
In Buenos Aires
the first two years in Buenos Aires was better than  here.
of course, yes, I have several acquaintances in Canada I do not even remember the cities, My brother is an engineer agronomist.
Some of my classmates went to Canada
there are many Argentines here, where else is in montreal.
I think it's Montreal.
In Montreal
one of my friends married a girl from there and took her to Argentina.
they could not stand the cold.
in Montreal is much colder than here.
okay
there are places much worse.
Ottawa, I almost go to Ottawa in a moment.
Ottawa is a very beautiful city
yes
yes there are many cities like that in Canada.
I looked up in the internet when I went to Ottawa.
okay
the pictures of the city were very beautiful.
What Ottawa has is a small town, about 300 000 people
Oh, look that
No matter if it is the capital, the capital, federal capital of
Weird, right?, in Canada
From Canada, but the way the government works here is really different from the Argentinian Government, with the Independence of the regions, it's big
Oh
And Ottawa is half from, half in Ontario which is the State where Toronto is and Half in Montreal, which is the region where Quebec is
Oh
The Quebec state, which is half way both cities
And, in purpuse, maybe
No, not exactly, is not causality that it is right there, but it's a city where I was sometimes for work, is really nice, has a, it's a rural city, if you like
Oh, the
It would be like Mar del Plata, Mar del Plata must be bigger than Ottawa
Yes, it's true, it has 600 000 people, the double
That's why, that's why I said
Sure
The concept of a capital for Argentinians should be huge
Sure, and well, you look for photos on the internet, and I went there at the moment they offered me the job that I already accept it and well
And I came here, kid of sad because I found nicer Canada than the United Sates, but I had already said yes her and I needed to change, but
I really liked, but It seemed huge when I look the photos
. No, the downtown in Ottawa is five blocks by five blocks, eh I think so
Sure, it's small
There is the Parliament which is very beautiful, eh, the Rideu Canal, which freezes, at this moment it must be frozen and, ah, it's, how you call it? it's
the slogan of, eh ,ah, the largest ice skating rink in the world
Figure, natural yes
You, you can skate to your office, eh
If you want to. Some people do it, for sure
No, no, yes, It's like this, that's it. If you ever think of going to Montreal you must speak both English and french
Oh oh
It is the bilingual city par excellence
Oh, look. It would have been a disaster. My English is fine, but french, hardly three words. Oh yes
Eh, besides, I am not sure whether it's french or just something similar
And the, eh, is very divided, right? Really, the relationship between french speakers and English speakers is very bad, right?
There is a traditional, uh, resentment, I don't know. No, no, actually I don't know what the hell do the people from Quebec complain about, but
mm, they are always with the independence claim. That
Oh, yes, I haerd about that. I heard something about that they will do elections to see if they can become independent
eh, there was, there was a referendum, there were two referendum
yes they want to become independent
the last one was ten years ago. Not long ago was the tenth anniversary of it. And, mm, actually I don't know what they think, I don't know why they do it, I mean, what is it that they want
Sure
Like that, like, like outsider that I am I'm very interested in the topic em, more than anything because the Quebec are Latins and
yes.
And, and they are more similar to us. They scream and drink wine and they fight and good luck
Look. And the others don't. The ones from Montreal are more tranquil like the Americans, able.
No, no, No, no. Those are the ones from Montreal, those are the Quebec
Ah, no, ah, I'm dizzy, ah.
Eh, the ones from here are, supposedly they have a, a British background
Sure.
of austerity, and loyalty and the, development but
Look at that.
Mm. I don't know what. In, in, in Ottawa what you have is the, the Ottawa employer is the federal government, eighty percent of the jobs
are for the federal government and the, the requirement is the
Sure.
eh, bilingual. But, like, like that, as well.
Both yes, look at that. Look at that, look at that. How incredible.
In, in, this side, from, from the Ontario side is English
yes
eh, if you speak both languages you can find work just for that, if you want.
Ah, look.
And, but, but, English is predominant and, the opposite if you go to Montreal.
Sure, and, let's say, in those places, if you speak one of them you are alright, I mean, you can get a job, everything
In a way, yes, you will survive
Sure, and do you speak French as well?
No, I understand some words. No, no, I can't have a conversation in French
Oh. In French. But then understanding it is not that difficult
Oh
yes, uh, I don't know what accent they have there. I mean in France, I listened to the people and understood what they were talking about, don't ask me to repeat the conversation, but more or less I knew what they were talking about, I don't know. It hase many words thet you
mmm. I don't know. It is quite affected
Not there. They don't have any accent
I don't know if it is because of the accent, but it is complicated, it's , it's like Spanish, with the A and E nad
Sure, no. Speaking it is very difficult
Eh, and verb conjugations, and the accents
yes, speaking is very difficult, already. I tries to study at a time, then I quitted, but
I'm Alfredo and I'm talking to you from New York
hello I'm Marcela in North Carolina
hi Marcela
How's it going?
well pretty well, here in
how can you hear in the city
yea I can hear the sirens
in New York
it's pretty normal for here so like dating
dating couples, well I've been married now for a long time
ha, but but that must not be very fun then
so no, I don't have a good record of dating
and, and no yea like it's an exclusive relationship so
yea, yes yes yes, yea
mm yea, he
we've been together for thirty years
you've been together for thirty for years?
yea, thirty years
wow, so internet dating didn't exist for you two
no it wasn't around, no, no, no, no it wasn't around, no even the DC were around
the what?
the -CD's
ah sure, no
and the personal computers didn't exist, nothing existed
yes listen, and where are you from originally?
I'm Argentinian and you?
I'm Chilean
mm, we're neighbors
look
you've been here long
eh well I've never lived in Chile,  I left during the coup
mm
eh and lived in Europe, Mexico, in Honduras
ah
and, I've been here in New York like ten years
um, so you were, born in Chile but
no, I was born in the United States but went to live to Chile
your parents are Chileans
my parents are Chileans
mm
they were studying there, and so I went to live in Chile, my dad worked with agrarian reform, with Allende's government
hmm yeah and after what happened happened
and obviously we had to, yes, but, well here, now I'm in New York I'm looking for work, I just moved here because I finished school there in Wisconsin and I returned about three months ago
um
so
so you're not married
yes, in reality I'm married
ah
but, no, I separated from my wife about three years ago
hmm
and and we're still married because I'm waiting for them to give her the papers
hmm, sure
to be American, I'm giving her residence and this is why we have to separate it seems
yes, yes, this takes time
yes, um
yes no, I met my husband at school, at university
wow, in what university
and, eh well, it's a theater academy but during the uears he was a graduate, in Los Angeles
hmm
and after these ten years we got married but to celebrate the ten year anniversary
sure
so in total they're thirty years
okay, I already understand
legally they're twenty
they're twenty but look I was with my wife, I was six years
um ha
from there I got married and it lasted two years only and now it's been three years since that happened, look I believe that
look at that
the important thing is the relationship, not the paper
yes no that's true, that's true, now that of meeting people on the internet
yes
it could be that it has to do with the different generations but to me that seems like something very strange
Why so strange?
I don't know, it seems strange perhaps because I'm a very visual person
yes
you understand me, I mean I can't imagine eh, how it would be to meet a person and form a friendship with someone even develop some sort of affection, but it's an affection based on what? based on, on letters only
well no, and you are not limited to that because that's one way, but there are places where one puts pictures, and looks for specific people, you put there
a sort of, of what I like, what are
oh no, yes of course, that's a kind of dating
and that, and that is a big part of dating that they are doing now on line and they ask you many things about personality to search for compatibility, that's what they say they add
yes, yes, look you know what I would like to do but just to have fun only of course just like to act crazy, but what I would like try
mm
just to see how it is, is that of speed dating
yes sure
where people go to like a restaurant or something and then you sit with someone for I don't know two minutes, three minutes, I don't know a very short time
five minutes, five minutes, yes yes
and then they ring a bell or something, I don't know, and then you move to the other table and talk with the other person
yes I think that's interesting, because you know looking in their eyes, and being there, talking a little seeing if there's a connection or not
yes, yes
I, I understand what you are saying through the computer like no
I think that would be fascinating to do that only as a form of experiment, to see how
safe
what?
what happens is that you have to be careful, be careful that there are some that when one decides it's supposed to be a complete date there are some that are like that, there are some
to
I mean that no, is not like at the hour you are going to tell him well I'm going home already or whatever like you have five or ten minutes to say yes yes or no
but that you decide like you are not committed to do things
yes
necessarily specific, but to eat, you have dinner and all
sure
so
yes
yes, it could be interesting, I
but is that they are interesting things, but is strange, I don't know, because we have so many people and so many communication mediums and however, it's obvious that the majority of people feel alone
yes, is true and, and is hard sometimes finding, you're lucky that you haven't had that problem sometimes I, for example after being eight years with my wife
um ha
after that I had to start with, dates again and that was like strange, one already eight years that hasn't play the game let's say is
yes,yes
different then yes, it's been interesting, I I always, at least I've seen on the internet many of those sites, I'm not participating in any but I've seen them
um ah
inclusive there are casual encounters, that one can see, that are very fun to read on craigs list
mm, mm no
I don't know if you've seen them very entertaining the one yesterday was about a couple, she's five months pregnant they were looking for one or two participants, to
make love in front of those other people
oh yes, no, that's an old story
not necessarily with contact and I said, someone has to answer also, is that imagine a pregnant woman seeing her having sex with her type, I mean
oh God, what a thing
perhaps, you have to see the New York, if you are going to do it, it's very entertaining you go to craigslist dot com New York and casual encounters read them that they are very good
let's see, I'm going to go because is that I like to read funny things like that
it's called casual encounter in English
but, yes, really, I don;t know, we have two children, one is 23 yo and the other one 17 yo
So, and they use the internet
No, no, they make like the old times, meeting people in the school, or
yes
where they live maybe, I don't know, I think that the majority, well, maybe I;m wrong, but I think that the majority of people
first they try to meet someone trough friends, trough where they work, school, church
Oh, I see, and when they can't
And when they are desperate, they sign up
it's a good theory, but I don't agree, I think that the younger people now realizes that internet is considered distinct, I think, the tool
that can look for compatibility, without having to go out, to bars, in New York, for example, where you met people is in bars
yes
well, if it's in work, or with a friend, but it might be a really close circle, many people here, does not make that many social activity in the week, at least there is not much time, people is short in time
so, people must met in a gym, or a bar
yes, that's true
it's like, finding a needle in a haystack
yes, yes
and when you can, well, I'm someone that likes the cinema, so, you make a quick online search
and you get the pictures of, maybe, 15 candidates
sure
they send a little mail saying, and suddenly the same on their side, their instinct works and I think it might be, if someone is desperate, or nor
Look, it's logical, the truth is
it doesn't have much to do with what can be your partner or not, you know?, because it doesn't
Yeah, right?, you save time from all those dudes and girls that you're wasting time on
i can tell something that i, no, what i can say from the start is that i have seen a lot of pictures in those websites
Um, right
And people, it's not necessary like those people of more desperate appearance
Um
There's people that's very, very pretty, gorgeous, in those websites, so it doesn't add up, i can't believe they have no other way of doing it, i think that, it can also be fun like that
maybe it's the new, it's the new wave
I think it's the new wave, interesting, a little bit of adrenaline
Yes
a little exhibitionism sometimes, uh, when... it depends on the pictures they put, and maybe, i don't know
Yeah, the thing is that when you meet with this person and that the picture and the person match
and it's very different, that photo is from fifteen years ago
Because you imagine, it turns out you're meeting one of these girls like that, completely hot and you open the door and it's a parrot, that would be horrible
it must be, right?
but, what are you gonna do about it, right?
No, i think it's something...
Uh, and another thing, how do you know that these people...?, sure, that the person there, live, it could also be lying to you, no, but you think how do you know that what they're putting there is what they like, what they are, what they do?, it's true
well, you find out, i think that if you get there and the person is very different than the picture, you have a problem of trust on that person from the start, besides you may not like it
yes, um ha
but after this, I mean, I think that if you lie, as you get to know the person one realizes it and
um ha yes
yes, I think that
me thank God that I don't have to worry about that
you don't have, don't have to worry about that I think that I'm already getting there, well, no, not yet, I'm thirty three years old
ah, young
some day I will be one of those desperate ones that puts, that puts the thing on the internet
no, I'm fifty years old, so I'm on the other side of the wall already
um ha
and that would be very easy, imagine that I don't know what at this age one separates or becomes widowed or and who knows and, and one finds himself alone and
Hello
Hello, how are you?
Very well, what's your name?
George George
George? I'm Diana from New York
from New York
Diana from Philadelphia, but I'm calling from San Francisco
aha, like, like in the
because I came here for the holly days because my brother lives here
in San Francisco?
yes in California
but you live, where?
in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
oh, Philadelphia, what's your name?
Diana
Diana, how are you Diana, where are you from?
Paraguay
oh well, pleased to meet you, Colombian
oh my pleasure
so and what do you think about the subject?
the topic was the courtship
the courtships
yes
and how have you been?
are you married or?
yes I've been married
yes
yes of course, and you?
What? no, no I have a boyfriend, since a year ago
ah well, then you know sick of the topic
a little, a little, I don't know, I don't know much about the courtship through the internet
because it's fresh no, no, you haven't had, nor have you met anyone that has boyfriend by the internet
no, not many I do remember when I was, now I'm twenty six years old, but when I was like fifteen years old, eh I was
yes
there was a, a guy that lived in Spain
yes
that we talked a lot by chat, and every day, but it wasn't a courtship, it was someone with whom I talked to a lot basically
yes, a friendship
exactly, but
but not, not a courtship
What?, what other question did they ask about relationships?
I don't know, i don't remember what, the initial question was about relationships, the last one was about the internet, but i don't know about the beginning
Beginning
What were the questions
i don't, i don't know either, i'm, i'm, i think I'm happy with this relationship, but i came here to California to visit my brother who's ten years older
oh, well, yeah
He's thirty six
Yes
And he doesn't have a girlfriend
Yes
He broke up with his girlfriend like six months ago
yes
And so he's living the life of a, how do you say it?, a bachelor
a bachelor
Very much like a bachelor, i mean i don't, i don't know much, i don't like it very much that he's like that
Why not?
No, because he goes to the bar, he meets a girl one night and then it's over
it's over
And there's nothing there, it's over, he met someone like that, last night he met someone and he mentioned something, i didn't go with him
Yes
but he mentioned to me that he new someone and he laughed, so, he didn't tell me many details
yes
but basically in the environment of the bar is like, eh, I don't know, it seems like you can really get into the life of the game, more or less
not take the relationship between a man and a woman seriously
yes, and what do you think is the best way, because a dance is a good start
yes?
well I think so, what happens, well someone take like a rumba, and well, that night you decide who you want to dance with and, bye bye, the next day it's forgotten, no?
yes, aha
but, at least in my case, I meet someone dancing and I'm interested, I try to keep it going to eh, turn into something more, no?
but it's a good
how did you meet your, your woman?
what did you say?
how, how did you meet your wife?
well, I've had three up until now, yes
three wives, yes, that's good
and I'm booking, because I'm in the process of another, another separation now, the first was, the first was from school
ah yeah  yeah, a young love
um so, yes
in secondary, high school
yes, exactly, and, second
how nice, how nice, this is a dream, I have a boyfriend, I had a boyfriend
yes
who was my first love and
hmm
and I don't know, he was really young, I was really young
yes
and things didn't work, but until now I think that it would be nice for things to work one day
of course yes
by chance or something like that, to come back to this first love
yes, there are people who, I know cases of people who after they've been married, they've separated and met their first love again
yes
yes, and there have been these kinds of cases when one takes its course and finally comes back in a few years
aha
like if the things work, but good, the second I don't know, I don't remember if it was a ca- a sister of a friend where I worked
went out with m-
hm, yeah through a friend
yes, we played a lot on the weekends and the third was, after a breakup in a trip to another city, and working in the company I met someone
on a trip

ah yes you called and
San Francisco, yes I called

yes, yes, yes, yes, I called eh that when one is traveling you have another perspective of the world and sometimes, yes
oh traveling is very, very good
you think?
sure, at a cultural level, at an experience level, is very good
eh
yes you liked it. is the first time that you travel there or
no, no, no I travel a lot, a lot, sometimes I think that I travel too much, I tend
yes
that I tend to like to get out of my routine environment, and totally leave to another country or
yes and, for vacation or for work?

yes
so is kind of, the hours are not as rigid
um okay and you've gone to New York

ah yes um
I'm always traveling
sure, no my family lives here yes
and who else of the boyfriends or courtships

but at this age I eh, of the courtships
yes
I'm very conservative
Why?
in the sense in comparison with my brother that I was saying that he is always partying in parties
yes
I'm more the
you're more stable
very stable, very stable, I don't know if it's because of the age or something like that, but
yes, and when is the most?, what's the longest it's lasted?
courtship
with the same person,yes
ah, you know that honestly, a year is like my limit after, I had a boyfriend for like three years, I had a girlfriend like for three years but after the first year
yes, it's like already
we would break up, go back, it lasted like three years the
the courtship
the turbulence, for two years we were more less between this and this, and it wasn't stable
yes yes,
but it seemed to me that after a year, now I'm about to celebrate a year with, with
like, that you're getting to the limit,
to the limit, seriously, this is why I
seriously
yes
it's the limit, the limit, um
it's the limit is six years six years is quite a lot, married
yes six years, yes but not in a formal relationship
do you have kids?
yes, sure, but at six years, I'm not, I threw in the towel
aha yes, I, I travel, I go to another country
yes yes yes at six years
I travel more, I meet more people, but no, no, I love Ivan a lot, his name's Ivan
yes sure, well no, he seems like an interesting person
Hello?
Hello, good evening, my name is Carolina.
Good evening, my name is Marcela. I live in Carolina, North Carolina
Eh, you don't say. I live in New York.
Where are you from? Hello?
From Peru.
Ah, I'm Argentinian.
Look, how nice. From Buenos Aires?
Eh, yes.
Ah, how
But I've been living in the United States since I was nine.
Ah, and very from Buenos Aires.
So I'm more American than Argentinian, perhaps but the accent has never gone away
Yes, sure, yes, eh, My daughter worked with Argentinians and she has all of their accents.
Ah, yes, my son, both my sons are bilingual. And my oldest son, he was in New York because he went to -N-Y-U
And he worked in a restaurant, La Palapa
Um. Yes.
and, there everybody that worked in the kitchen was was from Mexico and then, for a while ah, he spoke Spanish with the little accent
Mexican, it was very amusing
But always the accent, it seems unreal, right?
yes, yes.  Yes, this also happened to me, if I go with someone from this site or the other site and, I talk with them for a little bit, after a while it sticks.
Are there many, ah, Latinos there?
Well, when we came in eighty seven no, but now yes, now there are many many, it's surprising
And where, and from what place?
And the majority are from Mexico
Oh, yeah, yeah.
yes.  The, the same story everywhere,
How nice.  Aha yeah, go-
Yes.
the topic
Well, we have to talk about dates and courtships, I don't know if I can have an opinion because I've been married for thirty years
Yeah, aha, ah, what
Ah, so no
Oh, sure, so you don't know, but you always hear, no?
Yes, yes
For example, he, I'm not partial to internet dating, because I have the idea of how the people I talk to
they say that, eh
Yes.
oh the internet, justifiably, through Fisher, I've meet people from various different places.
Hmm.
And they themselves have told me that when they go into their transformation, you can go into what you want, but it's really something else. Uh, a boy from Arizona told me that
he told me that, at least i know better, and he says, that the problem is they're liars and he tell me that when they say they are blonde or
you go and see it's a tall, small, skinny, fat blonde that work, but he says that all he has gotten so far
isn't worth it and after that i met another Dominican that also told me there was, through the internet, he told me you can get a lot of women
Because they want to date you and all that. But they're all, he tells me that they all tell lies, just, uh
Well, look, uh, i thought about that, and i just asked, uh, my son, uh, my oldest son, that is here for the party, i asked him, you
would you do, you, uh, would you go in one of those companies to find someone over the internet?, he told me no, never ever, and, uh because i
curious as i ame, the only thing that intrigues me, but that, and i would like to do it only for curiosity, right?, not to, not to go out
with anybody behind my husband's back, but just out of curiosity, that thing they do where people goes and
sits in a table with someone else?, for two or three or seven minutes, a, a very short time and then they ring a bell and you, you move to another table
And you talk to someone else for a very short period and then based on those, uh, short conversations
Yeah
uh, you write in a paper if you're interested, who are you interested in, and if the other person is also interested, then the company or
the group that, that, handles that, uh, connects you
Uh huh
But it's curious to me that in such a short time
Right?, you can
people can, and maybe yes, right?, maybe yes because it's on a more instinctive level, uh, and not so intellectualized, you see?, that
I look sometimes, right, because i say, i have a niece that told me, no, aunt, i meet them on the internet, i dated a guy
And i told her, uh, how can you do that?, it could be a sick person, a maniac or a
Oh, yes, you don't know who you find, because people can tell you anything
Yes, and well, sometimes i see it, yeah, a bit difficult, but after relationships... later on i think that long relationships also aren't, uh, without the internet, the ones that are long also
It's never anything... just yesterday i was talking to a lady that told me she was in a relationship for ten years and she broke up with her boyfriend because he came to the United States
she was also coming to the United States and she was with another one for ten years, and here she met one and married after ten months
And now she's been married for five years and she's happy, and i
Oh, look at that
and she was in a relationship for ten years with each one of them
Um
Unbelievable, right?, i mean, that life is like that, you never know
You never know, yeah, and no, uh, you always hear about people that lived together for a long time and later on they get married and they
and they don't, they don't last, it doesn't last
Exactly, yes
Something happens, and, me and my husband, we're the exception, i have heard a lot of people like that. We had been living together for ten years to, and to celebrate our tenth anniversary, we got married
Oh, look that's very nice
And, so, it's been twenty years from that, so we're at thirty years total
Uh
We don't count since it was legal, we count from the beginning
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
But, we're the exception
Yeah, of course, yes
of what, for what i have seen, right?, about people that have lived together for a long time, and then they get married and bam, everything falls apart
i, with someone, uh, i and other very conservative friends, and so i got married
Uh huh
marriage didn't work out and i didn't last five years married, but i had two children, but no, i have never married again
But incidentally, i got back to Peru and i found the boyfriend i had when i was young
Oh, look at that
He told me he had gotten married, and that he wasn't happy, he was separated, that he was about to get divorced, and he told me "i realize now it's because i always loved you"
Oh
And, uh
So romantic
It was like i was in, in a fairy tale, right?, but usually, he had a position as a military, he was very well established there but i had my life here
And i couldn't leave my children, that they practically were born here, and so, going there is
Sure, it's very complicated
Sure, right?, and life
It's different when you have children, because children come first
Also, and so i told him, he proposed to me, right?, to marry and rebuild our lives and everything, and i told him no, i couldn't, that my children were first
That i would never leave my children, so he told me "look, i take my hat of to you because not many women put their children ahead", and really
i dedicated myself to my two children completely and i live for them, well, i lived for them both, but my son just passed away, uh, six months ago, and I'm completely torn apart
but i dedicated my self to both of them, i have been, well mother and father to both of them, even though i never stop seeing them, right?
Uh huh
Mm, he wasn't a good husband but he was a good father and then
Mm.
eh, and like that,
I understand because I also have two kids and I eh, he works, my husband works, right? And, but the one who pushes, who knits, who drives, who
the one who does everything is me and thank God that they are both doing well. The oldest, he graduated from -N-Y-U he did it in three years.
Eh, he is, is, a modern dance dancer
Tremendous
and dances for a very famous group in that profession, that is called Pilobus
Aha.
and, he travels all over the world. And, that is
Oh.
that's too much for an artist because I'm also an actress and I direct and my husband is a musician, so as a family of artist, we know that
Oh
is hard making money and to live from what you do.
Mm.
You always need to have another job. And now the youngest is a guitar player, he plays
Okay.
plays classical guitar, jazz, well, everything, and he's going to go the university that's what I wanted, they can be artists if they want, but they have to go to the university
that's the only thing but
Tell me, mm
yes, it should be like that. And honestly yes eh, I hope and pray that they find good girls, right? When the moment comes.
Yes.
But
Yes, both of them are boys
Yes, they are both boys,
I had a, a boy and a girl.
Ah. Good, you always have the girl, because the boys always leave
Mm.
eh belong to the girl right? the boys belong to the mother more than the father. The girls belong to the father, but then when they grow up and get married, the boys go
with, to their wife's house
Ah, of the women yes.
You understand? However the girls bring their husband and their family to, to their house.
Sure.
And then, there there I lost a little
Well
but yes, I don't know what
I have six brothers and they all pull for their wives, none for the mother and when they were little, well sure, they were close to my mom
but married, everything for their wife.
Yes.
Everything for the wife, sure, is incredible.
Yes, that's how it is, so I try to cook special things, when they come to the parties things that like that they always say ah, that mom I want to go to mom's house so that
she can cook this or that. I have to have something to
Sure.
drag them to my house, but although they are are quite homebodies, but let's see what happens in the, in the future, they are still young.
Mm. Ah, sure, yes.
Yes, but well. I don't know, this of, of the internet and the dates, I never thought, being a person of my generation, I'm fifty years old, so, I lived in
in the seventies, when everything was accepted and I done, this
Hello?
Hello? yes, my name is Eliana, who is it?
Hello Eliana, this is Manuel. I am in Orlando, Florida, where are you?
Oh. Right now I am in Miami, Florida, but I am living in Boston
Oh, yes, and how are you?
Fine
Well, getting into matter, I listen, you start, what do you think about it?
Look, I really don't know, I don't know what are the regulation, eh mm, about women or anything like that. I arrived here in the United States only eleven months ago
And no, actually I didn't ask
yes. Eh, but no, no, haven't you heard antything? some friend talking about it?
No, act- no , no. I have no problem working here, I don't feel any discrimination. I don't feel any difference between men and women. Or anything like that, what do you think?
Well, I've been here longer. I have been here already eight years and the truth is that I think that in this country you really have some rights granted, unlike many others
Obviously
Oh, that's right, yes.
There are a lot of regulations for that purpose, I know it because I have seen it, let's say, in the media, or one
single complaint from a woman calling the police and they go immediately
yes
That's how it is. And there are many orders of separation after those calls, many, many of the orders come after
What? No, sorry
Eh, I think so. But, about emotional abuse, well, I don't agree there, and I think it is in both directions
although men have traditionally been allowed to do this, man has traditionally employed more of the force to abuse his partner, the woman in turn has
ah, ah emotionally abused, and verbally abused, that is very typical. So then when, when there are situations of emotional abuse, it seems that it isn't men or women, in general
I don't know what you think in that regard.
yes, it could be, but, but are there laws against emotional abuse towards women?
Eh, no, but here in the, intro-, in the introduction they spoke about this. Of the, that, the opinion of emotional abuse. That if you believe that women are sufficiently protected in this regard
But I don't know if there are, if there are specific laws that protect, or signal this, but if there aren't any, and if you believe them, it seems to me that you can't say just
men emotionally abusing women, it also happens in reverse
yes, it seems like that to me as well, that this is very exaggerated like to have it as law, or, or something like that. It seems to me that already, I don't know
if they can talk about abuse or not, right? it depends on the individual and couples. And there are even couples who like to be abused
the
to be verbally abused.
Oh, yes. The, the human psychology, humans, you know are complex. It is complex to the point that in many cultures, well, the matter of abuse is eh
things a man does against a woman they see like a symbol of manhood, no?
yes, exactly that very thing
And if, and if it's missing, then it puts in doubt like, something about the man's manhood. It's a very complex thing, but, but
the eh, the emo-
yes, at what would be the limit of, of whether this is abuse or, or is not abuse. It seems to me that this is when
here in this country it seems to me that it is barbaric that all of the laws regarding abuse and everything that you say, that it's true that a woman can call and right away there is
a policeman taking care of it and all of that, but on the other hand, you can go to the other extreme, right? It seems to me in some cases
yes, yes, yes, and suddenly if you have the opportunity to speak about it here with people, many men give you, they give, many are very afraid
Act in front of, lets say, uh, conflicting situations with your partner about it, because in the case of a call from the woman, it will always be the man's fault, and no matter how much he says it was something
mutual
yes
lets say, struggling or something like that, against, against the strongest... now look, there's another, there's another law that has been created and i think it's very good, yeah
it's that, uh, that happened against the immigrants, so, you know it's very common, well, for people to get hooked up here, get married
and specially with the, with getting the, uh, the regulation in mind, the papers, so there were, there were frequent cases of abuse
physical, emotional, blackmail from the partner against that immigrant, so, of course she was terrified to talk because she knew she would be deported
Of course
And the o-, the other partner would, uh, it abused her more by making her believe that, right?, well, there's a law that protects them, and
and the more police calls, lets say, if there's more, after that she can make the decision of separating and continue the legalization process on her own, without that partner
Oh
That law exists and it is, i think, yes, i think that's a very good one
Sure, yes, yes, yes. Yes, i think that here, as a women, i, i feel more protected. But yeah, i feel, i feel more protected regarding any of those problems, that's very good
But sometimes i feel that, uh, in this country, the regulations are going to the other side, and well, you never know, the thing is you never know where the limit is, it's like in
maybe in Latin American, there are none of those laws in our countries, and, and so there are much more people that hit and abuse their women
Yes
and here they go to the other side, in which you can't act, you can't say or do what you feel from fear of
going to jail, right?
Exactly, exactly, and, and, well, another, another very important factor is the children, when there are, and it's that, uh, those women always abused behind that
that costume, lets say, the one of, of the abuse well, from fear of losing their children or that something will happen to them, or well, them being taken away
I mean, that's also common here
Sure, also
When, when homes are very controversial the system, the state, decides to take them away
yes, it's true, isn't it? You loose for, sometimes you. It's true, it's very difficult, everything is very difficult
It is complicated, already
But
Its is complicated
yes
Eh, but I also think that, as is usually said, behind every abuser is a woman who lets him abuse her, right?
yes, also
That's, that's right. Once I saw in a X movie, a woman approaches and complains, ans she says, in brief,
I mean the person, I think it was a therapist. Eh, anyaway, look I've been fifteen years in a bad, into a relation where I was
eh, I have been abused for fifteen years, and I answer 'so? what is the problem? right? what is the problem?' I have been abused for fifteen years, 'yes, and, what is the problem?'
You'd better say that you have been fifteen years allowing him to abuse you
Sure
This is what often, they don't realize. Because at the very first hit, at the very first abuse you have to act, immediately. You can't allow that
Sure, just like that. The problem is that
So they often denounce that they have been abused for five years. Please!
yes, yes. But it is also true, that abuses do happen much more in Latin countries than, than, well I don't know, than in the other countries, right? because in, in
yes
the Arabic countries to say so
Oh, no way, no way
directly of course
It is cultural and terrible
It is still
and laws
It is completely accepted
yes, and laws, eh, that support men completely. Look, the movies that have made about the subject don't lie
Sure
about, about women who have married to, to men from these countries and suddenly decide to take the children and take them to their countries
And there is nothing the woman can do because that was the decision of the man, of the father
Absolutely, the true is that this is the reason, right? sometimes we are here arguing and so, about laws about this and that, but there  are countries that are
terribly much behind, rght?
Well I, no eh, it's incredible because of the way you have to dress. Not all of them. In many it is, because under many regime they can't even show their face
yes, that's incredible. And they can't vote, can they?
That is a full constraint, they can't talk to nobody in the street and even less to a stranger
Sure, and if they want to talk they may be kll- their husband can kill them
Just figure, it's like in industry, I used to live in New York. In New York at a time I was taking English lessons at a college
and when I got out, you know, about nine o'clock in the night you are starving and tired. Everybody was running to the lift. because it was in a fifth floor
and, well, we were going down in the lift, you know, all squashed because there were many of us and there was this girl, a Muslim girl and
Sure
always went do-, used the stairs. And you know why he did it?
Because ma-
And also, and it was a girl, a young and quite beautiful girl, she wore the attire. She only showed the hands and the face
all the rest in a black tunic and the hair covered. Because she couldn't be brushed by any man, and inside an elevator you can't help brushing each other, right?
Oh, yes, sure, so
figure, to the point that she couldn't use the elevator. Unless, she, she was alone, right? Alone in an empty elevator
yes, that's absolutely crazy, it's something that we, right? we just can't understand that kind of cultures, right? How
can they think this way?
And, and the most funny is that she told a friend, a friend of mine, yes, she told my friend she was happy like that
I mean, it is a barbarous question, but they are, they are grown up and educated for that
Sure, yes, right. How funny, right? and where are you from?
From Colombia
Oh, I see
You are Argentinean, aren't you?
yes
Oh, well, yes
With this imperative way of talking, right? and using the 'vos'?
No but, you know, the region where, where I come from we do use the 'vos'
Oh, really? I see
And well, in general, you try to speak as everyone else, but if we all use " vos"
Sure
"Vos"  and "usted", right
Sure, and it's hard for me to use that on the phone and they are trying to study the Hispanic language
And now that we are here, I speak, in my way, right?
yes, but really nice, You are all always conserving that and I think it's unique, it's really valid
yes, there is people noticing that
Well because, it's fair that inside those linguistic variations is where the beauty of our language is
Excuse me, what did you said?
Hello
Hi, Maria Inez speaking here
Hi Hi Alicia speaking.
Hi Alicia, Where are you from?
I am originally from Chile but ah, I'm living in
Where?
Atlanta, Georgia, in the South.

Ha, Ha Philadelphia, at the University
In yes, in Penn University
yes, where this study is, it seems no,
yes, yes, yes, I casually work at the university but well, nothing to do with the study, I work in the part of biology, nothing to do with it.
What ah, or, that's intersting, biology, wow
yes tell, tell me, and what do you think of today's topic?
that's terrible, eh,
Horrible no, I don't know apart I don't know anything about the laws of the United States, I don't know.
yes yes, sure.
So I don't have the slightest idea, I know it's terrible that there is violence and that well it must be everywhere, but
Of Sure, everywhere against women and, and for men too, am
um
In general, but, sure, the problem is that maybe, the terrible thing is that there's abuse within the marriages and that's the worst thing of all of it.
yes, the domestic violence, not inside the houses, well the State can't get involved in that and
That's what I was saying to some people, that domestic violence between lesbians is much worse than domestic violence among heterosexual couples, lets say
yes, it is.
yes, and sometimes, they make quite a drama and they hit and abuse each other and sometimes,
Oh that's terrible.
They even shoot each other, I was talking to a policeman here in Atlanta  that
yes
what's his name, that if it's a woman against a woman, that would be
Look, woman against woman, that's weird, I wouldn't have imagined really, I really wouldn't have imagine it was that way
Sure.
Look, that's terrible.
No.
And there are laws in Chile, there's something because in Argentina, I don't know the name of the subject, that's the truth.
I, I think so but for example, it's not really that useful neither it is in Chile, all my personal experiences and certain problems that I've had and the people I've met that has had those problems and it has never
it was never resolved, so.
It's like the police doesn't get involved in this things, no
Sure, they don't and let me tell you this, oh, it's even more dramatic to talk to the police that the violent event per se
yes
I mean, it really is, I mean, the cops, they have no empathy, they make you feel ashamed of what has happened to you and really, I mean, to me, the most traumatic thing was to have to talk to the cops, so
yes
yes so
Look
It woul have been better to forget about it
yes well but the problem is over
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is
Oh, no, well now you are alright
yes, sure, sure. In this aspect, here, to me, I don't know of nobody to whom something has happened here,
well, I knew a girl in Argentina, it was something strange, I mean when I met her the problem was already over, she had a boyfriend, but she was a girl
aha
very young, she was twenty-two or twenty-one, she was younger than me, and I was young by that time
oh, yes
And I remember that she was a very beautiful girl, from a regular family, they had money enough, everything normal.
Sure
I mean, she looked like a goddess, and she had a boyfriend who hit her
Oh, my
And he stayed for about one year with that boy. And he hit her, and then he regretted it, and then she cried and returned with him
oh, that's terrible
And while she explained it to me, I stared at her and told her, I can't believe it, because you can imagine it in a marriage
Sure, or from a stranger, someone you don't know, a , a rapist let's say,
Sure, yes, something like this, yes
But that someone wants, eh, how you call it? that someone wants to be with someone like this, that's the funny thing
A girl wit ha strong temper, she was not a girl of the submissive kind
True
With all the personality, and however, no, I mean I think nobody should be exposed to something like this, meeting a madman and
I don't know, or a madwoman in the case of lesbians I don't know
how incredible. Sure, that's true. But listen, it's strange that, I mean not even, it's strange that a girl like this one, with temper and so, let him hit her
yes, besides the girl could have had any boyfriend she wanted, because as I told you she was a precious girl, very beautiful
mm
Right? and she explained it to me, and I just stared at her and told her 'I just can't believe it'
wow, how incredible, that, that, maybe, maybe, often when people is abused by parents or things like this, they end up with this kind of people
yes, that's terrible also
Another interesting thing I have heard, I mean actually I've had some pretty funny friends in my life I guess, and I had a girlfriend who was into the so called sadomasochism
No
you, you know what I mean, right?
yes, yes, yes
Sure. Yes, she is into that lifestyle, and they go out to clubs and stuff and she told me
that she had met about, two women let's say, who were ah, who were, who had ended up with a husband, I don't know, an abuser husband, and now they were in rehabilitation
yes
But she got into that, how you call it? sadomasochism because in the sadomasochism sexual game they could get over and psychologically overcome of havinf been
Ah,
physically abused by men like that.
Like a shame, let's say.
Sure something like that, something, something very strange, yes.
wow
Like, sure, like playing a role like that
yes
sexual, but without real violence but violence, like an act I mean like a, a
yes like, yes it's like a limited violence, let's say.
sure all yes could, um fanatic of everything psychological.
Look
That had caused, so I found everything very interesting.
It's interesting I, that catches my attention a lot all that topic of sadomasochism, I can't, well if you are not in it you can't understand it.
yes Of course
Look that sometimes there are documentaries like that about those type of things and I watch them and say, but how, but well and yes, is for but good
Sure, yes is  true.
I think that if it's consensual by both parties, I wouldn't do it, but it's okay, I don't know.
It's true, Sure, sure, is
I mean it's worse when a person abuses another person without consent, no, I don't know
sure that you see all that world, of sadomasochism the most important thing is not causing actual harm, but all that's perceived as harm is like, is not real harm, I mean, it's all a question, but what happens is that I worked with this girl that,
he was in the lifestyle
yes
so then, and on top of that she was one of these types of, of people who talked all day about everything. So then I was already almost an expert, simply knowing this
hm, that
but it was like, interesting
Awesome, awesome. Listen, was this all here in the United States or over in Chile as well?
Pardon?
You knew these people here in the United States, or over in Chile?
Ah, yes, yes, here in the United States. In Chile, forget it, or they may exist, but they are inside the closet, you could say
Of course, yes, I believe they must be everywhere, but what happens is if you are not looking for them,
Of course
eh, or I mean, if you know someone who is in the lifestyle
mm.
it's like, you don't, you don't get to, but they must be everywhere, I would imagine, they have to be.
Of course, for example, two years ago I was in Concepcion, which is a very small city in Chile, the south of Chile
yes, yes, yes,
of course, you find yourself, but it's very surprising the number of, of, punks and of, of, goth people. And homosexuals living in Concepcion, in other words there is a complete alternative world, it's like, it's unbelievable, it's like the society
Look
eh, in this city it's super open, it's like, very interesting and I would have never imagined it
Look, it's very interesting, it's very interesting, very interesting and I, I saw on television there was a program over in Argentina where they did, like, investigations on this type of, that is, about these groups inside the cities with different customs, and they also did one about the goths
Sure
And they were people, well that was in Buenos Aires, but I guess it must be the same in every city and it was really a huge group of people who have a
Sure
I mean, like their own life style, they live at night and dress in black, Gothic I think
Sure, sure, and they go to clubs and listen to that 'da, da, ,da' music, I don't know
Yes, I would be a little scared to enter one of those, and well, I guess they are inoffensive, if you don't meddle they won't do anything to you
Sure
but their aspect is a little scary, it scares me
yes, I've started to hear about people who go to the, what you call it? the dentist, to put on fangs, with surgery
To look like real vampires
No
I swear, I swear
that's terrific, figure
Incredible
And there are also the vampire clubs, I don't know what they actually do there and what are their habits but I know they exist
Sure, sure, they swear they are vampires
human mind is really extraordinary
yes that's right, if it gets bored it invents whatever
just like that
and in Buen- in Argentina, where did you live in Argentina?
I used to live in Mar del Plata
Mar del Plata, I see, you are the second one, I met some people from Mar del Plata via Internet, we talked to them that way
Look, look, it's a small city, we know each other, OK it's big but we still know each other quite a lot, it's like a big town
I mean, I don't think that you know some Martin who works in a 'call centre', I mean I doubt it, but
No, well, I know several guys named Martin, but I don't know
Oh, sure, I guess so. It's just that, I can't recall his surname, but he did work in a 'call centre', yes. And I used to talk to him, but then he became idiot and we didn't talk any more
See, just like usually happens with the Internet
Sure, yes it's true, it's funny
everything starts fine, but then they start acting silly
yes sure, and you are an idiot and so, I don't know
I am from Mar del Plata, Mar del Plata is nice, so, where were you from? Chile?
yes, they sent me pictures, it's very nice I liked it a lot
It is nice already, yes, did you notice that the America's Summit was in Mar del Plata? I wonder if you heard
it arrived at three, right
Bush was there
I had no idea
yes, yes, yes it was in Mar del Plata
Wow
About one month ago, in November
wow, wow
yes, yes I went to Mar del Plata little time before, for a visit and well, they were preparing the whole city because all the presidents of America were going there, I guess you president must have been there also
oh, sure
yes, yes, yes
oh, sure, sure
he was, all of them were, they meet every I don't know how many years, all the presidents of America meet to talk about their
Sure, to promote the American imperialism
things, of course. Well, and they were all aginst Bush and so
Oh, I can imagine.
it was quite interesting seeing it
Listen, I think if I had been you, I would have regretted not being there, it would have been funny
yes, I was there just before that, but I came back two days before all the presidents arrived, precisely
ah, I see, so you saw the preparations somehow
I saw, yes of course, I saw how they were putting the safety fences, my parents lived right there, two blocks away from where Bush was to stay
so they were given, they had to give them two credentials in order to get in and out of their house, because otherwise they couldn't
oh, wow, no, that's ridiculous
And nobody could visit them without a credential, it was quite a matter
that's ridiculous
if they had to walk the dog, they needed the cerdential because they could be stopped at any moment to check if they were, I don't know, terrorists or whatever
Sure, yes, sure, today
Funny
The same, ridiculous, but also interesting, I've never being in something like that

Eh, in reality I live in Philadelphia, but now I'm in,
Ah, me too.

yes.
Eh, but I'm calling you from San Francisco, because my, my brother lives here. so, I came here
Ah, for vacations.
to visit him, yes. For two, three weeks.
Aha. And how is it over there? I have some friends, now, that went over there.
yes. To San Francisco?
yes, is it good?
It's raining, raining every day.
Is it nice? Don't tell me. Pitty my friends, they wen- on vacation, and it's raining.
yes. yes. It's all grey. But it isn't, it's cold in Philladelphia, right?
yes, but not that much. Er, winter is coming super quiet, it's coming very mild.
ah, that's lucky.
yes, yes, yes. Not so much, there's no snow at all. It's good.
a-ha.
It's really good. So, well, I don't know about that subject, which, which is scheduled for today, in fact I know nothing.
Neither do I, I was about to tell you the same, that this is the second time I get this subject, and
It's really bad.
no, no, I've not much to say either. What I said last time, is that I think there's a lot of abuse, when it comes to women,
erm, it is often psychological abuse, it isn't always physical.
Oh really?
yes, I feel sometimes, er, women can find themselves like trapped in a relationship or something like that, and it is due to being afraid of leaving the relationship that they stay and
accepts many things that, most probably, shouldn't.
Sure, sure, sure.
But, as for the physical thing, because the questions they asked are, erm, in regards to the, the American government,
mmh, yes, yes.
and the law, I think it is quite good, as far as I know. I don't know anyone who found themselves in a situation,
mm
yes, have being hit, or, sure
yes
Sure, sure, sure, so, well, I really can make an statement in the subject, because I've never met someone in that problem
And well, I really don't have idea, so, I can make an statement in that subject
So do I
So, let's keep talking about San Francisco, tell me, is it nice there?
Oh, yes, is really nice, I love this city, yes
yes, I see
My brother has lived here a few years. So, I often come here to visit him, and we get along, we are 10 years appart
yes, 10 years
10 years, I see
I'm 26 years, he is 36 years old
Oh, well, that's nice
So, he takes me out for dinner, because this city is pretty expensive
Oh, more expensive?, More expensive than Philadelphia, yes
yes, than Philadelphia yes,
I see
But, there are many places for eating, and really good
More Beautiful
Em, places to get to know, and this.
Aha, good, great.  There there's a really big gay neighborhood, No?
yes, there, but, Philadelphia,
They told me, I didn't have any idea, they told me that one of the neighborhoods
yes, there's one, a street that's called Castro.
Ah.  Aha.
And, over these streets and this zone, it would be like the gayborhood of Philadelphia.
Aha.
But, sometimes I think that Philadelphia has a, a bigger community than San Francisco
Ah, yes?
that, yes sometimes I think so.  Here, the attitude that, that everyone is really liberal and all of society is liberal.
And there's a very big and stable community of, of homosexuals, eh, men and women but, but it's not as, eh, I don't know, I think, em,
sometimes in Philadelphia, I think that they're more militant, more or less,
Ah, aha.
that, they have their zone, and this zone is really closed, really well defined, yeah.  Here it's more open, everyone is pretty open, eh, they experience a lot, or
like a more general liberal attitude, yes
ah, how nice.  This is good.
yes, yes, yes.
This is really great, look at that.  Well, now we have to go meet
yes.  And,
some day, to San Francisco
How long have you been living in Philadelphia?
No, just one year
One year. Oh, so little
this is my first year, and you?
Five years
Oh yes, and have you returned to Paraguay?
yes, yes. My dad lives in Paraguay, in Asuncion, and I often visit him
Mhm
I go there every year. Only on holidays, but this time I came here to San Francisco, to visit my brother.
Sure
I am, I am like the ambassador of my family, I go from one country to another, visiting my relatives, or my
Oh, that is who you miss the most
yes
Eh?
Well, eh, I don't know, my mom lives in Philadelphia
Sure, yes, yes. Oh, really? Ah
And I know she misses it. But, I think she has more limitations at her job, and
Ah. You have more freedom to handle it,
yes, more, yes
The times, that's nice, that's nice, we went to Argentina, last month, I think that last month and well, visiting
To friends, relatives, eating meat
Oh, nice
that you really miss here, right?
Now, I'm about to go to a restaurant where they cook the cheese steak here in Philadelphia
yes
Authentic, because they used the bread from Philadelphia
Oh really?
Do you know it?
yes, I know it, yes, yes
And well, they use that bread and they cook in the same way, let's see, like in Philadelphia and all that, but here
Why?
because it's
Don't you like it
really greasy, it's really heavy, really heavy
That's really heavy, really heavy
And I like meat, but is not that nice, either, is half baked meat
Did you see, I was hoping other thing, I will keep trying and each house, until I find the best
yes
But, so far no
Regarding the meat, i found the Mixto [or 'Mixed'] restaurant, or, that's very tasty
Oh, yes, in Phil, here. Uh, they told me about a restaurant, i  once walked outside it's door
Yes, they have a dish on the menu, that's the Argentinian roast, but i don't think they use argentinian meat
Well, but it's good, it's good, well, i think it's tasty. Oh, well
Yeah, i thought sou, with chimichurri. A little salty, yes
Oh, very good, oh, I'll stop by, yeah, they told me something about, about that restaurant, like that, about Latin American foods, and that, that it was very, very tasty, that it was good
yeah, it's very tasty
Well, so, well
And, are you married?
Yes, I'm married
Right
Yes, yes, and my wife is expecting a baby here
Oh, that, that's nice, huh, congratulations
Well, thank you.
Yes
Are you married or not?
No, no
Uh huh
No, no, i have a boyfriend that
Well
that no, I can't say that, that there's no complaint of abuse of any kind.  But, a year ago, we were celebrating.  And he's American, eh, of descent
Russian descent
Ah.
B-but he's, he's American.
yes.  Look.
yes.  He's tall
How strange.  No?
yes.  It's interesting.
Interesting, yes.
yes, different.
And, good.  How's the relationship going, well?
All goo, all good.  I think that yes, he's ten years older than I am too, like my brother.  And,
Hmm.
so, he has a ten year old daughter, and sometimes I think that we're at different parts of our, so, in different places in life, or something like that,
Oh.
but aside, eh, aside from all this, everything's good.
Everything's good.
I think so, I think so.
And how did you get along eh, with the daughter?
Eh, I met her once.
Oh, no, he lives here with him
Once, no, no, he's like, with, with the
Oh
no, with the daughter's mom, he doesn't, he doesn't have a good relationship with ther
Uh um, Oh
So, actually, it has, it has been hard for him to have like stable meetings, or scheduled, with the daughter
Oh, poor, po-, that's wrong
Do you have another daughter or?
What?
uh,do you have another son or is that the first son you're expecting?
it's the only one, that i know
I see, yes
So, no, this is going to be the first
The first, oh, yeah, and do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
No, we don't know anything, no, no, no, no, no, i think that's going to be a
the, a surprise
Yes, um, y that's going to be a surprise, like
Right
like the old times
And is your wife Argentinian too?
yes, Argentinian, also.
Ah, okay.
yes, yes, yes. So, he's working here in, in, in Penn. So, yes.
Ah, really?
Eh, well, and here we are. The baby arrived by surprise, but well.
Ah, yes. Arrived by surprise.
Will be welcomed.
Came mm, sure.
So, well. And, I hope he brings a, a bread under his little arm, as we say. That he comes with, with, with fortune.
What does that mean? With good luck, with fortune, with good luck.
And, good luck, and all those things, it means, that he comes with a bread under the arm.
Aha. Supposedly, well, in, in, Mexico, they also say, that the child or a newborn brings a lot of luck, that, that everything will change after the child comes, that work will improve and,
and all.
Really?
yes.
Ah, ah, you haven't mentioned anything. And not in Paraguay?
I don't know, don't know if there are any sayings that I know.
No. Aha. Aha. And how are things there in Paraguay? Is it nice? I don't know anything about Paraguay, I have no idea.
And, it's good.
I have no idea how it is.
Uh, the economy is always kind of unstable
Yes
And so, i think, i think there is a lot of trouble and that, because, because of the lack of money and that, there's a lot of poverty
Oh, sure
and now it's starting, the last time i went, i think it was more dangerous
Oh
the, the capitol was very dangerous
Oh
Th people don't go out at, at night, or if they do, it has to be with
A lot of poverty, sure, sure, you have to be very careful
Yes
Oh
Before, it wasn't like that before, when i lived there, i could go out anytime, and it wasn't, it wasn't dangerous at, to the point that
that they, right?, they're going to ki-
Of not going straight from, right
yes, they're going to be there with, with a gun or something like that. That didn't, you never heard of that, but now, another thing that's new too is kidnapping, something that was never heard of in Paraguay, the kidnapping of
Oh, we had that in Argentina
Is there a lot of that in Argentina?
No, it's calmed down now, it's calmed down, but, did you saw that, for a while in Argentina, the dollar was one on one?
Right
It was one dollar per peso, well.  And after there was an economic disaster, and
Good evening, my name is Marco
Yeah, good evening, i am Gloria from here, from California
Hi Gloria, uh, i am in Philadelphia
Oh, nice to meet you
oh, nice to meet you, uh, lets see, the subject, i didn't exactly understand what it was talking about, uh,
against the violence, lets say, well, against one, as a woman
Yes, yes, but, uh, you were asking about the opinion of, something, he said something about the law
i mean, the laws that protect, lets say, when you as a woman are being assaulted, lets say at home
Yes
and, uh, when there's domestic violence
Yes
So, well, here in California there are laws, yeah, there laws that help a lot with that, because when you're a woman, you're assaulted both physically and verbally, or psychologically
Yeah, with
uh, there's a lot of help here from the government, lets say, uh, for us women, when there's domestic violence at home, right?
yes, i know very well, my mother is a doctor, i know, i grew up i Paraguay, and she worked in the Health Ministry, in the office, the Secretariat for the Women
uh, she represented Paraguay in the United Nations and always, uh, very, she was very involved in programs to help, particularly that, in Paraguay and the whole world
Um, the hardest part is that any of this is very emotional, so, and with everything that has to do, whether it's emotional or
among the family, or married people, or there is another category, where it is, it's self-justified in some way
uh huh
um, no, no, i don't, i don't know, yeah, i think it's hard when uh, a person doesn't want help or give their opinion about other families and some people
ehh for example when I, where, when I grew up my dad used a belt
hmm
when we were bad, when we did something we shouldn't do, he punished us this way
hmm
and openly and this was normal and it was they way things were done
hmm
ehh, today for example, my, I have a five year old creature and more than when he was smaller, I hit him a little bit on his backside with my hand
oh, oh, a bit on his tail sometimes
hmm
ehh, no more than this, and once he could communicate, once he could talk with us, we didn't punish him physically since he's been three, not including before
ahh yes true it's up, but for example a person who's only used to this can think it's the way that they punished me as a creature
hmm
and they can believe that something barbarous and terrible but no, it was my dad who wasn't a bad man, it's just the way that he did it
hmm
and in some places they do things differently eh and when it has to do, when you have to accuse the other, eh, the woman always enters into a difficult position
hmm
em
in my opinion I think well, I don't know, if it's sometimes masochistic or I don't know, but sometimes verbal aggression hurts more
that the
no this is the wa- this is just the problem, it's more mental
aha, that is something that you don´t forget when you are a grown up woman
eh the body is not, no, not only that but that she gets hurt and that changes her way of seeing things, the way she feel things em
hmm
is not is is worse, is a lot worse eh that that is, definitively I know that my my mother she is here in the United States and my father is still in Paraguay
eh they are separated since, they talk well and because of that there was never a physical abuse problem eh she says that it was more mental
eh that was the way and that was in Paraguay being there the things are different, she is used to the way things are here
hmm
it was not I don´t know, she did not justified herself
hmm
and
I know many women too who are being physically abused and don´t, don´t notify it to any
no
lets say to someone who could support them or to the law because sometimes there is the immigration situation and they are afraid of being deported and all that stuff
yes
and then that leads to continue being attacked and sometimes they even are killed, right?
many times, many times even when you ask them directly if she was hurt without him hearing she does not want to get him into trouble eh, she does not want to
she doesn´t want to or maybe think that she is going to be punished by him if she tells that
hmm
and then when he know it or something of that she eh cannot accuse him and without that accusation
hmm
nobody can do anything, nor the police, the family, nobody can do anything
there in my country, where I come from, they say they can't, I don't know about laws but they say they can't intervene because that are couple affairs, right?
yes
so that's the reason for the suicides and so, and in a home, when there is domestic violence, children have it in mind
right
if my parents were like this, I will be the same
exactly, exactly
aha, my dad hit my mom, so I will do the same when I grow up, or even have a worse behaviour
it is not ne-, not necessarily, ah, sometimes after seeing that, eh, they do exactly the opposite, eh, they hate swimming in a swimmers family,
a son of doctors who can't, eh, stand seeing blood, and can't, eh, and hates hospitals, eh, not always will he follow the parents
right, there are cases, I have known such cases
it's more like
I lived with a person who, who since his parents hit him he wanted to do the same
yes, that is, that is nor very possible
so, he thinks my mom was hit because she surely liked it, so all women should be the same
it is possible, eh, because it depends on who you are with, if you are with people who don't think that way when you are not home
the people in school, the people wherever you go, the way these people think, eh, his behaviour will reflect that
his thoughts will reflect that also
mhm
but it is hard
the thing is that right now I think that I am not in those domestic violence cases but in my opinion is that now there are more and women are heard more
yes
there are women associations here
no no no and that is the, in in general the women have the same rights than men if for some reason is not like that
she is not receiving or is not having all the rights of a man she should simply raise her hand and tell it and that is going to be fixed
hmm
but the thing is that many time they don´t do it
because of fear or I don´t know
eh of eh because of fear,for any reason, there is help, is not that, is not that there is not
eh she can or not eh it can´t and after that if she didn´t say something is because something is happening to her Is she going to say that it was her fault?
hmm
eh because she didn´t say nothing, ah, are you going to blame her? if she killed, it is it is difficult, then it is not defined, it is eh complicated
yes but the thing is that we are still living in the past  century lets say it so hits and all that stuff are still a custom  and
when, while there are persons that because you love them or who is going to financially support me if he goes to jail maybe that is in their minds I suppose
because of that they don´t report them, right? or don´t ask for help and that becomes a routine that thing of being beaten I met a lady that when her husband didn´t beat her she didn´t
felt happy and she cried and cried all the day because she was used to be beaten
yes
and then eh I think that it becomes a routine is like a hobby
yes everything has to do with it everything has to do with what you are used to
aha
oh, and it's
I believe that violence and all of that it's becoming more common in places as Latin America because where I come from
most of the men had at least once gotten drunk and they become aggressive and
no, no, for example
and even if they are not like that, they do it when they are drunk
for example, they use it to punish their children, oh, yes, one, for example, they use their belts to hit their children, oh, they have boundaries too, it's not like
they do it to hurt the child but to make them feel some pain so that they don't behave in a wrong way, I mean, you hit them once or twice but
to do it again, you are causing some damage
my name's Ramon from Los Angeles
ehh I'm Rafael from Vancouver, Canada
ah very good okay, yes, nice to meet you ahhh
yes nice to meet you
this is a very interesting call for me
hmm
because it's the first time I've had a conversation with a person, after the what do I know, twenty five calls, ahh no, now I'm close to a restaurant
because this call needs to be, ehh, out of the, my house telephone
correct
ah this yes I'm really happy now that you've connected with me
ehh from where, like you live in Los Angeles
I'm from, I live in Los Angeles, I live here
but where did you come from?  What city, what country do you come from?
from Los Angeles, I'm Chicano
ahh, you were born, you're Chicano
yeah yes yes I was born here in Los Angeles, and you?
you were born in Los Ageles ahh good, I"m from, ehh, I've lived here in Canada for fifteen years, I come from Argentina
oh from Argentina, very good, ah only the topic is domestic violence
hmm
and here ironically I work in, and I'm a mediator and I work in the superior course of the county of Los Angeles and sometimes I'm a mediator
In problems of violence against women?
of cases of cases of domestic violence ah
ah you you eh have participation as a mediator
ah I am the mediator, I am a neutral
hmm
and and try I try to build consensus between parties ah in in instead of a judge´s decision and the person could receive a
a restriction order ah temporal
aha like
so ah
and there are many and there are many cases of violence I, so I imagine that
ah after the mind yes ah that is a as I work here in this area about three or four months and the papers of the
The United States in this area is very very bad ah in relationship with my part of the situation of how domestic violence is that the people that want to
ah the most are men but there are some ah there are some women is the same but it is like the with the person wants to call the other person, one person wants to call the person and
and the other person does not want it anymore and wants eh like to
aha
and a spy while
hmm
ah social things and like a million of people here in this country do this ah
hmm
eh that behavior
hmm
yes this is really bad here in the United States ahh and
but very, let's say the proportion is growing or is shrinking
ahh I think that it's a level that isn't growing but it's like, this statistic is ten years old, I think that there isn't
there aren't statistics this year but typically they think that a million people are like, ahh, bothering a person
hmm
here so, you know, it's part of the problem of society and since half of the marriages here in this country ahh
end in divorce
half end in divorce
yes yes, half of the marriages have a divorce
but, but speaking in general or in some communities?
in general in the United States
but the Latino community is the same, or, greater or less
I, ehh, I don't know, I'm sure that this statistic but generally it's ahh
seventy per cent
yes fifty percent and
aha
and what's the situation in Canada on this topic
well I, I'm not very, eh, up to date on the numbers
aha
but I think it must be around there
oh yes oh
yes yes more or less, could be a little less but not much less, no, there is not
aha
there is not such a big difference between one place and the other about this aspect
aha
because maybe in some other aspects we could talk about there may be a difference, but in this aspect, as far as I know, no
ehh I am about forty percent, he is dealing fifty percent
oh
in that aspect there is a si-, there is a similarity, I mean a similarity with, with what we are here
talking about probability
aha
that, that is afterwards, I don't know, we should also see another thing, about what happens if inside that fifty percent
aha
how much ehhh violence does the divorce provoke, understand?
yes yes yes
I don't know, I don't handle those numbers because it is a thing that, well, is eh eh eh,I have never had violence problems
eh on one side in the personal
yes
but I'm not sure, because I would notice, well you must notice
but, you can compare Argentina and Canada and the laws, are almost the same, right?
well
to protect the women
no, no, no, no, here in Canada there is a lot more protection for women
yes, in
a lot more, I don't know if at this time the United States laws are the same, but here
yes
I mean, here man is guilty until proving the opposite
yes
I don't know how is in the United States
well, here in California is like, well, if there is a suspect and the man is acting as one, well
violent action, the police investigates, but there is a lot more legislation for women, and that's fine for me but
yes, also here in this state, if someone, you know, like a violent case, they must go to
a class of anger management
yes
for a whole year each week
each week
each week they must assist to those lessons
and they have to make, let's say, a reeducation
yes, reeducation to
And I would not say reeducate, of reeducating
or teaching, any, that
But, a curiosity, a question I've being wondering, excuse me, a curiosity, the current time percentage you were born in Los Angeles, isn't it true?
yes, yes
And were your grandparents from Los Angeles or did they also emigrated
they are immigrants, my grandparents after Mexican revolution they came to Los Angeles
And well, so, they are many generations
yes, yes, yes
And you are talking about, what revolution?
In Mexico, Mexico
in 1910
and well that's near to 1917
and yes 17, oh no
yes, 17
because
it's near Russian revolution
near the Russian revolution there was the Mexican revolution, I was confused because I had some Mexican friends and well
yes
And well, we sometimes chat and well, that would be a commentary, more like curios, because like they didn't had the chance
So far to talk about a person born from the grandparents
oh
eh that they were already living in California, usually
yes
it was people of the first generation or who had been living fro few years, whether in those southern states
or, yes, yes, in that county, in that county of Los Angeles, a very strange one compared to the country because
in a sense, because
like fifty percent of people here were born in another country
oh, fifty percent were born in another country, aha aha, and
yes, yes, yes, and in some other places like New York City, Miami, and maybe Chicago, ahh, and maybe one or two more
big cities, it is similar but it is, it is, like
oh
compared to the other big cities in the country, the percentage is very big
very big, now, one question, do you live in the very city of Los Angeles?
yes, yes
now, violence there is bigger, it is bigger usually than in other smaller cities. How is the environment there?
specifically in Los Angeles or in the county
I mean compared to the very city
aha
compared to a county that belongs to the big Los Angeles, right?
yes, yes, well, here it is like, mm, like two or three centuries back, the information in the news is that crime is decreasing in Los Angeles
ah the crime is decreasing, aha
yes it's decreasing I can't say ah specifically the statistics but ah the police in this city of Los Angeles was saying that crime is at
is more less than like two three years ago, so is better here
ah now ah is better, a question a question that at this moment comes to mind but I read two days ago an article
that is about the problem there is with the immigration there from Mexico, what do you think of the wall they want to erect between the border of the United States
Hi. Lurdes from New York.
Rodrigo from New York.
yes hi Rodrigo. Have you ever been in a jury?
No, never. And you?
Never? yes, yes, I was one time eh, they called me for service but they didn't pick me eh and the other time they called me for a civil case
and I was serving like ten days for a dispute of eh a renter with the owner of the building where he was living.
Ah, I was never so but I think that sometimes that is too much
eh eh I understand you perfectly because the truth is that the time that we spent waiting to be picked was more than the time we had to serve, right?
But what happened is that you wanted to participate?
No what happens is that if you don't participate, they arrest you. Because by law you have to serve.
yes that is true.
It's not an option, no?
Uh uh, whether you want to or not.
I I think that it's important, the problem is that the system well is not one that is like so to speak very eh
Democratic?
no no no that the whole system of picking the jurors is so and so slow.
yes.
And takes up so much time that then well of course anyone loses interest in serving, right?
Just the fact that I tell you that you have to have to go to jury duty is a waste of time.
Exactly. Exactly.
But well what you're talking about doing
And if the system were a bit more, faster, no, that the that the that the selection was a process that were less tedious, I think it'd be a lot easier for people
to participate, right?
I don't know, and yea.
I think the other thing would be for example the civil case that I had I mean the end at the end of the jury
I gave the same amount of money to both parts. And yea they cancelled the lawsuit and the counter-lawsuit, right?
what's the problem, what were they fighting about, what was the dispute
Because well apparently the the the person who was renting the apartment
Yea
uh, was, wasn't happy with the apartment's conditions. Because on the first floor there was a pizzeria
Mm.
and uh the the way that it was built the apartment well it had concrete floors and that meant that in the winter the apartment was really cold and in
summer it was really hot and but the way that they argued both sides
Uh huh.
to the jury it seemed like the lawsuit was frivolous, you know?
Right, but the good thing is that he won
And so
both sides won, both sides came to an agreement.
yes but both sides won but both sides lost because they both had to pay but the amount of money that it was it was the same so
at the end it all cancelled itself out, it ended up as zero. And that was like the way for the jury to say that your case didn't have any merit.
Shut up and go to your homes. That was like for years ago, and then last year they called me but they didn't pick me to participate. And, and the thing is that
many of the civil lawsuits that happen in this country are very very frivolous that, what they do is waste your time
Waste time
time. Time that costs money to sustain in the judicial system, well, for some of these cases that have no actual merit,
it's, uh, it's a shame, right?
Sure, lets see, sure
Because then the, the cases that are worth it and the frivolous cases get mixed up and you can't
The ones that really need the
well
justice, they can't get it in time. And the other things you said, like they are meaningless, they're just there taking space
Right
I don't, like i told you, i have never been called and i hope they never call me either. I don't
really
i wouldn't like to take part in that, right, because i don't have time to lose and this is very, that's all very... right?, so i wish i don't have to take part in it
Sure, sure
like you say, if you get called
or
You have to go
Look, with, there was a girl serving with me in the juries, that they sent the Marshall, the police, to find her at home
Uh huh
Because it was the third time that they had called to participate, to serve on the jury and didn't want to serve. So
The first time and the third time you go to jail.
the third's time the charm, exactly. But look, you already know that tomorrow it will arrive by mail
yes.
your first your first eh, order of if you go to a jury because whomever doesn't like the case be careful what you wish for.
Don't say this.
Eh.
What?
But look I think that again if the system was if they would fix the system so it wouldn't be eh so it would be a little more
I think it makes sense because at the end the jurors, the ones that trying to guarantee that there are people like us, right?
That are the ones evaluating the cases, that there's interest created of seeing what touches one to the other, do you understand me?
Of course it's true.
he doesn't want what, baby. Sh
Is it your kid?
yes.
Uh uh. Is it a boy or no?
it's a boy yes.
Ah.
He's nine months old.
Ah, little. I'm talking on the cellular because I'm in the train.
Oh, really?, from the street
yes, yes
Oh, okay
I hope that is not cut also
That if not, if they don't realize
I don't remember, are those 12 minutes?
There are 12 minutes, yes
Yes, we're missing like 5
Diego my love, please don't cry, this, what happen so many times with juries is that there is something that
I mean, sometimes, in the example, there are technical things of science, for example, not everyone understands
No
And then, for example at the OJ Simpson trial, there was evidence against him, scientific evidence of DNA and all that
it was conclusive, and that man was guilty
yes
bit, because of the people that were in the jury where people that not necessarily knew the science of what was being explained
and then, anything they said, that evidence wasn't valid, because the DNA is something that
is 100% different for each person, I mean, some Technic that you might not understand, and they make the result to be
not necessarily good and the people in a jury, are persons that are not researchers and not necessarily have
a well, a background in science,  and anyway, I don't know if the thing is know clearer, it won't because, well
No, that's true, Hello?
Pardon? Oh, look, the call
yes
Hello?
I will stick here to talk right my first call, this is my very first one
Oh, ok, ok, oh, is this your first call?
yes, and yours?
Oh, I've already made ten or eleven
really?
Yes, he is very
So
because you get to know a lot of people, and sometimes you may get the same person so you can somehow continue the converstaions. Uh uh, are you still there?
I hope it doesn't cut off
Oh, ok, the, hello?, hello Roberto? Hello? baby say hello
Hello
Hi, good afternoon, this is Micky
Hello, good afternoo, Micky. My name is Juan
Hello Juan
Hoe are you?
very well, and you?
Fine too, I'm in San Antonio, Texas. Where are you?
oh, I have never, in this I have never talked to someone in Texas, I am in Florida
oh, see, we are not that far awy
yes, not so far away
no, aha
no, and what do you think about the subject for today? justice and all that?
yes I have a question, in this case, the system of Justice based in
yes
Does this jury system exist outside the United States? This is my question, do you know it?
I think so
I think it exists in some
I know, I know that in my country
aha
I don't know what country you come from
From Mexico
ah, no, I don't know the laws in Mexico, I'm a lawyer and I know that
aha
it exists in, I'm Dominican
aha
and
And so there you have it
yes
ah, there there are juries, a OK so
yes
so you can make a comparison between how well it functions in your country if it functions
yes, yes it's the same, a bit the same, an but they've never called me, only on time and for me it's something I take seriously, since I'm the first
citizen in my family and well, and as a lawyer I think that it's something important, each person, it's like a civil duty to help the system even if, sure, I think that
in my country and here in the United States the justice system is never perfect
aha
and but it's my part to contribute a little bit, no.
yes
but, I, I know that they asked me I went and they quickly told me that they didn't need me because many times, they don't want lawyers on juries
aha
and I would happily like to help but no
that was, that was in your country or here
that was no here
ah listen
here in the United States
but you think well I think it's a system that works in a very ideal way, very adequate for some matters, but the question is If
given that system, does it work the same way in Dominican Republican than here?
yes,
Is it just as efficient and effective?
yes same as over there, or same as here the system works this way, I mean that they get a jury, each defendant deserves or has the right to a jury
for any crime in that, well although it can be in that the, well a serious crime of kind of serious the conviction can be more than a year
before that's if it's a crime very
aha
small or I mean if a youth steals a candy from a store or something like that, or something that it's worth more than five hundred dollars that type of crime no he goes to jail but
he goes for a few months, and no that youth wouldn't have
aha, no
if for, but for others even hitting someone in a party, they have the right because sometimes hitting someone if that person gets sick
in the mind eh they deserve a jury, and it depends no because in my country and here
aha
normally is a jury of twelve, of twelve people and they try to get someone of well people from different environments  so that they don't have their own prejudice
but that's where the problem is, no because is for example if it's let's say if it's a case in extreme cases let's say if a case like
Yes, a girl was raped
yes
most of the people will feel really angry against the defendant and even though
yes
it's possible he's innocent, and that's why there's a process here and there in the United States, but it's very hard
Yes
Even in the, what makes the system imperfect is that many times everybody finds about what goes in the newspaper
Yes
and we use, we use the internet a lot, and always, and that's why, because of the technology we are more aware of what's happening
Right
and the system here is made not to include, if there is something in that same example, if a girl was raped and it was on the news
in all the country, in television, in the radio, in the web, it's very hard to find someone that didn't, in the law they say that it wasn't stained
Right
for all that and they go
if you already have a previous opinion on that
sure, sure, that's very hard, because they try
right, that
what's in that example, they move the case, let's say, if this case is in Texas, they say "no, too many people is involved, angry"
"there have been protests and we'll move this to California, but even there, they know about it, it's hard nowadays right?
yes
But I'm talking too much, what do you think?
right, well, it's that you know more about it, that's why i started with a question
Right
right?, because i thought that, i think that in many cases the system itself doesn't work if it's not supported on a cultural matter of the population
And, like you said
Yes
if a population is easily vulnerable
Yes
to the influence of the media, well, the system itself suddenly can't be very closed because of the media influence, right?
Yes, yes
So, that's part of the, of the precaution that must exist, right?, so the first thing i thought is that if the system really works, the system itself
yes
right, that for what it's worth, it's a democratic system, of democratic representation of the justice, but it has its logic, but it's, it can be one of the
yes
of the limits, right?, that it can have
Sure, sure, in many cases, yes
in the century, but at the same time, like you said, there is no perfect system and sometimes the authoritarian one deciding judge system like
the way he "salomonically" thinks
Yes
Well, like in the case of Mexico, it's very prone to corruption
Yes, yes
No
sure, sure
because in Mexico's case, there is great corruption in the justice systems,
Sure
so, the judges always tend to, in very, in very important cases, to make decisions that go against what the very people thinks justice is
Yes, my country is the same, yes
Right?
like in this country, the corruption is
Right
i think there's a lot of that, but it's, i don't know, the cover up for corruption is the money, but in many cases, famous cases like the
uh, it's been over teen years, that a football athlete, OJ Simpson, was charged of murdering his wife, right?, and he
Right, right
He had a whole lot of money, and usually everybody thinks he was guilty
exactly
he killed his wife
Exactly
but yes, and that, that case shows there is a lot of imperfection, he had a lot of money, he had millions
right
in his, in his case and that's why, i think that had a lot of influence, and since he was famous, a lot of people felt sorry for him
yes
But at the same time part of the system is that one hundred percent of the jury has to have a  very pure certainly
of the guilt let's say of that guy of -OJ Simpson in that case
and there in, pardon in this case it was because of a technical issue, no
yes it was because they had doubts, they had yes
not exactly
they have to be one hundred percent I mean when they privately vote, the jury, if a person has a doubt, already it doesn't
yes
doesn't come out, but in that case the technical thing was that they thought well since since the glove didn't fit
aha aha
they had doubts that perhaps it wasn't him, I think it was two men in the way that they killed it was very serious, they lifted a man, they took off his head, but
ah
they had doubts and that technically as an attorney I understand that if they had even an iota of doubt they can't find him guilty, also because the police made mistakes
the cops
yes
they stepped on the blood, took out the blood, they found that man's blood in the car, but since they damaged all that, technically
yes yes
it can be used
exactly, there it was an excess
in that
that was really an excess, right
yes
from the jury
yes
I guess that in most cases they have some doubts
yes
I think, no
yes, yes
that there's always a small percentage of doubt in all cases, right
yes, that's right, that's why laws exist
but in this case, money helped so that the doubt
yes
would decide the outcome and not
yes, yes, yes, that's right, yes
I'm still talking about this example, but the fact is that the system, as you say, is not perfect
no
but it still works a bit better than other systems that are authoritarian, lets call them that way, authoritarian, no
yes yes
where a judge decides, right
yes, I agree because, I don't remember myself but my parents told me that in my country, they don't have the history of Mexico of course, all countries are corrupted by the history here shows that democracy in their country
It's wider, it's older, and well, my parents suffered a lot in my country when there was no democracy, there was a dictator and that's why i can only
compare it to when there really was no jury, there was nothing like that, that system from the fifties
Right
and, uh, and before, and well, i can thank the system for that, but it also has flaws, for example, in this country there still are, for example, if there is
there have been many cases where, lets say, of murdering someone, he says "no, i didn't kill the guy"
but you can't understand him well because he doesn't speak English very well, he's Hispanic
Right, right
Many times uh, in the jury, now and in the past, the lawyers pick people from the jury that aren't hispanic, and the court has been finding little by little that it isn't
it isn't, it's unfair, because they have to find people in the jury that can understand the man's situation
Yes
He's saying that he wasn't in that place and like that, many other go to jail that are innocent too
Right, like now in the Simpson case
Yes
somehow the system, the crime and justice problem, well, it obeys many complex circumstances
yes
I, sometimes i think about the case of Simpson, maybe he was guilty
yes
and the system declares him, uh, not guilty, and what we could expect is that the guy would behave, i guess
right
right, i mean, yeah, maybe he is guilty
oh well
but, in some other cases, the same system has declared innocent a guy that he's going to kill, rape or do some other things.
yes, yes, yes, unfortunately
so
Hello, good afternoon
Hello I'm Arthur, I'm calling from New York
Hello I'm Mayra and I'm talking from Texas
Hello Mayra, fine, fine, fine Mayra. Listen where are you from originally, from Texas?
how are you? Hello from Mexico City but right now I'm in Texas in fact I live in Philadelphia, but I'm on vacation in San Antonio
ah look from the D.F. very good, very good, I, I lived in the D.F. a while
where?, ah really, how long?
I was living in the D.F. like three years three years, two years eighty five, eighty six and then from ninety seven til nine eight
alright, and what did you think? yes?
aha, no well I like it. The only problem is the safety
yes, well that is- that's the only problem because the pollution that they had before has been fixed a lot
ah really? to
I feel that it's not as bad as in the eighties. In the eighties it was quite bad
yes I remember, and well and others - traffic yes that does, still exist for the
yes listen, and where are you from?
I'm Chilean
ah, okay, and now
well, then the topic, the topic is of, let's say eh, the topic of the day is eh the jurors right? Have you ever gotten to be a juror, no
yes no, no, no, no and I don't think I'll get to because I'm not an American citizen
ah yes is true, I think that you have to be a citizen
yes, have you had to?
I had to once, I had to once, what happens is that I'm also American. I was born in Wisconsin
okay
I hold the double nationality then yes one time I had to, they called me to, to do jury duty and well it was quite boring all that honestly, it was a lot of waiting, wasting time and at the end look that I got a case that I was interested in, I was interested in being one of the jurors
ah, okay
I said well to see how it is, but they didn't pick me, they didn't pick me but in a way, I remember, I don't even know why they told me thank you very much
only one the attorneys they have the right, for example, like fifty people arrive
aha
and then they call them one by one and they ask them, well first they give you a paper a form and you fill out the whole form and they see it and they can ask you questions and they start eliminating
any of the two attorneys can, let's say, eliminate a juror and
listen and on what basis do they eliminate, only if they think is a good idea or not? or how is it?
yes, no, there's no rule, let's say, there's no rule that limits it because, I mean they can eliminate them because is black, they can eliminate him because is
eh, husband of an, of an official, or because they answered a certain way on the forms, is that in the forms they ask you all types of things
okay
like for example
okay
what, what do you think of the death penalty, things about, I mean, they can ask you a thousand things and basically what they want to see is which is the jury that would be most advantageous to them
okay mm
then eh, a district attorney can want, for example, someone who's related to a cop, a wife, eh, a mother of a cop when for example, an attorney for the defense would never! want that
yes, well yes
and like that, and when it's for example a woman that was beaten and they are accusing a man, eh, I say that the prosecutor will want for the jury to be women
well yes
and those kind of things right? I mean, it's the thing of seeing, trying to decide trying to think how a jury a person in the jury will think. Well and what do you think of the jury system in general?
the system, now that you are telling me, for example, I was going to ask you how you think it works because it seems that you can I mean, you can practically change the, the, the way a trial will proceed depending of the jury you choose
because, for example, I've seen, in the last scandalous trials that there were of the CEOs of various companies
yes
two that were identical and the, the men had done exactly the same thing but one chose for the trial to take place in a in a county and the other chose in New York
yes, mm okay, yes
and one they gave him, one came out innocent and the other was found guilty and with a sentence of I don't know how many years and it really just was, I mean, they were analyzing it in the Economist which is the magazine that I see
and they were saying that yes, that the only real difference was that the lawyers of one were sharper and chose in other words the right place and the right jury
and well it made me think, like that of, listen then it just depends on what attorney you have and that's it, I mean, it seems- mm?
well in a large part in a large part that's how the justice system is here. Eh, it's justified by calling it an adversary system adversary or I don't know how it's called
and the idea is that they are competing like a tennis match or a football game okay?
mm
one team and the other, and the prosecutor team against the defense and the idea is that, well, that each one, I mean
it's supposed that in, in, in general is going to come out good but I don't think that the system is designed so that there's never a mistake, and that, that you are completely right and the example is: one single jury, one single person
can decide that, that no and the whole trial has to be done again, because one person says that no
yes
and that person of course that could've been eliminated by someone from the other lawyer and there's a lot, a lot that happens I believe randomly is that it can't be controlled, and that is part of the system
but generally it's supposed to work. I think that's the idea
well yes, I suppose that is the idea.  But it happens that, well, he also does well because lawyers charge you and charge you and why at times
you have to pay what they say, no?  I mean, if it will make the difference between being guilty or innocent, better to pay whatever
ah, this is true, and the most important, for example, I have a friend who was stopped because, well, I don't know, he was speeding, and he had drunk a little bit of alcohol and here you don't know how strict they are here
aha
with drinking and driving, they're exaggerated
yes, a lot
eh, yes, a big tragedy, imagine!  They arrested him and everything, imagine what this costs, because it's like five thousand dollars in fines
but after you're up, and they've left you suspended without a license, and it stays on your record after
wow
the insurance costs you an eye because insuring the car is a hug- a huge problem, but aside from this, there will be costs and all this, he's paying I think almost five thousand dollars
to get a better lawyer.  And with a better lawyer in the case of driving drunk
hmm
eh, it really works
oh yeah?  hmm, well, hmm
pretty well, like, I hope a little bit, so, yes, I think that in the cases, let's say, well, in all the cases look at the case of O.J. Simpson you can also see that
there are also many people who say that the jury system didn't work
yes, yes
and because he had such a good lawyer who was Johnny, and sure, and they elected, and the place where they did it and  number of blacks that they had on the jury, etcetera, people say that
this was an injustice, I don't know, I think that sometimes you don't know, and the job is only a way to try to guess
hmm
and, and we can't know if, if he is or is not guilty
listen, and compared to the Chilean system, for instance, how is the Chilean? is it like all the other where you are only judged by the judge alone and he is the one who
decides and pronounce the penalty?
oh, look I am not very, very, eh I don't know that well the Chilean system because I never lived in Chile
oh, OK
so I can't tell you, but I don't remember how it was in Mexico, although I lived in Mexico I don't know how the system is there either
it's like this, it's just like this, you don't even have- trials are not open in general, everything is acrrief out with audiences only
aha
and there is no jury, you just declare in front of the judge, and the judge is the one to pass at the end, to decide whether you are innocent or guilty
and he pronounces the penalty, and that's it but I have seen that you can appeal everything
sure
so even if you are declared guilty you can spend the next years appealing and there is no difference, you just have to keep paying your attorneys to keep doing the paperwork, it's quite funny
well, I think it's the same everywhere, eh, where you can appeal, I think you can appeal in most of the places
but what do you think about it? who is best to take the decision? someone who studied laws and who is professionally paid to hear and understand laws and determine guilt?
or do you think its better a system where an average citizen is part of a group who takes the decision?
I think, I don't know what is better honestly, I think that if I have, I mean thinking about it as if I had the resources, it would be more convenient using a jury
I mean, the one in which citizens pay because then I can actually decide what is going to happen, and otherwise then I would resort to the system which I find more fair where a judge is the one who knows and
the cases will be presented to only him, and he will take the decision
I think
but, that is what we use in Mexico and I don't know how well it works, anyway you can convince the judge to say whatever you want
or you can buy it sometimes, that's the problem, and it's just one person
mm, yes, it's easier that way, it's cheaper, I guess, than to buy the whole jury.
sure, and well I don't know, if you know, and I mean, if you know a person and he's going to be on the jury, I mean, they've picked him to be part of one, to have contact with them will be difficult
now, I think you might, it's just an idea but, for example, professional jurors
that would be a great idea, they would know about it because I think they are malleable, I mean
I mean, you take
a jury of normal citizens and well, you just have to control the news media, you can make everybody have an opinion
I see, and with that you can influence the jury's decision, there's no problem.
that's what I think, so, I believe that, sure, that's what happens when you have a very specific way of interpreting the law, no, I mean, just like a lawyer
mm mm
and oh, to have, I mean, to pass a test, with certain questions so that you have, oh, so that you are deemed capable and logical
mm
to know about statistics, to understand, for example, to clearly or scientifically understand what DNA is, the different kinds of isotopes, the tests, to know more about this than the average citizen.
lots more
yes, yes, yes, yes
and take it from there but also, if there is an anonymous group of people, to have lets say four hundred or five hundred paid people in that group, I mean, it would be like any other job.
and they are going to be picked, not by the lawyers, I mean, to change the system a bit
mm
just a bit so that instead of picking a normal person, I mean, they would pick someone that went to school to be part of a jury
Tamara

Very good Well I just returned yesterday
ah,
And I'm super sad
Happy New Year
yes I'm super sad because I wanted to stay
Oh, and what part of Mexico are you from? from DF?
From DF, mm
mm
And that's why
And is it nice?
yes, it really is
And is your boyfriend from Mexico also?
No, he's Gringo that's the problem
Oh,
a problem
Well he doesn't need a visa to go to Mexico
Well yes, But well anyway
And would you marry him, or is it too soon
Well like I don't have much of a desire to get married, in general
aha
I mean like yes, I want I feel very good with him, and I want to be with him for a long time
yes,
But, I mean like with that it's already enough
how, how old are you?
twenty five and you?
ah, I'm twenty nine
alright,
yes,
yes, but no, for now honestly no,
Well, you have time
yes, you have, are you married?
what?
are you married?
yes, yes, I married an Argentinian
Okay
Eh, I met, I mean I lived in Israel ten years
aha
And I met there in Israel
alright
And we got married now, last year but well, we've been together for seven years but, we got married to get the visa
aye, how nice
Because, yes because he had a biologist's visa, he's a biologist
okay
And he could be here for three years so nothing, like, well, we got married and he gave it to me too
That's great
And so, so we're hear until he renews it, and the moment that it's renewed I'm going to be much better.  But, but I'm happy, I'm working in a hospital
for animals, so
ah, how great, aye, how cool
yes, in New York there's the biggest hospital
aha
Biggest veterinary hospital, but well, we won't go to New York
Well, Boston is good,
yes, it's cold is the only
yes, pretty much
yes,
here too, eh, so
And you liked the move from Mexico to New York?
yes and no
why not?
Because, ah, well is that, I don't know, like everything stresses that is
yes, because there's too much competition
aha There's a lot of competition, There are a lot of people
yes
And although there's a lot of people where I come from
yes
here is like more hip the public transportation and not so much being in the car and like that
yes
You feel more and besides, I don't know well in Mexico is my whole family, all my friends
But, how's the music scene in Mexico?I mean, I know they come out with good bands but the question is, how many of them start and don't make it?
The problem in Mexico is that everything is super centralized dude,
Sure
I mean there are only two group that stick And there's only one singer that
sure
that they support
yes,
I mean there's only one thing And well here, there is more support but the competition is much more fierce
Sure
and then the truth I see it the same. There in Mexico I know many people in the medium which that helps me a lot
and you have contact? contacts like to record and producers and all those things
Well, I produce my own stuff, so I know many people there
Mm
And now, that I'm about to print my first record
Oh, really nice
Then, yes, I mean, I'm doing that alone, all of that
yes
But I do know many people in the media that can help me
But, it's alternative pop, like Thalia
No, it's more alternative
Oh, nice
yes, no
well,
yes, yes. I would send you a website, for you to listen, and then you can give me your opinion
yes, I would love that, it would be nice, and can I write you back?
yes, yes
If you send me the page
yes, I can send you an email
yes, Nice
with a link and the page, then you can check that and you can write me back
Cool, cool
Ah, well, how nice that I met you dude,
yes, now yes, perhaps we are In, when we are there in New York perhaps we'll go see you when you play
aha, you come here a lot?
No, no, really I've never gone, ah, I've only been here nine months
And, okay
And in March, last year And well, I was taking exams
okay
And those things, I never had time to travel But I want to
ah, well, you should take a trip
yes I want to visit New York everybody tells me that it's beautiful And well eh,
yes, it's fun
But I also have to travel to DF, I have a friend, a very good friend of mine eh, Argentinian that lives over there
there are a lot of Argentinians right now, it's incredible
yes, and many actors
A lot of them emigrated aha
She, she, her boyfriend is an actor
okay
And she says there are a lot of Argentinian actors.
yes, it's incredible the amount of Argentinians that are in the DF
yes
Impressive
There were even soap operas with main actors in the soap operas that were Argentinean
yes, yes, They're a bit better looking than the
They change their accent
They're better looking than the Mexicans So they stay
No, they Mexicans are good looking too
But, well in general the Argentinians are better looking
But don't you hate the Argentinians a bit?
how?
Are you not a bit mad at the Argentinians?
Well some Mexians eh What happens is that I think that like they are taking many jobs from the Mexicans And the Mexicans well it's not like we're doing so well, to tell the truth
yes Sure
So some people are bothered bt I studied in a school where there were so many Argentinians Over there in Mexico, aha
what?
I mean like all my life I've been with, I have had Argentinian friends
Sure
Like that, I feel that
And you never, and they never bothered you
Well no eh,
that's good, because I've heard many jokes of Mexicans, I mean in Mexico Jokes about Argentinians
Oh sure, I do know that, I do know that.
And it's pretty weird because I used to travel to Brazil a lot and I never had any problems, no  one in Brazil did anything to me because of my Argentinian origin but when I went to live to Israel.
Everybody hated the Argentinians.
In Israel too
yes, well, not all the Israelis, no, the Hispanics, Hispanics hated the Argentinians, I couldn't understand why.
Hey
yes, I never had any problems in Brazil, nobody said anything to me
And there are a lot of Hispanics in Israel
yes, a lot, there were many from Mexico, what happens is that sometimes it's like a trend, but sometimes there are this youth movements
And they all go to live there
mhm
The Jews in Mexico have a lot of money so, I don't know, the ones
Okay but in general, the Hispanic Jews well
yes, yes, yes of course, they also go live there, they are immigrants and those people, I  mean I'm an immigrant too, its like they have a different ideology
Hey but you, being a Jew, if you go to Israel you can
oh,
Work and do all kinds of things, right?
yes, yes, we the Jews, we have ah, it's like a law, I mean, Israel has the Law of Return, which means that all Jews can go back to
Israel and apply for citizenship, oh,
Oh wow
So, it's really cool, because when when you start at the 19 and you don't have any money, I left when I was 19 years old, and I didn't had any money
But that support you and they pay you University for three years
And you studied there?
Well, yes, they help you, yes
Wow
And so, it was really good for me
it's really cool
But, well, that depends on people, I for example, wasn't around Latins that much, but between Latins is a lot of hate
I see
there was a lot of hate, with Argentina
Hi, Good day
Hi
Hi, Good afternoon, my name is Carolina
Hi, My name is Miriam
Oh, how are you Miriam?
How are you?, and where are, where are you calling from?
From New York
From New York, okay, I'm in Toronto, Canada
Oh, that's nice
Yes
Mmm
And, about the question, the topic, well
Justice
What's your opinion, miss, about justice
Well, as they say, here in Canada, in Justice, I imagine that in Canada
it's the same, They find a jury of 10, 14 people to select a case, and then you are called, from the area
Yes,
from the circlair office, and you have to go, I have been called like
Oh wow
two times, two chances, but when you get there, they have to select, I remember some opportunity, Am I hearing some noise back there or is it?
Sorry?
the, what was, did you hear a noise behind you?
yes, yes, it's my son who's fighting with the other.
Ah, yeah yeah
Yeah, big son.  Oh.
yes, em, so what they do here is the select the jury, to be able to qualify.  So for example the time when I went, I was working in an insurance company.
So I, I wasn't qualified.
Aha.  And why would an insurance company not be qualified?
Well sure, because like, since I worked for an insurance company, it wasn't good to choose me, because I already have
let's say, I know a lot about a person, how treating us and what we say in the case, i worked for insurance of, of houses.  So, for example, if
someone lived in a house, and I went there, well we always had to
Aha
try to tie up and try to
yes yeah
eh, it wouldn't clean the case.
Aha, aha
So if one already had a compromise, some profession that hid something, then they took you out.
Oh, I see, I see Oh
yes for example, also, the other opportunity, the second time I was working for a nursing company.  And they didn't accept me either.
Oh neither you have your
Mm no, I mean, it depends on what work you do, to qualify for insurance.
Oh, oh, I see
For me, for the jury.
For the jury, aha wow
and, the truth is, I'm going to tell you, I wouldn't want to be part of a jury, that's the truth, oh, it's a bit hard.
Mm, I think so
They are made up of fourteen people, so, they all have to reach a decision, I'd rather don't. As of now, I have a problem with
um, the court because my son was murdered.
Oh mam, I'm so sorry.
Yes, oh, it had just turned six months and you know, that if they catch the guy who did it, they'll sentence him but if they don't, they don't.
But, they've destroyed my life.
Sure, I can see that.
they've destroyed the life of my whole family, I think I will  never be the same person again, they've completely changed my life.
Oh
And that bastard, he's a drug addict, he's nineteen years old.
Aha, aha
so, um, he apparently tried to rob my son and oh, my son refused and so, he
That's even worse
he had a gun and he ended his life in a second.
Oh no, that's so horrible! So, do you, in your personal experience, believe that there's no justice?
I don't think so because, you know, I've worked as a translator too, for the courts.
Aha.
and one of my friends used to work at children's court
Yeah
And one of my friends, she had to witness a sad case in which the husband took a girl from her mother, but the father, he was a white cop and she was Hispanic.
So, he had a lot of influence, eh
Oh
He had lots of money, he would use his influences so that she'd look like trash.
Oh
So, just imagine, she, her seven year old girl, was taken from her, they took her.
But, in, in the United States, I've heard that this happens a lot, you see, I'm going to tell you something, in Canada, we do have things like that happening but they hide them
It's a bit more democratic, still.
Eh, hm mm
But, the Canadian system is getting corrupted.
Mm
However, if a newspaper finds out about it, oh yes, or if they know that a judge had favored someone.
Oh sure, yes.
But
There's no justice, no, I  mean, the truth is that, I say, my son is going to rest in peace when the man that killed him is trialed, no
Just imagine, I
Ah yes
as a mother, the only thing I ask for is justice.  I ask for the Lord to make justice.
And
And that this scoundrel, that they end his life, that they kill him, no.  That he pays for
That he pays, sure
that he pays from year to year no.
Sure, because
Uh, and another thing that they have here, imagine, that justice is this, that this was a boy who wasn't more than nineteen years old.  My son already was twenty four.
Oh, a young boy.
So yes, and you know that, this guy
So
imagine that they give him twenty five years.  So imagine, when he gets out, he will get out at forty five.
Sure
He's still a young man, no.
And, and,
And he will get out and return to doing the same, who knows.  Because you know
And will get out to screw for the time he was isolated.
because they say that there, in the prison is makes you worse, no.
yes well imagine, no, they don't give rehabilitation.
Exactly, and no.  After is he behaves well,
There against
I think he can get out in seventeen years.
I can imagine
And I say, and get out in seventeen years for what, to go out and kill someone else.
Aha oh
No, to finish, because don't you see that they are raised with that hate inside, no. And who knows how it is really. I don't know.
What a shame, right, yes.
I only ask for justice. I hope although he already confessed that yes, that he killed  him. But he comes, that guy comes from a family of killers,
his brother is another killer.
Ah really
the father is a drug addict, the mother is
He has to be human, I mean, right
his I mean, that, it's really a family unfortunately of
You have to, what a shame that one crossed his path and no, God God doesn't punish
imagine. Imagine if
And was he your only son ma'am?
my only son, because I have a daughter too.
Ah, what a shame.
But, you know that for me to have my son I suffered so much,
Aha
because I had many problems, and I always said that he, no, oh, my child and, and the truth, I loved him so much that everyone told me that I gave to much love to my son,
Oh, no.
Because he was all to me. And besides the child was very lovely.
Hm
He was a boy but, imagine, he told me, I got divorced when my son was three, and I never married again
Aha
And I have lived only for my children, I never brought a man to my house, and nothing.
Aha
And I have worked, I gave them the best well, I always took them to Catholic schools and tried to gave them the best no. And then, so, but my son was a very lovely child, a very good one.
He was with a girl around six years, they want to marry, but them two were at college. Imagine that the girl was completely destroyed.
Also, of course, what a shame.
Eh, her family loved so much my son. So may lives my son has touched. Well everybody tell me that he was an angel, because the truth as he was my son, and the way he is remembered, it is
incredible, no. Then
I am sorry, Madam.
oh, imagine, you don´t know.
The only thing that could, the only I could tell you is to take refuge in God. At knowing him, you are going to
And, and, I pray a lot, I ask so much to God
so much, so much
I tell you he knows why he did it, to take my son in that way. In a, imagine. And well, so, what am I going to do, but until know I cannot believe my son is death, I tell you.
Oh God
It is but
my, how sad, how sad
It's very hard, very hard, and, yesterday was six months that they took him away from me.
Six months, aha
and to me it seems that well, it just happened yesterday. Because people say with time it passes, it will never pass.
No, never, never
For me that is
Sure
vivid, vivid
Yes, how do you call it, you
I always remember the moment in which they came to give me the news, and today
my God, how horrible, how horrible
and yes, I mean that, I don't wish that on anyone.
No, definitely.
But there I go, you know, praying, and how it says like the
Do you go to church ma'am?
yes, I go to church, I
Sure, find refuge there and you will see that
Hm mm
you will find comfort reading the bible, is very
yes, I think that only for believing so much in God and for having faith in God is why I'm alive.  Because I, my first moment was
I imagine
when I wanted to died together with my son.  And I'll tell you that now, before I said, aye, I don't want to die.  Now I say, yes, my God, I've given my life to the Lord.
And I say, Lord, save me to go to find my son, because I think that my son is calling for me
Yeah
because I always live with the thought of him, in my person.
Yeah, sure, sure.  What a shame, my God, my God.
And you know, no, but on the other hand I also think about my daughter
yeah
Poor thing I say, what will become of my daughter.
She's younger?
yes, my daughter, well, she's already twenty two.  But she's studying at college, she's a girl
But you have to be strong for her, because, because imagine your daughter, losing her brother, and then if you don't get better,
hmm
she'll lose her mom too, this would be really hard for her.  She will only fail if you
yes well
if you weaken
hmm
because now she's in college you say, she needs to be strong
Hmmm
To move forward in their studies
Yeah, well
Otherwise she, she would fall into perdition, who know's, the pain would be too hard for her
Uh huh, yes
Yeah, so, you know, get strong
Uh huh
grow stronger and, and keep getting shelter in God and
Oh yes
and that everything goes, to help her, to help her in her pain
Uh huh
It's an irreparable pain. To me, an irreparable mistake, never, no one will ever
Uh huh
No one will ever be able to replace that, but, can you imagine
Oh
That's a shame lady, so, what do you think?, what, you say there's no human justice, god's justice, do you think it exists?
Well, God's justice, i think so, because they say that sooner or later
Right, uh huh
Uh, right?, uh, God, like they say, God squeezes but doesn't suffocate, right?, so i think that some day, well, if not human justice, well, it will have
because that's what's a shame, right?, all the bureaucracy there is, and, and when the judges sell themselves, imagine that
Different
and I already tell you that, how they took from my friend, her daughter and
Yeah
and imagine, and she who's a good woman. The man is rotten, who has even abused but with him, with the power of money, forget it.
The power of money is more powerful than anything.
It's true, it's true. Yes
yes
Honestly, I stopped believing in the human justice a long time ago.
Oh me too
I've also sought refuge in God.
Oh
Because already you see too much injustice, too much corruption. In, in I'm from Peru. And in
