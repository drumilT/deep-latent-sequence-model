yes
I don´t think such a thing we could call perfection could exist.
yes, I agree
now if we are going to talk about perfection we are well we are talking basically okay the perfection at a human level does not exist.
yes
and starting from that it is the system eh fair of the Unidet States of the fair justice well
the jury system, right.
of course no the jury system and wow, it is an area I don´t know so much, I I don´t know honestly if the system that choose a jury
is appropriated no no
yes
no really I don´t know Nicky the only thing I know is that sometimes I have heard it there are eh people that do that work
yes
those are who choose the members of the jury right, I don´t know if I have that was what I heard
yes yes yes I the the system I agree, I think that nothing is perfect is like asking if democracy is perfect and
I think that things like that, systems like that not a hope like I say I am an idealist I think you always try to improve it and have
of course
and it has problems, and I do think that there have been many innocent people who have gone to jail, the same way that there have been criminals
who have been set free, who have been found innocent in the system, the jury system. I would love to do it, to do it, like you know, like my duty, but I do know it's not perfect
sure
the system they have here for the selection, often they are chosen by seeing the attorneys from both sides and for instance if they are looking for, if it is a crime of a man who is
let's say, he works harvesting grape
yes
for instance, I don't know, and he is been accused of killing somebody and he hardly speaks English and he wants to say that he was not in such place
often the state attorney won't bel-, he won't accept jury members who are grape harvesters, he won't accept people from the country of the man, he won't accept
people or men who work as farmers in general, while the other side will look for people who work as farmers, right? because they will understand
the job, if he says no I was working for twelve hours and one says how is that possible
yes
he can explain well I understand, life is hard in that month or whatever, right? and that is the problem because often the two attorneys fight about it
and what happens often is that it ends up being a jury of the people they want, people who have no prejudice of such
industry or such place, and often are found juries in which no member is from such place
ah
and that can be a prejudice, I have seen, yes there have been times for instance when it's an Hispanic the accused
the state attorney will try to pick people for the jury who are not hispanic, and althoug hhe knows that is illegal
because it's a prejudice after all, but this practice does happen, and that is unfair too because you'd like to choose people who can understand
in general, without prejudices, but can understand in general, how does that person work, and they can be what they call objective, although I don't think that is possible
and things like this
oh but you know, you are so right, so right, what you're saying is so right, like going back to the example that you just gave, eh
someone that doesn't know about it, for example the man you say grows grapes
yes
how is one expected to be on a jury if you don't know the issue, this man, and I don't know anything about, for example, growing grapes.
and all that doesn't seem too just in my opinion, right? You are right, you are so right, yes
yes, yes but at the same time that's the system they have, they'd tell the judge that you are a perfect candidate to be on that jury because they want people that
handle both sides and they are going to explain the issue in a basic way so that anyone can understand it, they know we don't know everything about the world, right? they would want to have people than can't be
impressed, that they can clearly understand the issue and you'd be perfect for it because you've got no prejudice, you don't know, you are not a spy and no one in your family has that same job
and then you could see both sides of the story, I understand both sides, unfortunately, its a burden that I, as a lawyer, have to carry because I have to pay attention to both sides of an argument.
and then of course, well that's why you are a lawyer, that's your job but it's so interesting, well, as I tell Nickey, it's the first time, he had never had a chance
yes,
he speaks to people when I get this calls, maybe it's the same for you, people with different professions but no
yes, yes
I had never spoken to a lawyer
yes, yes
well, eh, it's very interesting, this subject is so interesting.
but, do you think that for example, the system, most of the time, do you have a similar system in your  country Argentina?
is it, I don't know, a fair system?
well
when someone is found guilty I'm sure that's part of justice or is it something like, I've seen that in this country, sometimes money influences the decisions.
oh, of course, of course, it does affect, and well, in Argentina
yes, good night, this is Patricia, who am I talking to?
Good Night, this is Nancy, Patricia, how are you?
Hello, Hello Nancy, where are you from, where do you live?
I'm from Colombia and I live in New York
I see, I'm from Panama and I live in Delaware.
mhm
What do you think about the justice system Nancy?
Well, I don't really agree with it. They make mistakes, and then, they create more injustice
Exactly, they should really stick to the "justice is blind" quote, right?
mhm
But, apparently, obviously, if you have money, you get the chance to have better legal representation unlike if you are poor.
yes, if you don't have money, you don't have money to pay for a lawyer.
Exactly, so you better say goodbye, you forget about the issue.
If you get a public defender it's not going to be the same, mhm
And for example, you notice this from what is shown in television, oh, the proof of that is that ninety per cent of people that are in jail, at leas in this country,
they are, minorities, people of color or Hispanics.
yes, that's right
Sure,
they say it isn't that way, it's
No, they don't have money to, to hire an expensive lawyer.
yes
Have you ever been in a jury, here or in Colombia
No, I haven't been, never
Oh, you know
never and I would not Aguirre because, judging someone and someone you really don't know, and you try to know it
in the time the trial last, no
Not only that, but they say that is a jury of your peers
Mmm
no
yes
And for example, we have seen, for example in the last Michel Jackson case
Mmm
None of the juries was like him
No
none is like him
Sure, and they took the decision, that supposedly
Exactly, exactly, for
was the right one
For me, I thought that was the more political, the same happened with OJ Simpson, when he killed a woman in California
yes, the same was, innocent
Exactly, everyone, everyone knew he was guilty,
He didn't commit anything, hmm
And and well, for political pressure, social pressure, the man is now free.
Yes, because, money,
When they, when they found him guilty in the civil trial, that her parents brought against him.
yes.
How is it that in one trial you're innocent, and in the other you'll be guilty of the same crime.
yes, either you're guilty or innocent at the same time.
Exactly, so it's not the fact of guilt or innocence, but this trail taught us that the card called, eh, How do they say it in Spanish?  eh,
eh, reasonable doubt.
that the hmm
Where, where the only thing the lawyers have to say, and they don't have to demonstrate that their clients are innocent, they only have to plant it in
the minds of the jurors,
That, ah
reasonable doubt, and that's it.
And ready, ah, he's ready to get out.
And ready, everything was ready, exactly.
yes because
how many people are getting out now who are innocent with these new DNA tests
yes
the ADN, they have now realized that many people that have been put to jail are innocent. They have killed many who are innocent
Let me tell you, let me tell you, I served a jury when I lived in Florida
mhm But
And to me, to me it was an exhausting experience, it left my nerves very altered, and I am not a nervous person
yes
It was about a guy, the police had made a raid in the house where he was at that moment
mhm
because he sold stone
precious stones?
no, stone, stone he sold drugs
ah
So the police did that raid and he was there at that moment, he didn'y live there
Oh, it was a coincidence
So, not coincidence, no, so, eh, they made them enter the bathroom one by one to search on them, to see if they had any weapons or drugs
and when the finisehd searching on this one they found a piece of rock, beside his shoe
mhm, but beside it, not
Beside, not inside. Beside, and there had been other people before him
aha, aha
that had been searched on, so there was no relevant evidence that it belonged to him, that it came out of his shoe. Because nobody had actually seen it
We let him go free
mm
although we knew the man was guilty, because he no, if you are in a house where there are those sorts of activities, is because you're in it, you see.
yes when there's something illicit and one stays, well,
Exactly, when there's smoke there's fire.
is as guilty as, mm
But that there were no concrete proofs, and also because you hear a lot about police abuse that they do and undo whatever they want.
yes because is terrible
We let the guy go free, we acquitted him.
yes
And the only thing they were going to give this man was jail, they weren't going to kill him, or nothing, just simply jail.
Look for me to
yes they were going to, to punish his,
they did, they were just going to take his freedom away, they weren't going to sentence him to life,
his guilt
Nor anything drastic like that.
mm
and it wasn't going to be the first time that this guy would be in jail, neither, he wasn't a saint.
oh God, he had two previous records.
Look girl, I'm going to tell you that after making that mistake of freeing that man. When they let us leave, I sat in the first seat I found and sat and cried like a cry baby.
I can't explain to you why, I don't know if it was the stress of thinking, that the well being of another person was in my hands.
hmm without knowing the family of this person who,
Exactly.
who went,
Without knowing the circumstances, so I also started to think, well, if this man doesn't care about his personal circumstances, because they are important to me.
hmm
Well, I really feel this kind of person that I am.  No, I'm not going to judge anyone, or scold anyone,
yes but,
without being,
sure,
it's, exactly.  And it's a really really big responsibility that you imagine if they call you, a, Judge like in the crime of the wife of OJ Simpson, can you imagine this?
I imagine that you would tear your hair out every day from
Crazy, you go crazy.
and to agree.  there's when
Exactly, because then there are twelve people who have a ment- a different mentality, who have all come from different cribs.  And in their houses they were taught different things,
so they have to get to a mutual agreement.
and this is the big, let's say, more lasting to, to have everyone make the same decision, no.
Exactly, and I understand them because, the future of another human being is in your hands, it's huge.
And you don't know from here to tomorrow if someone is guilty, in reality, yes.
It's huge, girl, and you don't know, you don't know what tomorrow will bring.
aha yes because you don't know,
But if you think about it, the children, about all the things that they might have thought about.
mhm, you sometimes feel that you are there and,
No, but I, I did, yes, I believe that in a jury, oh a jury would be more convenient than just having a judge decide.
yes
No.
yes, you can take
With a jury, for example, okay, maybe those people are not in your same economic, social or educational circumstances. But, at least, they have to convince the twelve of them.
If you have a chance to, to, if you reach, or if you can convince one
Exactly, exactly. Specially if you know you are innocent.
mhm
But you can't prove it.
yes, that's the problem. I think that when you are there, looking at the person, you can see it in their eyes.
The other days.
yes, you'd notice it, isn't it?
You can't, I don't know honey, well I just know that the guy that we had to trial
Look at that person,
he was a first-level criminal, he couldn't hide it even if he would wear a bag over his head. No matter how you'd dress him, he'd still look like a gangster.
you could see that he was guilty, well.
mhm mhm
Oh God, but it's,
She had a terrible face, but well, That day she was saved
yes, but, who know more now?
A no girl, that's karma, you see
yes, they become more grumpy
And sooner or later, sooner or later, if you keep that, in any bad thing you are, that reaches you
yes, they say justice goes, but it arrives
Celestial justice, sure
Justice, yes
Casually I was looking the other days, a show, I really like to see forensic medicine
yes
and they were broadcasting a show about a wife and the husband was sentenced for killing his mother in law, and rape his nephew
And the eight year old nephew was the one he raped
yes
and well, at the end, 7 years later, and the wife didn't gave up because he knew his husband was innocent
And the women was able to get another trial
Other trial
because, DNA was more advanced
yes
And the kid change her opinion and admitted it wasn't her uncle
Oh, God
rather a different person, and after seven years rotting in jail, knowing you haven't done a thing.
I can just imagine the bad things they'd do to you in jail, too.
Exactly. That for example in this country, which doesn't happen in our countries, in this country, if they wrongly convict you and later a jury finds there was a mistake made
and the evidence is in your favor, they'll pay you for all of those years that, that you wrongfully spent in jail.
uh huh
in our country, they don't worry about that.
they tell you see you later get out.
yes exactly exactly if they even do that, right.
yes yes yea that happens a lot
But, but I do believe, I do believe juries are good, are good, a good idea.
yes, I don't know some day it'll be my turn, I think that I'll think, the, about someone's family.
You know, you know how they choose you to be on a jury.
No
When you vote.
Hello?
Hello, Aurelio
How are you? Manuel, I'm in Orlando, Florida.
Oh. How are you? Me from here, from Washington -DC
Ah, Hi, mister Aurelio? Well, so, let's get into it
What's your name, again?
eh, Manuel.
Manuel, nice to meet you, Manuel.
Nice to meet you, getting into the subject, well, eh, I hear you.
Ah, well, I tell you, and, they have never, picked me for a jury, because I'm not, yet, an American citizen.
Correct.
And, but they have picked my wife already several times, and also a lot of my friends, have been picked many times. And sometimes, I tell you, the
Right.
eh, the cases that they, I mean, that they have dealt with, it's absurd.  They are things that I say, ah, my God.
These people are spending money in such absurd cases.
True.
A horrible thing. People lose work, hours from work, the judges have to be paid, they have to pay the lawyers. I mean, it's a horrible thing, for some cases that are, that don't deserve so much.
So much paraphernalia.
Exactly, yes. Is too much, is too much, yes, yes. No yes. Have they picked you as,
Well, no, look I coincide with you. The exact same thing happened to me, they summoned me once, but I'm still not a citizen. So then, automatically, well,
it was disabled to accept.
Sure.
That was in New York, because I lived in New York a few years. Em, well never again. Ah, oh, regarding what I think of the system, well,
I would say that, that it's good. But, I didn't know the truth, as you just finished telling me, is that, that there was, that they were, well, eh, eh, em,
doing all these paraphernalia for very silly cases.
Sure.
I thought that it was only for cases of homicides, or more serious cases.
No, they do it for any type of case. The last case that, that arrived, that my wife, ah was called for, was a case about a guy,
of a, this, British, by the way, eh that gave the finger, there, to a woman, in traffic.
Oh.
imagine. yes, yes, man. The woman took him to court, and they sentenced him. He had to pay a fine of like,
I mean, for an obscene gesture.
exactly,
Oh, But how can it be? And all of us paying for that? Well, is that, look, what has been said, is a system that's already created,
many people live off it, I talk about the justice system.
Sure.
That it includes many things, not only the, the, the part of the prosecutors, the judges, also the jails. So then, they need people so they can continue, well, living that way.
Sure. Exactly.
It seems to me that, there I would fully agree with you. It's incredible that they are taking so much of our taxes for that, when a judge can perfectly have the preparation is obvious, logical
to, to decide that in, in half an hour.
Sure, man. Without so much bother, like they say over there, in there, in your homelands, I would imagine that you are Colombian, judging by the accent
yes, yes.
Exactly, without so much, so much mehollo, man. Because, look, the, the first thing they'll spend forever doing, like, take three hours to select the jury, one of them being my wife, they chose her finally
yes.
After the, the, the, the, let's say, the, the, the, the judge took about six hours deliberating. If it's one thing, if it's the other, that I just don't know, I don't know that, that maybe yes the man did it intentionally
what actually is an obscene gesture, what isn't an obscene gesture, that all depends on the, on the type of personality, over here and there. Total, they concluded that the guy was guilty of it
and they fined him, they put him in jail for two days, and a five thousand dollar fine.
Incredible, incredible. That, that was happening, you know.
An incredible thing, and I was just left in shock. I said, this can't be, these people
Incredible. But, but, that's, we run into each other quite a bit. But, yeah. We have the worst cases, that seem to me important. And what do you think eh, what, what?
What do you think, what's your take?
Ah, no, well yes me. It seems to me, it seems to me, for example, that case that was very relevant in ninety four, it's when I was
Ah, the, the, OJ Simpson, yeah.
that seems to me to be a case that is, that deserved that type of, of thing. Do you understand what I mean? Because it was a case, eh, supposedly, was relevant because the guy was famous. But,
Mhm, yeah
the guy
very controversial, yes.
exactly, including, homicides. You know what I mean. There, yeah, it's necessary that, that there be some sort of, let's say, deep scrutiny, you know. Something where they carefully evaluate all of the perspectives, and everything that had happened, yes that was deserving of that kind of thing.
But, listen, something like this,
Even though, ah, eh, there like, I am also fully aware of the jury's conscience, in serious cases even though here, eh, by what I've seen
it's very marked by the race factor. Don't you think?
Sure, of course.
Very, very marked by the race factor. And, in fact, already,
yes. Although they say that no, they say, listen, they always deny it.
ah, no, they'll never recognize it.
No, they deny it but up to when already nobody dares to say anything, no, yes, it's true, look, they found him guilty because he's black.
No, no, no, no.
Mm.
Eh, nobody dares to say that. But, if you hear the results, you see the things that happen on the television, you see, you hear the radio, the national radio, and all those types of things.
and, look, you can clearly see that, that there's still racism. And many of those decisions, they make them at a racist level.
yes, yes, it's true, and, and, well, and can operate on any sense. Because, to go back to the -OJ Simpson case, the race factor counted a lot, because the majority of the jurors, appeared to be black. And, look
he was acquitted, found not innocent, eh, I mean, not guilty.
Exactly.
when to everybody it was more than evident this man's guilt.
Sure. And that you, I remember all the eviden-
No, And what's more, because, the question that once somebody made, Well, and then, if it wasn't him, who, why did the investigation stop, why don't they continue, ah, investigating
Exactly. Aha.
until finding the guilty one
No, the guilty person was never found, is something
No, and things stopped there. I mean that, they, implied, they also concluded that he was guilty. But, they found him no
yes
So there was a also a racial factor there. but in the other sense, they favoured their race
Of course, sure
That's very complicated, very complicated, eh, eh, honestly, handling that. Specially with all the other things it implies, costs like you said, the, the, the
loss of money, for those who result, somehow, hidden
Sure, figure
Eh, because the companies won't always compensate for that. And what they recognize, well, it isn't much, I think
yes, yes, it's nothing, at all. A work mate was three days out of the job because of, of the so called jury duty. Mhm
But, anyway, the company I work in, I mean, paid her, I mean they treated her
Well, they were really supportive with her
yes, right. They treated her like if
But, but, probably almost any company does, because they are not obliged to it
Exactly, yes, that's right. Anyway, in this case, for instance, the Ameri-, sorry, my work mate, another case
not so absurd, but that wasn't so worthy after all. Itwas a drugs affair. A guy they caught with drugs and a whole lot of other things
So, then, they were deciding whether he was guilty or not. So, it lasted for three days, figure.
Oh
So, well, you know, shit happens. I mean, I think that people, people drowns in a glass of water. This is what I think, in this small cases
But tell me one thing, Miguel, what do you do int his country?
I am a journalist
Oh, really? Wow, how good
yes, yes
I am a musician, an opera singer
yes. Oh how nice. Look, I like opera, in fact, there in New York, I attended the Metropolitan some times
Oh, I see
and I saw, I saw Pavarotti singing some times
Oh, that's great. You saw him?
yes, when he was still in, that was in ninety-nine, I think, when he was still, well, active
Right, before he retired
Retired, right, eh. Good, ah, but, but, well, congratulations, but you, are you a professional singer?
yes, yes, ofcourse, yes. I
Oh, really? and you live in Washington?
yes, I used to live here in Washington, and well, I am working in a music school, I give classes there, and sing when I get hired to do so. I've just arrived from Italy two weeks ago
Really? oh, how good. Well, wow, congratulations!, really. I think it's very nice, a very nice profession
It is nice already, but also stressing, it's very, you have to do big sacrifices, you know what I mean?
yes, and I guess you also to, to take good care of your throat
Well not, you have to look after all yourself, not only the throat, you have to watch your diet, do exercise all the time
OK
yes, I mean, it's something, it's something global, it's not only the throat, you know what I mean? I mean
yes, yes
I, sometimes, see some singers around there who, do a lot of excesses, they just cover their throat and drink some beverages, but never exercise
Oh.
and no, let themselves do stupid things.  It's stupid, trying to take care of the throat without doing exercise.
Sure.
You open your mouth and you put the cake, you, all the time.  Exactly, yes.  Hey, and how long have you been in this country?
Eh, well, it's going to be nine years.
Ah, imagine.
I was in New York for a while, but unfortunately I couldn't with the climate, it's cold, well.  And I even loved the city.
Aha.
Eh, but the weather, well, no, it wasn't great for me, I had allergy problems and things, that degenerated into asthma
So, it was when the doctor, the specialist told me that I needed to find a warmer climate, and I came here to Florida, where my brother lives.
Ah, how nice.
I've been here for a year,
You're in Orlando?
in Orlando, yes.
Ah, hey, this is another thing, talking about the justice system, again, in this country, it's another thing, that in each state, each city, each county has its different things, manages things in a different way.
oh yes.  It's true.
yes.
It's so much that they even have extradition between states, No?
Exactly, yes.
And that this, well, it seems unusual, coming from a South American country, but, well.
Exactly, did you know that they just, something that just happened to my singing teacher, it's a whole thing that, that they just put here, it's new, it's in the city right now, in Washington
That you can't drive without an earpiece, an earphone, in the
Oh yes
cellphone, i think it's a very good thing
Very, it's very good, yes
I think it's a very good think, well, it turns out that my teacher, he got caught. He was on a traffic light and he was talking on the phone, so they caught him. It turns out the man forgot his wallet, he didn't even had his license
Oh
Damn, those things that happen, and when, when...
Yes
exactly, that, when something bad is gonna happen to you, it all happens at once. Well, the man was taken to jail and everything, six hours
and they had to contact someone to know that, because the problem is, he's called Russel
Oh, so, homonyms
And he's a more or less common man, so it turns out that there's also a Russel in the same area
Oh
that has more than two
Hello hi
Hello, Rodrigo's speaking! from,
From where?
from New York.
From New York, ah Ah How are you Don Rodrigo? this is Chong speaking from, from Well, from well I'm from Vancouver this is Columbia, but right now I'm calling from Toronto, Canada.
Okay
And how is the weather there in New York?
The climate?
aha
Quite cold.
Yes.
Yes. Cold, yesterday it was raining a rain storm with hail and now it's already normal.
Ah how nice. Also here in Toronto it's good it's normal, ah there's a lot of snow and a lot very cold but well that's how the season is of
of Christmas, of December and January Right?
It's always like that.
Yes. And I've heard well that New York is very it gets very nice in Christmas
Yes, yes is nice, a lot of people come here you know, The big Apple, they come from everywhere.
aha
But when one has been living here a long time, like one already gets bored.
aha, yes and there's a lot, I don't, don't know New York, I know well I know Chicago, I know several other cities in the United States. New York, that is
Before there was more, uh, more crime, more, uh, more danger, but now they say it's better, is it true or?
Yes, it has improved a little, but you know, you're never a hundred percent safe
Right
On the streets, there's always some danger, it also depends on the sector where you live
Right, and where in New York do you live?, do you live in Manhattan or?
In Manhattan
Right
Yes, do you know Manhattan?
No, well, i know it because i, well, i have heard on the radio and on TV that Manhattan is the best place in New York
but they say that, for example, there are places in Manhattan that if you go further than, upper, i don't know, the two hundred street or
We'll wait for you
But Brown [the Bronx] is part of Manhattan, right?
No, it's not
Right, but the places up from Manhattan, they're not so safe, are they?
Upper Manhattan
Excuse me?
Upper Manhattan
Right
Yes
They say there isn't as safe as the lower part
Yes, is true. Well but as I tell you, in all parts it has its pro and its cons and and sometimes one can be in the safest place, but when something is going to happen, is going to happen regardless.
Yes.
Yes, Listen and are you Colombian?
No, I'm Canadian but Mexican on my mother's side.
Your mom is Mexican and your Dad is Canadian.
yes
Oh, And you've lived all your live there in Canada?
Canada and I also studied and lived in Mexico
ah.
Well, sure Speaking of, of crime Canada is much more safe. In Mexico there's well, there's a lot of kidnappings, a lot, a lot of theft there in Mexico.
It's been like four or five years that I don't go to Mexico and they say the situation is worse now that there's a lot of, delinquency, a lot
Since the people, the people don't have work and want to make money, then what happens is that the important people, the people on television
That is related to show business they kidnap them,
aha
they kidnap them. And then they charge a ransom for them
yes
Yes.
just one thing happened to me, in the, in in. And where are you from?
Chile.
From Chile, Ah, there Do you know Mexico city?
Yes, the Federal District
Yes
Yes, I know
Yes, well, they stole my wallet there, one time I was in a truck, I didn't realize, I didn't realize until I was off the truck
And you didn't realize
No, I had it in my bag and in the backpack and I had the wallet inside, but when I got down the truck
The opened the backpack
I see
And they removed it without noticing myself
Oh, you didn't even noticed
No
Yes, it's dangerous, people is such a theft
yes, well
yes
And well, unfortunately, in those times I carried all my documents and well, I don't longer carry them with me, but I was carrying also, my birth certificate and
other documents with me, that I lost, so now, If I'm traveling or not, I don't carry anything with me, so
Just the Passport
Not even the passport, I carry the passport if, for example I'm traveling, i leave it in the Hotel, locked, but I don't carry it with me
And I just bring the credit card and that's id, It's easy, if you lost it, or you get mugged, you just call by telephone
they deactivate it
aha
And did they take a lot from your wallet?
No, they got about ten dollars, but it was the documents that, that caused me more problems.
When they take this.  Yes, when they take the documents, everything's more difficult
Yes Yes
Yes.  So, you haven't come to Mexico for a long time.
Sorry?
You haven't come to Mexico for a long time.
Yes, and also in Acapulco.  And I also, this time that I left Toronto I was driving passing through the United States getting to Acapulco.
Yeah.
And in all, all my, eh, where there's more, Where I traveled, more in the cities of the United States and
I was driving from Toronto to Acapulco I was also driving Tra-, eh, driving from Toronto to Washington, to Vancouver, and no, the truth, no, I've never had any of this
any problem, any danger
No, I've been living here in the United States for two years.  And thank God I've never had any problem either, I've never had a problem.  But I have friends who have had
eh, they had it.  The attacked one friend, the punched him and he died.  In Queens.  After leaving, after leaving a party.  To rob him.
aha
Yes, but not to me, I've been lucky.  These things happen at dawn at night when it's really late, only there,
you're exposed and something like this happens.
or leaving the clubs, well, this, almost, this almost
Yes.
I hardly go to bars and this things, maybe that's why I haven't had any problems
Of course, if you go to these discos, the clubs were a lot of people gathers
aha
And people drink. They drink one cup and anotehr one, and afterwards the problems start
yes
that's why I am always scared of that. But I think it is dangerous all over, also in Canada, Chile, Mexico, the UNited States, all over
it depends
Yes it depends, aha. Well we had, we used to have, I wonder if you heard that in the news, in Toronto there were a lot murders
ah eh We are having problems with guns now
No
And well, in the United States there are more, sure there are more guns in the United States than anywhere else, right?
Yes
But in Canada we haven't had that problem. Until lately, that the use of guns is growing, and crime as well
Listen, and is there a lot of people in Canada? I know many Chileans who live in Canada
Oh, yes. No I don't know many Chileans, but well, in Toronto and in Montreal and Vancouver there are, mm there are many Latin American people
Of course there are a lot of people from El Salvador, there are many many Salvadorean here in Canada
How do they manage with the language? because there one half speak English and the other half speak french, right?
Yes, well, in Quebec they speak almost only french, and in all the other places almost only english, and in Quebec
They don't want to speak or know anything about english. Well that's their problem, because they are trying to educate their children only in English
it's the kids that loose if they don't learn english. And in this world where English is the business language, and they speaking only french
Well, they, they're afraid that the French language is going to die and that's why they
They want to teach English
Right
And do you speak English and french?
No, no, i barely, i don't speak french. English and Spanish only, i have a girl, i hav-, uh, my daughter speaks the three languages
She studies and goes to a school where they teach her just, half a day in English and half a day in french. So she know how to speak English, French and Spanish.
It's multilingual
Yeah, yeah, well
That's good, That's good for the children, the more languages you speak the better, but sometimes it's a pressure too, that they want to put, uh
learn, very, very fast. While they're very little
Yes, yes, that's part of, but well, well, but, well, that's good because that helps them in, in their opportunities for life.
Yes, that's true
Yes
And you, is your wife also from, from Mexico?
Yeah, she's Mexican, well, and i, i don't, i don't, I'm no longer with her, but yes, she was Mexican
Oh, she's the Mexican
Yes, yes, Mexican, uh, one hundred percent

Ah, well.
Good evening, Patricia's speaking. Whom am I speaking with?
Hello, good evening, Ingrid. Ingrid from Philadelphia.
Hello, Ingrid. What country are you from and from
From Guatemala.
and are you in Philadelphia?
yes, And from what country are you?
I'm from Panama and I'm here in Delaware.
Ah
Next to you.
Ah, we are near.
What can you tell me about since you are in quite a big city, with a crime rate quite high?
Eh, well yes, eh here more than anything the news personally I've been here almost two and a half years
Mm.
and never by the grace of God nothing has happened to us.
Thank God.
No. Eh
Do you feel safe in the neighborhood you live in?
Eh. Well now I have like a month, a year of living here and I feel really safe, in other words that I can walk in the street peacefully
yes, me too.
with no problems, but when I had just moved to Philadelphia, where I lived in, no, I mean I got home at 5pm and didn't go out
I see
I mean I didn't feel safe
The neighborhood where I live is very very quiet. And the city is relatively calm. The only thing is that from time to time in what we call
the city's center, Downtown
Hmm. Hmm
from time to time things get wild, but that's once every five years. You hear about shootings and things like that, but generally they don't talk about us on the news
Mm
Hm. In my country, crime is very high because of unemployment.
I can imagine. I guess it's the same as Guatemala.
And the same must happen in Guatemala, exactly
Just like in Guatemala. Every time I, I mean, I don't even feel like going to Guatemala, I can tell you that. I don't feel like going because
Not me, I don't go that far
I'm scared
I don't go that far
I'm Eh
Uh. You simply have to be smart and know where you can go, and where you shouldn't go, and the time, what time can you be out if you're in a foreign city
yes, I don't know if it's the same in Panama, but my mom tells me
no?
that she goes in the public transport
Oh, Oh.
And do not ride with a gun
yes yes yes it has been known that in panama
gentlemen here
the thieves have gotten into buses and robbed everyone
Of course, well they take away the money and take away the clocks
there was a time
Sea
there was a time when Noriega had the power.
Mm
thieves used to break in the high-class restaurant
yes.
and left people without clothes wrapped in the cloth of the tables in the restaurant
yes, right?
because they even took the clothes.
It is very dangerous because you can get killed by a nonsense.
Then the youth of today gives me the impression that they are not afraid of anything.
the youth of today is not afraid of anything or anyone.
yes
they have no respect for God. Do not fear the police, or the repercussions of their actions.
yes.  Hmm.
I think that if you kill someone
Hmm.
well you should deserve the death penalty.
Sure, sure, sometimes it seems a bit exaggerated but as they say
Eye for an eye.
eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, exactly.
No, eye for an eye, exactly.
yes and
And especially crimes against minors.
Sure
These should be automatically eliminated and taken out of society because they simply don't belong in society.
yes, exactly, I don't believe in those who repent or this because
Or don't want to belong, no, no, not that they will repent.
like if they have the heart to do something bad like that, so it's very difficult that they can.
yes, and if you give them another opportunity, they will return and do it.
Sure Sure
I would like to see, for example, instead of spending so much money on war
Hmm.
I would like to see that they get more, that they train more police in the areas that need it to maintain order, to keep the family safe.
To keep children so that they are not a bad example for children, for example, with gangs and all that.
yes, and perhaps also invest a bit more in education and the, the
Education, exactly.
to people because lack of education is what also unfortunately throws people who are less educated, they are the ones who get into the
these acts of violence and robbery and eh
Look, I've suffered, I've suffered in Panama, I've suffered two robbery attacks, one was, I was struggling, pardon me, three
mm
But this was in Panama, eh, thank God it hasn't happened here, no one has stolen anything from me
Mm
But the simple fact that they came to attack me, I felt violated
Of course, of course.
you see?
Well, for me, just once.
And what it did to me, it made me very angry
yes
Not fear, it made me angry.
No, I, once in Guatemala, it was about twelve years maybe, eh, I remember that it was your life on public transport
the rear door was open, and I had my gold chains.
Mm
and that I don't even know why I was carrying them anyway
Hmm.
and when I don't know, like, when they didn't hurt me, damaged the one thing that I felt was something that fell
It tore.
that it was, well one of them had burst and when I went to see it was a few kids who were eight years old at most
That's what I'm saying.
and neither
that if, for example, there were more after school programs
Sure.
that the kids, for example, the dads and the moms who have to work, that kids, instead of being in the street, had more after school educational programs
Hmm
to teach them something, that the
sure.
police go to the schools.  No, they need a stronger presence
yes.  Exactly.
because they're going to do what they're going to do
Exactly.  Like they already start from
well, we have to do what we have to do to protect ourselves.
Sure.
And to me there's nothing that makes me angrier when I kill myself working to have the little I have for an asshole to come and take it from me.
Exactly.  Exactly.  And that
That upsets me.
That comes at least yes, in Guatemala that is more that their gold chain and it cost I don't know what fifty dollars just to say an amount
So that someone comes
they come and they sell it for five dollars.
imagine.
I mean is not even that they are going to sell it for a good amount but that they are going to give it away.
And also the people who lend themselves to buy those stolen articles.
Exactly, because because. Crime has two faces
Sure.
I also think that these, these hot shot executives
Mm.
that you see on television that steal millions of dollars
Mm.
those shouldn't be put in a minimum security jail. Those should be put with the rest of the killers
Of course.
with the rest of the rapists and with the rest of the drug addicts, put them there.
In other words everybody the same. Everything the same but for eh for the same reason for
Exactly.
because they have so much power
Thief, thief is the one that steals a toaster just the same as the one that steals five million dollars.
Sure.
A thief is a thief.
Exactly, but like this how these people can buy
And everybody should be together. Well, so. That's the system
the other employees
judicial. That's another fifty dollars.
exactly Sure
But, the crime is a crime, that you break the law it doesn't matter how or how much you break the law. You should be treated the same
as all the other criminals that did the same thing.
exactly.
The same with these Catholic priests that molest kids
the same, exactly.
those they should put with the rest of the
I mean, eh that is
so they know so they pay
Sure, that's eh
their crime.
at the same time they commit the crime the church is also committing it by covering it up
Exactly
because because they should pay is that more because one trusts the church with the eyes closed.
A child rapist A child rapist is a child rapist Whether he has the cassock or not.
Sure. And especially those people who are
That's like the toaster and the five millions. Exactly. They are people that you
trust so much
trust. Exactly. That know your most intimate secrets.
exactly, I mean sometimes not even their own parents know of the fathers I mean fathers of family know everything like these people
Mm, Mm, Mm.
And, and well, I'm not like that but there are people that I mean stick their hands in the fire for a priest, they give them their kids
without Ah any question
Ah, yes.
and and for these people to abuse like that they should pay
That's already ignorance. That's already ignorance.
Sure.
But I agree that they should put them with the rest of the ones that have committed the same crime put all of them in the same jail.
yes, yes. exactly.
And I bet you that like that
Exactly.
the next time, if there is a next time, they'll think twice.
yes. And another thing is when minors commit horrible crimes or
Of adults, exactly.
I mean, to me, there shouldn't be that because he's a minor, he's going to be judged differently
No, no, no, no, no, if you're a minor and commit an adult crime, well, you should be tried as an adult
like, exactly
Because if you had an adult mind to do something like that, to form a concept
Uh huh
like that, well, then you must also have the mind of an adult to accept
Right
your
and in
your punishment
And imagine that if when young, if they do such terrible thing when they're young, when they're adults, they'll be worse
Imagine that, when they're twenty one, girl
Um
They're gangsters
Right, right, and if they don't get punished, well, there's the example for other young ones like this one who did this terrible thing and didn't got punished, so I'll do it and what are they gonna do to me?
Exactly. Well, I'm gonna do the same, exactly
Exactly
And there are a lot of kids that know that with that excuse, since they are less than seventeen years, they know that the law protects them in some states
Um
That they only send them, they first send them to a rehab camp
Mm.
And second when they turn eighteen they close those criminal files
Mm.
that if at twenty they commit a crime is not known because those files have been sealed.
Sure that no well
That it doesn't show that there's recidivism.
Mm. I mean he can come, kill someone and and then continue with a normal life.
Exactly.
that that is not fair.
He turns eighteen here nothing happened
Ah.
Well here something did happen.
Mm.
But it already seems, I get the impression that the majority of the states are changing that and already if you are a minor
yes. and commit an adult crime yes, they will sentence as a. Yes, I already see that is changing a lot.
Well, yes that's good. How good so that one feel a little safer
Exactly. And so others see that the law doesn't protect them for being a minor
Sure in changing, in changing the law is like that.
in Philadelphia you see it, in Philadelphia
In changing the law is like that. You're not simply punishing the ones that already did it but you're also instilling more fear in the ones that are thinking about doing it
they're giving them a warning.  Exactly.  Now if you want to go crazy and do the same thing, well, it will come to this.
You'll pay.  hmm.  Yeah.
You'll pay, exactly, because you know the repercussions of your actions and what they will be, and if I go crazy, well I will wait that they find me as a crazy person.
Hello
Hi good evening
Hello, how are you? My name is Juan
My name is Carmen and I live in Miami. Where are you?
oh, I am in San Antonio, Texas
oh, Txas, plesaed to meet you, yes
aha, yes, How do you do?
how do you do? fine, thank you very much, no,I just
working? washing the dishes
no, no, I just got home eh, I'm free already, and then I thought I would have the last bite when suddenly you called AND I thought, well
aha aha
if I have finished I answer, otherwise I just wait until later
yes, right, that's alright Carmen, it's fine, I am very pleased to meet you, specially with this subject
What are you studying?
I don't study any longer, I would like to study again, but no
you study any more, sure
maybe next year or so. Are you studying?
that's great. And how is San Antonio for ..? no, no, I am already an old lady, I am working
aha
yes, no I already studied all I had to study
well, me too, well, I didn't finish to study all that I could study, but I'm not studying since some years ago
mm I see
Listen, I have, well, I have heard a lot aboiut crimes in Miami, how about that? is it true?
yes, well, there is crime, I mean sometimes when I listen to the news I think that there are other cities that have bigger problems
aha
but I think that no city, no matter how small it is, is free of, I mean no city is free of crime, at no
aha
level, because there are all sort of crimes
that's right, but I get the impression that, talking about crime, that most of the murders are related to
related to drug affairs. Drugs, right? the cartels, the mafia, right? all that
well I think that can be very related in some cities, there may be a very close link
yes right
just look ,I've been surprised lately because, at least of the little I know about the news,
I see a lot of family violence
oh, that's important, see
yes, the husband kills the
yes
sons and the wife who, for instance this morning I heard that two women appeared dead
aha
and they were the daughter-in-law and the mother in law
ah
I mean that, that it seems one of them killed the other and then committed suicide. and it seems that it all was because of family problems, of nature, related to domestic violence
aha
then that really shocks me a lot it particularly shocks me a lot because but I think that the basis of everything a lot of time is the loneliness in which the kids are raised
the lack of affection ah
yes
many things, right
yes, yes probably it has a lot to with that way in which the person is educated in such a way that well that of domestic violence well they are people, well I also imagine that don't have a good education to deal with the issues, right.
yes
so then they hit each other, they hurt each other, they scream at each other and they have no rational way of getting through the problems, right
problems and after they hit the first time, after they hit the first time if one of the two people
yes, it could be that
doesn't solve the problem that increases that starts increasing right it increases
exactly, look that here that also happens, here in San Antonio
then mm
The majority of the violent crimes are related to this that you say, the domestic violence.
yes
and also with the drugs
ah well but is that
both, yes that does happen here, right.
tell me, are you so close to the Mexican border?
eh eh hundred fifty miles
that's close, right
yes, very close
well, I won't say that, I won't say that you have a great influence there because probably it will be controlled, but like the cartels in my country, Colombia,
aha
have used all those countries in Central America and the Caribbean and South America
aha
to, to
pass the drug
exactly, so, one way or another everybody has been affected
yes, yes, exactly, that's what I was going to say, they are entrance doors, they are very important distribution centers of drugs, the problems between cartels, competition
and where there is a bad done business
between them cause, probably, the kind of vendettas they have among them
yes sure
you can't even imagine it from the outside, they fight for a shipment, they rob each other, they kill each other and things like this, no
you can imagine, but you never, never
so
never realize how much violence is used, because when
aha
when they do it when they give the order to kill somebody or do it is like they do it like if, like if they were taking revenge on the person they kill
yes exactly, they are being billed accounts
impressing
and they have their language, their language that tells for example when the person is being killing because he betrayed someone then they have a way to left a clue to show the reason of the murder, they don´t have codes
yes, yes
no for example I don´t know, they kill them and cut their tongues
or the hands or the fingers or
then that is a sign, hmm
or they kill all the family or the closest relatives and left him alive or they tie them I don´t know how many things they do
yes there is always a message, right
yes, yes, yes
then here in the San Antonio case that is what more happens
hmm
that kind of crime related or not with the frontier it must happens everywhere, right
yes
is nothing more than the drug which is,as bigger the city, well
and many
it is important the place and the fights
yes and many young people gets involved in that kind of violence
in
of crimes
yes you already know that yes, yes, yes
yes, many young people, yes
yes is the young people, no
that's the worst, no
ah yes almost, always are the young people
yes, look, sorry, sorry to interrupt you, in Colombia there was a time  when
and
those people that were into the drug businesses in one way or another eh, the comment, what people would say is that
that no one got to forty, in other words forty years old was already an old age
aha
for the people that were involved in those businesses
yes
because in one way or another he who didn't end up in jail could be considered up to a certain point lucky
aha
eh ended up in, in the cemetery.
yes in fact and many say I'd rather live ten good years than fifty bad ones, no
yes, yes
that is then well yes, look in our countries there aren't many jobs is the only way that the young people see like the only way to make a living
alternatives, alternatives
a good income, eh, no, exactly, which obviously, you know, you don't ussally think about when you are young
mhm
you live the moment, and many fall into it because they can't think on the long term
sure
it is not all the short term, and also what we said a while ago, in education it is very important, in school
they don't teach you how to take long term decisions, if it is not practised in the family, then the short term things, immediate, are the ones that affect you more, right?
right
you can't, they are the most important at that moment, and you react at the moment, it has no comparison parameters
yes, yes, yes, and there is a saying, some are born under a lucky star and some are born seeing stars
aha
and, actually, actually being born in unfavourable economical and social circumstances because of education and so in our countries
it is true to a certain point, but while there are people who get over it I can't understudy why others choose the other way thinking they will solve their problems this way
aha
when actually money won't solve every problem
aha
because they can, they can get money but the education they didn't get that they will never have
no, never
I mean they will never have that, and many other things
exactly
they won't have even when they have the pockets full of money
yes eh listen and what do you think about the other thing they were asking us, do you feel safe in your community?
relatively yes, I think that well I I've been living here in Miami a year
aha.
and well anyways always anywhere I've lived I've been, I've been cautious.
yes
I've taken my precautions, not arrive too late, put good lights, eh if I'm driving, go by well lit streets, well, precautions that I believe that, that can help one to
to avoid certain dangers
yes, yes exactly look that
the same in a shopping center, I park in well lit areas, well that I believe helps one, so
aha
em that's why maybe, I feel a little safer, because if I can't do it well I prefer
also is by areas, right, not because you live in Miami everything is one way, but rather that the area where you live also has its peculiarities
exactly and the neighborhood where I'm living now is a neighborhood where the people know each other a lot then
no
that also helps, no
aha, is, is
the neighbor know, if
is a Latin neighborhood
yes the neighborhood is Latin
aha
and look, I have been only living in this neighborhood for a month, before I used to live in a neighborhood where there was a big number of North Americans, of Asians, there was people from Central America, I mean
multiple nationalities and cultures
aha
eh, Afro Americans, but, but we even had some cops for neighbors, so it helped
very quiet
and another area where I lived, my very first neighbor was a cop
aha
so you feel really quiet, here where I live now I don't have any cop near, I don't have cop neighbors but, but the
Hello
Hello, yes this is
yes, How are you?  I'm Marcos, I'm in Philadelphia
Oh very god Marcos, I'm Jorge, I'm talking from Los Angeles, California, and if you hear a strange noise it's because I'm calling from a public phone
ah, interesting
from the street, yeah
okay
and s- so this is why I'm at the side of a pretty busy street
ah
oh, How are you?  Marcos you said, no?
yes, yes
how are you Marcos?  Everything good in Philadelphia?  Great
good, very good, happy, happy new year
Same to you Marco, I always ask
thanks, thanks
to know, eh, I'm originally from A-Argentina, and you?
ah, I grew up in Paraguay
oh Asuncion what a coincidence
in Asuncion exactly
Of course I know Asuncion, Paraguay.  Yes, but believe me that haven't spoken with someone from Paraguay for a lo- long time.  Well, nice to meet you, today's topic is
hmm, nice to meet you, I think that it's Crime
Crime yes, well, they've asked us many questions about crime, basically it's ah
How do you feel about where you live relating to crime?
When I say that I think about the crime in the area where I live
yes
Well, I'm in Los Angeles, okay, Have you ever been to Los Angeles?
yes no, no
In California?  Never, never
No never, I have a brother who's in San Francisco, but he basically says that Los Angeles is enormous
well yes
and eh, and difficult to get to know the city because it's so big
Exactly well basically what happened with, eh, San Francisco has more characteristics of, basically of a city but what Los Angeles has is
basically a, a big thing, eh, scattered everywhere
yes
it's really spread out, like this is what it has, for this it's so big
hmm
Well basically we're talking about crime in there area where I live, basically I live in Hollywood you see
hmm
and the area where I live is generally a safe area, there's always something that can happen every now and then but
I calculate that it's basically like this everywhere, no
hmm
like many places in general that is a sure area, of course you have to know too that you have to take care of yourself, you must know where are you going, how to, it is true, where do you walk
Of course, of course to know where do not walk
exactly, exactly And how is that, how are you are you in the?
yes, yes, yes I think so it is the same in all places
are you in the city of Philadelphia?
I am in the center, basically more to the center of Downtown eh I don´t know because eh, is from Philadelphia
from Philadelphia, well see it, I have never been in Philadelphia And eh, how, in general do you see it there?
it is a, it is a city, it is a beautiful city, eh but it has to do a little, a population that in general ah I am not sure how to say it in Spanish of Afro-american
eh to do not say anyways eh to sound racist and nothing like that
No, no, no I understand
but there is a big there is a big yes, there are a big amount of blacks in the city
Oh is that basically most of the population?
I think that in the center of the city you don´t notice so much but there are certain places of the city like the south and the west
eh, that is very pure, lets say
oh And how do you see crime rate in the area where you live? Because you are in the downtown basically in the center
eh, that have, yes and, and that exactly exactly that is, it is that of course it is in the a little that is not to the west nor the south
eh but here not so far to the south from here begins the part of of, of people, of black race but in this section of the city where it becomes that there is not any problem
so there is, there are not many problems lets say eh my sister lived here near a little bit more to that place but never happened an incident, everything was great, everything perfect
there is another section of the city more to the west that lets say is more turbulent eh
For my information, what is the area of that city? Because maybe in the future I will go to visit Philadelphia, I've never been there, so I'd like to know, tell me what are the areas
yes
where you think you should be more careful, for instance
there is a part, basically the west side of the city, the downtown is beside the river, eh, beside the Schuylkill River
and
What river is it?
the Schuylkill, it's an ancient Indian name, it's written
oh
-SCHLY or something like that
oh, I see
Schuylkill, the river, on the west side of the Schuylkill, for the first, I'm thinking about the name of the streets, from thirty to let's say sixty-nine more or less
you will notice it is a tunnel, you know, to the road, and you continue until you get out of that section before you, you slow down too much
OK ok
eh, please keep the windows shut, please don't feed the animals, eh, and so on
oh So, you said from street thirty to street sixty-nine in the west side of the city
yes, right
that's the area where you should be really carfeul
and it's pretty close to the downtown, which covers a few blocks, maybe ten blocks wide, the, the corridor
ah
but apart from that I think there is no problem at all, unfortunately I have no way to avoid the part of the city where there are more crimes
lets say the two more dangerous places eh, there is the west section, where there are people, black race people and there is eh, to the
east of the city eh south I think they call it north, but I don´t know how they call it north because if you look at the map is more to the south in reality
oh
but em that section is more Puerto Rican and eh and, central American that part is eh, that part is equivalent, basically I know some of that section
because I speak Spanish, my mother, my parents are doctors
oh, how good.
and and, my mother worked with the Puerto Rican association in march she worked in the hospital section, in the clinic they had em
Then I know some of that area  she always when she went to work being the doctor of the the the, the neighborhood basically, from that section any case
yes
she has, is like a title she has, it is, it is, it is safe for her because she is the doctor is safer for her than for another person, people take care of her, lets say.
of course because, I understand, of course
they take care of her eh, but besides that em I don´t remember anything else, eh
well it is okay, in general then
I never, I never was a victim of crime
better, better, better, better
eh so a, I was in an accident  where a drunken man cross on the red light and eh and I was in a car accident about
I well, I, I understand.Well I went
but besides that nothing
basically I can say victim when I was in Buenos Aires Have you been in Buenos Aires right?
yes, many times
Well, it's an experience I would recommend to nobody
aha, ah
eh, by that time, I was, I was working of course and, eh we basically wre paid monthly, so, so, it was
pretty ugly, now I got over already but, I had just got off the
yes
the bus, we call a collective in Argentina,
yes
nad
yes, in Paraguay it's called a micro
eh, in Asuncion it's called a micro
yes
and it left me like six or seven blocks away, and it was late, about nine thirty at night, I was walking and suddenly
a car, eh, I was walking and basically I noticed nothing
aha
suddenly I see somebody behind me, aiming at me with a gun, well
aha
just figure, it was, it was terrible, in few words it was a very
yes, yes
a very traumatic situation, I mean, they took
yes
I was working, I had two jobs, they stole everything from me and all I said was "take it all, just leave me alone", no and well, it
Sure, sue
was a very, very traumatic experience
yes, I think that's a good word to describe it.
it was traumatic, I was in shock for a couple of days, and , around that time I was living with my parents and I didn't want to do anything, I was very confused, I didn't want to talk to people, it was a terrible experience but thank God
yes, yes
the most important thing is, money comes and goes, but the most important thing is
sure, you can't buy
exactly, and, and, hey look oh

Where is that?
it's like an hour away from the DF
yes
yes, it's a little city, almost
yes
that if you look on the map, you can't even see it
Sure, I think that it's under the influence of the DF, because the DF is huge, I imagine, right?
No, excuse?
I say, that the DF is really big
yes, and also really dangerous
yes, no, well
yes
I hear that, many movies, but, I don't know if it's like that, that in the DF there are many snappiness, right?
yes, the weather is, specially this one
Sure
in the city and well
There is so many people
yes, well, I have been there only twice, only trough, right?, no more
Sure
And besides weather there is pollution, and you see on the news that people is stealing
corruption
Sure
Etc.
And have you been a long time in Houston?
Yes, I've been living here 8 years now
Eight years, I see
yes
And, are you thinking staying or returning to Mexico?
Well, not right now, I have no plans
Do you have family?
Well, let's see, no, I don't think to stay here, for a long time
No, Neither do I, I would like to return to Argentina at some point
yes
and that's my plan. From less than a year ago, that I'm here
Yes
And a little less than a year, I have to work. I always keep the hope of being able to return
Mmm
but well, things are not that easy, in our countries
yes, yes, it's difficult
it's difficult, Latin America
yes
How many calls have you made?, with this system?
this is the first call.
Don't tell me.
yes.  It's, I used contact patterns.  I called, but there wasn't anyone with whom, I couldn't locate the other person and you are the first person that I'm
Ah, I'm at twenty one.
Ah, well how nice.
So, with four more I'll be finished
yes
Let's see what, what happens
yes
But, but the truth is, aside from what they pay you it's been pretty good.  Because I've spoken with many people and in truth, I've liked it a lot.
yes
I've met several people, like this.  So I've found out how certain things and other places are like.
yes, yes, yes.  And what topics did you talk about?
Well, many times we talked about the topic of the day.  This one, I didn't hear well what it was
ah
But
The topic is
on
yes ahead.
but, in general many times too, it depends on the person, I've had, talking about, for example, like I'm talking now with you.  About, about anything
yes, mm.
And, but people that don't, they want to go directly to the theme of the day, and well, let's go, we have to get to this point, right?
Mm, yes.
For
But
I guess that for them it's the same, I mean, because they, they are here for linguistic studies.
yes.
So then, if we talk of the theme, or in other words, given theme, well, if not for that we don't know what to talk about
yes
So But in general, what's the temperature like there right now?
Pardon me?
Is it cold there, more or less?
mm, well right now no. No, it's a little, not cold but not very hot.
Ah
That's strange, because last year it was very cold. And now it's not. In Christmas above all it was a little warm.
you, very hot
yes, not that much, but more or less
Ah, I see. I see, here, here in Pennsylvania, it's very cold.
It must be snowing, no? I would imagine.
yes. not today, but, but today it's very nice because it's sitting at around five degrees, but.
Uh huh
A couple of weeks ago, we had less than eighteen degrees
Uh
And i assure you that's cold, cold
I can imagine
Uh, and, uh, and more than anything, i mean, I'm not used to it, i come from Buenos Aires, that's, lets say, pretty warm
No, in this season it's neither cold or hot
Well, it's summer now in Buenos Aires, because it's
Oh yes
it's the Southern Hemisphere
Um
But in winter, the colder it gets is one degree below zero
And when does the winter start?
the winter, in Argentina it starts around June
Oh, look at that, i didn't know that, i thought it was like, like in Mexico, like
Uh, no, it's the opposite
Like here too, uh huh
Because it's like to the other side of the world, the same with Australia, uh
Right
We're, we're the south
yes, yes
But, but the south of Argentina is really ugly
yes
yes Patagonia, Have you heard of it?
Hmm, no, I don't know.  What's Patagonia?
Patagonia is the most southern part of Argentina.  Seeing that Argentina is really big.
Aha, yes
Eh, basically, and Patagonia, there's the most southern part, Boreal goes almost to the border of Antarctica.
hmm
And it's very cold there.  And so, these zones can have very low, low temperatures.  But not, not the rest of the country.
And it is pretty or how is it?
Argentina is really pretty, yes.  It's as pretty as it is big, you have three climates.  Like, in the south it's really, it's with snow
mountains
yes, yes
and, and the north is pretty tropical, and in the middle it's temperate.  So you can choose
and where are you from, the south, the north?
I'm from the middle, the center.  Where it's temperate
Ah, how nice.  No?
yes, but, sometimes I would like to be a little closer to the mountains.  Because Buenos Aires is on the coast, so, we don't reach the mountains.
But, and you, what do you know about Argentina?
From Argentina, well not a lot, ah, I would like to go one day, but for economic reasons, well, I haven't been able to.
Sure.  And what do you do?
I'm, this, I study.
A study, in Houston.
yes, I study in Houston at the University.  I study Economy.
Aha
And I'm in my, I have one semester left.
Ah, how nice.
to fin- yes.
how nice.  And do you think you'll work for a while in the United States?
yes, I think I'll stay here.  yes, but I don't know.  I'd like to go someplace else.
Sure.
yes, well, I've been very bored, truly.
And what percentage of the population there in Houston is Latina?
Well, it's, there's a lot of diversity.
Aha
Oh, yes, there's a big percentage.
Aha
The good thing about Houston is that, well, there you meet people from all over the world.  Yes, there's a lot of variety, no?
Sure
Later, later you realize. Especially when you go to the Universities, Right?
Sure, a lot, a lot of variety.
yes
Sure. yes, yes, I can imagine.
Aha, they are not like other States and other cities where there's more like, people of the white race, Right?
Sure
Less Hispanics.
Less Hispanics.
Asians
yes, I was I know, California
yes
Some and there also there's a bunch of Hispanics.
yes
I think, Texas and California must be the others
yes there there are much more. Chicano, American, Mexican also Right?
Terrible, terrible
yes
An incredible amount, well all that, some day it was, once it was Mexican territory, so!
yes, yes
Many have stayed there. They are, are Americans, because they were born in America, but one hears them, or you see them and they are Mexicans.
Hey, Sorry to interrupt
yes
No, let's say, don't they disqualify the call if you don't talk about the topic
in principle know, I've been audited and they accepted them, so, stay calm
Oh, then okay
No
I was kind of worried, but maybe not, but well
Don't worried, How is it called? It also happened to me, at first, I wanted to talk about the topic and people talked about other things
Mmm
And then, when you are in the page and check your status
yes
You enter your password and you can place the states, and then, he says how many weeks you have done, and if they are valid or no
Oh, okay
And I haven't been rejected one
And you have talked about other topic besides today's one, right?
yes, for example, today we didn't talk anything and other days also, there have been days where I talked and other where I don't
yes
Don't worry, when you have to talk with other person, then yes
Then, about the topic
yes, you should try
yes
Do you like Football?
hmm yes,
Play!
I like it.
Do you play there in Houston?
I've been playing for, yes, for a year.  Because well, it's with the school and a lot of tests.  Etc.
Sure
Well I don't have much time.  So, I got on a team, since last year and we're in a tournament and well.
It was fun.
Sure
And to you?
Eh
You like it?
yes, I love it.  I love to see it and I love to play it, but no, I'm looking for a team here to play with.
hmm
Because no, eh, the one I found here was full, so they didn't need players
eh, hello, who's speaking?
Manuel speaking, I'm in Orlando, Florida.  With whom am I speaking?
With Pablo, here in Philadelphia
Ah, what's up Pablo, how are you?
What, what's up?  A pleasure.  Everything ok?
Well, everything's good, everything's good over here
Is it nice there in Florida
Eh, sorry?
Is it nice?  I say, there in Florida
Well, yes, pretty, pretty good
That's good,
The end of the year was spectacular and well, everything's good, the weather's really good
That's good, yes yes, not here, here the contrary, cold, rain
Yes, Yes, I have family and friends there, in the north, New York all this and I know how it is
Yes, yes, yes but well, it happens
Yes, but well it's
It's fine, it's fine
Yes, yes, the seasons are also beautiful
Yes,
Well let's start, eh, I'll listen, if you want, tell me your stories first and then I'll tell you
Oh, besides, today's topic is the crime
yes, yes
I don't know here in the zone we were, we were really protected, I live here with my wife
There was many security
right
Because the security, besides, the city police officers, we have from here the University of Pennsylvania, we are here in University City
oh, nice, yes
So, it was really reinforced, this topic, as many other things. Other things have happened when they are on vacations. There is always something, somebody gets robbed
yes
But, never too much, only last year, one rape. But no, it didn't happened anything, only that and once
The
And nothing more happened. I feel really secure in this zone, I say to you, this zone
There are some zones, here in Philadelphia, there are really heavy zones, really ugly
yes
But, I don't know them well, so I can talk, but, some people commentaries, well, you better not to walk at night, some people think like that
bad living and they feel insecure
mmm
And I see the central zone, University city and we are fine
It's fine
We're fine
Well, in what my, it's similar, I live in a really safe area, it's a closed unit
Ah, sure
En, and not just for this, but because in the whole area ah, there's a lot of protection in fact I see that, eh, regularly well, these places are patrolled by the
The police in their vehicles
hmm
They go into the units, look around, well, with relative frequency
Sure,
Eh, I see that the community is also, well, it's always really ready to immediately advise or notify any anomaly that they see
Ah, good
eh, yes, now it's the same as you say, well, obviously there are areas, well that don't count on as much security
hmm
But in general it seems that, that well, everything works well
Yes,
eh, but there still are, very painful facts of
yes, yes, in general I see it well, yes.
in fact, despite the redundancy, the news came this week, yesterday nothing less
hmm
than a person, close to here in another city.  A woman actually, lost an eye, well because of a stray bullet, on New Years Day, no
New Years eve
Ah yes, a disaster
Figure, what a disgrace, nobody knows anything about it, she was at home sitting with her family, her people, when she suddenly felt something in the eye
The last thing I know is that she has a bullet embedded
No, incredible
And it, it is quite unusual, even more around here where nothing ever happens, that people start shooting in the New Year, look what things happen nowadays, right?
Oh, here happened something like this also, I think it was last year, two years ago, and she died, a girl was killed, the same way
oh
A lost bullet
I guess
The father was walking with the girl behind him
Was it also in New Year's day?
No, no, no, no
It was a regular day, yes
The similarity is for the lost bullet
Yes, yes
And also, nobody knows nothing, nobody remembers nothing because it was a lost bullet, disgrace
Well another subject we can talk about, not because we are living or suffering it, is gangs
aha
It's obvious and no one can deny that big cities, specially, have a gangs problem
Yes
And unfortunately that is almost always attributable to minorities
Yes, yes
And in many cases the immigrants or children of immigrants
hmm yes, yes, yes
Well there, well there's not a lot of, to note but, I respect that you don't know all the details of all these things
But unfortunately, well, all of this well, involves a big decomposition of many houses of many families
Sure
And there are boys and also girls now, little kids who swim in the street from when they're really little.
Yes, it's a big disaster, no
And it's, it's logical that they will end up in things, in hands of those who are, of their friends
Sure Sure, sure, sure, Yes, yes
and yes, well you know that this is in New York, in Los Angeles, in the big cities there's this
In the big cities yes, like they say a lot, yes, here the truth is, in Philadelphia, I don't know anything about this gang topic
you see people who apparently seen like they were, living badly but not in a group, in, in gangs
And well believe me that I, at least with my personal security, the fact of walking on the street and all this, I feel really good, really protected
In exchange I don't feel really protected when it comes to cyber crime
aha
Believe me that one time the tried to cheat me, or in fact there appeared a charge on my credit card
ah, yes, yes
You know that
it's also a topic that showed up
And better that well, and better that the problem was resolved in my favor, but they say that for this there's more crime and I don't know and
And it's like they didn't stop enough balls
Yes, yes, we also have a girl friend who something happened to her like this, they took her credit card I don't know how much
Yes, yes, they had invented a charge, but, but well
No, but they're completely mafia it seems
No, eh,
Yes, they're completely mafia and there are people who are getting a lot of money, from this
ah, yes Sure
The, the identity robbers who are also connected to this situation and there's much, much identity theft, so I ask why with so much advance, so much technology
More now, well, with all this campaign of, that started after nine eleven
Yes
and there's much vigilance, super vigilance, but it hasn't stopped, with these people, because it's not a person it's bands
They're organizations, no,
Yes, international criminal organizations, and if you don't know anything they say or show, they see this organization disrupted, by, the traffic documents or things, no
Nothing ever happens, no
Well, the most I've seen is that they disrupt these bands of pedophiles or, eh, who exchange documents, eh, child pornography or something that I've seen but
Ah, yes, I avoid this too
But, but they break up bands dedicated to stealing identity or scamming the internet, I haven't seen
Ah, scams, No, I haven't seen, I haven't seen
That it's, well, we also have to add today's topic because it's also crime
Sure
And it cost money
How does it look for you, sure, if with respect, and after the topics, yes, it seems that they were exaggerating,
In the television, I mean, it was positive to see that much
Oh, okay
The cases that were played, in TV, I thought that was really positive, because if nothing, what happens in Television, I mean
Some people get sick, it really frights them
I agree with you, obviously, it must not be the only topic, Many media seems to do that
yes
To look and re look for everything with blood in it. I don't think we can reach that extreme, but it's important to keep us informed about things
Sure, sure, but there are media that well, they want to hurt you, that the whole day are highlighting the bloody and horrible news
yes, only that
And well that kind of press, well no. I don't think that it's the best. It's good to be informed, about the things that happen in you country, and well
In general, because you can aisle yourself and you can close you eyes and try to escape from that
everything that is happening
That is no right and I know some people like that, That never watches TV news and never reads a newspaper
But I also think that's ridiculous
Mmm
That's not good
sure
Regrettably with so much tragedy, regrettably, I hope that no
Sure Yes, yes but there are people that, that close themselves in their
And that think that got disconnected and that's it, and solved their problem, no
In their underworld yes, yes it hurts them, and doesn't want to see it and that's it, they directly disconnect. Many are the people that
That act like that eh, That don't read the newspaper, that don't watch TV and And well that's how life goes, that's how it goes for them, they live in their house and in work and
And that's already, and well But there are people that don't need it I had a friend that at one time was depressed and well
And, and the psychiatrist himself would prohibit her, would advise her not to watch television because like if you are not very prepared, very, if you are not
Ah, Ah, okay, in those cases yes, it seems right yes
There are people that are very sensitive, there are people that, that, well that's an extreme case, people that have depression but but there are people that are very sensitive and that if the whole day that's happening to them
Oh, no
Eh, it hurts them and cannot walk straight doesn't function
Ah, no, no, well is that, is that like that already seems like a punishment, I, I can put up with it for half an hour or an hour but
uh, the whole day terrible, that would be like Yes, a total punishment.
Yes, yes,
And it's a torture
Sure, sure, so
No, a little, you have to do a little of everything, that's life
aha
But then you are studying here or you are already based
No, no, no, I am working a little and I am studying a little English, more than anything, the one who is studying is my wife.  She is doing her post-doc here in
Oh, yes
Here in Penn University, and I'm here with her
Oh nice
So, it's more than her, and the principal is that she finish her post doctoral, and well, sometimes
work a little bit and the time goes by and you?, are you working there?, or Studying?
Sure, I'm here working, I also live in New York
I see
But unfortunately the cold kick me out and well, the doctor recommended me to find a hotter weather
Oj
For my allergy problems and all that, those where terrible
And the cold, and the weather, it's really thought
And the cold, it's really hard, and well, I had to take that decision and well, the city, I really loved and well
Well, it's a social laboratory really awesome
Social lab
Many things to do, a really nice cultural life
Really nice
And well, I don't complain, the weather is really harmless
yes
And well, obviously the city is much small and there are not many things to do
Oh, yes
Good evening.
Hello, my name's Yolanda.
Carlos.
Carols.  And where are you calling from Carlos?  From Houston, oh okay, I'm speaking from Fort Worth, Texas
Okay, just next to here.
How are you today, this afternoon, night?
And you?
Very well, thanks, also, have you been in the study very long?
Eh, yes, I've been in this since October.
Oh yes, that's when I started too, yes, ah, I, What, what's the topic on crime?
yes.  What do you think?
Eh and there, there in Houston there's a lot of this.  Right?
Well, eh, well, I suppose so.  Like, I really, well, I've been living here for five and a half years,
Aha.
really nothing, I've never had any problem, eh, thank god.
Oh, aha.
Eh, I understand that, well, yes, well, it seems that in the last few years, crime has been pretty stable, this, and if anything, perhaps it's gone down.
Eh, I've hear- hard, well, that, that in the last, eh, months, it's gone down considerably.
yes, aha.  Aha.
And well, many attribute it to the refugees after the hurricane.
Oh, yes, right
Um
yes, that's the, that's the, that's what I've been told. I have relatives that live there in Houston, and in San Antonio and well, here in our area, in
In Dallas Fort Worth too, uh, we get a lot of the, of the people that was, uh, that went through all that, and yes, there are many
Uh, situations where, uh, the, conditions of, the stores that, there have been more robberies and more
Uh, like having, like more stealing. Uh, that i know, but i don't know about anything else, like slaughters
Have you had, have you had any problem in the past?
Well, uh, some stores have, have, uh, suffered, how do you say?, burglary
Yes, uh, we're
Oh, they have robbed them and, and something like that
well, uh, i, well, really, i mean, i, uh, when i was, when i was like thirteen
Right
uh, i was robbed, uh, uh, when i lived in Puerto Rico
right
Uh, well, someone came up to me and, i had a, i had a golden necklace
Right
and well, they, they gave me like a, uh, they just, well, the, the, he grabbed it from my neck
Wow, at thirteen years old
And, yes, uh, i don't, i don't know, i mean, that's the only, the only experience I've had
Right
Oh, for me, always, I think that, well, having that experience, it prepared me, emotionally I guess
Yes
So, I don't know, If I had something that good. But well
No
I feel that if at some point someone would try to mug me, of stealing me something, I think that I would fight back
Well, more or less
And maybe, well, I mean, it won't be the best in the situation. but
yes
I don't know, I feel that I would try to fight back
yes
in the situation
yes
Mmm
I think that I understand the situation, yes, where is him, yes it's
But
near, maybe, of getting help, or if they have me cornered and maybe, according to the situation, I think, because I
it's hard to say what you would do, in those circumstances. But O would like to fight back, those are my things, and I have worked so hard to get them, to have
well, I think that maybe. Well, for me, I think that you should have an idea of
the things you can do about it, I mean
yes
I, I find that, there are, are occasions in which a person, well, I don't know, ah, ah, it sounds bad saying it, but, deserves to be robbed, ah, because
Aha
eh, eh, many times, I see women that are walking and they have, eh, a big purse, and in, and in that purse, well, one sees that, that she has money there,
that she's, she's showing she has money there.
Aha.
Eh, I mean, that, that's like an invitation up to a certain point that
yes, I, yes. One has to use their head, I say. One has to be wise, ah, like
Exactly.
put away what, when I go to a big city and need to walk around, I put my bag under the, if I have a jacket or I carry itclosed to me.
I just carry it, because I've traveled a lot in, in many countries, and, and is a lot of, or something that tourists, am, ah, they throw away their
the bags, or the packages, or something like that, whatever they bring, because they are careless, they sit to eat, and they leave them outside in, in, in the
the cafes that they have outside, and, and, they leave the bags and packages and all that,
Likewise, I mean, I, I find that eh, I've heard, it seems to me, many people that they steal, ah, their computer, eh,
Oh, yes, aha.
Why? eh, but I don't understand. I mean, if one is going to be in a public place, in a shopping center, and one has a laptop,
Aha.
well. Why is one going to leave the laptop in the car eh, completely visible
yes, aha.
I mean, I, I, yes, I always, well, eh, with my job, well, I constantly have a computer with me but if I know that I'm going to be someplace,
if I have to leave it in the car, I leave it in the car, but I always have- always cover it, I always have a shirt, or sweater, something, I mean,
yes, something to cover it, yes
that, that is going to cover it
Mhm
No, I never leave anything within sight
yes
I don't know, then
yes, well, figure, once I bought a car, it was a car that had been converted from gasoline to diesel
oh, the, the engine
aha
and we had troubles with the, how do you say repairs? it damaged often. I lived in Florida by that time. And, I le- there were, am,
ah, how can I tell you? there were a lot of car stealing in that area, with all the tourist and everything. And I left my car, it was a Cadillac, it was in eighty-four or
yes
eighty-five. And I left it with the keys in, open, because I wanted it to be robed in order to be paid the insurance, and
they never robed it
it depends a lot on, on the area where you live. I mean, for instance
yes, aha
I live in the Medical Centre, I work in the Medical Centre, here in Houston
Aha
And, well, I have never, thank god, I have never had any problem
Aha
The diferences, the same apartment complex, where I live now, there have being some robberies in the past
I see
And in other apartments I have live, there have being some robberies too
Yes
And really, I don't know how it's promoted to rob a car instead of other
yes
And well, I have been lucky and it haven't happened nothing at all, But I live, I mean, as I say, I never leave something visible in the car
Sure
Always, when I'm walking, and so, I mean, I'm 28 years old and I'm a little big and I don't look really friendly
yes
So, it won't be so easy, for a theft to rob me
Sure
I mean, in comparison, well, trying to rob a woman or a skinny man, without so
many muscle, like that, well
yes, I see
But I think that when I'm walking, if I walk at night, well I always see some people, with
They are always, well, I have high sight
Yes
And I always look people in the eyes
yes
and, eh, show confidence.  I think that, well, this is one of the things that you have to learn.  Um,
yes, this is important, yes.
but,
yes, especial- a woman has to be alert to everything that is around her.  Eh, if you park in dark places, and, and
only, well, you're asking for problems, because
Exac-
it's not very safe, and this is why you have to be a little, am, wise in how, in how to conduct yourself in the society that we live in now.  Because,
you see, there are many people who
yes.
don't have good thoughts.  Yes, so, Are you from Puerto Rico?
yes.
Oh, very good, And you have, like, you said, five and a half years?
Ah, almost six years.
Six years.  Oh, okay.  And do you have family, or you came to Houston from, from pointing to the map, or how did you come to live there.
Eh, I came for, for work.  I work in the Medical Center here in Houston.
Oh, okay, I had an aunt who was there in the, aye, I don't remember what, Medical Center.  What's it called, eh, a, aye
There are many hospitals there, I don't even remember.   But,
Exactly.
yes, she was pretty serious for a while, and, I spent a lot of time in Houston, almost three or four months I was there with her.  But, thank God, since, she came out and is better, and
and was it a serious experience.  But, everything turned out ok.  yes.  yes.  And you worked in the hospital or what?
yes, I'm eh, I'm studying in the school of medicine
Okay yes, aha, Very good.  yes.  And,
And so, you have time to
Aha.  yes.  And how did you know about this, this study?
Sorry.
How did you know about this study that we're particip-
Eh, one of my friends, she told me and I, since I,
Aha.
I always talk to her on the telephone and since she, What are you doing?  And,
Aha yes.  Very interesting.
one day she, she tells me how, ah, this person I'm talking to, apparently, she didn't like the opinion of
yes, hello
Hello, good evening.
Hi, how are you?
Fine, thanks. Whom am I speaking with?
My name is Fernanda.
Fernanda, How are you? With George, from New York.
George.
yes
From?
yes what no What are you saying?
Where are you from?
I'm Colombian.
And you live in New York?
yes. And where are you from?
Ah, me too.
You too what? You live in New York?
yes, in Brooklyn.
yes, and where are you from?
I'm Mexican.
Mexican, well, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
What do you think of today's subject?
Well, well, I feel like here that if this works, there's not a lot of crime. But, where I come from, and I think where you come from too, that there is.
No?
Mm, relatively. Relatively.
But, uh, I've never been in a, thank God, I've never experienced (sic), ex- I've never had a bad experience.
No.
But my sister has, in Mexico.
Mm. Yea? Mm.
And, yea there it's all like that, you
really? yes, the doctor.
It's all really dangerous.
yes, I've been reading, books about immigrants, and, Mexico's pretty dangerous. Right?
Really dangerous, really, really dangerous. There's so much inequality,
yea.
that people aren't happy.
yes, right. And, that's why there's so much crime too.
Mm hmm. But, it-
Well, but what do you think of the situation here? Well, I think it's about what it's like here. I don't know. Right? I mean, what's your neighborhood like? Is your neighborhood safe? Do you feel safe?
Where I'm at it's safe.
Can you arrive at any time, or, or,or?
I can arrive at any time. I mean, the later it is, the less people there are in the street,
yes, but, but is safe.
but I feel safe. Totally.
And, in the train, or, what do you use, the train, or the bus, or what?
Well, generally, I'm in the train.
yes.
And, I walk a lot. But, I feel very safe, eh, yes, yes I do arrive alone also. I mean, also
really. How good.
know where I go, and in the neighborhoods I go, I know they are safe. But, I do know there are very bad areas in New York.
yes. And what do you think of the parks, of the green areas, where there's,
What?
of the parks, or areas like very alone, isolated
Well, I don't go to the park, really. I think that there it's more dangerous Right?
Ah, I mean, you don't go because you think is safer. Right?
Well, I've never thought that a park is safe.
yes. Mm.
At night, I don't think so.
yes, because, well, here, It shocks me a lot, you know, eh, especially the rapes, and murders of, of women by themselves, especially the women that like to go out and run. Right?
To the parks.
Mm.
I don't understand how no matter how safe a city is, I think that always a park is unsafe. Right? to be there by yourself.
Well, yes, it also depends on the size of the park, but a big park, yes.
Mm.
And it's always been known right? that it is unsafe.
Because, I think that Mm, yes, because, I think is the opportunity for anyone who wants to do something. Right?
yes, he goes to a park and waits there.
yes. But, then, I don't trust Central Park and, sometimes I pass at ten, eleven at night, that I've passed by
in car or something, and I see people, ah, running and all that.
Aha. Do you live in Manhattan?
And, I don't know how, yes, I live in Manhattan.
Aha.
I live like five minutes, like two minutes from Central Park But, yes, I don't know how people go out to jog.
Mm.
I live by the edge of Manhattan, by the road that and also, I see people late at night alone, walking, running. I don't feel safe.
Mm.
For example, or especially a woman. Right? I think doesn't feel safe.
How long have you been living here?
Here, five years, more than five years.
Five
How many do you have?
okay. Me seven.
Seven years? A, well. And what do you do?
Mm. I make music.
Mm.
Music.
yes, eh.
yes, You?
What?
What do you do?
I can't hear you well.
Okay.
That you do what?
What do you do?
Ah, that I couldn't understand you. What. but what, what do you do?
I make music.
Ah, music. But what type of music, you dance, you sing, or what?
I produce and compose. Aha.
really? Ah, how nice. Interesting, I work, I work as a systems engineer, and work with
Pardon? I didn't understand you.
I'm a systems engineer, I'm a computer programmer.
Ah, okay.  Okay.
And, I work with tax sites, online, on the internet.
Oh.  Okay.
I'm a designer and a programmer.  And what kind of music do you do?
Well, popular music, pop music.
yes.
Hmm.  Like, different genres, but everything within pop.
Within pop?  Hmm.
yes.
Ah, the issue is interesting.  And have you recorded, or, or bought by other people?
This, well, both, I did things myself, and I've done things for
yes?
other people, for television,
Hmm.
yes, a lot of little things.
Really interesting.  Hmm.  Wow, good.
But,
But what?
but getting back to the topic,
But coming back to the topic of security,
In Colombia, you never felt less safe than here?
Hmm, a li- no, yes, obviously.  Like, obviously, here, it's not with the prevention, for example, that they steal a car.  there they steal many cars
So, I, for example, I had to be aware.  Well, one of the closed windows, at the stop light, for example, they break the glass and they take your wallet.
Hmm.
And these kinds of things.  So, eh, going around with jewelry.  Or fashion.  Here, I go with jewelry calmly, there's no problem.  And there are people who tell me, be careful in
certain parts.  No?  I don't know, they don't trust much.
Hmm.
But the truth that, that after a year or two years, you feel relaxed, like you don't have this prevention,
because, let's say, in Colombia, in certain parts, it depends on the city, no?
Hmm.
And you don't have, a bank, if you go to a bank, you have to have miles of precautions.
Hmm.
yes.  Here not so many.  Not many, but, but, in any way, I think that they're stealing and all this.  But, not as much as there.  There, for example, they realize, someone takes out five, ten million pesos
that this, here, like a thousand and something dollars, two thousand, three thousand dollars.
Hmm.
There are people who follow you from the bank.  They follow you and, are willing to kill to steal that money.
Hmm.
So, yes, this is true, here you feel more safe.  But, really, New York, well, for the populace, and for people, there are people from everywhere, from every way, no?
No, I haven't been witness, really, to anything.  But I've heard, for example, people on the train who are sleeping or distracted, they steal the
the, the suitcase, or the
Hmm.
the MP3s, or whatever.  Hmm?
Hmm.
Let's say that no one sill, that no one will, no?  like, like in other countries.  But if there's the opportunity, all of a sudden, they steal it.  No?
yes.
All of a sudden, knowing about robberies, no?  I didn't know about these kinds of things no?  To people, no?
I only know one person whose been robbed here.
But yes, And how did they steal from him?
Well, there in the street, in a really empty zone,
And in what part?
and, for a- in Brooklyn,
wow.
and it was a night and it was ro- raining,
yes.
and they just took his wallet.
they showed a fi-
But, in Mexico, I know many people who have been robbed, who they've kidnapped, who they've,
Ah, no, yes.  yes.
this doesn't happen here.
The situation in Mexico, right now is worse than in Colombia, as far as kidnapping and all those types of things.
Mm.
yes, for example. in, in Colombia, if you have money or something, well, you have to be careful and all that. Here that doesn't exist as much. Right? No, that doesn't exist, let's say. Mm?
yes, it doesn't exits.
Here, I'm more afraid of being robbed by the lawyers, the ones that do administration, of paperwork supervision, when one goes to do a mortgage,
Ah, I think there's more risk that they rob one,
Mm.
here there's a lot of fraud. For example, fraud, there's a lot of frauds. Right? Especially the Latins.
Jeez, a lot.
yes, there's a lot of fraud against the Latins, even selling products, or offering them, especially they take advantage of the people with the issue of immigration, Right?
yes.
yes, I think that here
But, here I think that they try to get money from everyone in whichever way.
No, that's why, here, that, let's say that to us, in our countries, from the pocket by force, like Right? Here they get it out of you surreptitiously.
yes, exactly.
yes, I think is true, I've been amazed, at the insecurity in that sense.
AHa.
Now, What do you think of the insecurity with e-mails through the internet, and all that
Ah, well, I haven't had any experience. And, I don't know anyone who's had anything happen to them.
yes. I do receive them, often,
But, well, you have to know more.
yes they come to me, every now and then, man, you know you're, you're convinced from the bank, of something,
Aha.
and, and someone that's distracted, gives them the password easily, gives them the user name and all that.
Well, but also, someone here from menso, who gives all the data, you also don't see as
Hmm.  No, but I don't think so.  Look, there are sites that are so, so similar that you say, well, yes, I'm confident it will be very trustworthy, above all, No?
Well yes, but there, also, I think that it's a lot about the person.
yes, but,
Because, well, if you're with a bank, you know what the bank page is, No?
yes but, no, if you get a message asking you your bank password, without realizing, and confidently, or on the phone, there are a lot of things.  Hmm
yes.
For example, I live in a neighborhood, I, okay, speaking again about security in the, in the area.
But, well, yes.
I live in a neigh- in Harlem, hmm,
Aha.
You mention Harlem to a lot of people and a lot of people say, ugh, this is dangerous.  Because Harlem, yes, Harlem was very dangerous a few years ago.
aha.
Very, very dangerous.  But, not today, well, there are people, you see them in the street.  And all this, well, you say, aye, no, well,
it's not dangerous, no.  It's a very safe place, a very safe district during the day.
Hmm.
And the people that don't know, or that don't live here, I tell them, I live in such area. And they tell me, uh, but that's like unsafe, right?
Mm.
Then, for example, that's, that's my experience. And, up to now I, well, I haven't had any problem. Now, I have known, for example, in the Bronx, some friends, they broke into the apartment.
Some friends that what?
And, they robbed them, in the apartment. And, they stole their bike, cameras, and they robbed them.
There in Harlem?
No, in the Bronx.
that the Bronx is more
yes, in the Bronx, that happened to some friends. And, it appears that yes there are in several, in several buildings, there are areas where
apartments, and
Hello.
Hello.
Hello, who's speaking? Maria here.
I'm Leticia.
I cannot believe you.  I was so happy, silly Leticia told me
María Inés
Well, no, hey, I have been calling for three hours, calling and calling.
Really?
yes, I got mad. Besides, they leave me, Paula lifts the tube, calls and gets connected, and me?
yes?
Ay, I was evicted.
No, but I, right now about twenty minutes ago, have been waiting for them to connect me
Look.
more or less, oh yes, fifteen at least
What, you press the one again, the one, like that?
yes, a bunch of times.
Ah. Ah, of course, I don't have a lot of patience, I do the second time I press the one, I hang up and leave.
Ah, no, no, no I stay doing something else, my husband is watching the television, like that with the phone there
Ah, well, it was Ah.
until they connected him, I said here, hold it, I told him.
Ah, sure, Sure, so, what happens is that I don't even have a cordless one so,  I get bored.
Ah, is not cordless, sure but I swear that there are moments that I say, I would like to have a microphone, how do you say it? a
Sure, a hand free
yes, or a hand free or a a spea-, not a speaker, a headphone
But those are super cheap, I think, for the cellular.
yes, the same, I'm not talking about the cellular
Ah, you're talking about the fixed one.
though right now I could, because after nine I could
Ah, and but by there it doesn't count, because it doesn't count as a different phone, right? if, if you call more than once.
No, no, no, no, no, and
It's not in your best interest.
I mean, after nine I could talk and it doesn't consume anything, but there I forget and well, and I talk with this one but I was answering e-mails and incidentally I said well,
I get on the telephone, when it connects, connects
How funny, well, what, Do you feel safe in the community?
yes, the community in Philadelphia
yes,
eh, eh the truth is that I think that about, about Philadelphia, must be true. The fame that it has, you see that it's not safe
with regards to, to the other places in the United States
To other places.
I don't know, at least, from what I see, I don't know if there are other cities that have an urban, well, by there, the most, most
big, like Los Angeles and all this but
And, no, and these places should be half
New York, yes, all the biggest ones, because after it seems like cities that don't, don't have a dangerous zone like you see here, or I don't know if it's dangerous but that
that scare you, no?
yes, and now, here, West Philly, when, now that the students aren't here this week it's a little bit better, but last week, I went to the gym
yes.
and I came back at eight at night, which is early
yes.
and I was scared at times.  I know, that on the face
Really?
yes, yes, yes, yes, yesterday someone confronted me, nothing, the kind, look, it was a crazy guy, he wanted to know if I'd seen his cat
yes, but, seeing how much they scare you for tiny things
yes.  yes, no?
And, what do I know.
And things happen, I think, I don't know if at this height, but West Philly
yes and no, they happen after the fifty
yes.
yes, after the fifty there's bullets
yes from what I know, and, and South Philly when you come from the airport you want to die, also, the places you see
yes, yes, and the area around the zoo too.
Now I say, well, yes, Philadelphia is nice, Center City nothing more
Sure
after we won't count anything else, not the rest
The field, walking in the field is really nice, and everything's rich
And the field, yes, obvious, but don't go there anymore because
No, no, no, no the center and the upper center, at this height let's say
Ah, yes.
between Market and I don't know, the South, it's nice
Ah.
after that Philadelphia isn't that great.
No, no.
And now the more you see
At all.
the less you like
yes, no, no, no.  But well, what can you do?
That's what we have to talk about, what can you do?  This Penn
Has its advantages.
yes, it doesn't have its wave, I like the wave of the city too
yes, the, the center is good, but if you go to the outskirts you want to die.
yes yes yes, it's a topic, after there are the other outskirts, the other outskirts are getting good
yes, the others are good, yes, but
you go to the bars like type King of Prussia those bars are
yes, but I already don't know if it's Philadelphia that
really good. And it's like no, like the like, like it's over there, I don't know, Ramos Mejias, those places, no, that is not Capital, that is
Pilar yes, No, yes, no, no, that's not Capital, Lomos de Samora and Ramos Mejia is not Capital, but
that, that is not Capital, San Isidro, Martinez and all that Ah.
yes, they're the surroundings, but I compare that more with
Sure.
with the surroundings nearby here, I don't know
Ah, it is put where he works, but really far, Paolia.
And how is it there, was it pretty?
is very pretty. See that it's very pretty.
I saw it on the map the other day. I was looking at the map and, and I saw it, because I had no idea where it was, I mean
I have no idea by where
is would be kind of like northeast, I think from what I saw
Ah.
something like that, kind of northeast or north, but going a little towards the west
To the west, because is passing Brindmore, Brindmore is where Marcela and Mario lived, see
Sure, is like diagonal I mean, it's neither north north, nor west, west, is, all like that kind of diagonal
Mm. yes, yes, yes, yes.
And it's good there, no?  yes
And they say how nice, it's crazy things that the nice people, driving nice cars, nothing to do with West Philly
yes, I imagine.  The other truth.
The two faces of Philadelphia
yes.  yes, I swear, now that we went to our friends' place, there in, in
yes.
Sure, they live in a condominium that has a pool, like Mario's, you know?
yes.
pool- a little more, other there I don't know, a bit nicer, Mario's is more or less the same but, good, it has a pool, after, eh
a jacuzzi
No.
after a place where we spent Christmas
yes.
it, it's a living room, but you don't know how nicely decorated.
So like a, like a common
yes, it doesn't have a barbecue, it's like a
Sure.
a tent, to me
yes.
like it's better than, than our apartment, I swear
yes, where, where my friend who lives in Boston has this, yes,
yes.
and it's amazing
With a redone kitchen, she has a good, one of those big televisions
And pays the same as you, able
yes, they pay a thousand dollars and they live in two environments in, no, two houses where she's really happy and, and
And because it's smaller she can, no?  Because San Diego is expensive, what I told Mariana, my, my friend's dad, and she had to go to the suburbs, what they call Paolia there.
yes.
And and they pay a thousand for an apartment, and according to her it's minimal.
Ah, yeah?
yes, no, not even a pool or anything.  The only thing they have is parking, but, without a roof or anything.
Sure, what happens is that Davis is a little town
Sure.
it's like living in the suburbs, nothing more than
You're going to live there, I don't know, in any little town close by, it's another thing.
yes, obviously, yes.
Believe that I, where Lucero worked, that's a little town, I don't remember the name
Wilmington
sure, you go there, and you're able
yes.
the rent but there goes half
yes, just like that.  yes, yes, yes.
and but well
What happened is that we, seeing this, said, ah, how good
yes.
sure, because it's barbaric, but like, what happens is that here to go to a place you can, but you have to travel
And yes, then after if you come to work at Penn the parking costs you a ton
yes, no?
and yes, to park, forget it, like, and it's for, with parking
Sure.
and it comes to, ah I don't remember how much it was
Two hundred?  No.  How much?
bah, it's not so, like seven hundred dollars if you pay the whole year together, if you pay it all together, so it's not so much
Seven hundred a year.
A year.  But if you pay by the month, it's another price
Ah.
the deal is if you go, eh, I don't know, when you start the school year, in September, you pay seven hundred mangos
yes.
well, aha
And it hurts a lot.
yes, all together
yes.
What, do I know, it's like everything if one has been here to stay, you take it as one more expense and what do I know, the last one you save from rent
yes, it's true, because renting at the most it's the minimum, but it's a bunch of dissadvantages
yes.
maybe rent turns out to be the same, but you live in a much better place.
yes, or maybe a-, it's less, what do I know.
yes.
What happens is that those things you realize with time, when you end up finding out it's like it's not worth it to move I imagine,
It's not long before you leave, what do I know.
yes, the truth is that I don't know, all the same I'm not completely convinced because it buggs me to travel, I don't know
Mm, it's hard, it's hard. On the morning, above all, you have to wake up an hour earlier to get there at the same time you used to arrive
yes.
and the day ends at six here, but you arrive at your house at seven
yes, for that, it's like it doesn't completely close. O-, it's obvious that if you live in a town and you have everything close by, it's great, but here, it's like, I don't know.
yes.
A-, you have tho think about it, I don't know, the truth is that
And Marcela, every day she had to take the train and then she had to take the subw-
yes.
every day of your life, it bothers me already to do it to go to some place in particular
yes, no, no. No, the truth is that that is what I hated of Buenos Aires, and coming here and do the same
Sure
because, I don't know, may you are not so used to it, but I, there, since, all the, all the, university was like train and subway
Sure, sure. I lived in a place that is not very well communicated, so I had like
forty-five minutes on 'bondi'
Oh
but it was one single 'bondi', the problem is that it gave many turns, it was not far actually, by car it would take ten minutes
Oh, really? Oh
But, and car was a good option, because there you can park anywhere you want, there's no need to pay for parking
Sure
and the Mard del Plata is not that big either, I mean, you do a pair of turns and you find a place to park, for sure
yes. No, if, to me, that is what I hated there, travelling
Sure, in Buenos Aires of course, when I, the little time I worked in Buenos Aires, I had to catch a train and a 'bondi' every day
Sures, yes
it was fast, I got there in twenty minutes, but I had to catch the two
yes
yes
I could get there in forty-five, but I had to catch two of them
Mm
the average was forty-five when everything turned out right, I mean
yes, it was a piquet
yes, no, well, The truth is that, it would annoy me travel
I really like that, getting up and 5 minutes later I'm in the faculty walking
Sure, yes
it's really comfortable
No, you are really close
it's really comfortable, but, well, what do I know?, you have to be in that side
yes, and well, it has it's advantages and it's disadvantages
yes, you know what?, At night it's really ugly and when you want to go eat out, there, well, you have like 80 options, here it's like
three or four options, to see the most attractive, it's like
yes, yes
going downtown annoys you, I mean taking the bus to go downtown
going to eat, only
sure, and well, it's a collective that in 5 minutes, 10, you are there, but, it's not nice
You probably used, it's the Penn Bus
yes
it's free
yes
And drives in front of your house
yes, now Paulo, today took, did you see Lucy?
yes.
for
That's from Penn also.
Sure. Eh, to come home, because he went by train and returns by train, so
Ah, yes
when going he went to take the Lucy coming back, have to see if passes nearby, I don't remember but
And yes, because that's free, it's really good.
really good. It's incredible, you save two sixty per day
Hello?
Hello, yes, this is Jorge, I'm calling from Los Angeles, California. And you, from
Ah, how are you? I'm Leticia, I'm calling from Philadelphia.
Philadelphia, and you're originally from Argentina.
Yes.
Me too, How are you Leticia? How are you?
You are also Argentinian?
I'm from Argentina also, yes, yes.
Oh, but you don't have the Argentinian accent.
Ah, what happens, it doesn't seem like it because you still haven't talked to me for a good while, still, I think that I have a lot but what happens is that I have
eh, that I left Argentina, I have twenty years.
It's been twenty years since you left Argentina?
Exactly.
Ah.
Basically, then, I left Argentina in March of eighty six
Sure.
and I've never returned, I mean eighty six,
But you're from Buenos Aires? Right
ninety and, nineteen years, I'm from Buenos Aires, yes. I'm from Buenos Aires.
Because in any case you have the Argentinian accent but from the interior, not from Buenos Aires.
I don't have, don't have an accent of a person from Buenos Aires
How funny. No. no. no. no.
I'm from, I was born and raised in Lanuz west.
Look at that.
Do you remember that neighborhood?
Yes.
Valentin Alsina. you do remember?
Yes. Yes, yes I came here not too long ago.
Oh, you haven't been in Philadelphia long?
It's been eight months.
Oh, what neighborhood in Buenos Aires are you from?
I'm from Villa Ballester.
Oh, and yes, yes, I like it
Also from the urban Con.
sure, yes, yes, yes. I'm glad, I remember. Yes. Sure, of course, I lived for a while in Florida
Ah, it's very near, yes.
in Florida, I was going to a school there in San Martin avenue yes, sure, sure, how am I not going to remember, well
Ah, and has it been a long time that you don't return to Argentina?
well, since, look that since I left in, in March of eighty six I have never gone back
No.
No, I haven't returned, So, you have a fresher information about the breakups, That has
Oh, that's nice, it's crazy, right? that you haven't returned to Argentina, that's why you don't have the accent
That we have, no, I haven't, I haven't, I haven't
Oh. you have many influence, from Central America
Well, it seems that basically, well, I stayed in several places, I was in South America,in Central America I lived for a year, basically in Mexico
Oh
And then, that might be
That's why you have, sire a really mixed accent
sure, yes, well
because, the "fijate", we don't use it
Did I said "fijate"?
yes
Oh, I forgot, well
That's typical Mexican
Yes, sure, after a year, after a year, well, look Leticia, transparently, to get credit from this talk today
I would like to keep talking with you about anything
We have to talk about the topic
but apparently to get credit, if not, we take the risk of not getting
yes, you're right
the credit, for this, 12 minutes
Yes, yes, well, with respect to couples, lets see I think that, eh, what you suggested in the proposal in, if it is easier to break up when you are younger, I think so
So
Ah, good.
I think so.
Yes, I suppose.
Because, it looks to me that when you are younger, you don´t have so much ties with the other person, right? and I suppose too that it depends too of the time that you have, that you have with the person, right?
Well, eh I agree with you, basically I suppose that ah well, basically to break up is never an, an, an easy thing.
No.
Eh, no, starting at that
No.
eh, to break up eh is never an easy thing, but eh depends of the situation, sometimes there is not another solution but to break up, right? sometimes
Yes, it is logical.
sometimes in a couple, eh, a person loves the other but, sometimes, apparently, love is not enough so, there are people that love each other
Yes.
but besides, besides everything eh ah, they have a lot of things that don´t, that don´t complement, that that they don´t work as a couple
Yes,or, or they hurt themselves
then exactly, then
right? in any other aspect.
Exactly, then, apparently is like eh, maybe, if it is possible it is better to them to break up or, eh, the the situation lets say, love and that, maybe they could be friends or something like that because
when things don´t work, don´t work and that is all
yes, yes, yes, yes.
This, but they include subjects that we must discuss for twelve minutes, but oh my God.
Mm.
They are looking for a subject
Oh, yes, no?
yes, yes.
Sometimes, or, I mean, sometimes I don't even know what to say.
No, have you been taking these calls for a long time? Did you start
I must, this must be the tenth, something like that.
I'm, I think this is my fifteenth, or, something like that.
Oh.
sixteen, more or less. Well,
yes, how did you get involved in this conversation?
I found out about it in, the computer, I found the information in the computer
In a website
in a, well, yes, in a dot com, in a yes, yes, in a website
In a survey website, that
that's right, what did you say?
in, a survey, oh, the
Something like that, something like that, yes, yes
Yes, because I ask everyone, and I'm intrigued about how people finds out
Yes, like when you
Here, well, I tell you, because we are in Pennsylvania, and I work in the University of Pennsylvania, where this study is being done
Oh
and
Oh, really?,you work  in that U...this is the first time, I haven't got that before, You work in the University of Pennsylvania, where this study is being done?
No, no, sorry, I don't do, I'm not related with this study at all
But, but, you work in the University of Pennsylvania?
but I work in the University
Sure, and one of the university's department is making this study
That's why I think, I mean
Look, yes, it's
in the page it says it's from the University
It's from the University of Pennsylvania
Sure
exactly, look, that's interesting, well
So, that's
let's see, taking about
but then, I'm intrigued how people from other states finds out
Yes, it's like
Sure.
and I, and you, and you are more or less like the fourth Argen-, Argentinian person I've talked to.
Ah, yes?
I talked with an Argentinian from Vancouver, Canada, with another from Toronto
Ah.
a girl in Boston, and now you
In Boston?  You don't remember what she was called?  Because I think she's my friend.
The, eh, Leticia, no
No, I'm Leticia.
no, no, Leticia no, in Boston it's Tamara.
Tamara?
Tamara in Boston.
Ah, yes, I know her.
Are you sure that it's her?
I know her.  Yes, yes, yes I know her, I know who she is.
I don't know, she's Tamara, she's just came.
From Israel.
Eh, yes.
Yes, it's her.
Ah, wow, look how small the world is.
Well, I know her personally.
Look how nice, just seeing, just getting with your partner
Yes.
she's from Israel, and she's working in the area of veterinary.
Yes, yes, yes I know her.
Wow, look how small the world is, well, well, well.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.  She's a friend of my friend who lives in Boston, yes.
Perfect, well, speaking a little bit more on the couple, let's see
And how is it in LA, with couples? There's a lot, it's very
Eh, couples in Los Angeles,
Yes.
well, I think that it's not really the city that influences society culture, you know what I'm saying?
Yes.
Eh, ah well, California is basically a very liberal state
Sure, it's famous, yes.
You know?  It's basically very liberal, well, there's liberal everywhere in the world, from, from you know, from Canada to the Falkland Islands.
Yes.
but, what I want to say is that this thing has, where you are apparently has the reputation of being a little more conservative on a lot of things
Yes, yes.
well, eh, here, in California the thing is more liberal, but, the relationship of a couple can influence the sociocultural aspect
Yes
And many, but not necesarilly, for example, a cousin, eight moths ago, my cousin from Argentina, that is in
yes
visiting
Mmm
And he says that people generally does not get married in Argentina
Yes, it's true
because, for a moment, I think is really expensive to live with a marriage and those kinds of things and, so, people basically lives in
as a couple, I mean, they make other kid of arrangements, isn't that true?
Yes, concubinage, yes, yes
And well, exactly, you know that better because it have been 8 months since you arrived
Sure
and you know more how the Argentinian reality is, I got out of there 19 years ago, do you understand what I tell you?
Sure
but it's true, isn't it?
yes, it's true
Because, besides the fact that getting married by law can give the couple more flexibility
Sure
They are not tied, apparently, to any social norm, like divorce and all the problems tied with divorce
yes, yes
so, mm, you know, if people get along then they live together. I don't, I respect both points of view
I mean, I am not, it's alright to me, right?
Yes
I have no problem, but, eh, I don't know, what do you think? from the Argentinean reality? you who came eight months ago
No, yes it's true, ah, there is a great tendency not to get married, to just live together and, and, on one side I think it is because of the economical situation, on the other side it is
because of the compromise matter, right?
Right
otherwise, many people feel somehow tied up to the the other person and have the theory that
not getting married, they have the faculty of choosing, everyday, that person while if you get married, mm, you have her chosen already
although you may regret it, I mean it's harder
Right, and you who have just arrived, eh, is this, the not getting married, these kind of couple relationship
eh, are they more common nowadays, right? in the Argentinean society?
Yes
So, basically, you can find it among your friends, you know many people there who don't marry, right?
Yes, or, or ,many people who just live together for a while, and then get married
That's alright
Maybe, a lot of them decide to get married when they have children, at that moment
Hello?
Hi, my name is Ramon, from Los Angeles
How are you?, my name is Maria Ines from Philadelphia, yes
Mmm
And where are you originally?
From Los Angeles, yes, yes
Oh, you were born there, and are you American?
Yes, well, I'm Chicano
Oh
My grandparents are from Mexico
Oh, it's
And you?
I'm from Argentina
Oh from Argentina
Yes, but well, I have been here for a short time, Like a year or less
A year here in the United States
Yes,yes, yes, and
Oh, really nice, well, the topic is Couple behavior
Yes
So, what's your opinion about this?
And I don't know my opinion.  It depe- the questions that they made, I think it depends a lot on every couple and every person, I don't think that, that it's something about age or
I don't know, I think that
Yes.  Do you have a boyfriend now?  Or
I'm married.  Yes.  Yes, yes, yes.
Oh.  I'm not mar- married.  I have a girlfriend now
Ah.  And?
and for two years and eh.  There's the possibility that there's a future, a marriage, but now, eh, hmm, she lives like thirty miles from me.
Uh-huh.
In San Pedro here, I live in Los Angeles, and it's difficult to have contact with her because I can visit her like three days out of the week.
And she can't visit me here, eh, because she has a, ah
Yes.
Eh, a problem with her kidneys and
Ah.  So she can't travel much.
Ah, for this reason. Yes.
Ah.
Ah.  And that's my situation now.
All the same, well, if you see each other three times a week it's a lot.
And what
No?  Ah, yeah.
Ah, ye- ah for, well yes, now it's enough but perhaps, to, ah, for the growth of the relationship, I think that we need more
More time.
More contact,  yes, more, more time and
And possibilities of you going there, to San Pedro, right?
Um, eh, there's, well, well, she doesn't want to. I have, I'm stuck in the middle and I have, eh, I want, eh oh, something new for me.
And I'm, oh
Uhum.
trying to increase my contacts in the, in, ah, the legal world to reserve the
Sure.
oh, legal disputes.
Uhum.
And that's why, I need, to be here in Los Angeles and, downtown Los Angeles and she's like
in the South of Los Angeles, eh.
Oh, but it's still part of Los Angeles, Los Angeles is a huge city, isn't it? Yes.
Yes, yes. It's huge, it's like, oh, yes, five hundred, oh, square miles.
Wow.
So, it's like three or four States, in, in this area.
It's huge. How much people lives there? A lot.
How many years?
How many?
Oh, like, oh I, in the, in the city, it probably is, I think its like three point three million.
Wow.
Mm, look and I think is like twelve million.
Ah.
Uh, and Philadelphia is like three million, so
Yes. I think that in total, yes, they're three or four million, but I think that in total I'm not, I'm not sure. I don't know, but as big as Los Angeles, I'm sure is not.
Aha and Ah, how many years have you been married?
It's been, well it's going to be three years soon.
Oh, three years, ah.
Yes. Yes. yes, yes, January 11.
Aha
Yes, we got married in, eh well in Argentina and after a year we came over here and
Aha.
And well, it's been a year that we've been here and well, we will stay a couple more years, it's not, it's not definite us staying here.
But well. Nice, we like it, we honestly do.
Yes, yes, yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
And what type of work do you do?
And I studied Biology in Argentina.
Uh um.
And, well I did the doctorate and came here to do what it's called the post-doctorate which is a job in a laboratory of a couple of years, two three years.
Uhm.
And, my husband no, he is a photographer, but now here he's working on whatever, whatever he finds.
Oh, oh.
So he's working, well now he is, at, at this moment he's cleaning offices in, in the suburbs, like to
Aha.
about an hour from here.
Ah. And, what kind of photographer is, is his specialty?
And, he well, what he likes the best is to take artistic.
Aha.
Eh, pas-, landscapes, and, yes, and mm Eh, I don't know like black and white, that kind of of thing
Uhm. Ah.
Eh, he has also taken from socials, like of baptisms, of weddings.
Eh, yes, yes.
Eh, let's saty that
Here in the the, in the the, in Los Angeles photography is very popular.
Yes? Like a hobby?
Yes, yes, it's Ah, like, ah mm But now, eh, for example there is one in Beverly Hills, eh, a-, uh, like I have an invitation to
ah mm, like to go to eh, ah, exhibited of a a, pho-, phot, photographer of ah.
And exhibit.
Yes, of like eh mm. Of art ah like it's the type like of, of people is that like ah that, in the, the photographs of his is in color.
Ah.
And, perhaps that, that is like art ah mm like ah, I can't exactly describe, directly describe of, but is, eh, eh, I, eh, ah, uh, but
Here in Los Angeles, for the reason of, of the Ah, the movie industry also
Sure, Ah, sure
is, eh, is very popular here for that reason but, I think that in New York city is, is more eh
Yes.
Popular.
I think so. I haven't really seen much here.
Oh.
I mean, when he arrived, what happens is that he doesn't speak English well.
Aha.
Then no, he couldn't find work for that basically, of photographer, because all asked him to, well, to speak English, and he's studying.
Aha. Yes.
But, well, until next year I figure that he won't be able to find. But, there wasn't much either, there are some jobs, but
Ah.
and on the artistic side I haven't seen much, there's a lot of art in Philadelphia and things, but of photography specifically, the truth is no
Yes you have a, a museum of, of, of, of art eh
we haven't seen many.
that's extraordinary like, like the, like the Philadelphia Museum of Art
It's beautiful, I went. I went twice and still didn't finish seeing it all. It's enormous.
Yes
It has everything, everything, uh, the famous painters were from there
Yes
The truth is it's impressive
Right
It's very, very cute. And then there's another one, that's the Rodin Museum, that's a whole museum, very small, with all the work from, from the, it's good
Right
even the thinker miniature, it's really really cute. Yes, yes, there are a lot of art movement around here, museums like that, and also a lot of, well, it's more expensive now, i still haven't
I haven't gone there because, because it hurts a little to spend that much money, but there's opera, there's Ballet and Choirs and Symphonies
Right
there's a lot of cultural mobility
Yes, here, yes, in Philadelphia. I, you see, since i worked in, in Philadelphia for like two years
Uh
Two years, uh, i used to, I'm a, i'm a mediator, i work with unions
Um
A union of, i, uh, my work in Philadelphia was to organize a union of, uh, against
Uh
like other sindicates, uh, uh, for
Competition
Yes, competitions. Uh, so every time they needed workers for another union, but there are like two of them, and i think that, i was in Philadelphia like three weeks.
Oh, and did you like it?
Three weeks, yes, I really like it, but
It's really different from here, right?, No, not at all, I don't know the
Yes, really different, the weather is not like Philadelphia
Oh, the weather is horrible
I really like it, yes, I like here, in Los Angeles
Horrible. In Los Angeles is not that cold, right?, In winter?
No, generally no. Now it's a bit cold. The lowest temperature is like, 60, 68
Oh, really nice
but, cold here is what for you would be
Fresh, No for us is really hot, it must be like 35
Really?, Oh
Yes, and it's not cold, this winter is really nice, there is no snow nor Ice
I see
Normally, well, I don't know if you have been here in winter, but the path froze. And you start drifting, and you can't walk because it's all ice
And they have to trow sand to the ice to melt and being able to walk some bit
And now in Argentina, and I saw a commercial to travel to Argentina, like 5 days and Buenos Aires is like
Now is really hot
Oh, Hot in Argentina now?
Is summer, right now. Buenos Aires must be in the 80's
Eighty?
Yes, yes, yes. We should have around thirty degrees, I don't know how much it is but I think that's around eighty six or eighty seven.
Uhum. Oh.
Fahrenheit degrees. Right now it's pretty hot in Buenos Aires, it's summer.
Yes. Yes. Are you specialized in anything?
A what?
Oh, oh, if your type of job is, are you a doctor or what?
No, I'm a biologist.
Oh, biologist, oh, oh.
Eh, yes, yes, biology, eh, biochemistry actually.
Aha.
And, well, but, I studied biology.
Oh.
But, I'm not from Buenos Aires, eh.
Yes, do you work at a university or what?
Eh, I'm in, yes, at the University of Pennsylvania.
Oh, oh.
Here, yes, yes.
That's why you know about this program right, about these calls!
Yes, well, not really, I met a guy, he's from Argentina too
Right
you saw the one that, the sign at the door were he works, he works in another laboratory away from mine and he, he let me know
Oh
Yes, yes, yes
Right
Because it's from there, from Penn, the study. But i don't, i really don't know, or, even the, uh, nothing, not even the building where they do this
It's huge, well, it must be like, the one there must be huge
right, yes, yes, and, uh, it's, i, i, i have like five more calls for, uh, conclude this program for me
Oh, i'm, i think this is number ten, i think i still have some left to do
Oh
I have like 10 left
Yes, it's, it's because i need to make those phone calls, like ten, in uh, different phones
Yes, oh, and have you done that?, the five phones
Yes, yes, right now i'm, uh, near a market
oh, in a public one?
Yes, in the public one
Oh, do you know how lucky you are that they, they put you through quickly because sometimes it takes long, you see?, and
Right
But well, i, i don't like it in the cold, that's, well, the good thing of Los Angeles, here you freeze if you go to a public one
Yes, you have to talk twelve minutes from a public phone, you end up like a penguin
Yes, yes
You just can't
Ingrid, hello, you're speaking with Ingrid from Philadelphia
hello, ah, how are you Ingrid, my name is Eliana
hello, what's up?  how are you?  where are you speaking from?
fine, from Boston, yes
ah, how nice, and where are you from?
from Argentina, and you?
from Argentina, okay, I'm from Guatemala
ah, look how nice
yes
I've never been but I want to go to Pical
ah yes really pretty, I was there when, well I don't know, I must have been ten maybe, but I really liked it and I hope to go back although I was there until
I was seventeen but it's not, no, no, I would very easily go
ah look what a shame but well, not everyo-, no, you know all the places in your country
yes no, almost not and Guatemala is really little and to get to the capital it's about twelve hours by bus or an hour and a half by plane, but it's not very accessible to get to.
sure and tell me, what do you do in Philadelphia?
eh here, eh, we lived in Maryland and we moved here, my husband is in medical school and I graduated a year ago and now I'm working
ah good, great
yes
how long have you been here in the United States?
for ten years
sure no I know one
ah ah ah and what do you do here?
here I'm doing a post doctorate in genetics
ah yes of who what? ah ah ah that's good, that's good and how hard for me
sure no if everyone thinks that it's difficult but for me for example literature, someone talks to me about history and it sounds very difficult to me
sure that is depends eh my husband is eh how do you call the ones that are science oriented I mena that they like science I imagine like you and they have to eh
ah look
that what was your degree in in genet-, no it wasn't in genetic and well it was two I had one in bio chemistry and the other one in
in yes I think that, no no no cell biology
ah good
but he worked, he worked with his mentor foreign he was he was a specialist in genetic eh
ah so that
good and I say I don't know how they can learn so many things but I don't think I he likes it, he likes
sure yes it's like that I am dumb when I write I don't, I make many spelling mistakes and i am PhD but well everyone isl ike is also
I can't play the drums because no
sure and each one has their talent
sure that yes, and the topic well, the topic of the day is is interesting but well
but strange I I keep on thinking well really no I don't know what to say because eh I met my husband when I came here and we started to go out since high school
and then we got married and we have been married five years and five years so ten years in total
wow
and before this well I had for example a relationship since I was really young that isn't anything well, I got bored
yeah we didn't go out and so since it was difficult
sure ah no, just the contrary to you, I'm thirty and have been single for a year and to break up like this, no, but it seems strange because
yes
it's difficult to break up because to me it seems like it's always difficult
yes
to not be, like you're the bad person because tho whom you
sure yes because I imagine that it doesn't matter the kind of relationship, if you've shared time with someone, I imagine that it's like
it has to hurt, well, I put myself in the position that if one time I left my husband it would be, I don't know, very
no, no I can't imagine how difficult it would be
sure
because after sharing so many years, or whatever, it's a life
sure even if yes for example you stop loving him or have a problem
hmm
same it's the custom to live with him at his side for such a long time
sure
well for this if you stop loving, it will always hurt
always yes because because like even if something really ugly and you way well yeah, I, I don't love him, I don't want to live with this person but it's that eh
at least I say that it's ten, up until now it's ten years of my life with memories, with things that we share, with things that
that like that I alone and well, doing them without him would feel really really ugly, really strange
sure, yes, yes, it's weird, but sometimes, even if the subject is better, the other day we had to talk about, what was it?, women's rights, I don't know why but I've been here for only a year so there are subjects I don't know anything about
there are, oh well, I don't know either, I had to speak about that too, I believe it had to do about abusing women
yes
I had to talk about it for a while, I mean, I was once happy of not knowing too much about it because I've never been in that situation
sure
and I've never met anyone who is in that situation, oh well, it's weird because, because, there's always someone who's been there and there are lots of people that suffer because of that but
so, I didn't know what to talk about but I had to talk to a boy in Los Angeles and he works in the Courts, with cases like those
yes, oh
so, he, he explained to me what was done in cases of domestic violence and stuff like that
sure
so, I learned a bit with him
sure, sure, yes, it's interesting to talk to someone from another
yes
country, sometimes the subject is interesting and you start talking, I got to talk to a girl from Argentina, she was in Philadelphia too
aha, yes, oh okay
and she told me, I told her, I'm from Argentina but I live in Boston, you are the friend, she's friends with one of my friends
so, we started to talk about them and they told me that they saw you and that they talked about these calls, well, it was, so
that's good, you become friends, the mother of one of my friends, she's also taking part of this, I don't know, and I've had the chance to speak to her, she's from Mexico.
and here name is Olga, I believe, she's older but
yes
Eh well, you have to make twenty, twenty-five calls, no? she has thirty, already has like thirty and something and she loves it but she loves it because she says it's an experience, whether or not they pay you or don't pay you.
What she likes to do is speak with other people, share, because
ah.
But it's a, a very different experience, in that you speak with someone you don't know, who is very different, from other places, and, and, that is, it's interesting
if, if, in truth it's good that it's very interesting and now, I don't know, I hope, and that they keep doing it but it seems to me that, that no
eh you see, at times good, not once in a while to be honest eh, I am working here
ah
and I'm good on behalf of this, of this program, this project, and how I am obligated to participate
ah, ah
but, but at the same time I like it in itself that you share with one another
of course, and what is it that they want to see in this? that
well then, eh, what they, what they are studying ah, here with us, I'm from Guatemala, you are from Argentina
yes
and we speak Spanish very differently, I mean your accent, the words you use, how you use them
of course
So then this is that, what it is, what we need is to collect much, much information.
yes
this, what is recorded in the computer and later we transcribe it and it's like, for educating computers.
ah
eh, I don't know, like, like, that the those who are in computer science.
yes
they have their programs, but, the same, for any programs you first have to teach the computer, like, enter the information
sure
and since the internet sometimes has sites where they say you can translate
sure
so for everything this first you have to enter information and this is what they're doing
ah, how nice, how interesting because
aha, it's really really interesting
and it's like the next time they will to classes of Guatemalan Spanish, Argentinian Spanish, they'll say
sure, like because you realize that already in Microsoft Word when you want to translate or use Spanish it tells you
Argentinian Spanish, Mexican Spanish and so
sure
well in this way they can identify each each Spanish
sure, ah how nice
yes so this, this project and there's another project that's called mixing, and this involved like one hundred and fifty different languages
ahhh
and also, like, it's payed and it's also for people, example Chinese, who speak Chinese, or Russian, eh, there are rarer languages
ahhh how nice
but, but also really interesting
sure ah look, no the truth is that this is really interesting, and, is it cold there?
here in Philadelphia, there is such a crazy weather, that today for example, I was in 50 and was in lunch hour and it was a nice day
for a light jacket and the sun, there was no wind
Sure
But, it should be really cold in this time of the year
yes, here also, still in Boston, there should be
Mmm
And also know that we felt last year cold
And well, not even for Christmas, because regularly by Christmas you should use a huge jacket and you should be really protected and this time I was wearing
with just a sweater
sure, and did you see that it's always about the weather, because I remember dates and the clothes, right?
sure, sure
it's like if I have my birthday in October, the end of October
Mmm
and then, it might be hot and sometimes it might be cold
yes, that's like
and then, when I tell how is the weather on my birthday and I see some photos I'm with shirts and in other with a sweater
yes, in my case is not worth
I'm from August and it's always hot
Sure
always, there is always hot, at least in this area
sure
what I'm scared about now with the weather is that we've had really good weather in comparison to other years and I don't know what will happen here in February, if it will get really cold
sure
or will snow a lot because it sometimes happens that with the course of time, with the course of the seasons
sure yes what happens here you always say, will the weather be good?  no, it will be worse, here people are all pessimists
that it will be the worst year, that it will be the worst and
aye no
and it still isn't cold because it will end up being worse in February, this is what everyone says
and this is funny because I remember that I had a friend at University who would say to you, I took my
Aurelio from Washington D.C.
uh, Manuel from Orlando, uh, i think we spoke these past days, i
hey, it's true Manuel, how are you?
Very well, how are you?
how's everything going, is everything fine?
everything's fine, everything's fine, yeah
Oh, that's good
well, good, let's get to business, I'm listening
and I'll tell you something, these subjects they pick here, i don't
yes
uh, oh no, breaking up with a partner is something difficult man
yes
yes, yes, that about breaking up is something, you know, i don't know, on my, in my experience and what i have seen, it's something very hard
it's always hard, whether it's only a casual relationship, or a serious relationship
yes, yes, yes, it's still painful
sure, i mean always, there's always going to be a something awkward, do you know what i mean?, it's always going to happen, you know, something there that, well, there's always going to be something that makes people uncomfortable, do you know what i mean?
i have seen in a many cases, right?, co-workers and friends, where, in fact very close friends, that, uh, right now, well, they are
they're a couple but, uh, a year ago well, one of them was living with us and that's when his partner broke up with him and, well, that was a mess
it was, the man was completely devastated, i mean, hurt
yes
depressed and lost weight,that was a horrible thing
of course, of course, yes, yes that, well, look that I eh think the same that you, no, I cannot talk because of much experience because in that sense I have been more
more stable
aha
but yes, obviously I know cases even close cases, my siblings and and well, yes, it is a very painful situation and sometimes involves all the family, his as much as hers, right?
of course, hmm
however, even if you want it you should not exclude yourself
of course
eh, now well, eh I would say, no, they didn´t say that exactly in the introduction, but I do well and there is that we have an epidemic, so to speak, of divorces
I was reading that here in the United States the, the statistics show that more than a half the couples get divorced
oh, imagine that,
then, believe what it is happening, well, the only thing that goes through my mind is that definitively people don´t know each other or they are very immature
yes I think that too, there is like a, exactly, much immaturity and not only that, is like they go into a marriage as lets say, thinking that it is not a
is not a serious issue, well, it is a thing that, they take it lightly and well, if it works it works, and if it does not work well
sure, exactly, they go, they go with that mentality, with that predisposition to end quickly the relationship, I don´t know if the truth is that
yes, yes, the family therapists themselves and all the people who are linked to that are alarmed
of course, yes
but on the other, on the other side there are too, there are well, people that, I have worked with people, known people, specially when I lived in New York
that say that they are not interested in marriage, or that, both men and women
hmm
I met people that, well, women that were, well, lets say professionals, with a very successful career, that, well, they're not interested in
Yes
And that's very respectable, and i think that, well, it's a, lets say it's like something that has brought us the evolution of, uh, social evolution, i mean, and uh, uh
the woman's access to the job market
Uh huh
i think it's healthy in the way they know each other
right
because the saddest is to watch someone that doesn't know, lets say, cases of women that get married for some reason and that they knew that wasn't their destiny
Yes,
They didn't want to be there, or well, having children
Uh huh
That's the saddest
yeah, a bit pitiful, exactly, you know what else?, that, that i see a lot for example where i work, the music
uh, also homosexual relationships
that too, that too
that when the relationships end, i mean, uh, the couples,i have a lot of friends that are, uh, lesbian women or gay men
yes
And look, i, i mean, like they where heterosexual relationships, it's the same
no, and, and, and, exactly, and, and just at this show, of Dr. María, Ana María Polo, i don't know you have ever seen it sometime in the
of course, of course i have seen it
Well, there was a case, like those, where she pointed a case where even a woman filled a divorce because the husband was
and he was, excuse the redundancy, he was gay
I see
And then, she would tell that, there are people that takes 50 years to recognize
Figure that out
or recognize, and then, exactly, there are many casuals
sure, it's too much
but I think that all go for the same thing, when people assume that compromise, it must be serious, maybe it's not the moment , they are not mature
exactly, I think that that maturity
or lack
it's about maturity, you nailed it. I think the same, it's all about maturity, what people ends to do, in that moment
It's done like, without thinking it, like they are shoping
exactly
They liked, and they bought it, and that's it, do you understand?
exactly, and I say that initial attraction is really common, they magnify it and think that only the fact that, in that moment, they really like her
it's forever, but they don't sit to see other things and watch
mm, sure
if really it's the person they would like to be for the rest of the life, they don't
sure, that's the difference
yes, exactly, because we know that that first stage of being in love and passion, and all that is so fast and then, there must be other things, more important
yes, are you married mm Miguel?
yes
oh, me too
yes, it is, eh, he, so
me too
as I told you, actually I cant talk on my own experience because I have had very stable relations
mhm
but well ye, yes, I've lived other people's stories close
sure, yes I have lived it, I've been through it about five times, five serious relations I had before I got married
and well, my wife and I, we will be soon six years married, we have just been six years in December
honestly
mhm, well, not that good, we can't complain, not she or either me
yes, right
I won't say it is the perfect relation, because you know
oh no, it doesn't exist
doesn't exist
no, and whoever says so is lying, that's it, and there are amny who say so
right
so, you know he is lying
sure, but look, we help each other alright, but I have seen cases, my parents for instance, my parents divorced, it is a horrible story because
and really
not horrible, I say, something very, very interesting I normally a life, of, my brother yes, my sister and my brother are always there playing. They say no, you don't have to be together that
they're fo- that and fo- for as for and I say, but what it
no, I have
first already that isn't important to us because in, in fact I think that that never should have been important to us as their children
no, and, and, yes it's true and there he is
and, I, and of course and second, they already see
getting to a point of no return well so that
exactly, look, my, my, my sister is already married, imagine, my brother is, he has been married three times already, which
they touch in, in their relationship with my parents I told them, well and why didn't you get divorced since you should have been divorced
long before, before us
that really is how to say to them I hit the nail on the head because that's what's happening
of course, and he didn't see, and
ah
and an interesting thing, because they got divorced and later they got back together again and later they separated again, something something weird in fact, I just talked to my mom. Not much, not much is happening and about two hours ago she called me and was telling me that
that my dad's new girlfriend called her to insult her and
ah, no, but they're like kids again
they are, but I'm saying, but what that is is more
no but, but, I think that if you have to cut to the chase, and like the family therapists rightly say when a relationship is toxic.
exactly
that has to be decontaminated and the decontamination is that, the separation
sure
if not definite at least temporary
and better for the healthy, certainly, yes, yes yes, and You know? that doesn't only happen between couples you know that also, that can happen in any type of family relation
oh also, yes, yes, yes
that when those types of toxic relations exist between, between brothers and sisters or between you know? between, between brother let's say
mm
between kids and parents, any of those types of relations that exists, of those things
ah this is, no and, and what you point out is super important, because later if we repeat it to the couple well is that also in the heart of the home there is another type of relation
there too
sure, sure
people living together and and you pointed it out well, they are very strained relations very hard
exactly, true, and the majority of the people don't realize that then they live in a, in a how do I tell you, in a quarrel, you understand me, is
eh, like a guerrilla within the same family, and the people don't even know what it is, and that comes from, from that type of relation, you understand me? from
from toxic relations that happen before between the family, happen between a couple, between friends, also sure the friendship is a different issue because the friendship, well the people
well, cut off a friendship
yes,
more easily that a romantic relationship, or that a family relation, because
family, yes is exactly
but but I think that everything happens on a level in all on a level that happens I had to once end a relationship eh
friendship, but it wasn't something from the other world, also, I mean, we met for like, five years, we met in the University
And well, we had an impasse, and well, I said, this is not going anywhere and if we keep this, well
I mean, the hypnosis followed, and it had repercussions in anything, it grew and this is not going anywhere
It's better to cut this on the nice side
Mmm, yes, yes
I was, I mean
That it's a decision maturated sure
sure, because figure out if we are trying to keep a live thing that does not exist, that's the same it happens between couples, do you understand?
yes, and
when I moved here, for example, I left a girlfriend, a really serious one that I had in Venezuela
really?
and well, I had to left her, because I came her with
the
here, but I wanted to bring her here
Oh
but she didn't wanted, do you understand me?
that's other important thing, the circumstances, because
exactly, that was it, exactly, and in this case, it was the circumstance
Honey
Good evening
Good evening
hello, my name's Marco
How are you Marcos?
I'm in Philadelphia, and you?
I almost can't hear you
ah sorry, is this better?
yes
okay, eh, I'm Marco and I'm in Philadelphia
And I'm Honey and I'm in Florida.
ah, hello Honey, eh, let's see, breaking up, if it's difficult or not, and I imagine that, this depends on how close it was to begin with
als-
I agree that with age it's easier or more difficult.
depending on the experiences that you had before I think that, I think that and yes, with the age or it can be that the you react more strongly or more
that it's more difficult to break up o sometimes for a long time already living in the world and knowing how it works, and practically hoping for something like this to happen
I don't know why because I have my parents who are basically all ages
yes
and some not for the age but for maturity, I have people who also you see the point of view for the age that you have, well they stay with partners that they shouldn't
hmm yes
because, he is afraid of starting, or getting alone, or anyone they have
yes
but, it's easier to, in base of my experience, I was a teenager and it was easier, you know, I'm up and down
but, as they got older, it's difficult to know new people
yes, that's definitively true, but, remembering also, that being teenager, the emotions, not necessarily strong, but
at least, more colorful
exactly
when, you are a teenager, it's, breaking up with the couple you can imagine a teenager talking about wanting to killing themselves
but, at that age, it was something strong
How?
because if I remember right the loves from high school were more healthy, this was going to be for all life
yes, yes
and you know, I want to be with him, and you get so involved and you didn't sit to analyze the pros and the cons of the situtation
yes
and after you start growing and getting up earlier with bad experiences, you get more realistic and the situation changes, is not the same
how would it be, the passion of being in high school was really innocent
yes, I remember my friends, when I went out with them and they kept the same girlfriend from three years ago, two years ago and I think that they are all married, but none is married with that person they dated for two years when we were together
It was like a practice, let's say
I think that as you get older, you get experience of not having
the same social activities you had in high school
Uh huh
I mean, that there were much more people of your same age, basically with your same tastes, then you grow up, you go to work, you meet people from different ages
Yeah, you know, i think that age itself is something
different
merely, merely mental because, uh, for example, there are people of old age, lets say, like fifty or sixty i mean that's not very old but
That feel like a lot less than that, they feel younger, you always remember the father of that classmate, uh, that came out and played football with us, uh
That the way they, uh
they are like young at spirit
that are young of spirit, but at the same time there was always that people that was twenty years old but was serious and stayed at home and didn't go out
It was like an older people, two person can be together in a relationship or
yes, because in my case, i never had the chance to go out with people of my own age, i found them very immature
i always, i, I'm always with, i get along fine with older people too, uh, people, people way older but i always got along, i get along fine with people
younger, for example, i have some friends, I'm thirty years old, uh, i have some friends that are twenty one, twenty two, that i understand the way they think and i get along fine with them
Very uh
I can barely hear you
oh, I'm sorry, i get along fine with younger people, almost as much as older people, like people older than me are almost the same in their behavior
i don't know, because i have had, of the several relationship, once i had the brilliant idea to date a person much younger than me, i'm, let's see, i just turned thirty two
Oh
I still refuse age, but thirty two
yes
and, he was very mature for everything
yes
but in relation with the relationship ideology. there were somethings that made me look at him like okay What era are you from?
hmm
because it did not fitted with the age
yes, yes
and you know in relation with business he was very mature. but as to the relationships it was like he didn´t understand because I have children
yes
and then I had one
hmm
and was a thing, it was like my head could not explain to him. that you are in an age when the parties don´t
are not so important like when you are twenty.
yes, of course
so I was very happy with my relationship my home my son, my partner.
hmm
where he was, but sometimes I thought that he wanted to be with his friends that he wanted you know, and explain to him that thing of the age gap, okay I understand that you are much younger than me
hmm
and maybe that is part of what happens to you there is a part of your life you have to live and that I have lived.
But if you are going to be in this kind of relationship, you must understand that I am not going to be with you because I have a child.
yes,of course
look, you know, you are going to have to choose what is most important for you, I mean, or if you are ready to take this type of relationship, or
if you need more time to live your life.
yes
that is where I found the biggest difference, and leaving that relationship was much more difficult than any other relationship, because it was a matter of, like
I now have so many years, I'm going to begin, go back to meeting people, it's like returning and I'm going to put it like that
if I, eh, I live with my fiancee with whom I've been with like four years or something, eh, she has a son, eh, I've been with her since her son was just one year old
eh, she was married briefly, briefly eh, and then divorced, I knew her before the, the, before she had her son, eh
and the, the difference between her before her son and afterwards is a world apart
it's, it's very, very different, or is it that before you had your life for you
yes
and this is difficult to explain with couples
yes
because then jealousy comes in, things you know come in, a series of things come in, what I'm explaining with age it's easier, it's more difficult for everyone the compromises that you have to
mm
let's see, for me it's difficult to explain that before I became a mother, I could love you and adore you, but the moment that you interfere, with my relationship with my children, or my ability to be a mother to my children
yes, yes
you are putting me in the position of choosing between one or the other, and I can guarantee you which one I'm going to choose
yes eh
and I've had relationships where I've had to leave because of this
there is no, no animal eh that you can come near to, to their young, the children of, it's the moment that is most
fights stronger and the moment it can harm you the most
and do you know what I have seen, generally it is about stupid things that sometimes I think about if those stupid things could bother my son´s father
for example, the girl is two, she is naughty the boy is an angel, he is eleven and he is an angel, better son he could not be
put the younger one is sent by the enemy she knows as a bible and is very close to me she knows she needs attention and
and it is a thing I have to explain, I understand it is bothering, but she is a baby. she will grow up and the naughty behavior will be gone little by little.
even to me, there are there are times when I don´t understand that relationship that I don´t understand entirely, no, no
you are talking very low and I can barely hear you
ah pardon me eh, it is that pardon me I have a little problem here with my telephone okay
Hello, my name is Miriam.
Hello, how are you, my name is George, I live in New York.
Hello
How are you?
Fine, George, thanks.
Good. where are you calling from?
I live here in Toron-
Where?
In Toronto, Canada.
In Toronto?
Yes
Really?
Yes
Mm, I went over there like six years ago
Yes, you were by here?
yes In Louisiana
And you didn't like it?
yes, but I was studying English there for three months, and you only
Oh, I see how nice.
yes, hm mm And what, what, what do you think of today's topic?
The breakup of couples. I think that when the relationship is really deteriorated, when there's been a lot of lack of respect,
yes
Already, there's no trust, is better to break up eh.
yes
But it's very hard making that decision, because sometimes the couple is so used to each other eh, is very hard getting out of a
Hm
of a circle.
yes
Eh, and the people get very used to it. And the person has to be very strong to
yes, Hm
to make the decision of leaving.
yes, yes
And, And, the age, eh, I think that already, perhaps when the person is younger, is more
Easier.
easier breaking up, I would already say that. Because younger you have like more friends, you see the future differently, right.
yes
Like an older person sometimes thinks that already they are not going to find more.
yes
That its' already the last
And he's right of down
because you're already older, and no one will every trust this person again.
Hmm, And what do you think, for example when there are kids?
Kids, oof, this is really difficult.  It's even worse.
yes Hmm
Yeah, because sometimes, but it's a mistake, I'll tell you, it's a mistake because people sometimes stay together who don't have love, just for the kids.
yes
But they actually really hurt the kids.
Hey, you know what?
Tell me.
I've finally found someone who agrees with me
Yeah, you agree?
totally
yes
This is my point of view.
yes
I always say sacrifice, what sacrifice.  I think that it's sacrificing them.
It's them, yes because they realize.  They perceive everything, kids aren't stupid at all.
right?  yes, Sure, hmm, they are the most affected.
Yeah, yeah, and then they suffer,
Hmmm  hmmm
and look for a relations that's, a man if it's a woman, looks for a mam like her dad, who doesn't love her, who doesn't respect her
so this, the cycle, the
You repeat
the chain continues.
yes, do you think that it repeats?
And it repeats, many times it repeats.  It's really true that the, the
Hmm
child of alcoholic parents
yes
takes the same, or the, the children of abusers, abuse themselves and others.
yes
or are abused.
Hmm
And abuse the other kids.  Many pedophiles have been, eh, abused themselves.
Hmmm yes, yes.  Many eh, cases, yes.
Sure, like, so this chain continues, to not be that the person
Hmm
what do I know, ends in therapy, or goes to a church there.
Hmmm.
and there, there are groups that help.
yes.  What what has been your particular experience?  Well, I don't know if you want to tell me or something.
yes, my experience in particular,
Have you had?
what I said, I'm one of those people who are, I'm a coward,
yes
and I almost see a relationship that doesn't have love or anything,
yes yes
and in the three, I'm forty, but in the three relationships I've had in my life,
yes Hmm
I didn't finish them.  But yeah the relationship has been really
yes
already empty of this love, and I waited until the person told me, you know, this is where we've come to.
Like, but, But did you realize?
yes, I realized, but it was still pretty hard.
yes
And it's strange.  And by a mistake you think you, should keep going.
yes, I think that, they're relationships
Because
that come relationships of permission, yes.
sorry?
There are relations that becomes sickening
I don't listen to you
That are relations that end up being sickening, I mean
yes, yes, it's true
yes, and then, they don't get along and have problems every day, I know children from families of these kind, where they don't get along, but I have seen that the kids suffers the most
than, children from separate people, right?
Yes, it's true
Mmm, and do you currently have a partner?
Well, I'm now separated
yes
Oh, but we are like that with the dad of my kid for six years, we were together and separated
Yes, I see
But, I, now, I'm now going to a church, a lot
yes
then, I think that it's becoming me stronger
Mmm
So, I took the decision that I can't keep being with him, unless he changes
yes, where are you from?
I'm from Peru
Oh, I see
And you
Me, Colombian
yes, I was going to say

because nothing happened, I didn't have kids, but
yeah
unfortunately, my son´s dad, I have to see him, all the time. And argue, and fights and all that.
Ah, no, that´s, that´s really awkward
Then, uhm, it´s enough. But that will have to wait, wait until my son grows up
yes
Until my son
No, I mean, I, I, relationships have been really
really what?
They´ve improved
Improved?
Later, yes, after all the problems, and all that, you have a good relationship, let´s say
There are people who can´t live together
inside Hm

yes
I have sister that, she has huge fights with her, with her husband

But now that they are divorced, they get along better. They´re friends

I'm unemployed now
Yes
And there are some jobs that are ridiculous and pay very little
Uh huh, what are you gonna do about it
And so, it's a little tough
Yes
And you, how is it going over there?
No, for me, fine. Since the beginning, like always no, as it happens to all of us, no. But now fine. Well I'm a, a systems engineer, and I've been with the Internet, and all that.
and things are going well, hm
Hm mm Hm mm
How did you find out about this program?
I also once went on the Internet, looking for work, and I saw it there. I applied,
For one, in what site did you see it?

Hm. okay. Aha, well.
Mm, but I couldn't say one hundred percent. It was in that or in Joe Cool
And how many calls, and how many calls have you made?
I'm just in, eh, eh, I think that it's already the eighth one.

Ah, we are, we are more or less the same in that also.
And you?
Ah well I'm also like by there, everywhere. Yes because
And will they pay?
yes, of course
but and how are we going to, are you counting the calls?
yes you well
Hello.
yes, hello?
Hello.  What's up?  My name is Felicidad.
Ah, hello.  My name is Blanca and I live in Arizona.
Ah, how are you?  I live in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Uh-huh.  I live in Phoenix in the Mirage
Ah, and where are you from?
From Colombia.
From Colombia, ah.
yes.
I'm from Argentina.
yes.  yes.  I can tell.  In the tone of your voice.
Hmmm.
Uh-huh.
yes.  So you, well, the topic was the break up of couples.
yes.  so difficult
I don't know what, what do you think?
ah I think that last week I talked about the same topic, no.
Oh, well neither.
They repeat, right?
It could be, it could be.  If you want to we can talk about something else.  No problem.
No, no it's ok.  I don't have a problem.  I don't have a problem talking about this.
Good.
What do you think about breaking up?
Um.  I think that it's always difficult to break up with someone even if it's for reasons that you don't love him more or if or if
something happens or the person did something to you.  It's always difficult.
Hmm.  yeah.
So. I suppose that it has, it has, it's more complicated when you're older than when you're younger.  Because things change. But no, no.
Go on.
It doesn't seem to me that any moment is easy.  For me it never was easy to break up with someone.
yes.  I think the same.  Ah, no, it's not easy.  it's never easy breaking up with someone, eh, where there's a long term relationship because I think that there are very volatile relationships.
and that are like that.
Hmm. yes.
temporary and not for anything.  But I also think that you, um.  It's very difficult and more so if you're young.
Sure.
Right?
Hmm.
It's more difficult to do when you're young.
yes.
It's very very difficult.  Eh, Well you have to learn, I think, to live.  With what happens in life, no?
yes, yes, yes, yes. You may be right. Mmm, I guess until it gets more complicated,I think that if you, I don't know, break off with a couple when
when you haven't been with that person too long, or when there are no children to think of, or when, it will always be easier, right? It is different when you have
been married for years or whatever, I mean, figure, it can get much more complicated
Well. I'll tell you about my own experience. So, before getting married, I have been married for five years and I only stayed with my husband
yes
five months as boyfriends. And we got married. But, however, I had had two boyfriends before. One for nine years and the other for eight. The one of the nine years
was my first boyfriend
yes
and it was very hard for me to break off with him, actually I didn't do it, it was him that broke off with me when coming here and so
it caused me a terrible crisis. But it was because I was very young, very immature
Mm
I thought he was my one and only love
Sure
but now, eh, with this one I broke off six years ago, before coming here. Mm. I was the one that broke the relation, and I think that
It didn't hit me so hard, actually I didn't feel it at all
Oh
It is, I think it is because you are already mature, you have the experience, the capability of deciding what is good for your life, what is good and what is bad, what benefits you and what doesn't
Although there is love, you think more with the head than with the heart, when there is
Sure
maturity, because when you are young, I tell you, I almost died with my first boyfriend
Sure.  Sure.  In all ways, everything more like more passionate, more than with
More intense, right?
Sure, sure, sure.  The first experience already happened that also helped you to manage it.
yes, for all these things.  Ah.  They help a lot, they help a lot.
Sure.
this helps a lot.  I think that that yes it's difficult to break up.  Whatever the circumstance but there are factors that help it to be more bearable than others.
Sure.  Sure.  Sure.  yes. yes. yes. yes no I agree.  I agree with what you say.  So in breaking up I don't have.  I'm married here four years but
eh, when I brought but but yes you're right.  This is easier, let's say, when you had an experience when you already know what you want and these things.
Hmm.
yes. yes. yes.
yes.
It makes sense.
Uh-huh.  Well, no, no it's not that I'm twenty two, I'm speaking from my experience, it can be that for other people it's not as easy.  Because it can be that
that the first love was something without feeling that has arrived and then another that fills it more.
Sure.
So it will be more difficult for that person.
Sure.
Getting out of this relationship.  This also has to be taken into account.
Sure. Sure.
Because there are many things.  I think that there are many things.  It could be yes, it could be no.  It's difficult for a person to get out of a relationship.  It depends on so many things.
Sure. Sure. Sure. And you have been married for four or five years?
It will be five years, yes.
Oh, look, and do you have children?
I have two babies
Oh, how nice
I have two babies, a boy that is, the boy is three years old
Oh
And the girl is one year and a half
What are their names?
Alejandro and Elizabeth
Oh, beautiful names
Ah. I have two crazy dwarfs there
Mm
They are crazy like myself
Do you enjoy being a mother?
Oh, I am happy. I am happy of being mother. Besides I was mother very old. I am already thirty-seven years old, so I was mother old already
yes
Si I already lived my time, my moments, I already enjoyed
Sure
I went to university, I graduated. I mean, I had my time for myself. And afterwards, when I had already graduated and realized myself as a professional, then
because you don't always realize. Eh. But at least I have already finished my studying objective
Sure
The first part of it, right? because I still have one more part. Eh, I decided having my babies
yes yes. Sure. Sure, more or less the same happens to me. I have been married for four years. I am twenty-seven, twenty-six years old
Mm
I haven't finished studying yet. But I've always thought that as soon as I finish studying I will have a child. And yes, with a station similar to yours but some time ago
Uh uh
So, yes, we will see it
Yes
We'll see what happens
I didn't marry before for the same reason, because I thought, marrying implies devoting to the husband, and having children
Sure
and then start the arguments because you don't want to have children yet and I feel like I want to live
Sure
So I, I lived, I enjoyed, did my stuff and well, mm. I formed myself professionally and afterwards, luckily I got married, right?
yes
So. Mm. Because I, let me tell you, I as a matter of fact came to this country escaping from marriage, because i came on my own
Mm
because it was a senseless relation, kind of
Sure
You know, i came here like running away from it, and it turns out that i hadn't even been here for a year when i met my husband and after a few days we moved in together and five months later we married
Oh, that's very odd
Look, after all those years of relationships, with two previous boyfriends that were, well, my previous relationships
Right
I was always a girlfriend for a long time
Yes, yes, yes, but you found him and that's it
Uh huh, and that's it.
And
He was the one
Very well, very well
He's keeping them for me here
No, no, i married young when we came here together
Uh huh
So, uh, we kinda started a life together but before marrying, we agreed not to have children. Him, my husband knows that
i want to finish my career and get a degree and
Oh yeah
And have all of that before if possible. If they come, perfect. I love
Uh huh
children, but yes, i can plan it better.
Sure
So, we're all set before having it. But in a country, when i don't have my family here, well, that's more complicated
Look, it's very difficult, believe me, it's very difficult, i
yes,
I have dedicated to my children, i have had the luck, but it's very hard, it's very hard like that when you, i have wanted to do something at this time, but i think about the kids
How I'm gonna leave them, what i'm leaving, what i'm going to do... a lot of things.
Yes
Very hard
I'm gonna work
No, i don't, i don't work
Um
I don't work
It's OK
I'm here at home with my children all the time
And, do you like it?, do you like to be with the kids or what's the matter?
Well, uh, at this time, i love to be with them at this age
They're certainly fun
Uh, yes, i think that this are the most important years, so i thought, well, i already worked, i worked until i got pregnant
And i said, well, lets go, and when i was halfway through my first pregnancy, i said "i'm not gonna work anymore", uh, my husband told me "no"
"stop working already", and well, i went home, i stayed at home, and i had the kids, and there
I'm still at home, but i want to do something
Sure
I want to study now, like doing a specialty or something, because there's always, like you still miss something
i thought it was over, but no, you always want something else
yes, yes, of course, and besides you surely have met at the kindergarten, at school and other stuff, right'
Uh uh. I'm starting to be alright, alone and that, i say, a time where they
Sure
are studying, i can work. I'll do something for myself
Sure
Um, yeah, yeah. I [was] very [interested] in their first years, but later on, when they want to go to school and on kindergarten and all that, well i
you can dedicate to yourself again a little bit
Yeah, yeah, and my mom says the same thing, lets say, she stopped working when she had us, i have two more sisters, the three of us
Uh
But, it's like that, my youngest sister was like eleven, twelve or thirteen years old, uh, yeah, like forty, yeah, and she was like "yeah, you're old"
that she didn't had to do, because she had nothing else to do since
Um
Hello!
Hello
Hello, who's speaking?  hello

In Manhattan
Oh, Manhattan, oh, that's good, so we both live here in New York, that's good, well, and how do you like it, what do you think about the thing, about receiving phone calls?
Fine
Yeah, uh, do you want them to call you and bother you at any time trying to sell you stuff?
Yes
Well, so, what do you think?
It's good
yes
And what do you think?
Well, i, i think it bothers me, and i don't want them calling me at any time selling me crap i don't want to buy, if i want
to buy something I'll go and find it, not you calling me and bothering me
Right
And on the internet, do you like to receive offers too?
A little bit, yeah
Yeah, and have you bought something over the internet?
Uh, sometimes
Yes
aha
And you don't have, don't, don't worry that they can get your private information or
yes,
mm, okay Well and then, eh, and by telephone you've also bought things by phone when they've called you
no
No, ah, okay, how nice And well, what else, what do you think because we have to talk a while, and if you are only going to say yes or no without giving your opinion
Well then we are not going to get to the twelve minutes hello,
Hello?
yes,
Hold on a moment?
yes,
Hello!
yes,
Hello, how are you?
hello, yes, fine, And how are you?
Fine, look my cousin says: what's the topic?
Ah, the topic is receiving emails
Tell me
yes, if it doesn't bother you to receive emails For eh, that they are selling you things.
Oh, the, the, the spam
Oh, yes, yes, yes, what, what do you think of
Ah, what do you think of the email they send to ...? Ah, of the email?
yes,
Oh Of the spam
mm
no, I don't like them too much
mm And receiving calls by telephone or when they are selling things neither
ah, I hang up.
Ah, well, yes, me too because sometimes they call me they call me when, always when one is
yes, and they cut off the call, you have to hang up
Eating Right? And then yes,
and you have to, and they charge the calls
yes, aha, yes, exactly, also So, Well Then we covered email, we covered about the telephone
yes
Eh, And well what else mm
you answer them And then hang up?
I do I, I, I, I with, with, I, answer and then I hang up because I don't want, like I told you they normally call me when
we are eating, and it bothers me that they are bothering me when I'm eating
And right now they made this call to you
what?
yes, right now, they called, were you having lunch?
No, well, no, not yet, I have long around seven, I mean, in a little bit but the starts are just beginning, so, this one
I mean, I'm participating in this research so, I see the call coming on the phone and so I know it's coming and I pick up, because I know that, I know what it is about
aha
So, so, it's a bit different from when I get other calls, and I receive calls at night, mostly while I'm sleeping, and we often go to bed early.
And they call you around nine in the evening
yes,
yes, so, it's a bit of a problem, it's a bit hard
I don't like to be called at night because sometimes, I'm worried because, I don't know where are getting my number from
yes, that too, yes well, the exchange numbers with other people and they buy lists so, it's kind of dangerous because you have personal information and
that bothers me too, so, but, you've got to be careful with your stuff and don't give too many information over the phone because there are lots of evil people out there
aha
So, how long have you been here from Chile?
ahm ah, about fifteen years

Hi, good afternoon.
Eh, Good afternoon.
yes, eh, my name is Sean. I'm speaking from Toronto, Canada.
Ah, How are you? This is Manuel speaking, I'm in Orlando, Florida.
Orlando, Florida. How is it over there in Orlando?
Ah, no. Well, the weather, we- we-
Aha.
Although, at night, well, in this season it's lower. But, well, obviously not so much as in the North.
I lived, well, I was for a few months for like an hour to the, to the East of Orlando, over ther by, eh, near where the Kennedy Space Center is.
I'm at about two,
Ah, very good, near
near, yes.
yes. Aha.
yes, there'a beach that's very, eh, very nice, that is to the North, right to the North of the, the Kennedy.
yes. yes, I think it's a nice beach.
yes, it must be. It's like, it's like, it's all virgin, well. All, eh, no, without, without anythin that is. Nothing of, of, eh,
yes.
not shops, no restaurants. Only, eh, virgin land, well, it's, it's, I think it's the prettiest thing that, that I saw when I was in Florida.
yes, very quiet. yes, like that. I have been there, well, it's that one, the one that you, I think it's that one, very quiet, a place that's very, very, very quiet.
yes. One ha- one has to pass, ah, near a, eh, near a reserve of the, of,
W-we-
for the animals and nature to get to the beach.
Eh, it's correct.
yes.
And good, well, entering in the material, Sean, well, I hear, tell me, what are your thoughts?
On, On what?
About the material, about the topic of the day.
Ah, about the topic, ah, I almost didn't notice it, I almost never talk about the topic.  They told me that it's only a suggestion, that's all.
But, I think that, What's the topic, about spam, no?  About
Eh, yes, yes.  Eh, the spams, yes.
Aha, for the,
About spams, if you've ever bought something from unwanted emails, what you think.
No, and this spam, I almost always delete them.  No?  Then, then.  Never, I don't even read them, they almost always have an attachment, and some virus, this,
that can be, that can damage.  No?
Correct-
yes, eh, Have you bought something through the spam, or?
No, no.  Never, never, yes I make many transactions on the internet, but never from spam.  I'm also really afraid of them.
No.  Aha.
Eh, well my account is with AOL, and they, well they have a series of filters that you can activate, and so,
they come, they come nevertheless, you're not safe.  And well, obviously, the mail whose origin I don't know, I, I erase it.
Right
Now, they ask if there should be a program similar to, the "don't call", i don't know if it exists in Canada, so, well, there was, a program was installed for
you sign up, and after that, they don't call to offer you anything over the phone
Yes, yes
I have it, and, well, i think it's excellent, and i think they should do the same with the e-mails
Yes, and it, and it works, uh, it's not a, uh, a, it's not a scam itself, they they just gather your phone numbers to request
to request, at the request of everyone that signed up to this... to not receive calls
Yes, yes, it's worked here, it's very good to me. In fact, i couldn't stand the phone calls here, to my house phone, offering me, well, a series of things i don't need. I was sick of it
i signed up and, of course, of course it works, they never called me again
Right, i don't know in Canada
Uh, i think that, that, uh, with the spammers, the, the thing is that there's like a mafia behind that, and there's people who's earning a lot of money on that
And, well, i don't know, they don't want to stop it, because, imagine
Yes, i, uh
It's thousands and thousands, millions and millions of, of spam, that they drop everyday all around the world, we all get them.
Yeah, can you imagine the traffic, well, uh, the, the internet resources that, uh, that they need just to, for spam
Yes
Yes, that's a, uh, that's a, uh
And
How can i say it?
On the other hand, i think it's also very unfair, to me, that they're making money on your data, with your data, your address, your stuff
And, and you don't perceive any of this.  Well, then, so, they pay us a percentage too, to manage all this personal data.
Aha, yes, yes, for example, I don't know, the United States, ask for your social security number if they want some paperwork from the bank, some paperwork from,
from, whatever, wherever it's necessary.
Right, right.  Exactly.  Because, it's, besides, there's another more serious case that can be associated with this, this topic, and that's identity theft, that this, here,
every time, well, more, more dangerous.  Many people have been victims of this identity theft.
yes, yes.
And, well, I don't see that they're working, really, many, with respect.
Aha.
And, you know that they're completely mafia companies, people who are making a lot of money with this.
yes, I.
Stealing identities, and buying, well, everywhere.
yes, and well, yes, I think, well, someone has to be making money, I don't know, there are many people who are assholes, well, who
Much money, yes.
see this spam and says, ah, this is true.  It's worth it that I'm going to grow a meter if I buy these pills, or,
this are, so, but, but follow.  yes, yes, no one had, to ask, there money, there wasn't, ah
Right.  But, look, what happens, I see that there are still many people who are really deluded, really innocent.
Aha.
How is it possible that they call me, X, an they say, you have just won a cruise, that costs five thousand dollars, so, it starts
please, give me all your data, including the name of your card, How will I do this?  One moment.  It's obvious that no one is going to give me a cruise.
yes.
And, and there are people that fall for it, because we see it in the news, people that let themselves get scammed.
Aha.
And I don't, honestly, is that I don't understand how they can be so gullible.
Well what I, maybe, the only thing I've heard, well, I have some friends that have left, they are of, of timeshare
Ah, but, that is very different, yes, very different.
They give you, yes, a vacation, but you have to be in a, for three hours so that
No.
to-
That, is very different, because I also have acquaintances in those programs. Is very different, because they pay an annual fee
Aha
and they are supposed to, to register, for the place they want, they have selected it months before so, so they take them into account. That is not that
I decide to go today, I don't know, to Mexico, and already, in eight days I'm there. No, you are not going to get anything, because there are many people ahead of you.
Aha.
Is, is very different. But, the truth, is that I don't know. You are there in Canada, in what city did you tell me?
In Toronto. I came here for the vacations, but I live in Vancouver, ah, British Columbia.
Ah. Really? And, and do you have Latin American origin, well, or, or your parents?
yes, part, eh, half, from my mother.
Ah,
But I grew up, almost, purely here in Canada. But, also there in Mexico, in the -DF, in, and in Acapulco, eh, I lived and studied.
Ah, no. You've been around a lot.
Yeah, uh, and where are you from?
I'm from Colombia, I'm an immigran. I've been living here for nine years now
Right
Uh, i lived in New York and now, a year ago, here in Orlando
And, why, uh, did you, did you, did you find it better there  in, in, in Florida than in New York?
Uh, no, no, you see, i had problems with the weather
Oh
I had a lot of problems with the cold, i started getting a severe allergy, that degenerated into asthma, so, well, that's when the doctor advised me to search for a warmer weather
Oh
And, well, i was there for seven, almost eight years until i decided to come live here, and yeah, regarding the weather, it was an improvement, well, much better. But
No, New York City is unbelievable, i love it, that's, well, that's why it's the world's capitol, right?
Yeah, i don't know that, i have to know that, I'm very eager to, to see it
It's wonderful, i love it, well, it's too bad that the weather, well, i couldn't, but
Right
It's an amazing city, there's so much to do, so much to see, the cultural life is intense, well, i find it very amusing
Yeah, specially now, they say that in Christ- in Christmas, New York City Gets more
Yes, and in New York, well, you see people from all over the world, from wherever, and just by using the subway
You're there watching the world resume, you turn to the sides and see people of every colors, of every size and every expression
It's very funny
Yeah, here in Toronto it's, it's almost the same, right?, but not, not so big. There's people from everywhere here in Toronto
Yes, oh, i, i love all of that, the, uh, the diversity
Yes, yes, it's just, uh, uh, it can cause trouble, for example, they keep to themselves, right?, in a, uh, neighborhood, and i don't know
they don't hear from, from the outside world. And that's why the, the new, the new immigrants come here and they don't learn English well, and after that they don't, they don't know the resources, uh
Yes
that are there to help them
Yes, yes, well, but, but there are also programs to correct that or, i mean, to assimilate them in some way, not to let yourself get run over, rolled over
Right
Because i think that you have to preserve your essence, what you are
yes, of course
Yes, and, well, there are a lot of cultures that prove that. A  Jew is a Jew wherever he's standing.
Uh huh
What ever corner of the world he's at, he's a Jew. But likewise, he, he assimilates his environment, for what, for what it's worth, the language, uh, the costumes
But, in his private being, he's still a Jew, just like a Chinese, and Indian. So, that's ok, because after that, imagine if we all were so alike, doing the same, thinking the same
Yes
The world would be really boring
Yes, yes, of course. Sure, on the contrary, but you shouldn't have, for example, that problem they have in France, uh, that's the other extreme, that, uh
Oh, no, no, no
That they're completely isolated right?
Because, it's terrible, terrible, that you also see it here sometimes, what they call "ghettos", but you know, that's more because of the lack of opportunities, it's because the people is being rejected since they're little
Right
People getting put into a corner, and, and the governments have done a little bit to end that. So, they're still being exploited heavily. But,
yea.
but, it hasn't been so, that they've wanted, it's that they've been obligated to do that,
yea. And because of economic factors, or
or racial. You know that discrimination is really ugly, and, and, there are some people who are really racist.
yea. Yes, more than anything, well
No, well, no, it's people, to me it doesn't seem to matter a whole lot, well, the color of your skin doesn't matter, man, well, more important.
The most important is what's inside, your values, the way you see the world, and all that.
yea. Yea, that's, it- that's the problem, well, like that with the ha- with hunger, and, and, and the, and poverty, well
Hello, Aurelio from Washington -DC
Hi, Adrian's speaking from Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
Ah, hi, how are you?
yes Fine and you?
Very good thanks.
A, little cool by Washington, or no?
Ah, is cold now. The cold is very pleasant.
yes, here more than pleasant is a little painful, but
Aha, I can imagine.
yes
Look, and ah, have you ever bought something by, through this type of marketing?
No, nor, nor do I intend to either.
Pardon?
I don't intend to either, I never did it, nor will I ever do it.
Ah me neither, and I tell you, eh, I've received many offers of buy here, buy there. You know, they are always sending you things. But, ah, no the
To buy Viagra and
Eh, ah, that's another thing. Buying Viagra.
and
Or, eh, enlarge, your, your eh,
Your, your penis, yes.
big your penis, with, look it returned too much. Every day, I receive, look, like tons of those, of those emails. And
yes, my wife always tells me, why do they send me this, if I don't have a penis, but
My, my wife also tells me the same thing, What's more, at work is the same thing. My female coworker says the same thing. Why do we have to receive this
if we don't even have a penis.
To enlarge it, yes.
I tell you, I have bought things on the internet, but not because they have sent them like that by, what they call in English, spam
But rather well, that I get on the internet and I buy things, you understand me,
yes yes, in, in normal things, yes.
Exactly, yes yes, but no, sometimes, you know that another thing, that they send me a lot, mortgage offers.
yes
yes, that to do your mortgage, that do your mortgage, what I already do is erase it, I don't pay attention to it. Well, imagine, if one starts paying attention to those things, forge it.
One goes crazy.
No, the problem is that someone buys from them, if not they wouldn't do it, is for sure someone has to buy from them.
You think somebody buys from them? I don't, look, I really don't know anyone who has bought something like that.
And but if not, they would stop doing it. Yes, if not it would be, if not, if not it would be some one hundred thousand, some, I don't know, of how much, of a million,
but somebody has to buy from them. If not they wouldn't do it, No, no, they wouldn't waste the time and effort in sending all those emails.
Well certainly, you're right, you're right, because is true, if not, they wouldn't send them, exactly.
I suppose that it is like, that it's like the illegal drugs, that any other
That
kind of strange thing. If there is no if nobody bought it the problem wouldn't exist, right, but
Exactly, you are right, you are right, yes, yes, yes. I'll tell you what, I guess they send millions of that kind of messages, right?
And then I guess, I don't know, if the on- if they send one million and the one percent answer, then we are talking of, how much? one thousand?
yes
Or ten thousand?
Ten thousand
Ten thousand, figure
It's a lot, it's
right, a lot, right, you are right
At five dollars each, it is a lot, yes
Hmm mm, listen man, this is incredible. The other day, I don't know, I'm gonna tell you a story, because, eh, something very interesting happened to me.
The other day I got one of those messages. This one to buy something, I don't remember, I think it was a telephone service. But I just got the message
And deleted it. That was in the office. I deleted it. I didn't pat any attention to the message. One month later, I get the telephone bill in my office,
and there is  a charge. Twelve dollars, for voice-mail service. So I called and tolde them, look this and that, you are charging me this service
that we don't have. Oh yes, that is a service that somebody called Aurelio ordered on the Internet. I tell him ,no, I haven't ordered anything
Oh yes, you did. Then they started, I guess, looking for the records they had, and told me, oh yes, we sent you a message and then you
ordered, and I said no, I didn't order anything, all I did was deleting the message. Oh, when you delete it our computer automatically
takes your message and all your data and that's why are charging you for it. Oh, well then, don't charge it because that we don't even
have it here, and I have never used it, so please I am not going to pay for this. But look,  that's how they are doing it. I didn't even
But, what company is the one that did that?
right, I didn't even open it, I just deleted the message, and their computer automatically takes my data
No, I don't think so, no, it should be, what happened was that those emails, they are more than spam, it's a scam of some sorts, some type of scam, but
Oh, sure, yes, yes, it has to be, that's why.
Oh, the, the email says, if you don't reply, we will activate it or something like that, oh
Exactly, that's why I called and then I immediately deactivated it because otherwise, imagine what would have happened if I don't get, if they keep on charging me. Oh, it was twelve dollars per month.
for a service, oh, and they were charging me for it, how can that be, I supposedly had signed up for the service, it was a service of
voice mail for my phone and it turns out that, no, I didn't even own a phone at home. In my house we don't have a phone, we only have cellphones, my wife and I.
And this service was being charged to a telephone bill from my job, a voice mail service  for my home, I don't even have one!
And I said, no, no, no, this is a mistake, please, and they were like yes yes we are sorry, it's a mistake, we've made a terrible mistake.
we've made a terrible mistake, she told me. So, please, forgive us, this no, you don't have to pay, don't pay and I said, but of course I'm not going to pay but
I'm calling so that you take out those charges so that you know that I won't be paying and that's when they did it.
But you have the account, imagine if they do this with ten thousand little mistakes of around twelve dollars per month, oh
Exactly, if you, if you sum it up, you get, it's a lot of money, so besides that, oh, lets say, this here and there.
like the amount is so big,
It's a small amount of money for the the the each transaction but
Exactly, yes
that's how they make money, all the telephone companies and all of that.
Sure, sure.
With minutes and seconds and
yes, two minutes and seconds, men, it sucks, it suck, let me tell you hey, one thing, haven't you, no, no, no, no, haven't they send you things like,
they send them to you and automatically charge you for them?
No, nothing that, that I have noticed, no. Ah, I'm very careful with, with that type of thing, and i try to always read everything, and
Ah
And try to understand if, if contracting some service I try to understand well what it means and I call and ask, forty times and I'm, I'm a bit bothered with that type of thing.
Or if, if it's true or not.
Yes, and I try to not, I try to not, ah, to not go about contracting things because always, that later the problem is to unsubscribe, and
of course.
to have these things, oh, three months free and then you have three months to unsubscribe, but you spend three months calling
No, exactly, yes.
on the phone to cancel the service.
Exactly, there is always a trick there. Always, they always look for something like that. Yes, hear one thing.
No, it's what I
Where is it you live?
In Toronto.
Ah, in Toronto, that's in Canada. Ah. Listen, I didn't know that people in Canada were involved in this study as well.
You see that they didn't, you see that they didn't get enough people in the United States and started to send mails here as well.
Ah, I see. To me, this is, to me I don't, they signed you up by means of email? They sent you an email message?
No, I found it, there was a notice in, in, in the Internet forum called Craigslist.
Oh, Craigslist, yes, that's where I also found it. ah, okay.
But they published it in, it was published in, in, Toronto, in, ah, Vancouver, Montreal, in
Ah
in Canadian cities too.
Hey, that's good, that's fine, yes because I got it right there too but in my city, here in Washington
Oh, yes, the
yes
my wife said, they are not going to pay you anything, and I don't know, it's all a lie but
Oh
I talked to several people and they told me, no, it's true, they've paid me before so yes
Oh, you see, no, I don't, this is my first time. In fact, oh, I spoke with one of the coordinators, I think that
she told me that she was coordinating this program, I talked to her and she said no, yes, this is serious
legal, well, it's a legal program
Oh, I spoke with a
She liked it because it was interesting, in fact, I've spoken with so many people from some many different countries and in very different circumstances, oh hey, it's really intersting.
Mm, I spoke with a couple of guys from the University of Pennsylvania, that were studying there and they told me that they always do this, that they did a similar program last year.
They have to tape I don't know how many, oh thousands and thousands of hours and they use the conversations to train, oh, voice recognition systems
Oh, hey
yes, when you speak on the phone and they ask you to please say what you want to do, say if you want to talk with I don't know what, with turkeys.
That's what they use it for, I didn't know.
that's why they need people with different accents, people that speak at different speeds and people talking about different subjects, and
Sure, to train the machines. I can't imagine.
hm, that's what they told me, it's one of the things they use it for, they have some government grants, they have money to do it. It's just that
Sure, wow, that's incredible, uh, well, look, uh
And i want to finish, look, i checked this morning and it's my number twenty two call, uh, the
Oh, imagine that. I don't even, i, there's been a while since i went into my account to know how it is, because I've been travelling and, and i really don't, i haven't had the time to
lets say, get in the computer and see how much time, and how many calls I've made, or something like that, the truth is i haven't done that for a while
But i have
And i wanted to see, I'll finish next week, that's for sure
Oh, yes, because, how many are they?, it's twenty calls max what you
No, it's twenty five
Twenty five
Yeah, so i have three more left
Oh, so you're ready mate
Yeah, I'm getting close, where, where, where were you born?
Yeah, I'm originally from Caracas, Venezuela
Oh, very well, if I'm correct, you're the first Venezuelan i speak to
Yeah, where are you from, Argentina?
Yes, exactly
Oh, ok, oh, ok, yes
It shows, it clearly shows
It shows in your accent, yes, it shows in your accent, accent

Hi Maria Ines, how are you?
Fine, everything's fine, where are you from?
I'm from Chile
From Chile, I'm from Argentina, we're neighbors
Yes, i thought you were from Argentina, i recognized your voice tone
Does it show that much?
Your accent, well, to us Chileans it does, and, did you know i was from Chile?
Now that I'm listening to you a bit more, yeah, when you told me the name, i realized that, well, you surely weren't from Argentina
Sure
But no, i didn't know where, now that I'm talking i do
Oh, that's so funny, and
I'm telling you, i know more Chileans now that I'm in the United States than there in Argentina, where we're so close
yes
It's... well, i don't live very close to Chile, but it's hilarious, i met a lot here, where in the United States are you?
I'm in Maryland
In?
Maryland
No
Is the west  coast.
Ah, how nice.
Sorry, the east coast.
Ah, I'm on the other side, I'm in Philadelphia.
Then we are near.
Coast?
East.
Ah, I understood west, ah, then yes.
At first I said west, but then I corrected myself.
Ah. And, and what state are you in?
No, I'm in eh, Montgomery.
Mm. Mongo-
In Maryland
No, well, I don't know, no clue, I don't know much about the geography of the United States aha, I don't know anything.
yes, Philadelphia is like I think four hours from here.
Ah, nearby.
yes, yes, near.
Near, near, Look and, have you been in here in the United States a long time?
Hmm, four years, a little more than four years.  And you?
Ah.  A year and a bit.
Hmm, and you like it, are you used to it?
Me, yes, from what I know, I like it, yes, no, I got used to it, but, like, I came with the idea of going back to Argentina, like, that in reality
I, I don't really want to get used to it that much
yes.
but I came for two or three years, eh, surely it will be three, and after I'll go back.
Ah.
No, no, I came for a job.
Ah, perfect.
So, no.  You came to stay?
yes, yes, I have my family here.
Ah.
My husband and my son.  So, yes.
Ah.  yes, you'll stay, you have kids here, Americans.
yes, yes, one of three years and five years.
Ah, how nice
yes, yeah.
It's the sweetest age, besides, they're so, no, I have little nephews, I don't have kids yet, but it's the age where they're starting to talk, at three, they're divine.
yes, yes, they're exquisite.  They're the best there is.  Well the pre- the topic was
yes, oh, what, oh oh yes, that subject.
yes, the subject of, of
yes, that
of people who speak on the phone offering goods
yes
that you don't want, yes, have you ever bought any of them, in that situation.
No. No, no. I got a call once I remember it was from my own bank, my own bank in which I have an account, I mean, nothing.
Sure.
There were, but, I couldn't hang up, they wanted to sell me an insurance or something and I wasn't even paying attention because I was doing other things, you know, like when you are
yes.
doing something else and not actually listening? so, I told him yes to everything and then I realized he was about to charge me for it and I was like no no no!
and that was the only time that happened by the phone, but it's pretty common by mail or email, they send
everything.
yes, yes.
I can see that I once registered my address somewhere that I wasn't supposed to and so I get
yes, well that's, that's bad.
Did that happen to you too?
yes, it happened to me once, I would get all kinds of offers but, in yahoo for example, it has some options in which they can't, no spam
oh oh, you can, how to say it? register, isn't it?
yes.
of the different things, but is a bother because one wastes time.
yes
You have to look at the mail and all that.
And also but see, you put the filter, and by there later they filter the messages that you do want to receive
Exactly, yes, yes, exactly.
Is an issue, and with, with the mail also that
yes,.
arrives there, you open the mailbox in your house, in the mailbox and when you open it, you find a bunch of envelopes, super happy, and you look and at the end is all advertisements
yes, yes, yes is a bother, yes.
That
yes but
I don't know, In Chile does it also happen, that they send you by mail, by paper and things?
Ah, well not by phone, because I think that the people in Chile, would not receive those things like that too well.
Sure.
Let's say, they wouldn't have an option
Ah.
because is, is like bad manners calling you house by phone to offer something
Ah.
then
Ah, no, in Argentina they call a lot, they are quite annoying, yes.
yes. Oh, how boring.
They call you, see it, by cell phones, a lot
Aha.
after that eh, promotions of shared times, see it, in different places around the world too
Oh, of course.
and they are jerks, they do not let you to say no, yes, she is interested and doesn´t hang up, see it, they keep talking and you have to be rude and hang up, because
yes
it is awesome.
They don´t let you another option.
No,no there are times when you have to treat them badly and you think poor of that person you are talking to, he is an employee that has to
not because he likes it, but because well, it is the job he found
Exactly, exactly. yes.
Then I try to be good, see it, but
You feel sorry.
of course, well if it happened to me, I would not like all the people treating me badly, but it happens, one day it could happens, see it
yes. yes, yes, that is true. Eh, but I, the truth it is weird, I don´t remember to buy something offered to me in that way
I think that never.
No, I think that
Because they have to offer you something you were looking for, that you are interested in, because if not only by talking on the phone don´t
yes, and, besides at last you pay attention and then you look for it in another place, because I like you would be afraid to buy something on the phone.
Sure.
Ah, bah, I don't know.  What do I know, because I never did it.
yes.
But, no
yes, but well, I have a little, the culture of my country, I think it's bad education that they call you on the phone at your house offering you something that you didn't ask for before.
Sure.
I think that they shouldn't do this.
Sure, no.
Suddenly you're eating or doing something or you're busy, and, and you have to answer eh
yes, and well, as you know what happened to me with, with the people from the bank, it had just arrived because I'd bought the computer on the internet
Aha.
I was excited, and when you're opening it, you're so excited to see and the telephone rights.  And I didn't know who it was for, I'd left it for the answering machine, but seeing how when you go and answer and say no, that if
this women calls, I want to go and see my computer.  Ah, funny, but well
yes, yes.
They're pretty annoying, truly.
yes, and have you bought, you haven't bought anything either from
No, no, never, the same here, they call me less than in Argentina, I see that my telephone isn't very, eh, many of them still don't have it
what I get is a lot of mail, envelopes, cards.
Ah, well, this is another thing, yes, full of
Ah, it's annoying.
oh, yes, yes, that's terrible because it
Credit cards, I don't know how many are offered to me each day and then they deny them to me, I've been for a year ago and
Sure, sure, the worst thing is that they give you different, I mean, every month I get the same things so it's like, I didn't answer the first fifty times
but they send it again
Sure, I, Capital One doesn't even know how to send it to me, the last time they sent me an enveloped, and I'm like, what's this? Nothing, it had the same letter as before and I was like
They are really creative, oh yes, they send a
to
an envelope with your name handwritten in it, with a
Really?
the last thing that they sent me was a, it looked like a newspaper ad with information from the, the, it had to do something with a car
oh, so you look at it and you see all the profits that they are making and the, the, the, oh, their market share and how cheap they are but
it's an ad, lets say, it's not really a newspaper article.
yes, yes, yes.
I don't know, it's quite funny, the way they try to catch your attention
Why? Bah, they must have, I think they should do some research before sending it, I mean, they must have but I don't feel like buying them
Me neither.
the things that they sent me, they tried to confuse me.
yes, exactly, yes, yes, it's like
I mean
oh, and they are invading my privacy I think you have to handle those things, it's a lot of crap, it really is, a lot of crap and
yes, really.
I don't know, all those things that you receive maybe sometime in your life you're going to buy something
And for sure the day you're going to buy, surely y you already threw it away and you will end up buying from another place because as you were saying, what is the chance that just on that day in which you get the envelope
you're in the mood to buy that, or the need to buy that
Sure.
it's
Well that, probably there's people that, that feels, they read the ads and they thing ah, well yes, really
Sure. Maybe I don't know, one that wasn't raised here, but there should be someone, I don't, I don't have American friends, American, to ask them, but
somewhere, yeah yes, that you were born here it's like they are more cued up because you got used to it from early on, I don't know.
yes.
The truth is that I don't know.
yes, it could be. What we set up on the phone is a filter now.
Ah, that's what they told me.
ye, that you get on a screen who's calling you
Sure.
so many times if it's them it tells you that no the number is hidden, the number is from a company and I don't answer I let the machine answer right there
Sure, sure.
because really it it was exasperating, let's say
And to me they told me that there was an Internet page in which you can sign up
Ah, yes, yes, I didn't
yes, and you put it there so they don't send you, I think, I don't know if it's by mail or phone, but I think that it's by phone,
Aha.
so they don't call you
yes, yes, yes, I know that there's this too but
eh
I didn't do it, I don't know why.
I no, I didn't look for it because really to me by telephone this one time it happened to me.  I'm also not at home very much, so if
they call me but, but yes, I know it exists, a friend of mine did it.
Yeah, yes.
They drove her crazy and she did it and they only call
And it worked?
well, people who want to sell her something who know her, they put it, the bank where she is a client, not this, because, well, she's a client, they have the right to call her.
Sure.  Ah
but the rest yes.
Well yes, this is what bothers me, for example the last time, what bothered me the most is that we have a line with Verizon
yes.
and, well, they called me on the phone, many times they sent me things by mail that came to my house, and rang the bell
No.
to offer me, hmm, what are they called?  I don't remember the name of
Internet?
no, is not internet, that they put the fiber optic.
Ah, yes, -D-S-L
Sure.
is
With fiber optic, yes I mean, no, I already said no six hundred times before
Ah.
I'm not going to change my mind, please, no
Are they going to ring the doorbell in your house? Is the last thing I needed, I hadn't heard it yet.
yes, yes, yes, yes, yesterday, the day before yesterday, a man, came
Ah.
it was cold outside, I felt very bad for him
yes, poor guy, right?
and, and he told me, uh, we offer and, yes, but, you know what? No No.
Ah. Besides that the majority of the places they go, there must no be anyone one because
Sure, imagine, poor man going around like that in that way
I don't know. Oh
but like you say, they must, they must make money some way, they must make their
And I think so, I imagine so, because if not, it must really be costly to, pay a person to go
ringing the doorbell I don't know. Is brilliant, is brilliant that yes, one feels a little invaded with
yes.
all in all, even the people with whom you... let's say this, they call me from the bank every once in a while to ask my opinion about something, and you don't say
Yeah, i have a complaint, I'm gonna call you
Yeah, don't worry, they'll call you
Don't bother, sure, besides they have your number here, your office's
Right
they call me at the office
Oh
And, and you don't say "stop, I'm working, i don't want to tell you if i like the checkbook or not"
Yes
it's a plot, uh, yeah, it annoys me pretty much
Yes, yes
I don't know
Yes
I don't know
And from, from work, they bother you at work too?, let's say, you get things related to work, that they want to sell you stuff, or things, yes or no?
They come, well, i work as, at a lab, and people comes, uh sometimes, offering a service for the lab, or some product, free samples of something
But no, it's not, it's not heavy
Yeah
The truth is it isn't, no, no
It seems that's not a type of massive sale then
they come, I don't know, once a month.
no they are desperate.
And they are companies, no, but
It gives me the impression.
good night
hello I am Manuel, how are you doing

ah no in Miami
in Miami hello how are you
well thanks
eh lets see pardon me unfortunately I am I am in the middle of something and didn´t hear exactly which was the topic?
it is about unsolicited emails. Spams
ah ja
hmm
em lets see it do you use electronic mail
yes
and I imagine that you receive spam
not so much
no not a lot
no no because no no I don´t receive too much, very few of them  in the past it happened to me with another mail but now eh I have not authorized anyone
I receive some three or four from discos only
ah how nice it is, let's see eh
mm
I use I use the net a lot
mm
I use the computer a lot too and is is a is a problem eh is a serious problem eh I have ways of dealing with this problem eh
aha
I have I have for example eh eh different filters eh I use eh tan cop which is a way to report that basically that way
that way they throw out the , the eh
yes well right?
that's a good system
ah yes a lot of advertisement
eh eh eh there's simply too much there's no way of
mm
there's no way of stopping because it's not even it's not even a question it's not even a question of that your address is in the open
I'll be back in a bit sure eh it's not even a question of that they leave in the open the address of the electronic mail but that they use back
use programs that are sending eh electronic mail to random accounts
mm
eh and not even, eh there are so many that the servers in reality don't send you only mail that is to your address but rather that is almost
your address
aha
it sends it because it takes it for granted that perhaps is misspelled
probably yes no
then that way and it's received I receive my name is Marcos I receive electronic mail for Marcia for Emanuel, for Michell for whatever
sure the
eh eh everything that goes to the server that I use but
mm
is, eh I think what they should do eh they are talking a lot for example that the electronic mail they are thinking eh thought a couple of times
in putting some sort of eh like like a stamp that cost that there's a cost
for each sent
to send eh so that there's a cost for the electronic mail
mm, yes I understand
I see I see that honestly would be a good idea but not that it's a cost for sent mail because that's ridiculous, the internet is a is a
is a world, is an, is an animal but free is something
and and besides is not free because you pay for it
no eh and that is precisely the problem and is
you already, nobody has free internet, right?
what?
nobody has free internet since you pay for the monthly service
not necessarily eh
well you have one in the university right but also you paid the university's tuition in some way you pay it indirectly
yes indirectly or directly and using it from one place to another but the
sure the same someone pays it right? is not you, someone pays for you
but, for example with the spam what they do is that specifically because the electronic mail for example if you send
to the other electronic mail or receive you don't pay either way
ah no no mm
you don't pay, if there is a cost even if it's a marginal cost, that is for that I say is not a thing of a matter of
for sending it by mail but rather for let's say for the access to be able to send email you have to pay a dollar a month let's say if is like that
when the ones that send the spam arrive to your eh to your eh to your mailbox your mailbox is costing you money
and is costing you money they are wasting your money or stealing your money in which case that becomes a legal matter and in that way it can be attacked I mean you can
you can you can prosecute you can eh arrest you can fine the person who's sending the spam but the problem now
is that it already doesn't cost you anything to receive that garbage you don't have who to complain to what they tried to do for a while is with the for example the mail
pornographic spam that that for example there's a basis that is eh that if your mail gets to a person who's under age
then you are breaking the law then in that way they were able to attack that instead of having eh explicit spam like that with explicit sexual notations
instead what they do is send things that don't offend but rather it simply fills up your mailbox with garbage but is that they do it as if it was that
is costing you money in which case is a theft eh start attacking that also but there's not that much, already there's not that much I mean
there's still a lot of spam eh of explicit sex but is not as popular like before for that reason precisely because is a
mm
is a side that they legally can attack the person who sends
mm ah I didn't know that but I don't know if they should charge
yes
I think that no, maybe
no, I also think that, I always thought that no
I think that if it's free it's better because there are many people who maybe, here, everyone can pay but in other places, no, everything that you pay, it's
methods of communication and education it seems that
no in any case, it's not a dollar a month but a cent a month, the objective is that it's a cost so they can legally
eh, they can persecute those who send span because they don't need, even if you buy something from spam, that you're seeing what you're getting
they only need, yes it's only one time that you see, that for the doubts, yes, eh
really follow one of the links and then the server will show that a person visited it and that's the only thing they pay for
by hit
not by visit
for visit, so, eh, they only need you to accidentally go and see
hmm
then you'll also see too if you go to a place that has a very similar name to another, for example hotmail
hmm
yes it's what you write, for example I say, ehh, h o t m a i l instead of a i l
hmm
I'll go to another site where many people accidentally will be automatically spelled bad or go to a site that's simply
show you a lot of explicit photos and but the servers show these as a hit so the person who owns the site where hotmail
ahh is getting money for this
ah yes probably, right?
that that and that's the way that it works
mm
and the thing is that since it didn't harm you in any way legally you can't perceive that from a person who has that
but if it is that for example in the email even if it's a marginal cost, even if it's I mean that is simply a tax to your connection
of some type, but but it has to be minimum is not that it has a use the money for example the city taxes they use to
to fix the streets to repair the sidewalks for all that
they say that right?
eh in any case there's a huge need for money but in this case what I see of course I don't like the idea but I'm trying to find a way
I'm trying to see, understand some way of stopping the spam because is a problem that is that is, is mounting is getting worse each time and is going to get to the point in which
but it really seems such a serious problem to you
the more
to me it doesn't seem so
more of, I think that more of
I don't think many people deem it a problem, perhaps for
no eh
some people that really work with hotmail for an institution but for many people I think that it just causes them to waste time right? and sometimes really the time is not worth money right?
no eh the thing is that really it is creating a problem because the eh for example the isp the servers, the places of
of access the the aol and the eh all the traffic that goes through the net through the internet
okay, mm at its height ah
more than fifty percent now is spam
Honey, yes.
Hello
hello, eh, Honey's speaking
ah, my name is Gloria, from here from California
you know, yes here in Florida and I didn't hear the topic well, it was of, of non requested issues, that if one had bought
is about when there are promotions on the internet oh, if you have bought something by internet what do you think, and of marketing and
oh okay I specifically have bought things through the internet, but not for not things that are not, you know? that is not requested
mm
I don't think that already, well no, I can't say that either because I think that once I did get one of those strange messages and it was something that I was looking
mm
I don't know what was the situation like so
the truth is that, from what you hear well, that sometimes there's a lot of fraud and all that, I do get scared, the truth
on internet
yes I do get scared because there's a lot of fraud sometimes, sometimes one thinks that it is safe but is not one hundred percent safe, right?
that all depends, that depends, you know, if it's a good way of looking, eh, you go to their webpage, you know? that has the page
mm
and verify what the product is, if they are authorized they have to have their own page
mm
my experience up to now, I've never had such a problem, that I've ordered something on the internet
be quiet my daughter
and, you know, has had a problem until now at least
mm
but as far as that they should have some way of being able to stop you know, all the crap that one receives in the mail, the
yes, mm
is chronic
mm
yes I agree that there should be something for that
mm
you know? the same way that one blocks when they call the house and are bothering you.
mm, it's happened to me that sometimes at nine ten at night they are calling for promotions that sometimes I go into some pages or something to see how the promotions are or everything, right? the offers and all that
already at night I already have the call there in the house then no
that they get your information and they call you
yes
no because yes, do you have your number registered with the, with the do not call registry?
yes, I have it but I don't know what's happening, because always is that sometimes there's a lot, a lot of deviousness in that of the Internet, I am somewhat scared of the internet
the only think I do suggest is that ah, ah, joined to my bank account and a specific card, just for that, and no, you know? I don't keep a very high fund just in case any thing
you know? no, no, if they get my card or anything that shouldn't happen happens is easy to cancel and is not the card, you know, eh, from my main checking account nor anything like that
mm
which is a measure that I've taken so if anything happens at least I don't have to worry that I have to cancel my checkbook or anything like that
mm,
and I know of another way, which is to have a card in which you only pay a small fund  you know, so if anything happens, at least
you know? you don't have to cancel everything, you just cancel that account and that's it, you can report it as stolen, like you do with the visa
shut up girl, mhm I don't know but, I didn't take part in the purchase of it
some people, it makes your life easier
the internet, aha
so, you know, sometimes
that's right, isn't it? aha, but I can't afford it
sorry?
I can't afford to buy things from the Internet, no, no, no, I don't think it's one hundred percent safe.
well
but some do, right? Maybe they know more than I but I don't know
well, it's the technology has
in my opinion, no
you know, it'll reach a point in which the stores, all of the stores, you know, stores where you buy groceries,
mhm
they will allow you to order, you know, to buy things online.
aha
to look for
aha, they are making your life easier
mhm
mm
and I know that like visa visa and mastercard they have now a protection system, you know?
yes mm
that if it's a, a thing on the internet that they've had problems with fraud or there's a chance that there's fraud your card doesn't go through
mm
I mean, you can try to pay with your card via the internet and it doesn't let you it rejects it
mm
in other words they have also opted for security measures, to protect the the you know, the consumer
that's good, right?
mm
mm
because I tried even, using it in a, in a site and when I called and told them look, my card is declined and I don't understand why
they told me that it was the visa that didn't accept for them get the card
mm mm
I said well, that's good you know? I already knew that there was something strange there, and that you know
mm
so I told them, well look, so, eh, pleased and ta ta ta and I told them that no, that I have no interest in that product because if visa doesn't want to do business with them, is because of something
mm
I mean that yes they have taken certain precautions, but as far as the garbage that one gets in the mail, there's nothing that annoys me more than that
too much, right?
and I had to spend a lot of money to buy a few programs
mhm
to block the pop ups, the little windows.
mhm
it says that in fifteen minutes you will be able to access the website that you were looking for.
Mhm, so many things, sometimes I've found up to six, six hundred, seven hundred that go straight to the trash because I have it all programed, but they always get in, right?
mhm
that's the bad side of it.
have you tried, have you, do they still send you the same message? To pick it up and send it to, do you have an email account?
mhm, no, I haven't tried that
you pick it, it's the latest thing that I've done when they keep sending me the same thing, I've already blocked it, you take the address
and you report it to your provider and they do some research and they, you know, they go and cancel their account
mhm and they pay it, right? when we, they send us spam or something
span is any email that you are getting in your email that you didn't request.
mhm
you know? if you didn't go to the website and registered in their lists, it's something you did not request.
anything that you did not request is considered spam
mhm
and that's it, about that you know that there are programs to block them.
mhm.
the majority of things, I know hotmail has put up some filters and if they are not in your list of, of
friends or address book that you know
mhm
they will send it to the trash folder
that's fine, right?
yes
mhm
Yahoo still doesn't have it, I believe that if you file a report with the provider they take it and they find out and if they see who is sending out the emails they ask them why they are doing it
mhm
you know? There have been lots of frauds lots of people are inventing them, yes
that's better,  yes
no,
I hope that this company that we have would update more often because even if I block them, they still reach me
because they find ways to
mhm
it's a robbery, a computer goes and takes lots of addresses, for example, they put a very simple thing like
for example, everybody with an address that ends in  m and everybody that has that
calm down sweetheart
you know, that's fine, it's weird because they are trying to do their best, you know
shut up
to improve the situation as such
mm
but is that one also, you understand me? how do I tell you, you have to protect yourself what gets me mad because I have, you know, I open my mail and there are, I have to clean it for
fifteen letters that I didn't even ask for nor requested
mm
and after I clean all that, is that I come to see what it is they are sending me
for me sometimes it comes out like that error, error because I send it to the trash and all that already later it comes out that many errors, that I don't know what
then even if one wants to protect themselves sometimes the same company I don't know, they are like associated with those companies, I don't know if it's not working for me because
every time I want to block and all that it already sends me the error and already others get in that cleaner that I don't know what, that I don't know such
is pure business
how strange
mm
because I know that, with what I have in my account, thank God up to now I haven't had problems, because every time that I've reported the things
they investigate to see, you know, where is coming from
mm
but they should have like a list for your email, like you have for the phone because already thank God they don't call my house
mm
because they had me that it was Sundays at seven in the morning
how terrible
the phone ringing and an agent to sell me something and me look, but if I need your services I call you I
aha
so we went and put the phone in the no-call list and as soon as we informed them that our telephone number was in the no-call list, they have to take notice and take you out of their lists.
so I have, in order for my number not to be published, they always do and now I'm even paying for it not to be published.
you have to report it, there's a special list to block the telemarketing calls.
aha
and you have to inscribe your number in that list and, it happens because when you have to fill out a request or whatever, that has your phone number in it
that person, generally, sells you information
mhm
so, what happens is that, you know, your number comes up and wherever you put your number in, they have a list with all that information and they sell it, so they earn some money
mhm
so, if your number is not registered in the national phone book, they can call you, if you registered it, they can't call you at your house.
because you have a private number, that doesn't mean that they don't have access to it, they can get it from certain operations, do you understand?
mhm
they do what they have to do to look for it through third parties and then, I noticed that, I, well I don't know, I called the phone book office
you know, my local office
mhm
and I asked them for the eight hundred number in which I could register my phone and it took about three days and they registered it there and I don't get those calls anymore
they had to take my number out because when they now look for your number it doesn't show because it's in the do not call list
mhm
and they can't call you anymore.
that's good, right?  because they've sent me mail that I don't want, as if I had accepted what they were proposing at any moment
and if you don't read well and say, ah, here you have a contract with them
yes, this is what scares me the most about the internet, more when you don't know, you don't have a wide knowledge of the internet so sometimes I prefer
only going to see if it's my family and all this and if there's nothing, I disconnect and everything stays there
no but neith-
because when you don't know a lot, you're the victim of scams
yes, you have to be careful but like I told you, it makes life easier for example, this
hmm this yes
Hello
Hello?
Hello, yes what's up, my name is Soledad.
Ah what's up, my na- my name's Mariano, now are you?
Mariano, are you from Philadelphia?
yes, I'm from Philadelphia.
Ah, I'm Soledad in Philadelphia.
Sole, I can't believe it.
Look at that, how funny.  I said this, this is Mariano
I said, she sounds Argentinian, I said, she really sounds Argentinian
how funny
How, how funny, I can't believe it, how are you
So, well no just yesterday, the first time I call, and I talk with someone
yes
and it's a Co- Colombian girl from Phoenix, I don't know what, I seen that when I say, who I am, and whatever, I say to her, what, what is your name
I don't know what I said, and I say, so I'm Soledad, I'm from, and she said, at the same time, Argentina
Argentina.  yes yes yes.
She told me pretty bad, and I said, um, well, so I started to try, to talk about you, about you, I don't know, seeing that there are means, you think that you go with a bad intention
They're yes, no, it's, what happens to me, every time that I talked, the same thing happened.  Amazing, this, what's it called, each I said, I said two words and they told me, you're Argentinian.
We really, really must have an accent, my God.
yes, you know that I, and now I realize eh, I just explained to Laila, because I just explained to Laila so she could get on it too
Also
and I told her, it's incredible how aggressive we are.  There- like, not for us, but, I say, when you listen to people from other countries,
yes
you realize what you do, or I don't know, it's very
Sure
it's really authoritarian, how we talk.
yes, it must sound bad, no.
Sure, yes yes yes.  Very, the, it's very
yes, I think it's strong.
It's amazing, it's amazing.
Besides the sh like that
Sure, yes, yes, yes.  It's very strong.  How, how, well we're talking about what happens to an Argentinian, when I said
How fu-
I said, yes, I'm Soledad, what's your name, you said Mariano, and I, Mariano where are you from, from Philadelphia, ah, I said
Mariano
it has to be Mariano.
yes, this is my call twenty three, so I'm here.
Aye how nice.  And you called from different telephones?
yes, I called from five different ones, so now, yeah, I always call from the same because, I'm in the laboratory, I'm about to go, but
Sure, sure
i mean, at least i make, i make the call from here
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Dude, how was the moving, fine?
Fine, fine, it was fine, we did this thing that, I'm telling you, it was exhausting, moving
Terrible
Yeah, like, it's something i hate, if there's one thing i hate and stresses me out is moving
It's horrible, yes
It was really a very [...] experience, i don't know, it was, it was hard, i mean, maybe the, the day of the moving itself
Yes
i was dead because i more or less put all the things from the department, because Martin had to work, and he couldn't help me much, so, i was beaten
Sure, i mean, you were stuffing things in boxes all day long, more or less
Beaten, beaten, beaten. But anyways, i mean, we did a lot, in an hour and a half, we finished in an hour and a quarter.
Uh, were there a lot of you carrying things up?
It was, I'm telling you, including Martin and i, we were eight people
Oh, very good
I mean, that you know, Marcelo came
yes
Uh, and well, no one else, because the rest were two couple of American guys that used to work in the lab across Martin's
Right
They came with their partners, then, we first did, since we were four only, we would go up and down, see, but the stairs, really, kill you.
No it kills you, it kills you.
They kill you, when is four floors up, four floors down. And later, when they came, when the rest came, I said let's do the human stair, see, which is the best way. Then
yes
eh, me and another girl, would take the boxes our of the boxes and once they took out the big furniture, like the bed, and those things,
Sure
they took the boxes like that from the apartment up to let's say just to the tip of the first stair. And Marcelo was there and he would take it down one floor.
Then there were two guys that would take those boxes another floor down, and like that, understand
Sure, and not three floors, something like that, that kills you.
Then, sure, a, I don't know, you just moved one floor only, up and down, up and down.
yes
And we did it like that and Juan spent, because the, the truck was the smallest of all, and, when Juan said, all this doesn't fit here.
Juan said
yes
Then we said, well uh how depressing, I don't know, well, let's put the most important things first. And Juan I tell you, did an engineering job. You do know Juan the cordobes?
Eh, cordo- yes, yes, the short one.
Juan The short one, yes, how you call him short, but he's strong, because he lifts weights and all.
yes yes yes
And, mm And he started accommodating everything in a way that everything fit.
Eh
It was incredible, it all went in
Incredible
Everything, everything, so, nothing, and we closed the truck and that was the first part
No, but it's a lot easier when they're a lot, because the truth is
yes
i, the, the last time i, i mean, i suffered moving twice because i, obviously [came] from Buenos Aires
yes
to my parents house, where i left the stuff
yes
that killed me. And i came here to Philadelphia, i go to a su... i have a sub-lease, you see, where you came to look for me, over there in West Philly
Yas, yes, yes
And also, after one and a half months, everything once again, oh god, and we weren't many, and I'm telling you i ended up dead.
Yes
Dead, dead. There was Paula, Maria Inés, Paulo and no one else, lets say, so we were, i swear i ended up
Sure
Dead, the next day everything was hurting too
Right?, it's terrible, on top we, well, the other day, well, i went to pick up Federico at the airport that day
Oh
And the day before i had gone looking for... because they also come to work like that, for three months, his sister, he and her boyfriend, who are also biologists
Right
to do type of an internship, but, but are, are in the career so to speak. Just in third year, so , so they are little.
Sure Sure
And, what is it called, well and them them two, and Fede we all went the other day, to Baltimore.
Aha
And they helped us, but well, we already had, we were five, and three I mean, you had like a dock where you would pull up the truck, and it was like that near the elevator
Ah, then
You would go by elevator, see, then
okay, is much more comfortable.
is much more, also, it was an hour and fifteen minute, an hour and a half, and we had already gotten everything out of the boxes. They also helped us to dismantle a little, not everything, but everything is almost done.
You are in Philadelphia now right?
Eh, now I'm in Philadelphia, yes yes yes.
AH
yes, this week I'm here, and now on Sunday I'm already going to Baltimore and Martin is staying what happens is that the papers have to go out.
Sure
So it seems that it will be two more weeks that he will have to stay here.
yes, I I called Marin, to see I mean, where he was, how you guys were,
yes yes today I also got a call from, from Nati, you know that today, today I felt so bad in the morning. I was, see we were, when we returned, we were both, super sick,
yes
with a cold I don't know.
Sure, dead
And then with this stress matter, I'm telling you, the body
yes, yes
i thought it wouldn't work anymore
Yes
I mean, this week i almost did nothing, nothing. I mean, i didn't see anyone, it's just i really, i can't, no, no, no, uh, Marcelo left me in the house, you see, the Chilean
yes
That comes back on Monday or Tuesday and we're looking out for it this week and i don't know, we stayed there
Sure
And I'm telling you, i was laying there on his house almost everyday. I don't know how Martin still goes to work, i'm really, no, no, no
Yeah, you got completely stressed, right, now
I, couldn't, couldn't, i couldn't think
And you can't wait to be in Baltimore, quiet, i mean
Yes, on one hand, i want us to be there already, he's making me really nervous, the matter of Martin's paperwork
Right
Because i have, i have to go, yes, because i have orientation day next week
Sure
So, uh, i have to go there, but well, we'll see, you see, like
Yes, no, everything's gonna be fine
I can't get stressed more than i already am or else I'll have a [heart] attack
No, no, logical
what was I going to tell you, and what are you guys going to do today?
Us you know that nothing, I don't know, in reality, no, no, I think today there's no plan like pre, pre meditated, so we are kind of
Well, I just recently talked with Martin,
Aha
and since Marcelo told us, invite whoever you want here, to our house I don't know what, they have a barbeque
Aha
And see that is not very cold, too cold. Then Martin is going to buy meat, and was going to tell Fede-
yes
Federico, and I was going to tell Laila too, you don't want to come eat some barbeque, like that?
Aha Well, let me check with Leti, to see if
Well, ah
see, because I know that Leti was also talking with someone to do something, so, well of last,
Well Well, if you guys want, if you want to come, um,
eh yes, yes, it would be super good.
well, okay
Tonight.
today, eh yes today at eight thirty, nine, call me or if not call Martin, at the cellu-
I'll let you know.
I'll let him know now that I told you, and that's it, no problem.
No, yes, super good and, then where are you going to
Uh
to Baltimore, next week?
I'm leaving on sunday, this Sunday
On sunday, oh, it's OK
I'm driving there
it's OK
And, martin doesn't, doesn't know, he'll probably have to stay two weeks more here in Philadelphia
Sure
So, maybe i, on the weekend, not this next one, but on the twenty, i have to comeback because i have a wedding here, from an American girl
Yes
So I'll probably come look for him, lets say, that same weekend
Sure, sure, sure
Uh, a co- i think, i don't know, because after the twenty two, I'm starting college
Um
so, i hope he can come here fast
Oh
I'm a little, a little down because of that
Oh, yes, oh my god
I don't want to be there alone
Yeah, i, I'm with [...] now, i started looking for, what's it called?, tickets to Argentine, all that stuff
yes, oh and? how are you going to find it?
No, I don't know, I mean, actually, they are more expensive from here than from there.
yes
But in the end, no, I don't know what's beset, if you should buy it from an airline and put up with it even if it's more expensive and to accumulate miles,
yes
or, or, or what do I know, to  look for a cheaper price,
We always look for the cheapest price.
yes no
The truth is that we do, like it hurts, you feel the pain in the
Like two hundred dollars more
to pay that much money and to accumulate miles, how many, I don't know, I don't know, what do I know.
Four tickets and you get one free, kind of.
yes, that's also true.
what do I know.
But if you think about it, you are actually paying for that one too because two tickets are, two hundred more, two hundred dollars more for a ticket to Argentina.
It's like another ticket, yes.
Well, lets say cheaper, six hundred dollars.
Cheap, yes, I now have a credit card that luckily doesn't charge me an annual fee and
There's a credit card, no, it's a point, a mile, Marcelo has it.
they give you fifteen thousand miles, yes. Sure.
That it is supposedly good.
And and but, in general, all of them have an annual fee but this one doesn't.
Oh, look at that.
So, you get, it's US Airways, it gives you fifteen thousand miles, at front.
I see.
So, with two passengers and more you are
Oh
It's not bad.
It's okay, well, it's okay.
I think that, I think that I'm going to do it because it's the cheapest option to go to New York, I don't know, do you always flay from Philadelphia?
Oh, no, we've flown out of New York twice, and twice from Philadelphia.
Hm
Oh, twice from Philadelphia, well it did to Martin, not to me, the flight got canceled, I mean, if it rains a lot, oh no, I don't know, you see, it's a bad flight sometimes
well, we had bad luck, it doesn't have to happen but
yes
Oh, our flight got canceled I don't know why and in New York, well, the only good thing about it is that it's a direct flight.
Sure
and you know you won't loose your baggage or anything.
Sure
The bad thing is that you have to go all the way to New York.
yes, that's it
And, since not long ago, well, the one Paula took, but since not long ago it was not expensive taking the truck to the airport there
And now it seems like it was fifty round-trip
It is a van, like a shuttle
it's like a van, a shuttle, right? sometimes they take you straight to New York, and sometimes they take half way and then it's like a mini truck, and they take you to the airport
Oh, it's not a bad idea
It's not bad, it's fine, but it is fifty dollars more or less
Sure, but you still save more than one hundred
Sure
of ,of ,of
That's it, and you have to bear in mind that it is all day long, I mean, if for instance your flight leaves tonight
and you should be leaving by, I don't know, half past ten in the morning from your home
sure
Because with one thing and the other it is four hours, five hours
Sure
to the airport, because it is not only the distance, but it has to pick the people house by house
Oh
So, there you loose about half an hour, forty-five minutes
Sure, yes, it gets
Or one hour. So it takes an extra hour, then let's suppose you find a little traffic it becomes four hours, so you have to calculate
I don't know, if you leave at ten, to be there four hours before, you have to leave like at nine in the morning, between this and that, understand.
Sure, sure, sure, it becomes long.
But, well, I don't know. See, if you save- I've done it, is not the end of the world.
How much did you pay for the last ticket for example?
Eh, eight hundred
More or less right. Eight hundred and something.
and something. Eight hundred and something, and it was in November, no it was in December.
I don't know, no, December should be, a thousand and
When are you leaving then?
No, we feel like going in April, what happens is that we still don't
Hi, Lucas, what's up?, my name is Marceliana
Oh, how are you Eliana, where are you from?
from Argentina, you too, right?
That's it, how did you recognize out my accent?
Yeah, you can tell right away
And, what, are you Porteña too? [From Puerto...]
Yeah, too
Right, but how, where are you living?
In Boston
Oh, me too, in
No, it's in
Dude, happy new year
Likewise
did you go somewhere on vacations?
Yes, i went to Miami, i was with my brother who live there
Oh, that's good, and was it hot?
Yes
Uh
Obviously a lot more than here
And, did you went into the sea?
No, I got into the pool of my sister´s house that has hot water
And are there sharks in this season of the year?
The truth is that I don´t know, I didn´t get into it Did you went somewhere?
I was in Spain.
ah, Where did you were?
I was in Madrid, I went to the north of Spain hmm, by Portugal
Wasn´t it cold?
A little, it was snowing in the Basque Country But
Did you knew Portugal?
I was, I have known Lisbon, but now we were in the north of Portugal that is good but nothing, many churches, I got tired of seeing churches
Ah, yes
But well Europe yes there are churches more or least, so you have to stand those things
It fucks me when it is that
Man, Which is the today´s topic? that, that thing of buying on the internet, no No, eh
By telephone,
Ah, it is fine
that one called I buy things for my work by phone.
No I get caught some times, after seven at night when they begin to call anyone And they offer you things you don´t understand what are they talking about and
You don´t know what to say and, ah, well I accept and they send you something
No,
yes, yes, as soon as I arrived to Spa- to the United States, a friend of mine called me talking in a language I didn't quite understand
And told me that there was something to call within the United States, and if I wanted to join, and I didn't understand a thing, so
I didn't get to tell her that no, that we were not interested, and I got a ten dollars bill, the first month, and then since I cancelled after the second month was started they charged that too
the second month. But like this on the Internet, I buy, nut it is not things that
Did you give your card? Did you give anything?
No, they charge you directly, they charge you in
ahm
It is like, you know there are several companies to call within the United States. It is a company and they, they keep fucking you around until you say OK
oh, anything to get rid of them
look, I didn't know, what a shit, that didn't happen to me
That's usually when you have a line telephone, not a cellular one, and your number is all over
ah, ah
The cellular is much more private
Sure
Everybody. Terrible
Sure
So
at what time is it? at what time is it?
after five o'clock in the afternoon they start calling, they tell you mistress whatever, and mistress Quintana and you just tell them yes, and they start talking and you just want to stop them
Sure
yes I didn't tell them no, I'm not interested, but very very clearly, those people immediately
ah, how annoying, wow
had the sun
hmm no there were some cloudy days but since I was with my sister who was pregnant and she's like resting because we were, she's really fat and everything,
yes
No, well happy to stay at home
needed to, to give her
Supposedly a month, but if she's dilated one and a half and is bedridden, the hospital, the girl said bedridden
oh, like, yeah, they have to give
But well, no one wants to say, seeing how it is in this county, no one wants to say in case
And how's the hospital where he will be born?
it's good, so, I went with her to do the ultrasound, it was the week, I don't remember, thirty six, thirty five and well, good, everything good, the truth is that it was great
And yes, I also had a, it was a lot of vacation
And does she have other kids or is this the first?
No, I have a little nephew well it's more her son than it is my nephew, eh, who's divine, divine, who's learning more every day, he's two
And he was born here?  In Miami I mean
No, they were born in Boston, they lived in Boston and he was born one winter day, because it was November here and
Like so, ah,
Sure,
that's good
And the parents are in October
And anybody else there in Miami?
yes my brother also lives there And was like that, he worked everyday but he would leave, at night he would come here, practically every night, and we dined together and there was also a friend of mine
he slept with my brother and I slept with my sister and so then we would all see each other Besides a new holiday for Christmas holidays for the new year
Friday he would leave earlier to work so is like
yes you put for the child
No, no he was in school since we are Jews
Ah, I also left
Ah,look
ah, never
Well Hanuka eh, No, because my mom is going to Buenos Aires with all the The candelabra with all, but it was the last day we don't do it
that your mom went from Buenos Aires to Miami?
My mom alone will stay two months in Miami to take care of the future son
ah, the mess
To help so she moved forward the ticket to see me two
And she's going to visit you in Boston
she doesn't know yet depends how everything is with Layla
Did she bring you something
yes she brought me a bunch of things,
yes,
A bunch of things, a book And a bunch of clothes like for summer, that now the sales are starting and the same and I see it and no, like
It doesn't grab my attention since I'm tired
Even these days is not too cold
No,no And no, everything good luckily I had a great time, and was it cold in
And eh, more or less, that we took the jacket for the cold
Ah,
And Since when is cold in Madrid like everybody dresses well in Spain we put on the overcoat and it wasn't cold
mm
Here if you wear an overcoat and is minus five you are already cold
Sure
But no, it was good Eh, nothing to use it a little for hours or, but no, not like here that you are the whole time with hats and gloves
No, okay
But to walk it was good, we didn't have any sunny day so,
ah, brilliant and, and where did you stop? do you have friends?
yes, we have a couple of friends, eh, and then we were four days traveling so we stopped in different hotels Eh, and on the way back was when we to Madrid, we were there four days
At some friend's house And there we spent eh, Christmas and new Year also
Ah, look at that
And we were with their dogs who are awesome, the truth that
Ah, you know them so to speak
yes, yes, yes and one, one came from Argentina she went to Israel And another I mean And both they took them to Spain and are already there, they adopted a cat also in Israel that they are also taking to Spain
Because i needed to get the Van through
Because they were from the street
Oh, they call that "ahorcada" [hanged]
The dogs, yes, yes, it's that, no, they just got them off the streets, right?, for nobody, but
Sure
I found the Kitty in a dumpster and i gave it to... i wanted to raise her but my partner didn't let me and
We gave it to those boys who took it to Madrid
Sure
You can't even touch her
Really?, oh, look at that, oh, the dogs don't do anything to her
No, they're very pretty, uh, it would be good if they showed the pictures, but since they don't send them, you can't see which
No, you know what?, what's your name?, Tamara
Uh, they call me Luca
Oh, Lucas, ok, Luca, I'm sure we'll meet in a few months and we'll remember our names and maybe I'll catch you suddenly on Boston
Yeah, I'm gonna
There's a present, lets say, we talked for a while
Do you come here some day on...?
No, not really, no
Because there's a restaur- there's a really good one, uh
Yes
eh, average natural food
yes, it is in
Well, but if you come it is very good, because they give you food
Oh, I understand, and
Free things, you go there before one o'clock
Sure, yes, yes, I used to, but I gave up with that because I gain. Even without hunger, sometimes I passed without hunger
You know, a friend tells you to try the things they have there, then you buy the package, and you find strange things to eat at home
that's right, that's right
just yesterday I eat some chicken rolls, very tasty, like the spring rolls
yes
yes, it was good
Oh, look
yes, note it down
spring
So if you are there one of these days get in and we may meet
alright, and what do you think of the cold? it is not that cold right?
it's great
yes
yes, I hope it stays like this for a long time. This is the first winter I spend here
Sure
You were saying, right?, it's gonna be cold, it's gonna be cold but
Yes, not now really, but the snow subject, the snow, i love snow, yes
Yeah, but well, if it snows you have to be sliding and that, i keep travelling and i don't even know the hour, so
Um
But
Of course
Well, now we have a car, maybe, yeah, it's gonna be a little bit easier with a car
Oh, look at that, so do you plan on going anywhere this weekend?
And, i don't know, because i have to work tomorrow, maybe going out at night, i don't know, is there any good place in...? that you know of?
Uh, i have a friend, Juan Luna, an Argentinian, he sent a mail, he plans to throw a party at some place, something like that, for his farewell
Tomorrow
Yes
Oh, that's cool, that'd be good, is the dude Argentinian?
Sure, lets see, give me your email
Well, write it down

I barely know that, he must be about to write, he told me
Well, ok, excellent
So, it's an idea
And if not, if not, we can do a movie night, i don't know, maybe you come to watch a movie, it's more or less good
Another idea
That's good, well, i don't know, if not, we'll meet at
Sure, but I'll call you tomorrow as soon as i find out about the party
Well, give me an email
Hit it
Hi, my name is Eliana, who am i talking to?
Hi, what's up?, My name is Soledad, nice to meet you
Nice to meet you Soledad, where are you from?
From, Philadelphia, right now
And, uh, where were you born?
In Argentina
Oh, i thought so, what are you doing?
Yes, i was gonna say you're Argentinian by your tone, it shows right away
Soledad from Philadelphia, you're the second, i spoke to another that i don't, i don't remember who she is, but she knows some friends of mine, maybe you know them, Mariano and Leticia
Yes, yes, Sole, Sole, we call the girl Sole because she's shorter than i am, the other one
Who, Leti?
Uh, no, no, the other Sole, do you know Mariano and Leticia?
No, uh, Mariano and Leticia, yes
Oh, do you know them?
Yes, yes, i know them, they came to visit me, I'm here in Boston
Oh, look at that
And i spoke to another girl that was from Mar del Plata that also knew Mariano and Leticia, do you know her?
Oh, the girl from Mar del Plata, yes, what's her name?, oh, i can't remember, but yes, yes, yes, i met her just on Christmas day when we stopped
we ended up eating in the, in the house of some fiends in common, and i met her and her husband
Oh, look at that
yes.
And what are you doing there in Philadelphia?
And there, here I've been living for about four years, Philadelphia, and live, in reality I came with my husband because he works at Penn, he's a biologist
yes.
eh, and well, I'm studying to be a social worker, in reality, it doesn't have a lot to do with, with science but
Sure.
so, and now we're moving with, with my husband we're going to Baltimore because he's going to work at Johns Hopkins, another university.
Ah, look at that, aye, what a pity.
so, so, so, and yes, you know how nice, yesterday too, I talked on the phone and it was Mariano.
No.
I say, I can't believe that I'm talking with you Maria, because you see, we see, we're here and it's fifteen blocks, twenty blocks.
Sure and well, yesterday the other day, a friend game, because seeing that if you call with another telephone line they give you fifty dollars more.
yes, yes, I'm in the house of a friend now
Ah, sure, well, so she came to my house and I gave her my cell, mine, and well, in reverse, well, and they communicated with both of us, so we were there watching ourselves
talking on the cell phone
Seriously?
yes.
In the same, in the same room?
Sure, yes.
Aye, how funny.
yes, super funny, sure.
What is, what is your name? Oh, I already forgot.
If you do Eliana.
Eliana, that's good.
I'm the one that's in Boston that they came in November to Boston to visit me.
Ah, I'm going to ask Mariano, but sure, I'm sure he must know yes, so
yes. What's more, I think that on February the twentieth, which is a holiday, President's Day
yes.
go-, I'm going over there
Ah, good.
So we will meet
yes, we-, I'll be in Baltimore but yes it's, there's a holiday or something like that but I'm sure that, that I can drive, I'm here about an hour and a half away, two hours
Ah, good, really good.
And we have all the friends from here, so probably, if we're not too busy I guess we'll come here too, I imagine.
Sure, look I am here with a friend from Argentina
yes.
that will start to, he will be a social worker Ah, no, he's a psychologist.
Ah, look at that.
Bu-, ah, and he will work as a psychologist at the end,
Here I have a friends that's an Argentinian psychologist
Ah, seriously?  And he works as a psychological clinician?
Eh, no, no, no, he works in an institute, no, in reality he's a pharmacist and after he got a psychological degree
Look at that.
and so now he's a psychologist, he works here in a clinic.  Eh, it's called Gustavo Clurf- Clurfman or something like that.
Ah, I don't know, I don't know it.  Ah, wow.
His wife lives, works at, at Penn, well, she's about to be a professor, she's applying to different universities but, what's it called?  She's a biologist too.
Ah, wow, there's a lot in Phila
yes, and what do you do in Boston?
I'm doing a post-doctorate in genetics, I'm on this path
Ah, a post-doctorate too?  Martin just started the po- the postdoc we say.
Ah, look, ah, he's in Hopkins to do the postdo-
At Hopkins, yes.
Sure, I'm here in Tufts University
yes, now he's doing, now he's doing genetics, let's say, now I think that he will do I, I don't understand, eh, what's it called what he will do now?  Something in neurology, I don't know what it is.
Ah, that's good.
I don't understand anything
That's good, better, better eh, I always say, I don't understand the couples who are two scientists, it's
Ah
it's crazy, right now I'm single because I don't want to have a scientist next to me.  yes, there need to be two different conversation topics.
It's crazy, besides here, everyone we know are people from the faculty and we're all like that, the majority are biologists, or economists, who we know here at Penn at least.
Ah, same as here.
And they're, you see?  They're always the same topics, or, what do I know?  It's funny.
yes, yes, yes here for example, in a moment I was tied because I had friends from Berkeley which is Tufts University
yes.
And so, I go out with them sometimes and it's another vocabulary
Sure.
completely, you see?  recently I heard one saying to someone, what's your major?  And I say, what are you talking about, the military?  No, a drummer or a guitarist and I say, wow, this is
another vocabulary, jokes that, I don't know, they seem similar to you and sound really musical
Ah.
and they laughed and I didn't know it was like this, it's good, really.
Look at that, look.  And how did you get into this Fisher thing?
In exchange.  Mariano told me, when I came here and she told me that they had
Ah.
eh, I mean, I work close to a hospital in
yes.
and in Human Nutrition is a whole building dedicated to nutrition, so there's a lot of studies
Sure, obviously, yes, yes.
and I enroll in a lot of them, they're on the, the fifth highest floor of my laboratory
Ah, look at that, around the corner.
so, sure, so I had to go six mornings and on one I stayed there all morning with a
yes.
let's say, they take out blood and it's six hundred dollars a month
yes.  Wow.
so I started to tell them this whole story, and since sixteen I'm doing one to talk, I say, and the date passed, and in some way I have to get some money together, because besides
the money I'm making here, I say well, with these two hundred dollars, I can go skiing four times.
Sure, so, if you want to go, go back to Argentina, it's a part of the trip.
So, so, no
Yes we, between Marin and I we do it too, not we have two, eh, god willing, we'll make two fifty each that's five hundred dollars
Sure.  Sure, it's great, it's great
You see?
so yeah, I sign up in all of these.
I've never got into these things that here there's a lot in the universities.
And besides don't trust, yes it's in Buenos Aires, don't trust, they're going to take an organ, maybe
Sure, ah yes, no it's too much
Su- Sure, no, well, I was in a room, sequestered, with a needle, let's say
And why?  Ah, because they were taking blood?  Sure.
Sure, so, and I saw the study they wanted to know, see the times when you have a glucose analysis, if you're diabetic?
yes.
ah, I don't know if sometimes they give you a jui- they give you something really sweet and they take your blood?
No, they never did this to me, but I've heard of it.
Sure, ,well, now they want to check if it's the same if they give me bread or juice, so one day they give me bread and the other one juice.
Oh, look at that.
And you see, the amount of money they spend in trying to find out if it's better to eat ninety grams of bread instead of drinking juice. That's amazing, oh.
Well, they have the grant's money to do that, so that's it.
Sure, no, sure.
It's like, when the scientist spend money, I don't know, in buying telescopes or whatever, sure, it's not the same but, I think, they have money saved to do that.
Sure, no, yes, they  have it saved for that since, yes, so no, well, so these
It's okay, I had never taken part of this things, I mean, it seemed too complicated for me, I don't know, it was weird. But that, oh, when, when Mariano mentioned it, we met for lunch just before Christmas
The four of us, I don't know, we were talking and and suddenly he
yes.
I was like, how much are they paying you? I though he was going to say, fifty dollars but then he said, two hundred and fifty and I was like
Sure.
oh where do I sign up, and he sent me the info that same night
Oh, I see
So we signed up and now, this is my third call
Oh, look
So
and you know what happened to me? I spoke with a woman from Guatemala, and he was like, where do you work? And other things and I told her
I'd really like to know what this is for, what do they get out of this conversations
yes
They tell me well, I tell you the truth, I work there
Ah, she told you?
yes, then she told me that in reality I didn't like it that much, at the end
Why? How is it?
See, for example, Word that has Spanish from Guatemala, Spanish from Argentina, Spanish, Understand?
No, I don't understand, I don't understand, what, what?
See the programs, kind of like Word, that has
yes.
in the dictionary, of the Spanish of different countries.
yes.
Well, they want to make like a program like that of translation and that this and the other and they need to gather information from Spanish
Ah, and
then, in reality, it goes to a computer file that they are training to be a good dictionary, understand?
Ah, but then, what are they going to do? Because I mean, our our Spanish has nothing to do with the rest of the Spanish of, of other countries
What?
that the way we talk in Argentina, is very different to how they talk in Colombia or in Venezuela.
Sure, well, perhaps is for pronunciation, then they, but what they do with our talks is gather information.
yes, I knew they recorded it, I mean what I had understood was that it was a linguistic study.
Sure, I thought that it was that.
But no, no, nothing else.
yes, but well, is like more commercial, eh, is more, Bill Gates must be here
Ah. And well, what are you going to do? Everything is done for money
Sure, everything  to go skiing four more times.
And where are you going to go skiing? By there near Boston?
And near Boston, fifty minutes away, I didn't ski in Buenos Aires, let's say
yes.
no, and to
Is much more expensive there, I think, ah, I don't know, or, or more inaccessible because you have to go up to the south.
Sure, well, sure, that can, here I have friends with cars, we go in car the closest one is fifty minutes away
Ah, how nice.
yes, for example, and is open at night, then already a couple of times, we left from work early, four in the afternoon and
and we went to ski until ten at night.
Ah, how pretty, and you know how to ski already and all? the hand, was it easy to learn or not?
Look, the truth is I picked up fast, since last winter, yes, I picked it up fast but,ski but now, this winter I'm going to devote myself to snowboarding that they told me was a little more
Look at that, mate, how good, how good. I would like it.
yes, in a month and a half I'll let you know.
For me, we would like it, what happens is that now we are leaving to, let's say, Baltimore is closer to Washington, then it gets harder, but just the same with all the friends we have here
and we have another Argentinian couple that lives in, in Vermont
yes.
and they go skiing all the time, obviously and there no, well there's much more to do in Vermont, but this
Sure.
What is their name? They always tell us, come here, come visit and lets go skying. I really want to.
Sure, yes. yes. It's okay, I like to do it, it makes me able to
yes.
long for the winter.
yes, hold on a second, hold on a second, what? It's in my, yes, yes, it's in my wallet I think. This, mm, what was I saying? Oh, about skying, yes, I want to learn how to do it, I want to learn
Sure, yes, well, that would be great. Then, oh, well, but, I'll tell you latter about snowboarding
I heard that Snowboarding is really good, one of my friends, well he's restless, he's an Argentinian guy from here
Philadelphia, his name is Federico and he told me, lets say, once when you learn how to do something, he gets bored of it
I mean, when he's, when there's nothing else for him to learn, and he, oh, what happens is that, oh, since he skies, it's like you have a lot of things to learn
Oh, I see
I mean, never, you never stop to try to perfect your skying.
Sure, that can be true, that's true, but the, the ones that practice snowboarding say it's funnier, they never go back to
Oh, skying? Really? Look at that.
Sure, they say is more fun, that's what they say.
That's all right, I mean, it seems hard, snowboarding, I believe that even, when they should, I don't know, why, I feel like it's easier to learn how to snowboard than to sky.
Sure, no, I don't know, I've never been able to get on a skate
Sure, yes, it's complicated.
So
They say it's like surf
And, and of course not, I don´t know I don´t have I don´t know, well eh I am going to, I am going to see how it is but if, I don´t know, I want to, besides the
the move, all my friends tell me I started, and the move, the culture, the ones who make the
Ah.
snowboarding is like when you go to the beach and there are the surfers
yes? Are you serious?
they get into, they get into a good time, then I said well, lets go to do it, I bought, they bought to me
Ah, do you have, Do you have the snowboard and all the stuff?
NO, no, no I say they bought me
Ah.
William, Orlando, Florida
Good evening, Aurelio from Washington DC
how are you sir?
Very [well] thanks, what's your name again?
William
William, what's up?, nice to meet you
How are you?
Very well, thanks, I'm driving here, can you imagine, uh
Uh
Hey, equity, maybe we could write a book
definitely, where are you from?
I'm originally from Venezuela
from Venezuela
yes, from Caracas
Oh, you, you know that the Venezuelan and the Cuban together
Exactly, yeah, they're now there with Chavez in the new, the new union, you know, the new set
And, and, how's equity there in Venezuela?
Look, I'm gonna tell you something, i haven't been to Venezuela for a long time, i haven't gone to Venezuela since ninety eight
Oh, yes
But, of course, i lived, i grew up there and i came to this country when i was twenty four years old, uh, but
wow
there was lots of inequality in Venezuela, I mean, that
lots
oh sure, between the rich and the poor
but but but it's something similar to this country or different
well, it was different because here it has to do with race and over there it has to do with
yes
the social class
oh, it's about the economy, money
exactly, do you understand? In here, at least the ones that don't make much money they can still have some things that the poor people
in the same circumstances as the ones from our countries, they will never be able to have, you know?
I understand
so, this, this inequality it's different here than the inequality from
it's mostly about race, I for exaple
race, religion is something else, religion in here is
in Miami, I used to live in Miami for a long time and here in Miami, ever since I arrived here from Cuba, I was nine years old and I lived there until I was twenty
or twenty four, twenty four or twenty five years old and now in Miami you don't really pay attention to race because everyone is
well they come from the same, I mean, the city is mostly made up of Hispanics, everyone is Hispanic so in a way, if you speak Spanish, everyone can understand you
this is a county of inequality but it's not so much because of the money, like you said, I think that money is the biggest race in this country
sure, mhm
I think that it's the money because you make money or you don't make money.
It's true that here, here in Washington for example is such that enough money and the race I say here for example
Yes and the race
Yes that's another thing in this country depends on where you are if it's here for example in Washington sounds, looks
yes
The other day I had to go to the police department because I had an accident recently so I had to go there to settle some issues
ha
But it's heard that it's the first time I've gone to the police department.
The first time in your life.
The first time in my life.
okay
and the car burned when I was in was traveling in Italy.
Aha
and when I returned I spent a week out, when we returned we saw the car burning.
hell
it would raise and they neutralized it completely, it burned with with this thing called paint center
right but to see here why is that
exactly yes, well it turns out that I had to go to the police look at all the people working there in the police here in Washington all I didn't see any but not even Hispanics, all black
ha
all, all black friends
all the blacks same as here, same as here in Miami and in Orlando because all, almost all the mulattoes, the blacks you can say, so
they all have the jobs that are in the state, federal, in the city, everyone
ah
here until the coast the girls write on the computer, what they receive
let him write
ah so so so the people who pick up the garbage, the garbage people, everyone's black, everyone's mulatto.
the same here too, the same here too, the guy who drives the bus is black, the guy who picks up the garbage is black, it's a crazy thing
I say, wow, it was incredible because not even one Hispanic
no brother, we're not, we're waiting behind
nothing no now but it's another thing here, the big concentration of Hispanics in this country is from central America
yes, the majority
the great majority, the great majority in the area of Washington come from El Salvador or come from Honduras
from Mexico
eh no very few, there are few Mexicans
yes how surprising, this is really surprising
what's abundant here friend, when, when you go there and check it out you're sure that they're from El Salvador
they come here, ah, let me ask you something, there in the north, eh, the total percentage of the city, or the city up there you can say
what would you say is the percentage of Hispanics?  How many more or less do you think of the population there?
sometimes here I would say it's about
yes
five percent more or less
nothing more
yes but depending on where you are too, it depends on the area, there are parts here in Washington that are totally Hispanic, the stores are Hispanic
the restaurants are Hispanic, you're walking on the street and it seems like there was recently, eh, I don't know if you've directly seen in El Salvador something like this
yeah you know
you have people selling popusas in the streets, like something so so like
a Hispanic thing, the Hispanic things that we are looking for.
similar, similar, so exactly
and they come here and personally they, not like I can tell you, they aren't but Americans, Americans know when you introduce yourself that you're Hispanic
look for me, I'm going to tell you something, I know something else that doesn't get a lot of attention either
no
so it's mostly the majority of Americans here think that I'm Italian
ah, yeah?
hmm, yes, they think that, there are some who think that I'm Puerto Rican, and there are others who think that I'm Italian, I say no, and they fight for the two
hey yeah
I'm Venezuelan yes yes yes
from the city of Caracas
yes, exactly, and another thing, I worked for two years, I worked in Radio Shack in a shopping mall
aha
really famous in this area for sure, a really big mall, and eh, I saw that the Arabs who came thought that I was Arabic
and they'd start speaking in Arabic and I'd say, hey hey hey stop men, stop it, calm down man, I'm not Arab so
I am not, I am not, I am not but you've never been here by the super, in Miami, Orlando
yes yes sure I've been to Miami and Orlando many times, my family owns a
what do you think, what do you think about Miami?
I love it, I loved it, I love it, mhm
nice, oh, come hear, let me ask you something because I'm quite curious about it, I signed on to join this program but I really didn't read what it was for
why are they making us do these calls and all of that oh I'm not sure to what I signed up to but it's been a while and I don't remember exactly what it was for.
this is a linguistics study that is conducted by the University of Pennsylvania, no? I'm not sure if it's the University of Pennsylvania or not.
They want to do, they are trying to do an investigation on how people speaks Spanish, do you understand, to do linguistic studies and to
and to train these machines that can recognize who is talking
aha
you know, machines that you tell them anything and then
yes, like when you call Fedex and you just have to speak to the machine and press a
that's the same thing, well, that's what they are trying to do
wow, but do they do that only with Hispanics or with the gringos too?
Look, I've spoken with people that speak with a gringo accent, that are gringos, you can notice that their native language is English
sure
and well, they also included them here so I think they need to do that, look, there's people that talk to those machines and they have an accent so the machines have to
be able to recognize the accent someway.
wow, that's amazing.
yes, but it seems to be to be a very interesting study
it's incredible, they come here and you know that I have family in Venezuela
hmm, really?
I have, aha, I have two cousins, I have my aunt, my aunt's husband, eh well, in the end I have two or three people over there and I'm really worried about the situation because they're good
aha
in Venezuela they're fine, they don't live badly now and what I want to ask them, eh but when we can see each other, when they will come to the United States
and they say that no that the thing, the thing seems that they can't in the next ten years, they can't get out of there, you know?
or things aren't easy right now to, to come here from there.
the thing is really complicated
no it's, yes, my my family well, they have when we, before moving here we came here many times, my dad had a visa
he's American like to come here, well as a tourist
sure
so, but you don't think that it's as easy right now
well, eh, for what they tell me, imagine living as well as they're living, there's money for things, there's job
this is what they say, they tell the family this to keep us mythical
sure yes or like
that I can personally, I compare it from where I come from, I lived in Cuba for nine years and so this is, pardon the language, tremendous shit, so what happens is when the tell me they're living so well the I let them
it's comparing to how they lived in Cuba
sure
because I say damn, you're living so well and you can't come see us, it needs to be a little more complicated than this
well see I am going to tell you something I was ah with people from with Cubans here in this country and they tell me that the situation is not very good as it is said
aha
yeah yes yes yes they are not well so they are bad and there are others who say that they are well so it is a thing  like I tell you it is difficult to
so it depends of each person
it is difficult to generalize
exactly it depends of the perspective of each one there are people that say no the situation is good, I am, we are fine there is not problem ta ta ta
yes the worst maybe the one besides you is all fucked
exactly you don´t know it is difficult to tell it
come here and What can you do in Washington in a night of? eh in a night like this eh how do you say it so cold, there is very cold in Washington today right?
right now not yes right now is not so cold so cold don´t think about it because if a
yes, no
no no we have thirty seven grades Fahrenheit that is like
fuck you but here in Orlando there are forty and I am freezing here the air
Hi, good evening, my name is Martin
Hi, good afternoon, my name is Jorge and I'm calling from
From
Los Angeles, California, where are you calling from, Martin?
Martin, uh, from Philadelphia
And you're argentinian, isn't it true?
Yes
You're the fifth Argentinian person I've called on the phone now
Oh, really?
Exactly, uh, when was it?, the day before yesterday i spoke to another girl from Philadelphia
It must have been Mariano
No, a girl from Philadelphia that's called Leticia
The, yes, Mariano's wife, because she's
Oh, what?, what's this?, do you all know each other there?, what?
No, it's, it's very funny, this couple, this couple of friends dragged us all in into the system to this opportunity, i don't know what and well, we all called
Yes
We all know each other, we all do. My wife just talked to a girl that was also a friend of Mariano but lives in Boston
Oh, oh, well, yeah
This is very funny
Uh, did you say that Mariano lives in Boston?
No. Mariano lives here in Philadelphia, he's a, yes.
Mariano,well. The interesting thing is that I've been talking with eh Leticia before yesterday and Leticia tells me
Yes.
Oh, the other, I'm telling her, the other day I spoke with an Argentinian that lives in Boston.
Yes.
Yes, she tells me, and what's her name? Her name is Tamara. She tells me, oh I know her, is a friend of a friend of mine.
Yes.
So we are all well connected. That's good. Good.
Yes, no, is that we are
What place of Bue? Are you from Buenos Aires?
Yes, yes, You?
Yes, I mean that, Yes. what place from Buenos Aires are you from, from what neighborhood?
In reality is outside of Bueno-. Of of Haedo.
Oh, Haedo. Yes I remember, Haedo, yes. I'm from a neighborhood call Lanus Oeste.
Yes yes yes.
Valencin Alcina, but I've been in the United States almost nineteen years.
Ah, how terrific.
How long have you been here?
It's been four and half years, more or less.
Well, pleased to meet you, pleased to meet you. Well the topic that we have to talk about, today, this people find such topics, such topics
Yes, and, well
That make you philosophize, it's OK
Yes
The subject they want to make us talk about today is equity, uh
Yes
I think i have never seen in these nineteen years, with all the talks about equity
Yes
and, so many differences as there are in the United States
Yeah, right?, i find that kinda unbelievable too, yes
Uh you, yeah, are you seeing that already in... in these four years you've been...?
Yes
and, well, i have really witnessed it a lot with these nineteen years
Yes
Equity has been discussed for so long in this country, it's been so long since they talk about the good, the constitution of the country, everything
but racial differences are so evident that i never saw that
yes
anywhere else in the world
Yes
Uh, do you remember?, in Argentina, right?
There is inequity in Argentina, but it's more between rich and poor, between the middle class and rich and poors
Exactly.
there's inequality but is not so much. What happens in Argentina even with the immigrants. The immigrants arrived and got mixed among everybody and here you still see that on, I don't know, on the west coast there the immigrants are from other
from other countries, but here are the same from the same countries that went to Buenos Aires. The Italians, the Polish, eh and each one has their neighborhood. this is the Italian neighborhood, this is the Polish neighborhood, and they don't mix.
Even eh in Philadelphia?
That is Ah yes, in Philadelphia, in Phila-
I saw that when I went to New York, to New York.
Eh, New York also. But in Philadelphia is the same. There's the Italian market and they are all Italians.
Ah.
And they are still fourth generation Italians and are called Italian-American.
Ah ah ah.
Is as if I was called Italian-American simply
Do you have ah you have is your family of Italian origin?
Yes but that is like third or fourth generation also, then
Sure, I Sure, sure, sure. Me too, me too.
is as if I said I'm Italian and would talk with a strange accent that's why I thought. Then is like it was always very marked
eh from where you come and well, and your origin and everything makes you different and that's why the racial differences are marked  also.
Exactly.
I think, I don't know.
The other day this- you are like the third person I speak to from Philadelphia, the other day I was talking with a guy from Asuncion, Paraguay and he told me that in Philadelphia
Yes.
a great one. Oh also I tell you, in parenthesis, if you hear a lot of noise is because I'm making this call from a public telephone.
Ah, well.
I'm almost next to the street, what happens is that eh, of these twenty five calls, I don't know, my plan asks me to make five, I don't know in your plan,
yes.
but in my in my plan it asks me to make five calls that are not from my house.
Yes, yes, yes, yes. The same, the same.
Then this is the fourth, then now I passed by a public phone. Well,
Yes, they give you fifty dollars more.
I was I was telling you. Eh, the other day I was talking with this guy from Paraguay and he tells me that in Philadelphia
Yes.
I can get to say that the majority or a great majority of the people are of the black race.
Yes. yes. More or less.
Is that also your impression?
Yes, is if it's not fifty percent, is forty percent. The population is very big, yes.
How incredible, right? Look at that.
Yes yes. Is that it happens a lot here in the cities. New York not so much because is a huge city and is very cosmopolitan but even Washington -DC or Baltimore which is eh,
in fact we are going to move now to Baltimore, they are also
Ah, look how nice, look how nice.
It's also like forty, fifty percent blacks.
Exactly, exactly. Well,
Is is like that.
in Los Angeles, have you ever been in Los Angeles?
Yes. No, no
You've never been, well. In Los Angeles ah
No.
there are many types of races, basically, eh
Yes.
there are many people, there are Italians, there are many people of European race
Yes.
but also other types of minorities abound. Well the Hispanics are very big here in the United States.
Yes, sure, sure.
In especially, well, here in California, in Los Angeles. Eh
Yes yes yes.
mm many minorities from Central America.
Yes.
from Mexico. There are a lot of Argentinian people.
Yes.
Every day there are more Argentinian people. There's a big colony eh
Yes.
Armenians here in Los Angeles. Eh so much so that they have named one of the areas of Hollywood Little Armenia, little Armenia eh
Oh, really?
For example, the neighborhood i live in is a big
Yes
Uh, Russian immigration
Oh, look at that
Sometimes i'm, you're walking around the block, on the block i live in
Yes
And the only thing i hear [them] talking is Russian
Oh
It's very interesting, i think. It's like i was in Moscow, or, i don't know where, right?
Sure, yes
Uh, and, well, and the problem of equity, well, here in Los Angeles, to be more specific
Yes
Uh, they make you fell like they don't talk about it much, sometimes there's not much talk about it, but you feel it. for example, we have a governor
Sure, yes
Arnold Schwarzenegger
Yes, yes
That basically he's, well, i can't find any other word to say than he's basically racist
Sure
Against minorities, specially Latin minorities
Yes.
eh and he has basically declared himself against many of the laws that favored the Latin minorities, especially the Hispanic minorities.
Sure.
And then, and he basically he he he is a citizen of the United States but he wasn't born in the United States either.
No, it hasn't been long that
Because you know that he is German.
he hasn't been an American citizen that long, in fact. Yes.
Exactly, you know that he, I think that he's Austrian. He's from Austria
He's Austrian, yes. Yes, he's Austrian.
Well, see? And then he is the one that should least talk about those type of things.
Yes.
But to give you an idea, maybe you heard about it, there was eh a law here in California
Yes.
that they wanted to give to the opportunity of having the the, how do we say it in Spanish, we call it the driving permit.
Ah yes, the driving license. Yes yes yes.
Did you hear about that there on the east coast?
Yes I heard a little, I mean the idea is that
Well.
sure because no because in - the federal law doesn't let you get the driver's license if you don't have
A
A, a valid visa, basically
or a social security number, exactly
or a social security number, yes
Exactly, and so most, the great majority of... a great percentaje of the Latin or Hispanic immigration in Los Angeles, a lot of those people don't have a valid visa
Sure, sure
So, uh, uh, you know there's like eleven million in this country
Yes, yes, yes
that are fighting to correct their legal situation, so he basically
yes
uh, spoke in favor, i mean, against that law
Sure
So you see there's a lot of inequities there, another thing that was
yes
a couple of years ago here in Los Angeles, uh, there was a very famous case about Rodney King
Yes, yes, i remember, yes
Maybe you've heard about. Oh, you were still in Argentina at that time
Yes, i was in Argentina, that was on ninety seven, something like that, right?
Something like that, it was a huge mess
Yes, yes
When, uh, it was basically... the white cops uh, apparently there was an incident and they beat him, etc, etc, do you remember the trial they held for him?, [riots] broke through
fires were alighted in the Los Angeles area.
Sure, because people wanted to protest somehow. Yes.
It was pretty serious, it was huge. I used to live there and it was something so big, the are was badly destroyed. So, oh, equality is oh
is something that in theory, it sounds interesting but it doesn't really exist, equality.
Yes.
nor in the United States, nor in many other places.
No, yes. I agree.
Oh.
It's like-
Hello!
Hello!
Who am I talking too?
Hello, my name is Leticia. I can't really hear you that well.
yes, can you hear me?
That's better.
What's wrong? Well, oh, where are you calling from, I'm sorry?
from Philadelphia.
Philadelphia, that's fine.
And you, what's your name?
I'm, my name is Cris, I'm calling from Houston
Oh, I can barely hear you
yes, from this is Cris from Houston.
Aha, from Houston
yes.
Aha, and, what do you think about today's subject?
Well, it's a bit, I think that it's going to be a while before, no? before we reach a total equality between sexes and races,
We still have some segregation going on, different
yes.
types of races and well
How is Houston in the? There. What are the bigger minorities over there?
Well Houston is very diverse, it's very diverse; I think that it's one of the most diverse of the United States, including New York
yes.
but yes there's a big Hispanic presence
Yeah
yes, in comparison to others, the other states and well because it's Texas, right? it's close to Mexico and
Sure, Are you Mexican?
excuse me?
Are you Mexican?
yes yes, What do you think?
And I haven't been here long living in this country, eh the truth is that it still, I couldn't live very eh, very close, eh
Here in Philadelphia, there's a very big community eh, of African-Americans and no. No, there's so, so many Latinos for example, yes there's a lot of Asians, mostly Chinese.
yes
Eh, the truth is that, I don't know what, I don't know inequality shows itself. I, what I see is that each one, how they are, eh
the African-Americans between them, the Asians between them,
Sure
and I wonder well, the Latinos take care of it, eh I don't know eh, Or rather I don't know if if it's because there's a segregation or because
the, the people tend to group together to be a determined minority
mmm, sure
The truth is that still no, no I can't define it; but the neighborhoods are very distinct. Eh, but I don't know at the national level how
if they contribute for it to be that way or if coincidentally they, for example, the Blacks are poorer.
yes
I guess, no?
In general, no?
yes.
I imagine they are.
But, but, well I don't know what the government is doing for it to be that way or if it's problem derived from the society in itself.
well, what do you think about, lets say we have laws, right? Lets put a law that says that we are all equal and we are not going to discriminate.
it's true, when for example, someone is looking for a job, a person from
yes.
a, a person of that race or a Hispanic or a Black person
yes.
In that respect, well, it might happen that yes, there's some equality, no? But the reality is different in my opinion, isn't it?
No, it is like that we are not all treated in the same way, but, well, I believe that reality is quite different.
And something that is being shown, they want to make it look like
yes, sure.
No? And it's different in the reality, yes, when I was looking for a job I was very impressed that here,
nobody states in their curriculum how old they are, what genre,
Sure.
what Nationality, when they got to this country, it's something that one should state
yes, in your curriculum,
And, then here nobody asks for those things
where are you from
from Argentina. And that grabbed my attention, it seemed good. Right? because
yes, sure.
it means that the employer in some way chooses not not by the sex, not by the age, not by the race, by
yes, but rather by the abilities no that
I mean, yes, yes
for being an individual
Supposedly, yes but, well. Eh. I don't know, the truth is that I've been here a long, quite a long time and with the people I socialize
socialize the majority are Latins. Or Spanish. Or let's say or Europeans some. But I mean, it's harder for me socializing with Americans.
mm, And how long have you been here?
Is the same.
What?
No, no, I didn't hear what you said.
And how long have you been living here?
Ah, eh And since May it would be eight months
Ah.
I don't know. Do you socialize with a lot of American people?
Of everything.
Of everything.
yes. mm, almost no. Well, more with, mm, more with, with people of Indian origin.
Ah Indian. Are there many Indians there?
yes, well the University that I attend, eh, there are you see many Asians and
Ah.
many white people.
sure.
but I do like to relate with all kinds of people No? To get to know different cultures.
No, it's logical that's interesting, And did you ever feel any kind of discrimination?
Well not directly. But yes I mean. I don't remember one but yes when I came, I arrived here and eh well because of the language no? that
Because of the language.
isolated. So people like they discriminate you and they push you aside.
Sure.
But from there in in that well yeah. It's not. Well, at least it's not experienced any type of
yes, the truth is that It's, it's more or less rare the phenomenon to take place here. Because on the other hand it's a country that has, that is so cosmopolitan.
That has so many people, that come from other places, I think that I don't know, it must be one of the most cos-, cosmopolitan in the world
It could be No?
And I don't know, I to tell you the truth I haven't felt-t openly discriminated,
You, you think What, what what it has to do with the country where you come from? Because I have noticed that, I mean many people, eh
according to the country or the situation, so- socio-economical of of each individual, I don't know. If you have noticed that?
yes
But, that is not only here, but all over the world, I think, right?
yes, yes, maybe it is related. It is, eh, they open their doors, to everybody, right?
Sure yes. Or even the skin color, right? maybe
Well, it happened to me, I talked to a lot of Asian people who complained about being discriminated. Or mistreated
Where?
In, I don't know, when they go shopping, when they need to process something, they told me they were discriminated. And
and I told them, how strange, because that never happened to me. I have never been mistreated, not the way they can mistreat somebody in my country
Also it may be because of the bad temper of the person, but it is not against me. So, I don't know, that may exist, honstly I don't
know, if it is so, but
I, I think that is to certain people, don't you think so? Some people are very racist, other aren't, don't you think so?
yes, ah, sometimes I hear you so low that it is hard to follow the conversation
No, I'll put it louder
ye please, because
Now, do you hear me now?
yes, that's a little better
Ok, sorry, eh
Do you hear it right?
yes, yes, yes
Oh, I don't know what happens but
Perfectly. I think is the distance Right?
yes, I don't know what it is, Are you talking with a hand phone?
yes.
What were you telling me?
I think that someone of, depends on the person Don't you think? There are some people that, well have certain discrimination towards certain groups,
and some people that, well no.
yes,
Don't you think?
yes. yes. yes. I think that, I don't know here, some Asian people, perhaps have said the the African Americans didn't treat them well but
I don't know, I don't know if its real or not or, or, they are like sensitive and think that it's like that. Right? Because there are times, that also you have to
differentiate, what is a discrimination and what isn't. Right? But well. Have you lived in the United States a long time?
yes, I've been living here like seven years
Ah it's been a long time ah, And always there in in Houston?
Yes.
Aha, do you like it?
The truth, no
No, What part of Mexico are you from?
I'm from Cuernavaca, Morelos.
Aha
Do you know Mexico?
yes, i know the south
Oh, OK
San Cristóbal
Let's see, you see
Yucat'an
you see, last time i spoke to an Argentinian boy, and he also knows Mexico, but the south too
Oh
Yucatan and Chiapas, all those places in the south
Chiapas, sure, yes
Yes
Hello
Hello, can you hear me?
Hello?
Hello, Silvia here, with whom am I speaking?
Lourdes speaking, where are you located?
oh, I'm in, in a suburb of Chicago
oh, I'm, I'm in Texas,
it's called oh, in Texas, very good
how is- ah, for me it's the first time I've done this.  And you?
yes, eh, oh, yes, no, this is the sixth call already
oh, yes?
and I've talked with, it seems that it was four men and two women, and the topics were varied, no?  Ah, vary from being able to break up in a couple, to
eh, the religion, it has to do with, ah, if it's ah, what's it called?  eh, the religion if you were pro or against the, eh, organized religion
and these were the topics, but no, others have told me that it's not necessary to speak on a specific topic, the one from today is
I already forgot what the topic was, on, the equality, the equality, right
equality between the sexes, right?  in a job
aha yeah, or, or globally, because for me there will always be, ah, hmm, well, discrimination, discrimination against any person who's not the majority there, so
for me, coming here about five years ago, the United States will have for me, more ah, people, ah, mixed with Hispanics and people
ah, of color, and very few will be people of completely white blood for me, hmm
oh, yes, it will be very rare to find, and from now forward I don't know when
mm
and it's been happening for a long time, but as far as equality of the
mm
jobs and that the problem that exists now is that, eh although the women can do the same job as a man
mm
they don't pay them the same
exactly, that still happens a lot in fact, I finished doing a job, because I do insurance ah, and they send me to different states to be able to represent the company and its benefits they offer that year
mm
and in two or three weeks we are there with like thirty of us as employees and we explain the benefits one on one, right?
I got Louisiana and sat with
oh
one hundred and sixty people during that period of time and they were whites, blacks, Indians
mm
ah they had French names because that area was Creole
yes, yes
but it was very popular eh, being Indian, also
yes
and very few spoke Spanish and I stayed the same, I thought I was going to learn what was the difference of an Indian and a Mexican
knowing well that originally we are Spanish mixed with the Indian, but which Indian? I still don't know,
I should
mm, I haven't been there a lot, mhm
oh and, where are you from?
My grandparents are from Mexico but my parents were born in Texas.
Oh, okay
I was raised in Laredo, Texas
Oh, okay, look
My grandmother forced us to speak Spanish when we were little, when we were around six or seven years old and I thank God for that as I know speak Spanish
I moved to the congregation
yes
yes, oh, Spanish to continue and it has been of a lot of help in my job because
mhm
I always need it at work, they even pay me  more for that, twenty five dollars more per day as I speak Spanish, so, it was pretty useful to me, mhm.
really? Well, I've been lucky, I
I see
when, I'm from Puerto Rico.
oh, okay
and when I got
I don't know, hey, I don't know, hey, it might sound like I'm use to but Puerto Rican people have an accent, I don't know, you can't tell
,
,
It was because, when i got here, i found out that no one wanted to give me a job because i had an accent
Right
so, all these years i have done everything i can to lose the accent and, and, and everyone in my house speaks English
Wow
And all that, so, uh, now, after I've been established
Right, right
Because I've been here for twenty years, so, now
oh
I'm starting to use my Spanish again and trying to find more people, because i never, since i got to the United States, I've always been with americans, my husband is American
Right
And, and, well, it's like, i, how do you say that?, uh, i separated from
Right, well, yeah, you forget
latinos, except when i go to Puerto Rico to visit my mom and borthers
Uh huh
But aside from that, I'm always with Americans here, so uh
yeah
It's a habit i have, and everything i have, what i cook, everything's American
Yeah
So now, after I'm not, uh, older, well, i was, lately, i don't know what has gotten to me
I've missed from time to time, i need to find more
mm
the, the
is true is true because one, needs to know our ah be able to pass on to our kids, grandchildren, the family
yes, yes, yes
and, those
yes, my daughter my daughter lately has been interested in learning Spanish and in learning the customs and all that, and she's practically the one who has brought me more
ah, how nice
again, and in fact I was researching online, to see if I could be an interpreter
oh, is
ah, I wanted to be certified
mm
because, eh, what is it? eh, now I've been seeing more jobs that need interpreters and all that and that is something that I would like to do, you know
mm you should research for the courts because when a person is going to especially to do the citizenship papers
yes
they need, especially the attorneys, well here is something that is in high demand
wow
but they send they want you to go to school
yes, well I found on line here to do I just saw online online classes
oh excellent
and by phone, that I don't have to, eh, they come from Washington but I don't have to go there I can do it all on the computer or by phone
oh, how nice, what is the company called?
well I'm looking at that ah no, I have it at work, I was looking at it at work I have it, I have it in the favorites
yes
at work, ah, but
okay yeah
eh ah I don't remember now, I think it was something like that
oh, very good, because
but I don't remember but
I've also been investigating, and what I found was because I also want to travel, at the same time to a country outside of, of the United States
ah, okay
and what I did find is that if one goes to teach English as a second language then I was searching for a, a Latin country to be able eh
teach English and so they pay me to travel, right? but what it has shown through the computer it pays hardly nothing, it's five hundred a month
yeah
or if not they give one housing a, I mean a house to share with other teachers
oh, aha
and but, they give like twenty dollars a day, very little what they pay but, is, tele, well I know the advantage is traveling, I imagine, but
yes, yes ah, but in what? you tell me you are doing insurance now, life insurance or?
of life, of health, ah, also well, for older people, I did it for almost twelve years already, of medicare
aha
and, when that already passed the time when the government doesn't already support enough the people of advanced age now, well I switched to sell eh
the insurance benefits of the big companies, no?  Where instead of them being a great board and announcing all the benefits that they get, well
this company sits with the person individually with the computer and they show them everything that's free, this they can share, this they can,
pay, voluntary, voluntary services, and this happens in many different states, I'm almost at home, I'm almost never
ah, you don't have kids?
so, no, yeah, mine are twenty five, twenty six years old and I'm forty four, my daughter
oh yes
isn't a girl anymore, my daughter who's twenty five stays with me, she doesn't have kids, she doesn't have a boyfriend, she goes to work and comes back
yes
every day, I say, this one will stay with me until she's fifty, I can't get rid of her
yes, now, you're not married now?
hmm, no yeah, I divorced after twenty years of being married, and I'm go-
yes, now you have time to travel and enjoy and
yes this, I want to travel now, this is why I
yes, yes
I looked for this little job that brings me to different states and I've liked it a lot because the company pays for everything
yes, yes,
and when I come back well I fix my situation but I have my mom who's almost eighty
wow, yes
and I like to check with her because it gives me the opportunity to see the states that I haven't been able to see, because I didn't travel for my whole life, only on three or four cruises
wow
and, I was able to go to Puerto Rico, San Juan
yes
ah Cumule, in the Caribbean but aside, or to Hawaii, so, aside from these four trips I didn't, I haven't traveled at all, but this is where I knew my country, I don't
know Mexico at all, I don't have family who I know, eh, but all my family is in Texas and there I don't know anyone
wow, ah
so I would like to maybe travel as much as possible in the United States with this job
yes
but if the
and how, hey, and how did you get into this thing that you're doing?
this work?  in my
yes
in my company they all talk about it, right?  when you see a person from, you know, when you have experience in this area of work
yes many talk about what they will do and now they call it networking, right?
aha
because, when you stop working and go through the phases where you're blessed with a job because for me the corporal world where
you've been for many years, this is something in the past, the company where I worked for twelve years was, and they treated us really well, they paid us really well
but when the government didn't want to pay for the HMO then, well, they really cut down on us
hmm yes
and they cut our five offices down to one, they offered us packages for us to go, and well
aha
the ones that couldn't live with that cut were
Hello
Hello, good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
My name is Elena.
Who's speaking? My name is Rodrigo from New York
Hello, how are you? I'm call- I'm here in Vancouver.
Good, and you? oh Vancouver?
yes
ah, is very far
yes, yes, yes are you Chilean?
yes, and you?
ah, no, no I'm Spanish.
oh, how do you know, by the accent, by the, the tone of the voice?
yes, yes, yes, yes Is that I have, have a good ear and I have many Chilean friends.
ah, you already know.
yes, and I've talked with many people from Latin American so immediately immediately I hear the tone of the, the accent.
oh yes, that's what happens when one already talks with a eh, a couple of people. You already know eh, the tone and all that. I also, I know Spain, I lived in Madrid.
Ah, really? I'm from Madrid.
yes yes I knew Madrid. I was in plaza of Spain in the, train stations, in collao and all that, I liked it there a lot.
I was there two months.
Ah, were you there on vacation or for work?
yes, I went on vacation, and to know, and I took photos in the little castles and all that.
and so, and so, how long have you lived in the United States?
yes,  Now I live, so, I've been living here in the United States for two years.
ah, and are you going to stay there, or no?
yes, yes.  Now yes, now I'm thinking of staying.
ah, like you, you like it.
yes, I like it because I came, like I told you, two years ago and now I've gotten used to it.
sure
I got sued to it and I'm like this, I started studying, I started a little business, and since I, I like having come other times.
aha
Twice before.  But this time I want to stay.
ah, ah super, how great.
yes
And the business, like, is it going well?
yes.  It's a business that we Chileans have here in New York, that's about pineapples, selling this, mani, cacho, almonds, and all these things
ah, pi-
I don't know if you know New York here.
No, no, no, I don't see why, why, why, eh, is it particularly a Chilean business or
Because those who started the business were Chilean, so now the company has grown and yeah, there are others from other countries but those who started the company were Chilean.
i mean, what dry fruits are?
No, no, did you see that, uh, what do they call it?, uh, peanuts or things that are cooked with fire in a, uh, in a "fogoco"
Paella [a Spanish type of pan], you pour water and sugar, you warm them up and they sell
oh, yes, yes, yes, what we in Spain call "garapiñadas" [sugar-coated]
that, that's it, sugar coated, sugar coated
oh
we put sugar and honey on it
Oh, yeah, that's very tasty, oh, look at that
yes, and that's what we sell, and that's my business, i live from that
Oh
i live here, i have an apartment and i have my business, my cart, and that, i get by fine with that here
Oh, that's wonderful because it's, it's just that, uh, New York is very
cold?
it's very expensive
Yes, life here in New York is expensive
Oh, and you say, have you been in other places in?... because i was living here in California, and the truth is i.. i just came here a
week ago, i was in San Francisco and i love it, love it
Yes
Yes, yes, yes, that's
No, the places i know here are only in New York and New Jersey
ah, Have you never thought to go to California?
no, it is said that there are many Hispanic and many laws, many things I don´t like a lot.
yes ah, I don´t know. Well, the truth is that, I was, the first time I went to the United States I went to the east coast and I like most the west coast. Because of the weather, the people, for the
eh, the quality of life. Inside the United States is much quieter, people is least materialistic and
yes to me, where I would like to go is to Miami, live there in Miami.
Ah, yes well you can, you can go.
Because of the weather.
Because of course, of course, of course
You know that in New York is very cold. We have almost eight cold months.
yes uh
and we only have June, July, August with hot and others are colder. Right now is cold, it begins to snow and all that stuff.
of course, of course, and, and have you tried, have you herd the, the today´s topic that, that was put
The, the equality
yes have you notice?
yes
that inequality in, in, in the United States?
I, there is much difference.
hmm
There is much difference when a person is an immigrant and comes from another country now they put those things of the, the single women they don´t want them to come anymore
hmm, hmm
Mexicans, one died, one was killed short ago.
yes
I find that there is not equality here, so much injustice.
yes
Because if Mexicans come and jump is because they want a better future for them, for their families, for their kids.
hmm, hmm
And the people that is in that, that was put now, I find that not, I don´t like it. Now they put a group that besides the
immigration, they also are dancing that and they treat them bad, they treat them as the worst and I found that is not fair I don´t like it
hmm
I do not agree, because of that, I do not think that there is equality here.
of course Well, I think that not, it does not exists. Equality never, no, does not exists, so, it can be a, there is a
No.
a better thing, right? I know that I have seen for example in, in reference to Latin countries including Spain for example between men and, men and eh, and women
no
there are more differences in Spain than here. Eh, or in Cali, in Canada or in the United States because in Spain, eh, the woman
because she is a woman has less, less, eh, work she is less, eh, paid and besides that also eh, I don´t know, the, the job offers and in Chile is the same
they ask you, eh questions that in Canada and the United States are forbidden, right? Like for example eh, your civil state eh, and what is the other one?, and, things like that, so, things that
In eh, the United States never would ask you and are illegal, in Spain they still ask you. In fact, the curriculum I don´t know if you call it like that in, in, in Chile
aha
you have to put your picture. Eh there are jobs where they require to be younger than thirty, so there is age discrimination, there is sex discrimination,
and there's also eh, discrimination of, eh, of, of race, right?
in Chile you also go, a woman wants to work in a supermarket it has that says, needed cashier up to twenty five years old.
sure
Security guard up to thirty five.
mm
And they put the age, they put the age already by that limit you are already bigger, older, you can't opt for that job.
yes, yes is the same, and
And mm and
I have a friend, look is interesting is the, the opposite of, of in your case. he was living in, in the United States for ten years
He had his papers
okay
but he didn't like it, he didn't like the United States and at the end has gone to live to Chile, he's been there already like two, two or three years
and I don't know how well he's doing because he left well he left, he left exiled from Chile, right? and was living in France,
and then was living in in the United States.
ah, sure.
And, and it was, was quite hard for him because he didn't know the language, Did you speak the language when you came to
No, I'm just recently learning because I'm going to school to learn English.
ah,
yes, is hard but you know that here the people are understood well. I mean is not impossible, I work just the same, I just the same do my things in- I mean in English.
sure
Do you know what i didn't like about Spain?, that i wanted to work in Spain and if i didn't have the so called "job offer", i couldn't work
sure, sure, sure
job
What, uh, if you don't mind, i mean, if it's not very, uh, very
No, ask me anything you want
yes, uh, what did you, what did you work on in Chile?
I worked at one of those markets
Oh, sure, uh, but no, i think, in Spain you can, you can get a work permit, uh, because for example, i know many girls that work, uh,
uh, babysitting and they give them a job offer
yes, i tried to get that job offer, uh, but it was almost impossible, right?, it costed a lot, so i was there for two months and my ideas was to go
from Chile to do my life in Spain, but i went with two more friends, well, we were three
Uh huh, yes
and we were four
Right
two stayed and two came, my other two friends stayed there
in Spain
others didn'- in Spain
Oh
We went there on like two thousand and two
Right
they have three or four years here and I think one resident.
so what are they doing for work?
having no papers  they went to work in the fields to harvest the olives or something like that
in southern Spain right? Almeria
yes, yes, but I did not like had a theater workshops
yes, yes
but when I saw the boss he didn´t wanted to pay
without shame, that's what happens
I wanted to pay because their passports and held me all that I did not like
I have family members here and they have noticed that I am here hi Mary how are you? can you give me a hug? I love
your dress can you give me a kiss? I´m talking on the phone, I´m going to go now okay?yeah? I just that I have to
we are celebreating the cinco de mayo, i´m sorry January
oh yes that day
the three kings day
we celebreated yesterday we had a rosca(bread)
in fact
rosca de chocolate( chocolate bread)
a chocolate cake
yes of course
I have family members say good because I've been here about ten days and I have not spoken
Well, I'm gonna keep doing this, right?
yeah, and, how many calls have you made already?
I don't, i don't have many, like five, and you?
I have like four or five
Oh, OK
I want to finish already, not the twenty five. I told the operator, "look, can't i make two, can they call me three, four times a day?"
And she said "no, it's only one a day", it's one a day, right?
Well, i don't know, sometimes, sometimes they call you more, it depends, if you have the call or not, but well, it's interesting, the truth is that you get to know people and you can see a little bit about the
the differences, right?, and, do you have friends in New York?
yes, i have lots of friends here in New York, i have lots of mexican, dominican, Puerto Rican friends, i have everything, everything
Uh huh
I'm one of the few Chileans that hang with them, because i don't quite get along with my race, with the chileans
no?, but, but why not?
because it's like a very... like very envious people
Oh
Oh
Yes?
sometimes, sometimes you have a little bit of, of people from your own country, and you find friends in other countries that are better
Um, i, uh
So it's not the same
Expensive, I in Chile always, eh The Chilean people yes, have always been people very they have always given me the sense that they helped a lot.
yes well, we
That they helped a lot among themselves, they are very cooperative.
yes that, that is all, is like that, is true. We for example, the Chileans, when they come, how they call them the outsiders when a foreigner from another country comes
mm, mm
we give them a hand and that where are you staying, come stay here, you haven't eaten, we make you food. We are like that.
mm, mm
We are like very, eh, loveable with the outsiders.
mm
But here in the United States they are not like that, is very cold.
sure
You come from outside and the people distrust you, they don't open the door, they don't give you a glass of water, they don't help you at all. Here one doesn't know the neighbor no
okay
no, no, doesn't know how, that lives, no, they don't even know each other. I've been here in this apartment a year and a half and I don't even know all my neighbors.
sure mm mm
I don't know them.
and you
No I live in New York.
ah,okay
In Manhattan.
ah, wow.
yes, and I like it, I like it here.  yes.
Sure well I, you like it?  sure, here, eh, what happens in Cana-
You're in Canada, no?
yes, in Vancouver, I told you, I lived in, in the United States
yeah
yes, I like it a lot, I'd go to live there but well, in terms of visas and everything, I can't get the, the green card, I was working legally
yeah
and we- eh, my husband is from h ere.  That's why we have visas today, because it's his family and, they're Canadian so I came here and I've been living here for two and a half, almost three years.
oh, you were Spanish and your husband is Canadian.
yes, yes but we're going, eh, we're going to Spain.
yes
We're going to Spain in, well, I always say we're going to Spain.  Now starting in January a course of import export and well, if I find a job I'll stay a bit but
in theory in September we'll go back to Spain.
Because, you know?  here in the United States, there came, I don't know, many Spaniards who came to try their luck here because your country is good.
yes, well, there's more in the United States, I don't kn-
Hello
Hello yes a pleasure, my name is George calling from New York
George How are you? I'm
What?
What? yes I'm Antonio, I'm in Florida
How are you Antonio? How is it going?
How are you? fine, well getting into the matter, well I hear you.
yes this about the inequalities, right.
Of inequality, discrimination, integration, all that fits there.
there's a lot of that, right
yes,
well what do I tell you let's see.
How long have you lived here?
Me is five years. mm You?
eh, Always in New York?
yes yes always New York
ah, very good
How long have you been here?
I've already been here eight years and I lived in New York a while.
yes mm
yes
Got tired, got tired of the cold.
Well no, so tell me your impressions
Man let's see, well there's inequality because of the economic issue but also there are inequalities
yes
eh, I think here that is almost, almost opportunity for everyone, true.
yes
let's say that not totally, but if you make a little effort well the opportunities are there. But I think that many people also don't bother taking advantage of the opportunities there are, to overcome a little the inequalities.
I mean one part depends on the system
correct
of the government, of the people themselves and another part well man if I feel unequal, well I try to improve myself and get ahead.
correct, correct, Do you come from Colombia?
sure. yes I'm from Colombia
ah me too
yes What part?
yes from Medellin
ah maria, well you don't talk paya anymore
eh, barely. Where are you from?
I was born in Ibague but I lived in Bogota for more than twenty five years
ah good, good and also very close to Bogota
yes, sorry?
That Ibague is also really close to Bogota
ah yes only, now they're like three
It's very close, there, there in the neighborhood.
yes and
No well, I agree with you, and basically this is the country of opportunities.
yes
And I've been able to check and well the evidence is that, it's sure knowing more some other, other countries and other regions where discrimination is crazy.
I don't know if you know that in Europe there are countries
yes
that by constitution
hmm
a nationalized foreigner can't occupy public office
yes
so imagine that you have all the immigrants for all the time they've been there, and the more they prepare.  Not here, here the only preserved office is well
the President and the head of the Supreme Court, the rest everyone.
yes, yes, the rest, everyone can have any office
and you see that there's people, well there are many success stories.
yes hmm
now in how, well, it's the incorporating part is about the laws and living together well, you can't help but notice that there are people who have a lot of prejudices.
yes
But man we are not going to say that only here. In ours there also are and not so much for the color of the skin but rather the status, you know that well.
yes that ah
Bogota north south you see such enormous differences and
mm
and how the ones from the south there's no integration and and, and there's not much access to certain places.
yes and, and maybe you find more racist people among the Latins, among the blacks, than, than among the whites themselves or,
I mean that
Americans, no.
yes, yes is that many times
very racist, that the Puerto Ricans, that the Dominicans, that the Mexicans
mm Each one starts to put their region, their country above,
yes
And falls into that, that vicious cycle.
mm
But well abounding a little more there eh is not the legal part anymore, but rather is the, in the coexisting that you have seen. In a city like New York for example.
yes
What as far as the integration?
ah well mm, no well New York, since there are people from all over the world and there's a place for everybody.
really
but definitely well like each region is, is closed, right. I don't think there's much integration. Suddenly one sees the Asians, the Chinese
the Hispanics and within the Hispanics the amount of groups there are each group is closed.
yes
basically, to me it seems the integration is very little mm
Correct that's also what I witnessed, but above it all you can
mm
say something grandiose. there is the coexistence, I mean together but not in each other's pockets but they are not killing themselves because of race issue, nothing and there are people from all over the world.
yes yes yes
Then there are places where
yes
like you say there live people exclusively of one ethnicity or race or region.
mm
yes they coexist
yes, no and for example one finds for example in the English classes those types of things
yes
well I see many people that like the same, I try to integrate with Russians, with Japanese, yes and I've never found any type of rejection, within those people or nothing like that.
mm
is correct.
then I think that if one wants it one can do it, now a lot of the racism and those types of things is a little bit of ignorance of the people, Isn't it true
Definitely, too much prejudice.
yes definitely the people, I see how ignorant the people are, that the first thing they put is the color I've had black friends, yes
yes
and people tell me And how do you understand black? no, well I have friends two three, but well and, and they have been like special with me, and I say, well I don't know
one has to know the person.
yes, yes definitely, exactly, I also think the same, that the people that put their racial prejudices or any other type ahead, are very low people.
yes
Because definitely you have to go further, man, why not see someone at the end for their values, for what they think, for what they do
mm
not just for the color of the skin.
yes
yes but unfortunately that's how it is. Just look eh, eh
mm
what just happened in France, where
mm
they themselves had put a blindfold saying that everything was fine, everything fine, and everything wasn't fine.
mm
it seems they have some belts almost of misery and they never wanted to see them.
And that never, you would never hear
No never, they, is that all they talked about this country you know that in general the Europeans are always knocking on the gringos.
ah mm
And them here what? There I saw some documentaries from the Spanish television, I mean done over there not from the gringos,
yes I was surprised with that
with the ghettos that the gypsies have in the
yes
all central Europe and I mean in Hungary, especially in Hungary, Romania and that, they don't want to see the
mm
any misery neighborhood in our country is more than that
yes
and they are there in Europe, but no they close the eyes and say that there everything is perfect.
I didn't, I really didn't have any idea of that situation,
there you do notice a certain racism of the other where the people are not allowed, to advance socially.
mm yes definitely the inequalities are the same in all the countries of the world maybe in some is more deeply rooted, or in some they cover it up, or in some they manipulate the situation
yes because inequalities, definitely in all part- here one, I admire it when one goes now to certain parts of the country
Is true
some states that are very agricultural, I don't see shacks
also
yes I didn't imagine
yes also, also one, one
ah
that well one doesn't believe it when one lives over there well one assumes when one is in his country that
yes
everybody lives very well and no, well at least all the whites and not necessarily.
no, not necessarily, I've seen many people that no
sure because there's also other things, people that I've known people that don't care well
yes
make a fortune, that's not their life ideal Then they live and survive but
yes
they are not interested in sacrificing time, to make money, that that is what's happening laast.
mm yes here there's not that culture of saving, of making a capital, here I see that many people live
Many people yes, well obviously they do dedicate themselves to capitalize
live no, yes I mean the
but there are others that no and that you have to respect, people that don't care say no, I'm not going to change years of life, precious time to enjoy submerged in money
mm yes but let's say in our countries, for example in Colombia everybody has a goal, their house, their savings, the education for their kids
yes, like everybody has the same but not here, here there are some that businesses or make money without caring too much about stepping on whoever.
mm
correct
And the great majority that live there like day to day Since the government pay many the
for the mone- but, but yes but you couldn't say they were unhappy, perhaps they are happy like that.
No yes, no, they don't worry about that situation they live there day to day, yes
Then that I know there are people that yes, are fine like that.
mhm
that, that is the
But the problem is that this country goes around with it's head down and so then the people aren't watching that, because
yes ah, yes, yes the last couple of years have been difficult, but
because, because
but in general because it's that now, What country is that in?
no yes but let's say that, a large part of the of the world, are thinking that here could be the most marvelous place in the world and that here nothing is ever going to happen to you
ah no, no yeah that's not that the stories that they tell that they tell those that came here forty years age, that's not no
yes, no mm
that they would go out in the street and the bosses would fight for them
yes, not right now, right now right now for example top executives, executives who rare fifty, fifty five right now there are a lot of people in the street
yes
and here with the pension plans, there are a lot of employees that are wanting to file for bankruptcy
ah yeah that has been huge, that was an enormous tragedy
they take this fund that truth, not the people well yes I have been reading stories of people that weren't used to it and each time they were changing jobs going upwards
and now after two and three years and the situations, the situations getting worse
yes that, you see that, right.
mm so then
addendum to this What do you think about interracial marriages or interracial couples?
it's hard between some, between some races I've read a lot about cases where, especially people married to Arabs.
hmm
it is, it is difficult, because the children are theirs, the submission of women I have read many cases, with Chinese it is difficult.
yes specially for women, right
correct, correct
for women from here from women from, married to to people from middle east, it is difficult.
and, and exactly and sometimes they don´t bother doing a little research
yes I have the case a daughter that
they take they take very unpleasant surprises.
yes no, I don´t they even notice it they travel in an innocent way and there are many women there that have not be able to freed themselves, lets say so

We went skiing to a place called... that's between California and Nevada, on the border

And
called Carmel, that's south of San Francisco, that's like, i don't know, an Elite place, something like that

Sure, yes
But no, the truth is that it's great, after there's a place that is all, like the area of the vineyards, like if it were Mendoza, but well, best here of the
Of the vineyards that are called
yes,
That's really pretty too
Ah, and they let them try

yes,
But no, not crazy we said no, everything's great but no, no
Sure
It already happened, we weren't paying five dollars to taste some wine, that on top was a glass they didn't even fill
Sure, well, so let's do this, we're almost sure that we're going there on twenty
Ok, great
So
Yeah, spectacular

Hmm, yes, yes, yes.  it should be the same.
You're not sure, no?  That, that your orientation
Sorry?
No?  You're not sure in your orientation?  You don't want to get married, a boy who seems cute
Ah, this is why I'm pretty deviant, you say?

And well here I have a moment.
A step forward
Like, that they will do it.
Return to
it's good.  The money, yes.  The money that they give you.
An ho well, it's not worse, until they give us back the deposit
Until what?  Ah, yes.
Because there are things.  There are the view seats, eh.  Like insurance.
yes, well.  Crazy.  What was I going to tell you? Aye I have to go to the baby soon.  Well it doesn't matter.  Where he is, you don't see many service stations in Baltimore.  I don't know where they are.
I remember one.  The North
But but yes but you have to ask
No.

yes. yes. still twenty five dollars
Hello! Rodrigo, from New York
Mirian from Florida
Hello,
Hello,
Tell me, but you're calling from Florida
sorry?
where are you calling from?  From Florida?
Yes, from Florida
Yeah,
yes, what do you think about this?  the, the topic
The topic of today.
Ah,
Well I agree
yes
I think that, that I agree that people who want to come to find a new future, who come to this country and it's good that everyone who comes
doesn't have to close, close the doors.  No, I don't agree with this big wall that they're building against Mexico and this, no
yes,
and you, what do you think?
I think the same, that well everyone
Ah,
He came, the majority of people come for a better future, for, to have a better economic life, to help their family, from the country they come from, and here this country
Help people, help to have this opportunity.  They give them the opportunity including my dad was an immigrant for many years and now thank God, he's, he's making enough money
Ah, yes this is good and so, have you been living here for a long time?
yes, I've been here about fifteen years
oh, and you're used to it, you like it, no?
what did you say?
that you're already used to it, if you like to live here in the United States
Oh, I love it, eh, I went to Mexico and I love to go, but only on vacation, yeah, you're already used to it here, like, going to live there again, I don't think
that I would be comfortable, it wasn't they same when you, you've been living in a country and you've adapted to the culture of that country
Sure what happens is that people
You know?
People get used to a level of life and so, I, you're already used to living here in the United States and after, eh, going to live in Mexico, since you
You would only like to go to visit because you're used to living here yes
hmm
The same happened to me, I lived in Chile
yes
My parents came from Chile, but I'm used to here, to live here too
Have you been here for many years?
No, I have, I go and I come back, I come and it's like the fourth time and now I'm here again yes
Ah good yeah I understand, no but, like, I'm Mexican and going back to Mexico, I don't think I could do it.
My dad cooks well No, don't think that you can go back to your country and get used to living there, right?
but yes, no, not any more, I would not be able to get used to it again any more.
yes it's hard to get used to it And that's why I'm telling you, I think that this country gives many possibilities of
yes,
Like what they call here the American Dream so everyone that wants to come here and I think that's good, that it has ah, Give an opportunity
And then the, what one does here, I mean the, what one earns in one day Ah the, sometimes a person makes that over there in a week
Then so used to a, a way of living
sure
That with a hundred dollars a week
mm
No, we wouldn't be able to live
no because you know that here a
No, I mean It would be difficult for us
A
For us to get used
No, here one can earn a hundred dollars daily, over there I tell you they earn it in a week, as you say so Eh, one has to get used to that standard of living
Exactly, yes yes, but
yes,
Eh imagine it's be, rather the country
yes
what damage,
Exactly I don't know why now those, those men the
personal
mean men I don't know what they are called Who are against the
yes
Those men that are against, that say that they come to do harm, that it's a plague. No, I find that no, we come to contribute here to the country.
The manual labor and many things that are produced
hm yes, yes
Is not like they are coming to do harm or any of that.
And, and it seems that I heard that
But there are so many racist people mm, pardon
And it seems, I heard that, the founder of that organization
hm
Is an immigrant
imagine that
I mean how can an immigrant do that to his people, understand,
yes I also know that
When
There were some Mexican people that were well saying they were like accusing, they were in charge of looking for people that were coming through they themselves
Being Mexicans or from Mexican parents that are into that too, how can they be like that.
aha
That's not all right.
And for example, the Mexicans, the Salvadorians, I mean, all the Hispanics, they do the jobs that the Americans reject, the ones that they don't want to do.
sure
And that
Just imagine how it would be without them
It's everything this country doesn't want, they don't want to acknowledge the fact that they need the immigrants and that's why sometimes, they do grant asylum to people, to people from countries like El Salvador.
sure, but that's why, they don't want to acknowledge the fact that they need them, yes
mhm, yes, so, for example, this lottery thing, have you heard about the visa lottery?
yes, the
yes, it includes lots of countries that have been excluded from the lottery, I mean, because, they chose to let in some countries and leave some out
And what happens is that, the, the, the, they include them because they have already filled their quote, they have a quote for example, there are lots of Mexicans, so lets say, we have lots of Mexicans
and they don't want to let in more Mexicans, so that's why the are left out but, there's still a
They also leave the Salvadorians and Hondurans out
yes
Guatemalans.
yes, because I don't know how this works so they I believe they fill their quotes and they need foreigners from this country
So they don't need more I don't know, I only know that Chile is not excluded from the list
How?
I, I the only thing I know is that Chile is not excluded, no, we can
Oh, no
Well, before it was very easy for us to come to the United States. You got a visa, anyone who had a good job, who had a, a
regular economical situation got one, but now it is almost impossible. Now for a Chilean to come to the United States, he has to be almost millionaire
yes, yes
And a long time ago he got the visa
what?
He got his visa a long time ago
I got it in the year ninety-four, but
mm, it's a long time ago
but the important thing is to keep you coming and going, coming and going, I wonder why, they give it for six months or one year, and you must respect that date for it not to expire
And that's it
yes, but it is nuisance travelling there, just figure every six months spending on two way passages. Is is expensive
Because the idea is staying, for a while, here. But you can't because it is illegal. A lot of possibilities also, right
oh, yes
But, like I told you, from Mexico it is also difficult to get a visa to come here
yes, really difficult. Mm, last
Mm, too much vigilance
Even, in my country, it was easier for a person who was studying in the university. Regular students from the university applied for it and got it
but not any more, now if you are a university student you don't get it, eh, it is a young boy, it is a risk, a risk that  since he is young he may come here to stay
yes So many people opt to leave the hard way also hello, okay
yes
It's hard but the people come and they opt to leave the hard way
and I can't hear you, there's too much noise, where you are at
You can't hear well
No, is all the noise, in the background
Okay, but okay hold on
I can hardly hear
I'm going, I'm going to change to another room to be able to talk fine.
Do you have a party over there.
Hello
are you having a party?
yes A little party of the magicians, that we 're still going with the magician's party and Now yes. Now you hear me fine right?
yes, yes okay
Now I came to the room, yes
Better yes then No, and also for example They want to build the wall of, which will divide, divide Mexico and the United States
but the funny thing is that the Mexicans think that the Mexicans themselves are going to do that because they can pay them cheaper and the
Sure yes I understand you I mean you know that he found there the bar, but the bar for the cafe for the Mexicans
yes Well yes, eh, because them I mean near the, the border what you most see is the immigrant And an American is not going to work for six dollars an hour, nor five dollar an hour
No
would have to be very in need, then unfortunately the Mexican or the immigrant would have to
It is like, it is like an irony that they themselves have to build their own barrier
yes, that is what I was saying
Their own wall
Like I heard in "Primer Impacto" the other day fashion shoes, been sold in New York, in New York
yeah
They are been sold around a Hundred dollars each, each pair No two hundred two hundred dollars each pair And the designer of those shoes Went and gave them as a gift to immigrants
yes
Because she made a promise And the immigrants have very expensive shoes And here Americans paid around two hundred dollars to have that pair of shoes
ah, yes I saw them, I saw them, those were all terrain shoes
I suppose so they were yes, well, they have, well, like a compass, so
yes
and like air under them
Of course they were all terrain shoes, prepared to cross without a problem
yes, yes, those, those are the shoes So, how funny that an American Has to pay two hundred dollars for a pair
yes
And those illegals are going to have the shoes for free. So all is an irony, all in life right now
So it is, but you know that, there are some things that also help, for example
This
I have friends that They have, eh, they work with a cart, so they sell on streets Yeah And time ago that person could have a license
And now a law was enacted, after October, November That the person that doesn't bring papers Can already get their license, the only thing they need to get is the Tax Id
Oh, yes
yes
yes because
So already mm
yes, I had heard that the immigrant couldn't, couldn't get for example the license and all that, things had gotten harder because of the terrorism
yes, And that more than anything had affected the immigrant a lot All, all the terrorism that there is that there's been lately, the attacks and the threats
Has affected the whole nation whether you're an immigrant or not, because still
but sometimes I think that is too much
yes, but they are doing it for your security, mine, of your family and mine
mm, yes
And certain things are good, for example in the airports Hardly, I don't know if you have, if you have traveled lately but in the airports
no
Sometimes not even for example not even a razor you can carry
no
In the cabin Because they take it away They wouldn't let you carry it.
But now they are letting use the scissors again
No, that I haven't heard
Doris
Maria, hello
yes hello good afternoon
yes good afternoon um well the topic is the immigration
yes
well what do you think about a little bit the topic that they posed the impact of the immigrants inside the economic structure of the country
no I think that the immigrant has been the great majority structure of the country because nowadays the immigrants are the ones that work in the country, the major
source of works are done by the immigrants
sure but what I ask you is
for me
eh at the beginning let's say within the history of the country the presence of the immigrants was very important especially before the wars and after the wars
sure
but already having an established country with a social economic and political structure don't you think that the presence of the immigrants can affect what the
let's say the social structure
what happens is that
for example the fact that the social minority transforms into the first minority of the country don't you think that can have an impact
that the natives from here don't want
yes that is but already the Latins are the immigrant already is I think that is already turning into the majority of the country because I think that each time more and more immigrants arrive but
I think that after they come to do a job and help the economy of the country right? because they also contribute to the economy of the country, of the country I think there's no problem,
I think that I think that the presence of the immigrant is positive I think is positive in any country the position of the immigrant because it helps
to a growth, right? I think that interchange and multiculturalism is positive
sure
mm, yes, I think that in other countries, mm, and specially in the Latin American countries they are much more tolerant with the immigrants and offer much more options for them to stay and settle
but the policy of this country is often too restrictive
yes, I think so, because I think that, if they come to work, and they come to take care of their family, and they contribute to the country because they work, and
contribute to the economy of the country although they are immigrants, I don't see the reason for all those laws and all that pressure, there are other countries where they can have a chance
without all the requirements of this country
but, I think that beyond the economical impact there is a social impact that I think affects, I think this is a country with a structure
a social structure quite conservative, more than is often shown
yes, that is the real problem, I think that what affects them most is how their culture is being affected
and is getting mixed with the immigrant's
sure, but thinking about cultures, right? from different places in the world, I think that somehow Latin culture is not that much contradictory to
the American culture, because I think that for the Hispanic community, mm, the religious values of the families in the United States
and some certain policies have a big support among the Latin community, which may be different in other communities, in other cultures
so, I think that the presence of Hispanic immigrants is positive because they assert some values that
the American hold
of course I understand that culture diversity is very good, I think that people
the American can absorb a lot of things from the immigrant, I think they can live normally, it's just that the laws
don't help the immigrants
and why do you think the American has this negative attitude towards the immigrant and the Hispanic often?
well I believe that it's because it's turning into the most of the country already has more rights and things are changing for example, regarding the language and
Spanish is now becoming more important than English, I mean, all those things I know that more immigrants are arriving and the country is filling up with immigrants so, they have more rights and they can
they can have the right to certain things and be able to take decisions because the number of immigrants is growing
and I believe that the United States is afraid of, of loosing its basic beliefs so, I think that the majority of the
Hispanics, they are getting in and they have to give them voice and vote regarding the things that happen in this country.
well, I don't know if the basic beliefs are, I'm doubtful about that, no? yes, yes, is it a matter of belief or a matter of
racial discrimination I had a situation when I was in this country that I didn't know about it when I was living somewhere else but I now see the discrimination
racial discrimination, this discrimination started against the black Afro American population, the black people and I think it's now against Hispanics too
and I don't know if it's against the culture or against the core principle of basic beliefs of the North American culture and I insist, to me, one of the
basis of the American culture is that it's so conservative and very religious and I think that I share that with the Latin community
that might not be shared with the Asian community because they are different, they have a different vision of the world, no? But I think they are similar to the Hispanics
so, I think that the discrimination is racial
yes yes I think there's lots of racism here and I just got here and I've seen that and I'm
I'm an American citizen and you know, I don't have an immigration problem but there's lots of racism in here and I think that they are afraid, well, I don't know if they are scared or not but I think they are confused
and they treat you like if you were inferior because they were born here
and you think that must of these controls, well, the patriot act, the real ID, all those new things that were approved in two thousand and five that are going to be discussed in two thousand and six
the references to immigrants, do you think it has to do with what happened on September eleven?
yes, I think so, yes, I think that they are judging all the people because of what happened on September eleven and I believe that
now they judge us and they are afraid and and look, I sometimes thing that it's a good and a bag thing because
it might not be an immigrant the one that does something like that again, it' might be one of the ones that live here, it might even be an American, you never know, people is like that, there are lots of people
good but there are many people that are not too well mentally right? and
mm
and and it can be from the same from the house it doesn't have to be an immigrant understand that for me maybe an immigrant can come with good things just as he can come with bad things
like it can also be an American who has good things just as it can also be bad things
yes the topic of security is not a matter of ethnicity let's say
pardon?
the topic of security because all the laws that are emerging and all those things that are being done they are shielded in the national security almost all come from
the department of home land security then eh and I think that's also a way of creating a very negative awareness towards the immigrant right?
because of security then we are going to close each time more the doors then I think that there's like an idea a little like they are
using that idea to justify eh policies that deep down eh have nothing to do with a topic of security like you say
the security, the insecurity is independent from the race of whatever person right? this can be the same American in fact in this country a thousand atrocities have happened
and the problems in the schools and the rest have been focus have been caused by Americans
exactly
where are you from?
I'm Puerto Rican
from Puerto Rico, I'm from Argentina, and how
and I arrived here also, here I arrived here and then and I also received a rejection even though I have the American citizenship, understand?
mm
and you know I didn't go through the hard work that immigrants go through to enter the country
sure
and you know I I got things like if I was totally inferior to that you understand me and that many people that are not even American also get
sure
you know that one comes to the country has luck, it all depends I think that we can't judge anyone understand
but even like that even when you are Puerto Rican and come here you feel that in some way they judge you with the same stick as any other Hispanic with or without papers
yes of course yes yes yes no they already don't look at you as if you were I have the citizenship but you know but they already look at you as an immigrant also
sure
they don't look at you as if you came to the country and you already have, you are an American citizen, you know many people don't but many people look at you yes
and where are you from not for the fact that you are an American citizen, they look at you because you are Latin period I mean you are not from here
mm
and that's what they look at and I think that no they judge people a lot because of that
mm
but it shouldn't be like that I think that all, we all come to give something period and the United States lives a little bit in fear of that and I think that the immigrant comes to give and
like the same American that lives here he is giving eh offering his country but the immigrant there are some that no but there are others that yes you know everything is
sure but do you think that they really are scared of them in reality because to me the fear of the immigrant is an excuse to cover up another fear
well yes I think so I think that the United States is afraid they will stop being the world power.
I am
Hello.
Hello?
Ah, yes How are you doing? My name is Adrian.
How are you? My name is, What is your name?
Adrian
Adrian. And where are you from?
Eh, I live in Toronto, Ontario, Canada,
Hmm.
and I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
Ah, I am Chilean.
yes, And where do you live now?
Now I live in, ah, in Maryland, near from Washington.
In Maryland?
yes. Near Washington DC
Near the sea?
Hmm, no, not near the sea.
No? Not near the beach?
About three hours from the sea.
Ah.
Well, close yes, but, not so close.
Ah, closer than here. Here, the only thing that we have, are lakes.
Ah
No-
Well, it's still water.
I don't know,
Mhm.
Have you lived here very long?
Ah, four years.
Ah, that's good. More or less like me. And, and,
Yeah, and do you like it?
yes, it's a little cool at the moment. But,
Yeah, the climate's tough.
yes.
yes.
But, over there it's not so cold. Right? In Maryland.
Ah, mm, it's pretty cold, yes, in Winter. Not now, but, mostly in winter, but in winter, to
Nie, There's snow and all that?
yes. yes, yes, yes. Sure. yeah.
yeah?
yes.
Ah, no, no-
No. It's cold, yes.
I don't know to the south where the snow gets to exactly. But,
Me neither. I know it comes here, yes.
And,
And what, mm,?
Where, from where, where were you born, in Santiago?
In Santiago, yes.
And why did you leave?
Because I married an American.
Ah, well. Then, you didn't leave.
They took me, yes. They brought me here, yes. Exactly.
And, And, where did you meet him, in, in Chile?
I met him in Chile.
Mm.
In my country, yes.
Was he working there?
He was working there, yes. He had a company over there of, of, of, consulting company, or consulting, or something like that.
yes, exactly.
And, and you, Why did you come- left to Canada?
And- Because, I don't know, I was tired of Argentina, and the, the ? How, How can I explain it? I know, I know that things are a little different in, in Chile, but
the, the way of, of how the country is, if you want, or, or society, or the people, or the politic, or the economy, or everything together
um, the not being able to make long term plans
Mm.
and, basically, those type of things,
Mm.
Buenos Aires, specifically, is becoming a city, um, quite different of what it was when, when I was little, for example.
yes
Is a much more dangerous place, um, I don't know.
Mm,
I don't know what else. In, in, in, in my life I remember at least three of the important economies and, mm
yes.
and with everything that has brought me. Right? Is not only the economic, but there is an issue I don't know if it's psychological
Mm. The situation is very hard, for the Argentinians. Now, and, and, well, we, ah, I think that we've taken from here, from there to here, in the sense that the Argentinians traveled to
Chile when we had problems, and we traveled to Argentina when they had problems.
yes, that always yes.
With the matter of the currency exchange. Right? Then, yes, always, always, we knew, what was happening in Argentina. But, really, it's a shame because a country so, with people so,
mm, I like the Argentinians, um,
Of one, yes. When they are all together, holds back so much. But, when, of one,
Mm.
yes. More than two points, no
yes. Well, they have their things. But, I would say that they have good things also. But, I don't know if it's bad luck, the truth, no, no, I don't know.
No, it hasn't gone too well for them. But, well, ah, we have to talk about the topic of immigration. Um,
yes, it would be a little subjective in our case. But, but, if you wouldn't have married an American, Would you have left Santiago or no?
Mm, well, in my personal case no, Because, no, I didn't have many reasons to emigrate, let's say. I was working, um, I was making good money. No, I had no situation that would tell me or that would push me to,
to leave to another country. Then, but I think that there are many people
Did you get married and leave, or, or you got married there in, in, in Santiago?
I got married and left.
Ah.
But, I knew that. Let's say, I knew.
Ah, no. Obviously, yes, that they fooled you, that's true
No, no, no, No, but I want to say, that it wasn't something that, that, that,
Ah.
that came in the way and they told you, listen why not? No, I knew, And, the truth is that I'm very adventurous, then no, I wasn't scared.
Okay. But, for that it was, when you accepted the package, it was with the tickets also.
Exactly, yes
Eh, but
yes. yes but, I don't know, I, the truth, no, the topic of immigration, um, I think that it has advantages and disadvantages, like everything. Isn't it true?
I find that the people that come here, well, there's legals and illegals. And, I think that illegals, of course that it is complicated to handle a situation with illegal people that don't have,
they don't have health, no rights. You can't have a, I'm not going to say, control, but you don't know who they are, you have no, no record.
of that people, it's complicated for a country to be able to handle that.
But, the, the health, no, oh, I don't live in the United States but if you don't have money, you don't have access to it right? If you don't have money to pay for healthcare
It doesn't matter if you are there legally or illegally, no? The
Oh, well, that's logical. Not logical, yes, yes, yes, no, it has nothing to do with being illegal. No, but, in my opinion, the
of the country, lets say, it has its advantages and its disadvantages. I think that well, it has both. It has both, I also think that many people take advantage of it and they pay lower wages and all of that. So,
it favors the economy.
yes, yes. That's why, the, the, from the outside, they complain but nothing changes, everything stays the same as it wouldn't suit us
Exactly, no, I believe that, as I say, you have the advantage of paying them low wages and and they do the job, right? And they can't complain because they are illegals
They are illegals, so, I don't, I don't know. Look, the truth is that I don't know. I think that oh, I don't really believe in, in, in countries, they have the Internet, and with that
the information comes and goes and in the end, the countries are going to end, lets say, so, I don't know, it's a bit
No, I don't believe so, oh. I don't.
How?
Like that, oh, yes. It's a quite romantic idea but,
yes, yes, yes, I know, I know, I know, I know that, but, the truth is, no, no, I don't know. What do you think?
No, I don't know, when you spoke about control and you don't know who they are and I don't know what, what, what, what, what, it's the bad side of
this, that could happen. Do you think it's wrong?
I think it is wrong. You know why?
The illegals they don't know who they are and no, they can0t control but, why would they have to be controlled then?
No, no, it's not about control, but, it is in a sense, if you live in, in a place, you have to know your obligations and your rights.
And I see it from the point of view of the rights, for example, if you work, oh and you get a wage, you have the right to have that part of your wages and to have a retirement fund and to have health coverage and all of that but if you are here illegally
lets say, how are you going to get that? It's hard you see. On the other hand, the things
But, the the the the that's their fault, the problem is for the illegal or for the one that has given him an illegal job, or?
no, I think they share the blame, of course, lets say this, the illegal, I believe, he doesn't, I'm not sure, I've never asked them if they are illegals or not, you never know.
But I believe that if someones is traveling to another country and leaving their family behind, is because they have a lot of problems in their own countries.
So, I believe that they share the blame or there are situations in both, in both places that make them,
promote that, you see? In some way, they receive information in Mexico or wherever the immigrants come from, about the best possibilities in here
and who are giving them those opportunities? Well, it's the Americans like myself, so, sure, we share the blame, of course, yes.
No, but I think that for them to leave their families and all they have behind to come illegally to the United States is because,
oh, they are desperate,
Sure.
whatever that means. It's
Sure.
but the, the, I always think that, that, that, to me it's not, that doesn't make them a bad or a good person, a better or a bad one,
No, no, no, not at all, no. I mean, you are not coming here to play, if you are an illegal migrant, it doesn't mean that you are a bad person Oh, you are not a bad person. Most of the times, I, I,
No, oh, no, no, oh well, I've never experienced it. Illegal immigration, it basically doesn't exist. The,
oh, it doesn't oh, and I believe that the difference is because everybody can come here to Canada and file for political asylum.
Mhm.
And I think that for default, they don't refuse it to anyone.
M, sure.
And starting from there, you can start the formalities, and how it whitens the whole world.  No-
Sure.  Yes, politics.
the, this is why I tell you, no, there isn't, there isn't a strong, of the, more than a market for, for, hmm
for illegal immigrants, what there is, there are some pretty obscure jobs.  The, em, you know the, a boy I met, a Chilean, he, the Chileans don't need visas to come here,
Aha.
eh, to study and to, because of NAFTA.
Hmm.
Like, you can come, but I think that you can't work,
Hmm, yeah.
for example, he, illegally, in quotation marks.  He, hmm, and there are some jobs in this call center, that do like scams and some fraud.
Hmm.
With.
Well, this is everywhere, I think.
yes, sure, well, but this is why I have problems
They don't need illegals, or immigrants, do to this.
But, this is why I tell you, it's something that's obscure, the, the work in this, it's, it's
yes.
Eh, if, if you go there, you know that you're losing something, that, it's gray, with respect to the law, and things like that.
yes.
Hmm, that goes more there to the, to the,
Carlos
Marla, hello, fine, and you?
hello, how are you? fine thank you, how are you?
fine, fine
oh good, good, good
it is the first time I do this, so
eh, me too
oh no, damn, well, anyway, we are supposed to talk about immigration
aha, me too, I have no idea, I have no idea because I didn't expect the call
what? oh, no, but, do you want to do it?
oh yes sure, yes, sure, of course I do, go on, I listen
oh, yes, well ok, I'll start, I don't know, eh, they asked about immigration
eh
whether you agree to, let's say, an indiscriminate immigration here in the United States, or not. Mm, aha
yes, I think that this is a country of, the country of freedom they call it, right? but there must be some parameters also
aha
because it might become a social problem
aha, aha, aha
and a cultural problem for the United States, because certainly, every person, depending on the country you come from, whether it is Central, South America or even Europe
aha, aha, absolutely
they bring their culture, their culture and for example, now, with Hispanics, we are Hispanics and we know our culture so then, there's a clash.
aha, yes, aha, aha
there's a culture clash and in fact, there's a social clash because we also have to get used to this culture, all that the United States is
aha,
but, most of them see that we are Hispanics and most of them, that also affects the United States.
aha, all together, the whole of society
so, yes sure, even in religion for
aha, why religion?
because, for example, the United States has mostly a protestant society
aha, oh well, yes, Hispanics are Christians,yes
but most of the Hispanics are Catholics there's a religion clash and not only a cultural one
that's right, aha
religions, where, oh, if we put ourselves in the United State's shoes
yes
we know that they have to handle it and I think that they must have it under certain control
aha
they must have a certain control over it because the moment will arrive when this will get out of hand so, they have to control it
aha, yes aha, absolutely, I believe that, I mean, I believe that immigration should be controlled I mean, you call it control, I do too, I mean, it has to be regulated I mean, you can't let everyone in
everyone, I mean, in general I believe that
aha
so the country lets say would have to evaluate the kind of immigration they want lets say to the benefit so to construct a more strong  country
and to do not happens what you are saying, so I for example if I had, if I were the United States
and where are you? Which country are you?
like the, eh, no no no no if I were the United States
ah yeah yes, ah yeah yeah yes yes yes
not if I were in the United States, no no I am in the United States, I am here in Boston so but if I were the United States so i I were in charge of the United States´s politics.
I lets say will look for example how they do whatever in Canada they say well what do we need, so we need labor force in which sectors of the economy and in the base of that so...
I would let to come people that is like
needed, eh exactly
of course positive for economical development lets say and on the other side I also would let to come in people eh for example those who make doctorate here who want to stay post doctorate
so this kind of immigration that rises the education level in general of the country also I think that that it is good lets say
yes of course but but see that eh I think that anyway here come
hmm, hmm, aha
to me, in my way of seeing things and in the little I know from the time I have been here most of the people who come here are very in need and they are people from low income from another countries
in in I talk of a country eh Hispanic or Latin, eh eh most of them
do you think so yes, aha but are you talking about illegal immigrants
most of them however is not our case eh there come so many people that that that come here because they have very bad economical problems in their native countries or in the countries they are living
hmm
then they come here with what they have called the American dream
hmm of course but
and not everybody is professional and and and not everybody is study and not everybody has had a career
mm, mm
and they come here searching for a better, a better future
sure but I mean with the immigration laws that they have now if you have that profile how do you enter the country
I entered as a refugee
what is that, ah political refugee, ah okay okay I understand already
yes yes is for a situation that well it was out of our hands already and we got to leave
mm, where are you from originally, ah Colombia
eh from Colombia yes from Colombia then eh that is a situation but I do think that they should regulate some more
mm mm
and and avoid that cultural clash and that religious clash also that whether they want it or not it's going to affect this country
yes absolutely
it will affect. Now with that that there's no labor or that eh the Hispanic does what the American doesn't want or something, I don't know how how much that is because I've also seen Americans doing all sorts of things
mm
and they do it, they do it well I think, sure, then eh well is an issue quite complex but I think that there should be a control, I don't know if there is I think there must be but but I think that
mm yes I think there is I mean in part with the I mean with the Green Card drawing for example, that lottery right
yes, yes, yes
for example there are countries which cannot participate
yes
in that lottery I don't know I think that China can't participate eh, Jamaica cannot participate either
ah yes but the same eh I think that there are many people that, that are, that have arrived to this country and are here illegally
ah of course
and I think that there there is where, where they have to eh mm so to speak become more hands on, pay more attention
and yes what happens is that I mean I don't know they have to decide to control it in some way
mm, yes
I mean...I don't know the people that enter illegally I don't know, I don't know how you can control that I mean
that there should be some way also
mm
but for me that's the biggest problem as far as immigration
mm, well
the person that arrives here illegally
mm. but, do you think there are many that come illegally?
for me is, well I think so, I think so
yes, what happens is that, I don't know I can't even think of how to do it I mean is like I don't know
aha, yes no, I but, I think that there is where they most let come in
I think I don't doubt what I don't doubt what you are saying eh look I'm telling you I don't know how you do it cross the border I don't know without anyone seeing you
ah, ah well ah oh
understand I mean how do you do it because every time I enter this country I have to show a million documents, not millions but I have the visa this the other
yes no, me too me the times that I entered before requesting asylum well with the visa and without any problem, without any problem. but I don't know how the rest might have entered but there are people that don't have a social, that don't have
a document and are here illegally or ah
yes I am
for example the great conflict is on the border with Mexico.
of course, okay I know someone
for me it's all a big problem.
okay
it is a big problem.
I a person so she lives in Miami
she came as a tourist and never return to their country
yes
she really bad happened because I had no access to any health service.
because being illegal is  terrible.
I think we all need someone's help because we are all human beings.
I think they should give the services because we are all human beings.
I work in a school where most children are immigrants, and many of them are children of illegal immigrants.
You can not deny education to a minor.
of course.
just because parents came here illegally.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello, who's speaking? Leticia?
yes. Hello? It seems we agreed.
I've been calling you for like two hours. I'm here calling, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Really? Oh. I went in and it sent me. Sure, we were waiting.
Sure, I was watching TV, and kept putting one, one, one.
It had been such a long time?
yes, what yes. No, well, I don't know. But, yes. Ten minutes, fifteen, for sure.
Well, yes. Uh, no, no, no, I eh, was saying, with whom, I'll probably get someone I know, so. I didn't know with whom, but someone I knew, plus, Mariano he was going to talk, since is his last call.
Ah, he already called to five different ones?
And, I tell him, yes.
Ah.
Because he used one of,
From the laboratory.
of the secretaries also. He got anywhere, in the laboratory to talk. No. And, and, since it didn't call, he said no, I'm going to start calling, because if not
Ah, no, no, I can't believe you, Plus, it's been so long that we don't see each other. We have a lot to talk about.
It's been like, been like, yes. Less than twenty four hours.
yes.
No, and plus, this topic I already go once.
Ah, yes? I didn't get this one. Well, they repeat the topics. I've gotten them repeated.
yes. yes, they repeat them, they repeat them, that's why, this one I already got.
Hm.
And, and, but I don't remember if I talked more. If I talked with someone of the topic, I don't remember what. But no, no, how funny. Who am I going to get? I was intrigued
No, I don't know. I was convinced that I wasn't going to be able to communicate in reality. Then, since I saw that it wasn't connecting, and that for sure I wasn't going to be able to talk again. And, I was come one, come on, come on. I had no expectation.
yes. And what are you doing? Waiting for Paulo to eat, or?
And, yes. I mean what happens is that
Oh, what? yes?
waiting until eleven thirty, twelve, like you start snacking.
That's why. how do you do it?  Is a pain waiting so long.
But, I also don't like I don't know, for him to come and eat alone, I don't know.
No, yes. You'll make the effort and will eat again.
Sure, then, like I snack something there. I have soup envelopes. Then, if I get very hungry I drink a soup, something
And you cook for when he arrives?
Sure. yes, now, just now at this time I start to cook. So, can you imagine? for eleven.
And, yes, you have a ton of time.
yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, obviously.
Ah, really? How nice.
Not me since we just arrived because we came in the train bus. Since it's so nice, we said, See that is twelve degrees?
Aha, Is very nice, see?
yes, and then, we said, well, let's walk a while, to, eh, we take the train bus and it leaves us in the twentieth, and we come walking. Like that, at least, we do some exercise.
Sure. Ah.
Then, the man put me to make milanesas, for the oven.
Ah, how yummy.
So, yes, we made-
yes, How's the diet going? Did you catch Mariano again and put him in line?
No, Mariano is
Already is.
yes, no, no
And, is that the diet, when and is like that you are disciplined, you break it once, and you screw it.
No, yes.
Is like quitting smoking. You stop smoking, you smoke one of these, and already you started to smoke again.
And that's it. No, that's why, eh, yes, is very hard. I don't know? And, I don't know. I'm like controlled, but I'm not doing. In reality I'm not doing the diet that, that, that,
that my sister gave me, nor any diet in particular. Like
Mm. And you why because you gained weight? Well, are you eating too much, or because of the change, of the quality of the things?
I try not to eat sweets, basically. I don't know? I don't know, Don't know, Don't know. Honestly, I don't know. Eh, this last month, I figure
But have you weighed yourself? Are you sure you gained weight?
I was eating yes, yes. Some one kilo, two kilos yes. I mean more than what I brought from Argentina, that already it wasn't what I wanted, let's say. Right?
Ah.
But, For me, is the lack I mean, these last months, the lack of activity.
yes, yes.
Because last before,
With this cold on top, sometimes like you don't even feel like going out, to walk.
yes, and add to that the cold that started, that I started to work, and started to walk less.
Sure.
And, that besides, in the job, in ah, I mean, in, in December, every day they had some cookie that someone had cooked. It was incredible.
Ah, sure. For the holidays, they give each other things,
Every day there was some cookie.
Sure.
And see. I mean, you pass by there, in the morning you get hungry.
yes, yes
you pass by where the cookies are and eat one.
yes, yes, like now that the German girl came from and brought chocolates, and you think that? just from the tray I grab one.
Sure, that's why, is like
are you bored working?
yes, besides me, put ten thirty, and I get hungry.
Sure. You go very early, right? Like eight?
No, eight thirty or a quarter to nine, depends of the bus I take. That I took. No? But, I don't know. Ten thirty, eleven I get this voracious hunger.
yes, yes, yes, yes.
Today I ate an apple. But, is like That moment passes, passes. But if I just pass by there and see a cookie,
Sure,
I eat it.
yes.
And, and in December, I swear in the, in my laboratory, it seemed everyone had to take something. Right? Because of the parties. And, and, and, plus many cooked. Then, they would take things,
Okay, and if it's a big laboratory, like they wind up and many come like that.
some that were good, yes, I swear. All, no, no, it was fatal. Also, I received little gifts from everyone. Well, of everyone who's closer to me.
No?
Besides taking cookies, all my close co-workers, they gave me some gifts.
Like a chocolate
Chocolates, a little soap, another a candle, another a CD with Christmas music. No, no,
How funny
Like it's customary to do that, and
I don't know. In the laboratory, they didn't, well my boss gave me a card, the only one. yes.
a card to Mariano, the boss gave him. Well, they, Mariano gave him a gift because eh, the Chinese guy told him that last year the boss had given gifts. Then they anticipated
they gave him a gift, the Chinese guy chose a fruit basket that, I say, a fruit basket no.
Between all of them.
It seemed kind of strange, but well.
Aha. But, on the other hand, I think that, that's customary, eh. I saw in many places, set up fruit baskets.
yes, the Chinese guy was insisting that it was customary. Then, I said well. And they gave him that. But, then the boss gave them, some bomboms and a,
a, what's it called?  A guest card from Barnes and Noble
Look at that.
for twenty five dollars, like how nice.
Eh.  Ah, what a son of a bitch.  My boss is call-
He was reported.
My boss only gave me a card that she made herself on the computer, besides.
Really?
With photos that Paulo took.  One d-, one day we went to eat at the house,
No.  She inv-, printed some things and done.  No?
Sure.  We went to eat at the house, and, and I said, aye, i want to take some nice photos of the kids to make a Christmas card for my family because I have family in Germany and Africa.  that don't have anyone.
Ah.
And, and fo- and I didn't have a camera there, what do I know.  So, Paulo took photos of the assholes.  And, hmm.
And, put together a card.  Yes, sure.  Well, she gave one to each of us in the laboratory and sent one to her family.  But well, it's printed there on the computer
yes, no, it wasn't any, yes, it wasn't anything like
At the time I was happy, but now that, that I hear it, I don't like it that much
not playing.  I didn't give anyone to anything, I mean, like,
Me, nothing.  Not anything, or-
I didn't give anything, besides I didn't know if there would be this vibe in the laboratory.  When I came, I don't know, for me it was almost-
Ah, but it depends on the laboratory.
I had just started, and for me it was a little, I don't know.
Very jeered.
yes, since it still wasn't in the vibe there, I don't think I ended up badly, because, last, I had no reason to know that they were giving away all those things, and well.
Nothing. Besides, nothing. I don't think that is what is customary. Is that your laboratory is like that or Mariano's because
But, but by there he could've taken something.
Not me, mine nothing. And, the one in front, well Paula's, nothing also.
yes, there because they are American bosses. Right? But Paulo's is also American, what happens is, that he doesn't care.
yes. But is seems that Paula's is very cheap, see that she counts?
Sure, there is another vibe the guy. I don't know. I swear. Everybody took something. And, what's more, there were some that went to Florida to
mm, no. for the holidays and,
yes.
they brought a basket with oranges. And, they put the basket there. No, no, fatal.
yes Look. Look my laboratory. Well, the German lady, she did because they in Germany were used to celebrating the sixth of December, more than the
twenty fifth. I don't know why the sixth. In reality the sixth is the day of Saint Nicolas,
Why the sixth?
the day of, well of Santa Claus. And, that day is when they give the gifts to the kids. And oh is, Christmas is the day that Jesus was born, but there are no gifts.
Really? Ah, ah, Don't they go the sixth of January?
yes. No, the sixth of December. In January, the kings, but we also don't celebrate so much, a small gift.
Ah. Look.
And a matter of making some cookies, then they give us some cookies.
yes.
She took them, I couldn't stop. Some fatty things that come apart in the mouth.
Delicious.
No, no, no. I asked her for the recipe, but well. I have it written down there. But, they are hard to do, I mean, not hard, but they have eighty thousand steps, and kneading, and
yes, you have to make them, yes. It goes in ti- Sure.
I don't think I'll ever do them. If some day I do, I'll give you.
yes. Oh go then.
I don't know what they are. No,no, Is something incredible. Kind of like the dry pastries of over there.
yes.
But thinner. I don't know how to explain it. They are more delicious. More delicious.
Ah.
But that was the only thing. My boss was the cards, and the fat guy nothing, the other guys nothing, me nothing. No,
yes. Ah, sure. yes, I don't know why, um, in the laboratory, I don't know what.
Really good.
it was done like that, and I said, well.
The same next year you will have to take one.
Next year,
Candies, something.
oh yes no, I said, well, when I go to Argentina I'll bring something.
Sure. Well I didn't go to Argentina, I brought them.
Sure.
I brought chimbote candies.
And, yes. Is okay. yes, when I go to Argentina
yes, yes.
Mariano was already looking at the prices in that page you sent him. The one of cheap, and told me he found good things.
Ah. Did you see that page is super good?
yes.
They have very different prices from all the rest.
yes, no. It's good, he told me there are good ones, but there are some that don't tell you the airlines.
No.
Is kind of like Priceline, that you
Sure. It doesn't tell you the airline, and doesn't tell you many of the times. It tells you, put, such day comes out. But, but it could be from the day from zero to twelve.
Ah. Sure.
I mean, of But, well, if you are going to travel,
Well, but last, yes. There the schedule doesn't screw you so much.
I mean, for a weekend, it really screws you. Because, is, is very different to leave at a time which is twelve hours later. But,
yes. yes.
for a long trip, no.
yes, no, no. For that. Right?
It doesn't matter. The truth it doesn't matter.
He was looking, and, because he had already looked before, in other pages, and up to now it was the best.
yes, I don't remember the, because I always looked, and they said, but I don't know, because I put it on cheap tickets.
And, cheap tickets is terrible.  It's a scam.
Ah.
And, one day, by change, someone said to me, I don't know the topic was I put in cheap flights and there, yes.  Really good, much better than, than
what's it called?  Than despegar, than Asatec, than any.
yes.  The only thing that she said there if you have to put it with, like, they update it.  Just recently there are some offers until the end of March, or March, but
still no, they didn't put up offers for April, for example.
And, also the things from the last minute.  No?  I don't know what they are.
yes, there it's, it's good to get it at the last minutes, because they have- Before, it was always that you had to look for the flight earlier.  But now it's like, it seems like the offers come more at the last minute.
yes, like when the airplane is left empty.
yes, when they see that, that they won't fill it, they put it on sale.
yes, yes, I think so.
So, well, the same-
And I went when it was the holidays.  When it was on vacation, I said, well, if there's something on sale for Spain, we'll go, we said.
Yes.  And- no?
And no, there wasn't anything.  It was really discounted for January.  It was after.  For the holidays there wasn't anything, it was really expensive.
Ah, sure.
Now in this time, going to Spain is crazy, two hundred dollars for a return.
yes, it's crazy.  And well, the Spaniards wen-
Hello.
Hello, good evening.
How is it going? I'm Manuel.
Fine, thanks. How are you? My name is George.
a pleasure.
Yes, And what do you think of today's topic?
Um, about the immigration, eh, no, I, mm, I don't know, I don't believe they reduce the salaries at all. Right?
Yes.
I don't believe that, they have anything to do with that.
Aha.
But, rather it would have to do with the poverty here in the United States. Right? That, they also take advantage to pay little, since, the people that need the money, will get it regardless.
Yes. Mm.
But, they don't exclusively depend on the immigrants.
Mm. Yes, yes.
There's
I think that here, the system, a form of double standard. Right?
Mm.
They go, go blaming the immigrants
Aha.
when, really, they want to have cheap labor.
Sure, right? If it's true.
sad, with the benefits of well, to have a right to a, personal and to legally established here, Right? Mhm.
If, well, no, because all the, I'm not very well informed, but I believe that they do all the work on the farm, mostly done by Mexicans. Right?
Yes, no, all the farm labor, and all the low, low, low level work, mhm.
Yes, well, right?
We say that how, well, they've been displaced from, the, the, the mid ranges
Aha
that they've been forced to, to begin to take some low level positions, right? that before they wouldn't have taken.
Yes, well.
Soon, well, because of the economic situation, well, the situations is changing a little bit.
A ha.
But, really, if you look at the majority, I think that seventy, eighty, ninety, ninety percent, well, of the hard labor, the tough work is done by immigrants, legal or illegal
well, more than anyone else illegals they have, working conditions, most times, sub human, right?
Sure, Yeah, because there's no, this, if they don't have papers, it's more difficult for them to reclaims their
Exactly.
The stability,
Mhm.
and, ay, this, mm, well, also the, the owner, or the, or whoever's in charge of hiring, they take advantage of that. Right?
MM. yes, well, I always, I always said that it's a double standard.
Mhm.
Because, the businessmen as well as the government, know very well, it's very easy bringing a illegal person.
Probably yes.
Then, they, the only thing they do, is, well, ah present before the public opinion. Eh different positions. And, that's what's happening right now with the Senate and the House of Representatives.
Ah Sure, I also don't understand why they build that wall if all the laborers are Mexicans.
Mm. Because,
I mean, they are not going to throw them out. Right?
because now, there are elections coming up,
Mm.
then, many politicians need, to start, pleasing the people that vote for them. Right?
Sure, then, probably for the wall, well,
Then, the
an act for the electoral propaganda. Right?
yes, they are always in favor of the immigrants, or against, the votes.
Mm. Sure, because there goes, a good sector that doesn't
Yes.
that don't, that more, more, is a little like, xenophobic, well right? Can't stand immigration,
Mm.
because
Yes
yes, because, I, mean, is the, the state has, like you say, a, a double standard.
Mhm. Yes because that's not, it's not hard, well, to determine, by means of an employer, to determine if someone is here legally or not when they hire them.
Mhm.
Sure, they can easily get to know that.
So, they do know, they do know, who is going to do those jobs
Yes, yes.
Some jobs have now been taken to other countries.
Aha.
Yes, for example, maquila to Mexico or Central America or to China but some jobs like in the farms they can't export those because the fields
Aha. They must keep those here, right?
the fields are here and they have to farm it, no?
Sure, sure, and no gringo wants to
No
well, some gringos do, some are farmers too, but not that many, well, no?
No, and they pay bad, they are farmers but, well, they are used to work with their,
In their own lands, maybe, no?
I think so, yes, and with modern equipment, they won't stand working that many hours, mm, well, under the sun and all of that, no?
Yes, well, sure, but this is for the, mm the illegal immigrants that are farmers and the pick crops, well, no?
Yes.
Oranges, tomatoes,
Yes.
and, they have to do it, well, with, with people with illegal people. Right?
Yes.
Because if not, nobody does it.
Mm. I tell you that I had the experience, I worked in a factory like five years ago, when I arrived here,
Aha.
and it was an egg processing factory.
Okay.
And, there were two lines, there was a line operated by pure immigrants,
Aha. Yes.
the majority were illegal,
Aha.
and another one operated by Americans.
Aha.
It turns out that, that's supervised by a person from the government. Every day, the machines have to be impeccable.
Ah, okay, the facility.
has to be, yes, the facility has to be, at six in the morning has to be completely clean.
Mm.
processing eggs,
Mm.
yes, if they find any egg thing, they wouldn't authorize that day,
Yes.
eh, turn on the plant, turn on that line.
Ah, I already understand.
And, not a week would go by in which the line of the Americans didn't have work for one or two days,
Aha.
because of the badly done work.
I understand okay.
Yes, And, and the, and the manager, would tell me, it's incredible, here the illegal people, because they are the people that work. The others don't work.
Aha.
And that's true, yes.
Mm. Yes, well, there isn't a big necessity.
And, I imagine it happens like that, because, well, definitely, the culture is different.
Sure, sure, yes, well. Any job if you've had one or worked anywhere, you realize that sometimes
Well, yes, mm.
eh, the Americans, are not too interested, in the small jobs.
No, and they, well, they take their time.
They get them to pass the time.
they talk a lot.
Mm.
um, they don't care about changing jobs. Mm? They change jobs as if nothing. Then,
Sure, sure, they, well, they can jump from one side to the other.  En exchange, the illegals, what they prefer is to keep a job if it's good,
if they like it, they prefer to wait there a while.  No?
sure, and they have to take care and be there.
To produce.  No?
The American, well, without a job, well, he'll go to look for help from the government.
yes, well, they pay you eighty perfect, I think, from what you're earning.  No?
Exactly, while an undocumented person, the immigrant person without papers, eh,
Yes, well.
who, has to work
Sure, has to work.
Has a job where we have responsibility, here responsibility in our countries.  When you come here, then, you, what you're worried about is work.
Work, and work.
Sure, because here, the immigrant finds work at the beginning, but badly paid, well.
Exactly, hmmm.
Sure, for, like, everything you do is a lot in your country but, but here, it doesn't cover much either.  But, this, well, I think that it's like you say.  No?  So, this,
it's all a dilemma.  No?  They say many things but in the end I don't know
Hmm.  Now, another situation, for example the, the poverty in the majority of the Latin American countries, have been provoked by this country.
ah, sure, No?
Hmm.  So,
Yes, well.
then, right now, this is like the consequence of what they have done over there.
Mm.
So, the people have had to immigrate because, What else can they do? there are no job sources,
Exactly, Right? Because that's why they come, because there's no work over there.
because there's no work.
Only, Right? It's not because, is not, that's the only reason. Is not that the country is bad, but rather that they are individually bad, unemployed, especially.
Yes.
And, that's the reason that propels them.
Now, this country has been a country of immigrants always.
Also, Right?
It makes me laugh the thirty forty year old people, fighting against the immigrants. If you look at the origins of any person,
Sure, all the whites from here, the whites from here are, well, Irish,
yes, yes, Europeans.
Germans, Europeans, Right?
Asians, from all over the world. Then,
Ah,
I don't know who,
but,
who isn't an immigrant here.
but they go over the Latins and the Chinese. But, not the blacks, because the blacks are already established here, so, Right?
yes, well, they really were immigrants because, really, initially, they brought them here as slaves.
Sure, hmm.
Yes.  They bought them because they wanted to.
Hmm.  They were forced.  No?
- Many were brought, and they, well, they established and continued their
Yes, well, because also, for example, eh, for a European immigrant, it's easier to get the papers, eh, it's simpler immigrations than for a Latino immigrant.
Hmm.
There's
But, why?
it's a bit, well, for him, it will be, well, for the racism, no?  still, in North American culture.
Yes, I don't know if it's, I don't know.
the obstacles to the
I don't know, really.  Hmm.
immigrants, well if they don't have papers to be able to be working well here.  No?  So they kind of have to take what comes.
But, like, it's not easy either to put the fault on the immigration for the decrease in salaries and all this, no?  since this responds to commercial strategies
well, no?  of, of administrative policy, that they take advantage of what they find.
Yes, really, really there are many businesses here that, that like, cheap costs, they take them, it's because
Hmm.
they have workers, badly paid, and badly paid.
Yes, well.
The people who come to look for work from other countries.
It's like this.  No?  What was, what was the last?  I can't remember well either.
I think that the, the qualified workers, or something like that.
Aha.
I don't know, let's see, I, for example, I'm in a very special situation, when I came here three, four years ago,
Aha.
with the development of the internet, and the rise that it had, all the companies were asking for authorization
Hmm.
to.  Yes, to bring
To bring people who worked in, computers, No?
Exactly.  And that year, no, there was the great collapse.
Aha.
Including, they complained that, just more than one hundred thousand, something like that, and no, this quota didn't fill.  People didn't,
definitely the fall of the internet, many businesses fell, and no, people.
Yes.  Aha.
And now, so that they are bringing many, people are bringing many from India to work in, in systems, in
Hmm.
now they're hiring, over there.
Yeah, yeah.
And there are many, many business that are taking everything to India, above all, support.
Aha yes, this happens, No?  many people from India, it's
Aha.
in, experts in informatics systems, no?
For example, support for, support for, I think that there are some accountability programs.  So, calls for support,
Inge
hello my name is Miriam
hello Miriam, how are you?
fine, what is your name pardon?
Inge
Inge
yes
oh right, and where do you call from miss?
I am calling from Washington
aha, I see, and tell me, is there much immigration in Washington?
there is quite a lot, yes, quite a lot
eh, yes
and where are you calling from?
I am in Toronto, Canada
oh, in Canada
yes
there the immigration situation is different
eh, no, no, there are also quite a lot of immigrants, quite a lot, but I guess the United States are more saturated, because even the people from here moves there because the sallaries are better
it looks like
The sallary is better than in Canada
In some places maybe, in some sectors
uh huh, yeah there's a lot of people here from El Salvador, people from, not so many mexicans, but a lot from El Salvador, where are you from?
Oh, I'm from Peru
Oh
From Lima, Peru, and you?
You've been living in Canada for a long time
Yes, ten years
Oh, quite some time
Yeah, yea, and you, you're, you seem young to me
Yeah, not too young but yeah, you can talk to me informally
Oh, i see, right
Um, i, how long have i been here, is that what you're asking?
Uh huh
Four years
Oh, and, where are you from?
From Santiago de Chile
oh, Santiago de Chile, that's good
Yes,
I didn't recognize you accent, because i know many Chileans that have a different accent, a little bit, like you got
Yeah
But i didn't get any accent from you, that's why it was a little bit hard, maybe the province, i don't know
Maybe, yeah, they speak different in different parts of Chile
Yeah, yeah, and tell me, and, so, what do you think about immigration, do you think it's saturated and that they shouldn't take anymore?, or that they should take everyone?
No, well, they're two extremes, isn't it?, not to accept any more and accepting them all, like two extremes
Right
maybe i think that they should regulate immigration a little bit more, lets say
yes
well, i think it's regulated, they're probably the illegal people the ones who have more problems
And that's very true
illegal, i think so, yeah, well
there's plenty of illegal people
like, right?, they don't say they're illegal, but i imagine that's it
yes, because i have seen on tv, uh, i have also met people here that come here from the United States but then they don't like any thing here
Um, oh, why?
Because Canada, first of all, i mean people that comes from different Latin countries to Canada and goes to the United States, they like Canada, and people that go to the United States first and then come to Canada, they don't like Canada, they think the country where you got to
first, you liked it there and you, you got used to the people and like
Uh huh, sure
They go back right?, anyway, yeah, i have heard about a lot of people that go back because in Canada, for example, they speak English a lot
Uh huh
and i don't know id they don't in Washington, i don't know, it seems there are more latinos, where people can work without trouble
Without speaking the language you say
speak the language yes
ah yes, yes, yes sure
you see, however here in Canada is very indispensable to know English
okay
although it's becoming really, for example you find Latins everywhere.
mm
you will find it everywhere and there they give you a hand translating, but it's always necessary to speak the language, eh, and also that they pay is really low
mm
and that I don't know the cost of life here is high and you can't find work you can't find work because
ah, there aren't a lot of jobs.
no, there aren't because there's even employment agencies that pay cash they pay little they exploit them a lot, but there aren't many.
mm sure
and then the government put as a restriction that the same employment agencies ask for the social insurance number right, then
mm
many might be that I don't know that fabricate it, or I don't know, but but
and mm
but it's hard, it's a little hard finding cash jobs here in Canada
mm and what do you think, Do you think they should, allow more immigrants or make it easier for the immigrants or qualified people
well what can I tell you, Canada is a country different from the United States, Canada has a lot of land
sure
what happens is that they all gather here in Toronto, because there's work and but yes investors are needed here, because there's plenty of land that
that needs to be exploited, but the people don't go over there, see
mm Well is also very cold there.
also because of the cold, and also because but, I mean if the government, or the people invested for example in other cities and would build the traffic, eh
mm
the traffic, because the traffic annoys a lot, that's why the people want to stay in Toronto because, they find the buses and the train fast see
sure
but if one goes out of here is hard, with a winter, I tell you that is horrible
sure, I can imagine
because waiting there in those stops with that cold you know, that's horrible,
sure well that's why they don't have that many immigrants either
already in Canada there's a lot, look but I think that the problem of the United States is much bigger
mm
It's already much bigger
yes, yes I think that too.
I knew an Argentinian lady okay she had spent like more than ten years living I don't remember where, but it was in the United States, without any problems
mm
without papers without the need to speak English, or nothing, however when she came to Canada she felt very inhibited, because she couldn't speak English she needed favors from people
and she couldn't find work, they left, they left
sure
and then I men a Colombian woman, same with the thing that she didn't like Canada, yeah
yes here
You have never been here, come one day to see.
here there are it's practically, there's everything, restaurants, there are television channels in Spanish.
yes, yes yes from here we se over there
radio stations mhm
because almost many channels that we watch are from there
mhm
can you believe it, I mean the production of Canada is more, more
sure
yeah
sure
It's a nice country, developed, but I think that not the, the more of
maybe life is very difficult there
it's, it's a bit difficult and the more of, it's more more conglomerated it's the United States.
mhm
it has diversity in many things
here yes, there's a lot of people so for example immigrants generally work in mowing lawns in the summer, to do everything that
aha
Eh patios, eh, gardens
and and so you think that one of the questions was, Do you think that they deserve the salary of a resident and why?
no, no I think not
Or they bring new energy.  Alejandro Hold on Alejandro stop
yes
Look you're going to fall, sorry
it's OK
It was my son who was climbing on the window, yeah, so you think that they damage or they bring new energy?
yes ah, well I think that I don't know, in reality, I wouldn't know how to answer that question.
hmm
Because I think that on the one had they benefit from being able to perhaps have a salary that lets them live, I think in comparison with, with their situation in their original country.
yes
and, but on the other hand it doesn't have a lot of benefits, well, they're workers but they don't have benefits or
it's sad, yeah
or health, or any of this, so I don't know perhaps it's worth it for them to come and live here, and if the government lets them come legally and this
perhaps they will have a lot for free and there won't be enough work for them, I don't know.
also because there will be a lot, who don't want to see everyone, sees the United States as half.
yes, they all think that
or Canada also sees it as
life is easy there, or they can make a lot of money.
Yeah, look, professionals come here, professionals, but the English barrier is very strong, because i don't know if in the United States
uh huh
is like that, but in Canada, the English barrier is very strong
Sure, uh huh
They demand a lot more,
Right?, i think that, well i imagine it depends on the area, right?, since here there is a lot of, a lot of immigrants
that too, that too, yeah
The people that, the people that's from here, the residents are much more sensitive, so they're not so closed with their accent and their words and they have a lot of interest in learning Spanish
Oh, that's good, that's good, but like i told you, I've met many professionals here that, they don't get, they don't get with their papers and they can't find a job, they can't perform in their area
Right
that's, it's very sad
Well, i think that if you talk here, in a professional level i think you'd have the same problem
to the United States
there's people that don't, that don't speak English, there's people that does work, like manpower, like i said, fixing gardens and don't need to communicate
Right, right
Or take out the snow during the winter
Right
That sort of, construction, that don't need
But construction pays well
Well, they pay it, yeah, they pay them well, they pay them well, i think so
yeah, here in Canada many people look for jobs in the construction business because you can make money, it´s hard but you get money, you see the money
hmm
but if you go to a factory or something like that, well, you get
sure
a lot of sacrifices, giving all up
sure
giving many things up to save money
yes, yes
rents are very expensive, too expensive, they´re
hmm, yes, here in this area is a little expensive, but
and
there are sectors of, just immigrants, latinos, and they all speak Spanish and then
yes
it´s different, it´s like having a country inside another, sometimes
yes, really, wow, how interesting
yes, but there are people who don´t like it, of course
oh, well, here it´s not like that, everything is mixed
hmm
I wouldn´t say there are sectors, people do tend to look for each other, right, and there are some areas where you see more of them
but it´s not exclusive, there are other people with them, but it´s like they
mhm
they look for them that way, they try to live close to each other.
sure
for example, Polish people they also try to because they are white, and they are so racist, the, the Europeans talk to a lot of people but they just talk, they don't actually accept them.
sure
they are just polite
mhm
so, they, I've heard that, they live away from Toronto in a city
oh I see
I've heard that they look for people like that, yes, yes, that's true.
yes
oh, I see, mhm
Hello?

You see
Interesting, interesting, it's really good
Uh, and have you been in the United States for long?
And, i just, i got here a week ago, ten days
Ah, newly arrived. Eh, I've been here five years
You, five years?
yes.
Whoops
What do you think of immigration?
and how life is here?
What do you think of immigration? Let's touch on today's topic.
Ah, the topic, no, that it concerns us.
And it concerns us, exactly
That topic concerns us, us, of immigration here, in the United States. And, it's complicated. It's complicated. There's a lot of people. A lot of immigration. Especially
But, do you think immigration is good?
from Mexico.
But do you think that it's good? Is immigration positive for the country?
Immigration?
yes.
And, and ah, and yes, let's say, that it is, is too excessive, I think the immigration, to the country. What do you think?
No, but, I think that it's good, that it's something natural
yeah yes, it has
if, if from the other side of the border, the people don't have work and on this side there's work, what are they going to do.
sure.
He comes.
yes, has, has its things. What happens is that
Also, eh, the Latin people are the only ones that work, because eh, you see it, clearly. You go to any restaurant, and the ones that are in the kitchen, working, washing dishes, are
Are all Latins.
and are, yes.
yes, that's true. yes
Or, or Chinese, all have big.
Immigration is good. What happens is that
There's, there's
eh, there's a little bit of regulation missing,
No, same, same in the, same in the university. Same in the university. All the post-grades and all the, doctorate students the majority are foreigners.
Sure.
I mean, I think that is something that's good.
Sure, but there's certain immigration that perhaps eh, is not, is not too regulated, by the state and many people,
Sure, the state can
work in conditions more or less, labor
because they come
semi slave.
Sure, because they come illegally. Then,
How, how?
this is not regulated by the state because it's in a way, illegal.
Sure, yes.
Or to establish a more permissive immigration law, so this matter can be better regulated.
yes, that, that's so right. But
yes but instead of establishing, instead of establishing permissive laws, they build a wall, and that and that only makes it
Sure. Hello, hello.
Hello, yes, yes, hell. Can you hear me?
yes.  no, I didn't hear that last part.
Oh, well, no, I didn't really say anything.
Oh, the last part of what you said, I didn't
But, no, the reality is that with, those policies, the only, the only thing they are trying to do is
And what do you think that, those policies have?
to stop immigration, yes, there's something about it, I believe that the policies are meant to
Xenophobia?
No, it's a policy, I mean, in order for the government to be popular, I mean, so that people who are middle class, or the working class
they are upset about immigration because it takes jobs from them, many jobs, I mean, most people hire illegal workers because they are cheaper.
yes.
And, that's why they take jobs away from the, the local people.
Sure, that's right.
So, they set up policies or build walls so that, I mean they built walls, to, to make it look like, to show that it is visible that they are working on it.
About the wall, yes, is very exaggerated, I think.
that to build a wall, sure And sure, but it's something that, I mean, the people that cross a river, and cross a desert how are you going to build them a wall.
Sure
I mean, I think that the matter is, is another.
yes, besides the wall is the same, they win
No, but yes, yes
they'll cross in some way, let's say, is kind of
the way of, of, of, stopping immigration is eh, developing, or, or investing money in
I can't hear you, I can't hear you very well. Developing, a little
in other countries. And developing the other countries, especially all in Latin America
Hm mm
giving money to Latin America. The people I mean, the people won't come to the United States if their country has money.
Sure
So, I don't know, what do I know.
And yes, is a, is a deeper problem of the, of the countries that will immigrate here, so to speak.
And sure, yes.
Eh. let's say that the United States, well, finds the easy solution, let's say that nobody crosses. But, but the truth is that, is very, the wall, is kind of
is bad, I think. And yes, besides, is, is, is, is very messed up, because many cross, and then they hunt them as, as if they were animals,with trucks
and they return them. I don't know, everything is very, very bad.
yes, yes.
What?
yes yes yes yes, that you do need to know.
yes. The truth, the truth yes, so. And, and life here in Philadelphia?
No, living in Philadelphia is fine, yes, yes.
It's good?
yes. Eh, we miss Buenos Aires, but well.
yes? From one to ten? What do you give it?
Em
if, if you have to give it a score?
I don't know, I don't know what
What?
I don't know, no idea.
You wouldn't put it.
No
Okay, okay
I don't give it a score. No, but it's good, you live good. It's fun, there's a big group of people,
A lot of friends?
yes yes, all the people from the university, Europeans, and eh Spanish, Italians, South Americans, honestly, it's very good.
There's, there's a nice group.
yes,yes,yes.
Also. You whi-, you fi- five years no, since you've been. Four, or five?
yes, yes, and five, it's the last day.
Aha, that's, that's good, that's good. And yes, I am also leaving not in
yes
now in two months. I'm, Ik'm going back there.
Hm mm Ah very good. And what will you do there?
yes very short period. No, and I arrive, and I start with, with studies. I start, I get going I will start in the middle, at the end of
yes
of March, with the facu, yes I, I still a, one more stretch yet.
yes
A long stretch to finish.
yes yes
yes. SO little by little no.
yes yes yes
T- step by step
That's good, no, it's good. And do you think about returning, would you like to return or
Return here?
yes.
yes, bec- if working conditions are very good.
That's good. Do you like the work you do?
I mean, my job?
yes
My job is good. Lab-
What do you do?
I'm learning, about culture
What are you doing?
Cell culture, basic experiments, with gels, PCR, things like that.
That's nice
that's nice, my boss, my boss is a pain in the ass but, but, oh well, you can't have everything.
Oh yes, it always happens, problems with bosses
He's a pain, pain in the ass,
there are problems, yes, yes
pain in the ass, but, no, the truth is that, my job
Well, what, what happens is, that
the work makes up for it.
what happens is that in my house, the students, oh, graduates that are here are quite lazy.
The undergraduates, they are lazy?
Yes, yes, they don't want to work
No, who, they don't want to what?
to work as hard as I used to in the past, they don't want to work like we used to work.
And yes, they're ha-
When, when I was a student and worked in Argentina, I worked without resources, and I worked many hours and
Sure.  Worked full and here
and I didn't complain much.  Sure.
here they're more
There's almost
and sure, they have it, because they're served on a tray here, so
Sure, they complain a lot, a lot.
they complain a lot.
yes.
And yes, yes, this is true.  It's true.  But here it's good.  The truth is that there's a lot of resources, a lot of labor
yes, yes.  Hmm
wow and there aren't many who, apart, this orientation, let's say.  from science.  People who live here, let's say,
yes.  yes yes
Or no?  They're nothing like outside, no, the way they suck.
yes, yes.  In general, people who are doing a doctorate who put themselves in a foreign state
All foreigners?
Yes, according to the discipline.  But for example, bio engineering, or, or computing, or things like this, are ninety percent foreigners.
Engineering and computing?
yes, it's what the, the people
Oh, I can't hear you
I mean, Americans instead of going to graduate school, to study for four years and earn fifteen hundred dollars per month
yes
they go to work at a company and earn four thousand.
And it all goes to the
Sure, oh well
in the economic area.
sure, yes, or the, private companies, the development, whatever it is.
Sure.
They think differently
And more in science and yes sure, it's more
And yes
don't pay much, that's why
yes
It's like, like in coso.
Well, the same,
Like in Buenos, like in Argentina.
no, it's even worse in Argentina.
It's, it's pretty bad, how's in Argentina? Also,
It's pretty bad in Argentina, yes
Yeah, it's fucked up, it's fucked up
Yeah, it's not
I don't know if before, when uh, when you were there, it was more, a little, worse or better, i don't know, i don't know if it's bet- you have gone back
And, and, and what do you do in Argentina, besides studying, what else do you do?
Huh?, what do i do?
In Arg-. yes
Um, no, ba- basically it consumes a lot of time, and after that, no, there were some activities, i don't know, i go swimming

Silvia
Hello?
Hello, how are you?
yes, very good. And you, how are you?
Very good. My name is Silvia. Have we talked in the past?
Pardon?
We talked two weeks ago, right?
No, no
Okay. What's your name?
And I already remember. Chris.
What?
Chris, Chris. Christopher.
yes, oh yes. Christopher. Eh, I don't know this topic too well, of immigration, they say, right?
yes, the immigrations.
Okay. I don't know anything about that.
Sorry, Where are you from?
What?
Where are you from?
Oh, from Chicago.
From Chicago
Uh-huh.  I'm Mexican and I grew up in Ladedo, Texas
Hmm.
And right now I'm working in Arkansas.
Oh.
And I travel a lot with this job.  And, this.
yes, and what do you do?
Oh, insurance people?
Ah.
And I explain the benefits to employees in big companies.  And in particular, now, I'm talking pure Spanish with the employees of
A company that distributes chicken.
Hmm.
And I will go to Washington and from there to Virginia. But.
Hmm.  yes, a lot
Yeah.  yes, it's a lot of travel but I love it because I meet many people at the moment and I chat with them and we're always about thirty employees.  And we all stay in the same hotel.
Hmm.
But, yes, I don't know anything about this immigration.
Hmm.
At least what's in the news
Hmm.
But they say that we can talk about other topics, no?
Course so, I think so.  The last time I talked with another person on another topic.
Uh-huh.  Yeah for
We didn't talk about the topic of the day at all.
But, yes, eh for me the immigrations are, yes I support them.  Well in opinion, it's what we owe to the Americas.
Here in America they have, eh.  This idea that anyone can come, no?
yes.
But, there's also abuse when the person has to die to be able to pass, yes.  Sacrifice so much.  He can.  At least help to make it easier.
A process to help them, no?
yes, it's good.
Because, in the events, because I grew up in Ladedo, Texas.  And they told me that there the tourism business is finished, it doesn't exist anymore
And it's
yes, well.
Simply because there is so much crime due to poverty, I don't know if it's the drugs or
yes, yes.
Any reason but No, yeah.  Where there's a big market in the streets, there's nothing.
yes.  Above all.
And for me, this has to do with the police who don't have control.
This yes.
Or the government.  But.  When I get these calls, I don't know when, more or less, what hours they call me. It could be any
Uh-huh.
Moment in day And here he found me. Searching for a key for my hotel. I will find it now.
yes
But, where where are you from?
Me too. I'm speaking, I'm from Houston. Texas.
Oh, in Houston. There I have a brother that works for Federal Express.
Where?
And, but, he lives in Caiti, Texas.
Ah, yes, yes.
Uh uh. But he works for Federal Express.
Uh uh. Mm
And He's already been seventeen years with that little job. We're always asking him to come and visit and he doesn't want to, he says that
Ah.
They give him very little free time
Mm.
Although he does have vacations
yes.
I have to make a trip over there, to meet the wife. And they have already been married for five years and I don't know them.
Sure.
But No, uh, but yes he's Mexican, no?
yes, yes.
Uh uh
Mexico
From Mexico. I see. I don't know much of Mexico, only the areas we have been to on vacation, on the Cruises, which by the way were only Cancun and Coserle
Mm, yes
And when grandma took us to the 'partillas' when we were little. And we were a queue of kids, four kids. With just 'tortillas', but by that time
Mm
right? there was much more free time. You don't have to, our grandma advised us not to talk to people
strangers, right?
Right, absolutely. But. No. I'm getting a call, one moment, don't hung up. They are just, I don't think so, they are just costumers. But these calls, I have only received
yes
seven or eight calls
Mm
And when I first started getting calls, I forgot the PIN, then  I got like thirty calls
Wow. I have, how long?
because, because I didn't go back home, I was in these assignments
yes
I didn't know where to look in the house. Then I finally remembered where the number was. But I forgot how they pay, I haven't got any check yet
and you?
No, they pay January about March
Oh, until March
Hmm.  Once when the study ends, it depends on how many calls you've made.
Oh, yes.  If I've forgotten.
And, they send it to everyone.  They send it to everyone now.
Oh.
I think that until March, but it's not immediate.
But, it's not regular that so, I forgot how they paid.  It was from twenty
yes.
five calls but above it was two hundred dollars, no?
yes.
Uh-huh.  Hopefully it will come to us.
And the and five times calls, and eh, five different telephones.  They give you fifty dollars.
Uh.
Extra.
Oh.  Are there different telephones?
Uh-huh.
telephones?
Well, well it can be a cell phone.  Of a friend, your cell phone.  At the house, five different, different numbers.
Oh, well yes just to only test a telephone.
yes, me too.  But, how many calls to you have?
It seems that with this conversation maybe eight
Ah, well. Well, no. Don't worry. I barely have three with this one
Oh, yes. I've know, I've talked, with people that already have thirty, forty, around there.
Uh uh.
Uh uh.
yes.
Eh, I talked with a Lady named Olga. In, where did she say she lived? Ah, I think it was Detroit.
Oh,
Or no, that lives in Canada. Another one from Houston. That's why, it seems I recognized the voice. It was a young man. A man from Uruguay. Another from
Ah. Ah, I forgot. But of South American nationality.
Argentina?
Yeah I spoke with a man from Argentina. And with a man from Colombia.
Mm.
But. A Puerto Rican girl, the call got disconnected my phone wasn't charged.
Mm
And I didn't know how to get in touch with her.
Oh, I think that
Yes
No I think is like an automated system. right?
Uh uh
It connects you and disconnects you, so.
Okay.
You lose the contact, the communication.
And, what other type of study do you do in Spanish? Is it the only one?
Is the only one that I'm doing. yes.
I used to participate in many in English here in Chicago.
yes.
And they've paid me up to two hundred fifty for forty minutes of doing a study on new foods For example, KFC wanted to introduce
change the recipe of its ah the coleslaw
MM.
And they had us tasting and taste and taste the recipe, the differences. And they gave us a sheet of questions and to write what it was you
yes.
noticed if it was wet, that if it was dry.
Mm.
that if it's hot, if it's spicy, Uh uh. Also, when they introduced ah. The Baskin Robbins that they added, who knows what, the custard or
Mm.
Something different But it has a lot of criteria. You have to make a certain amount of money.
Mm.
But, that's what I like about Chicago. One can go during work hours or dinner time and you finish in plain day
Mm. Ah, how nice.
Yep. I think I'm going to go down to find another key because yes I lost it. yes here it is Is strictly in Spanish. There's thirty of us
I don't have a big family. If I have it, I don't recognise him. My whole family is in Texas.
Mm. Mm.
Yeah
Mm.
No Some cartridges, yeah. Look there are the bosses as well. OK, thank you Ma'am. Oh, great. So I'll share. OK, Sorry.
Oh, don't worry.
yes, um.
And how is the weather right now in Chicago, Is it snowing, is it hot?
Oh, snowing we have we're expecting four inches this year yeah
Mm.
Um, it was it is more or less good this year. We had it good. For example, we were in the fifties some weeks ago, that. I don't know if it broke the record or not but
You've been doing OK
Mm.
Because, for example right now To get, being in front of the Field Tower
Mm.
Almost One has to be on his side to be able to walk.
Mm.
And, yeah. That's why I come to the South here for this assignments. Ah, but sometimes we We have to go to the South. For example, right now
Mm.
They sent me to Arkansas However, they have the central offices in the North And from there they put you to work. I said, OK I didn't count on that.
Then, that's why I'm leaving, tomorrow I have to go to Washington
Mm.
But
You already finished a lot?
What do you make a living of?
Pardon?
What do you do for work?
Ah, I
Uh uh
I don't work. I study.
No, oh, you study, that's very good. And what are you studying?
I study at the university.
is not
Well, I'm studying economics.
Thank you for the card. Tonight, room, room. Uh, two sixteen. Yes. I left it inside. I'm sorry.
Well, no, no.
yes eh I'm going to start studying at school to be a real estate investor right?
Good evening, my name's Marco and I'm in Philadelphia, and you?
good evening, my name is Vilma and I'm in Maryland, how are you?
ah hello Vilma eh, no, eh, sorry, I was trying to adjust my ear piece when they were saying the question, did it have something to do with relationships, eh, on the internet and that?
in the, exactly
meeting people I remember when I was jo- younger, let's say eh
in the good years
because besides I, sure, because of course I'm still young, still
at heart, right?
eh, sure, I remember that they said that love from afar, eh, love of fools
well the same in my country
the- s, sorry?
yes, I think that there's the same saying in my country, where are you from?
ah, yes?  eh, I grew up in Paraguay
ah, okay, I'm from Bolivia, Bolivia
and you?  ah close, very close, very close
yes, neighbors
yes, nice, my father has ah, eh, he has an estate in Charco Paraguayo, approximately sixty
oh
kilometers from the border of Bolivia
ah how nice
oh but, as we used to say
well, regarding relationships, for example I think that when we were growing up, we didn't have this Internet thing
no
and well, I've had the chance to, to meet one of my partners in
mm
to fall in love through the phone, well, that was in the past
yes yes, you know, you still, you know, I also remember when, oh, hours and hours here in the United States, at least there's the unlimited oh
calling, local calling, it's something that we didn't have before
exactly, yes, well, the bills were for the parents, they'd pay any amount, right?
exactly, that's something that my dad is always going to remember, each of my girlfriends, no no, not each one of them, my my one girlfriend that I had
I see
mm he's always going to remember that because the telephone bills that he'd get
mm but do you think that, that, do you think that this new invention, the Internet, do you think
oh
it'll be useful to get to fall in love over the Internet, with someone that you don't know where they come from, because there's so many lying that you might not be aware of, because you don't even know how their voices sound like
yes no, exactly and of course, there's always the, the, you are not too sure if the person you are talking to is really who they say they are
exactly
or if, if he's, if it's not a she or if she is not a him, oh
mm
those things, I remember, oh, one of my friends, well she was not my, she was not my girlfriend but for all practical reasons we were dating
I see
except that I never kissed her
mm
I keep hitting my head for not having done that, but, memories, memories
I see
we met on the phone, through, she knew a person I knew and for some reason, I can't remember what it was, I think she was about to do a
a tele-, telethon and needed somebody to
mm
eh, sponsor her, so she called me by chance, eh, to ask me if I could sponsor her in that
I see
and we talked for years, eh, no, no, it was not just one call of course, but we talked for years and got to know each other
and
I think it was months until we met in person
I see, I think that romances before, were a little more romantic also, because now
yes my darling
they want to go too fast
right, if it is in the Internet they want to see naked pictures
mm
if it is in person, it seems that, I am out of the market since some years, but it seems that its is like 'let's go out tonight'
if nothing happens tonight, well, maybe tomorrow, like this, very mm very fast it mus tbe
yes, it's, it's very rushed, I believe that all that romanticism that we had in past years, it doesn't matter in which country because I believe that here in the United States it was like that too.
no yes
people used to be more romantic, they would go slow and now it's like in the first or second dates they are having sex and then it's over.
yes, exactly, exactly, they do it on the first date
mm
oh, they try but I also think that's a reflection of, oh, one in every two marriages, oh, ends up in divorce in the United States
yes, mm
that's an overwhelming number, o, it's quite scary, oh
yes, of course, in my case, I'm not aware of the percentage of the couples that get to marry and then start to fall in love through the Internet, no, I don't have a number or the percentages
mm, no, but, what I do, the way in which I count them is through the number of people that I know, that have met through the Internet,
oh, no, I haven't met anyone, I don't know anyone that has
oh, I have, I, I not me, I, yes
well yes, I'm lying, oh, one of my coworkers has a daughter and she loves to go out with that kind of people, from the Internet, what do I know
aha, aha
but, every time that he goes out on a date with someone from the Internet, they go out and it's a fraud, they get nowhere and as I was saying on their first dates, these people want to have sex
yes and, oh, lets say, they don't really get to know each other through the Internet, you don't get to meet their friends or their families
exactly, that's another disadvantage, mm
so, it's completely anonymous
yes, totally
in, in that respect, we, lets say, we are going to, oh, in Paraguay they'd go celebrate, I never understood why they'd use this word, celebrate, but they'd use it to say that two people were going out together
oh
eh, when they went out together, well, when someone goes out, let's say if you and I go out my first question, eh, like, eh, yes, on the phone, starts a-
that, what are you wearing, eh
hmm,
eh, it's hot down here, eh, so, they're starting, wait, wait a moment, because we're talking about, what do people talk about normally?  eh
now in these, di-
it seems like the art of conversation has been lost
totally because, ah, like I said, like I keep saying, there's no romance for beginning to get to know a person
yes
I think that maybe people are turning more, more frivolous or more materialistic because the first, now they ask if you have a car
well, we- well, especially in this country you have to have a car
yes, yes
but in our times there wasn't, at least, well, in our countries, no?  the, the boy, the young kid went how he could to her house and
yes,
and they got together, like I think it's all changing now, and it's a shame because, well, I have young daughters but I don't see
that my daughters are living what I lived
no, don't forget too that, at least, for example, here, eh, here in the United States, something that I've always, that I realized is that
eh, eh the Yankees do each stupid thing
hmm
but, and when I was in Paraguay and they came the, eh, and were there, I always was in, I went to an American school in Asuncion
okay
eh, I, I always met many people from the embassy, people of eh, American people, eh, I simply met
mm
but one thing that, one thing yes, yes, it can be said that, sometimes the American does such stupid things or is, they have in a certain way from the practical side
the American is quite ignorant, there are many Americans that you give them a screwdriver and they don't even know what side to grab really, but one thing that I remember, I would defend
yes
yes, is true, there are a lot of practical things that they don't know, but, one thing yes, the American works
mm
the American works more than any other worker from another part of the world in number of hours and in, in, practically in amount of work
but perhaps that is another thing that jeopardizes a couple because they are so bottled up in their work, the work absorbs so much
yes no, that's why, that's why I say, that's why I say, eh, you don't have, one doesn't have the time
mm there's no balance
yes, there's no, exactly, there's no balance, I'm I'm, eh, engaged, ah, to be married with my girlfriend, eh who is here
she has a five year old son
and is she American?
she's American, eh, is funny, her name is Hernandez but she doesn't speak Spanish but she is American eh, she got married, basically she got pregnant, and what does a Catholic person do when she gets pregnant? she gets married
mm, mm
then, she got married before of eh, and immediately
she got married before falling in love
she got married, is hard saying it, she got married with her boyfriend of many years
ah, good, hmm
eh, but it's a boyfriend who ma- who many years in a way of being a boyfriend, they broke up, he was the boyfriend again, they broke up again, eh, it's eh
several times, but what ended up happening is that she got pregnant, they got married quickly and, ah, the creature was born, eh, and had his name
hmm
eh, and before the kid was one year old, eh, she kicked him out of the house
oh, wow
eh, I, basically, I knew here before this and we eh, had lost contact for some years
yeah
and well, we started seeing each other when the kid was a few months old
hmm
and she- and when, after having the kid she was starting to be able to leave him at night
yeah
I've s- seen how at the beginning you need to still be really attached but when he started to get a bit older
hmm
eh, some months, eh, one to four, five months, something, and yeah
Hi, my name is Martin.  I'm talking from Philadelphia.
Ah, my name is Blanca, um, bi-
Where are you talking from?  Where are you talking from?
From Phoenix, Arizona
Ah, look at that.  Em,
And you?
well, I don't know, Do you want to talk about the today's topic?
Yes.
Yes?
I don't know.
Where are you from originally?
I'm Colombian.
Ah,
I'm from Colombia.
Have you been here long?
For five years.
Ah, quite a long time.
Quite a long time, yeah.
Yes.
Where are you from, Argentina?
Yes, I'm from Argentina.  Eh, yes, four and a half years ago, more or less, that I'm here.
Ah, we go at the same time.
Yes.
Hmm.  And where do you live, sorry?
What what are you?  Philadelphia.
Ah, in Philadelphia, aha.
Yes.  Em.  And where you there in Phoenix the whole time, or?
In Philadelp- No, I've only lived here in Phoenix for six months.  And, eh, initially I lived in Massachusetts.
Ah, close to Boston, no?
Yes, there in Boston, in Boston.
Ah.  Ah, look at that.
We lived in, we lived in Boston.
Ah.  A really pretty city, but it's a bit cold.
Yeah, this is why we came here, from one extreme to another.  No?
Ah, it's Sure, sure.
No s-
But, the same, the weather in Phoenix must be incredible, No?
Ah, yes.  Now it's an incredible climate.  Eh, it's three very cruel months, well, with the climate the, the heat.  But the rest of the time is really beautiful, really great.
Ah, Is it too hot in summer?
Yes, too hot.
Oh
Too much
Of course, because, uh, they always, they always portrait it as a place with nice weather, that never rains, sure, but in the summer it must be very hot
Yeah, but during the summer, it goes up to about a hundred and fifteen, more or less, the temperature
Oh, well, yeah, that's a lot, that's like forty five degrees, right?, Celsius
Yeah, more or less, yeah, it's a lot
It's a whole lot yes
It's a lot
And is it at least fresh at night?
Yeah, at night it's fresh, but during the summer not even the night is fresh
Right
Not even a little
Right
It's pretty hot
And, well, but it's ok. But, instead of snow, you have to put up with snow now
Oh, but it's, uh, i prefer to put up with this summer for three months
Yes
Than that winter for six months, you're locked up in a house without being able to go out
Sure
Because it's more, it's easier to, uh, bear the heat than that horrible cold
sure, sure, sure.
It's very horrible, is very horr-
Yes, no, here is not so, the winter is not so terrible, it's a little bit better than in Boston. It last less, at least, it's three months. It's cold but,
Ah, no, It's so terribly cold in Boston.
but in Boston the spring and autumn are like short.
They are very cold. Is that it starts snowing, sometimes, since October.
And, they are short. Sure.
Then, you don't have like a lot of time to, to
Sure.
of good
Sure.
climate. And, when there's good sun, there's a  humidity that's unbearable.
Sure. Sure
An unbearable humidity
Yes, it's true. Um. And what, what do you do, work, study?
No, no, I'm a housewife.
Ah.
No, no, No, here I don't do, at this moment, I don't do anything.
Ah, okay.
Ah, in Colombia I, studied librarianship, I'm a librarian.
Ah.
But, here I don't do anything.
Ah, how interesting.
Here I'm dedicated to the home and the kids.
Sure
A-
That's good.
To the maternal state, I'm dedic- Yes,
That's very good. Eh, How many kids do you have?
I have two babies, I have a one year old girl, and a three year old boy.
Ah, how cute.
They are very little, they barely walk
Yes.
starting life.
Sure. And is the older one starting preschool already?
What?
Is the older one starting to go to preschool, or to the daycare, or does he stay home still?
He's still here in the house. Ah, we already registered him, this year already he starts to go to preschool.
Ah.
Mm.
Sure.
Already this year he's going to go to study.
Sure, Sure.
Because, is already time. Is already time.
Yes.
Eh, eh, do you also have kids, or are you married?
I'm, yes, I'm married, but, no, I don't have kids yet.
Ah. Not yet? Ah.
No, we are thinking of having in the near future. But, eh, in like one or two years.
Yes. Ah, yes.
Yes.
Well, that's good.
We want to start trying, so to speak.
Yes, is already, is
Eh, but, no we do want to have kids badly, at least a couple.
Yes, is, is nice, is, is a, a beautiful experience.
We'll see later. Yes.
I took a long time to have my kids, a long time.
Yes.
because I had them when I was already older. But, eh, I've enjoyed them so, so much, is that they are, I don't know, maybe it's because I had them already, already older and all. Then, okay, okay
I had enjoyed, I had lived, had, well, I had passed a, I had leapfrogged.
Sure.
Then, that suddenly, has helped me a lot to enjoy my kids.
Ah, how nice. No, yes, yes. We see, our friends who also, who had them, had them older. She, she is young, but he is a little older, he's forty and forty two something like that,
she, she is, eh
mm
thirty one, thirty two, only, young. But, and we see them that they enjoy them so much, they have, had twins, and are very fun, is very entertaining.
Ah, me the, my baby, the, the boy, I had him when I was thirty four years old.
Yes, That's good. Ah, is also young.
Yes. MM
Yes.
No, no, Young, also. Yes, almost forty
But, now, now, now everybody has their kids at that age. Before, before they had them in their twenties, later in their late twenties, and now, people are having them in their thirties.
Mm.
Is very common.
Yes, that's true, that's true.
Eh, And, on the other hand, one can take advantage of the best of both things. Right? A little, be independent, and later enjoy the kids, also, at an age when one is still young,. I mean,
Aha. Yes. Is the best. Because, if you have them, I've always thought that if you have them too young,
yes.
ah, you are not going to have time to study, to do things that, suddenly, you want to do. Right?
Yes, sure, sure.
It will be difficult.
Yes, yes, it's difi- even to go out with friends. I mean, or, or nothing, or to go out to eat. Or, or go out, it gets complicated, because
Aha.
if you have a couple of children, you have to movilize the entire family, eh, but, the same, I mean, we would also love to, the truth, in a couple of years yeah
start with, with that, with that stage. Eh, but, on the other hand, we know that we could had a good time being married without children, and it's nice too.
Yes. That's true. That's true.
Em,
It's very nice.
Yes.
but ver nice. And, children are very nice, I live happy with them.
What, What? I couldn't hear.
That children are divine, I live happy with them.
Yes, sure.
They are, I don't know, they fill up your life.
Sure. Yes. Em, Well, Yes, I don't know what else to tell you Eh, and, mm,
Above all, about the topic,
What do you want? Well, let's talk about the topic, then,
Or about what? I don't know, whatever you want, however you want.
I don't know, no. We- we can talk about anything. Yes, we can talk a bit about the topic, because we didn't talk about the topic. What was it? It was dating.
Um, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, about relationships, something about relationships.
What's that?
So, i don't know
I forgot
Um, me too
Yeah, well, let's talk about something else then
Yeah, uh, about what?
Well, i don't know, uh, i don't know, tell me a bit about how the city is like
Well, let's see, this city is pretty nice
Oh, yes?
I, i didn't think it was a pretty city, i thought everything but that. Because i thought it was a city
completely deserted. In fact it is, but on the outside
Sure, sure
And, in the city, the surroundings are very different, i missed that a lot about Boston, because in Boston, in the summer and spring
Yes
Uh, it's completely green
Uh
There is plenty of green, the plants, the trees, everything, the vegetation
Right
But here it isn't, here it isn't, there are plants and everything, but it's not the same, it's not the same
Sure, sure.
it's not the same as, as there.  Nevertheless, there are some buildings, some really beautiful structures.
Ah.
The city is bas-
Yes, yes.  Like, the only thing I know is by watching basket, from the NBA and they show the city in general, the sky scrapers, and it seems like a really modern city.
it's a really modern city.  Pretty modern, yes.
Yes.
It's a pretty modern city.
Eh.
It's a city with, very new.
Sure.
Ah, and we came and and last year we came for a visit, because my husband has family here,
Yes-
and there was a lot of land that was vacant and all this, and now everything's going, everything, everything, eh, building, there's a lot of these, eh, houses, these, what are they called?  Condominiums, eh, from
well, a lot of things
Sure.
they're totally building the city.
Ah, it's growing a lot.  Yes.
Yes.  It's growing a lot, a lot, a lot.
Sure.  yes, I think that same a lo- they're building many cities too, here in the United States.  But no, people are coming back more.  Before people were going to the suburbs to live.  I think that now
a lot of young people, professionals, young people, their families, with children are going back to live near the city. And also makes them develop a lot
Right? I don't know
Mhm
Here, in Philadelphia also. This started about five or six years ago, more or less. And, mm, they started building, eh, in an extensive way, allover
Yes
And, areas that used to be, a little poor, or were sub-developed, with voids, mm, developed a lot. And, I don't know, now we are moving to Baltimore, andº
it's similar, they are building a lot
Yes. Here too, here it is incredible the way they are building. But, it's amazing how people want, I mean, that people like me, I include myself in the group,
want to move to places where, where actually, you see, what am I doing here? I, sometimes, start thinking, wow, what am I doing here in this desert?
Yes
this is not the typical desert we are used to, or we all figure, the sand, no, no, it is a very rocky state, there are a lot of rocks
Oh
It is pretty rocky. So, there are no, there are no plants, eh, you feel
Sure, sure
No plant takes root there. So, eh, eh, that's why it's a desert
Yes
There is no way. No, mm, that's why they call it
Lourdes.
Hello, Lourdes. How are you? My name is Eliana.
Ah, I, you are from Boston, Right?
yes
Ah, good. How are you?
Fine. Why, how do you know?
Because I talked to you a while back.
Ah, How do you remember my name? I don't remember. Let's see, tell me. Where are you from?
We talked about living in the city and you were talking that you would like to live in,
Are you in Los Angeles?
no, I'm in New York
Ah, then.
And you, eh, had said that you would like, going to a little island with a cocktail when
Ah, I remember.
How have you been?
It was plan -B.
Plan -B, exactly, plan -B.
yes, Look, I didn't know that you could, let's say that, it could be repeated.
Ah, the, the, the combinations of participants?
Sure.
yes, because since they aren't, there aren't so many people, I imagine, well.  At the end of the day, it's very logical that it happens to you connect
Sure.
with a person more than once.  For me, there's a girl in Florida who, we talked like three or four times, and I asked her about home buying because she's a broker.
Ah, really?  How nice.  Wow.  And now, the topic of the day is relationships.
yes, well, tell me, are you single or married?
yes, I'm single, look, I'm thirty, so all these ideas,
Good.
in any moment will come up.  And you?
Aha.  No, I'm, eh, married for two years, with a baby for nine.
Sure, I remember your baby.
yes, yes, yes.  Well, tell me, How are relationships, then?
Ah, well.
Have you done online dating before?
No, no, never.  I don't know if I will get motivated to do it.
I have, aha, yes, tell me.
For, yes.  NO, no, because the topic is the language, it should be in Spanish.  To me English is still hard.  That's my problem here.
But tell me, what were you going to tell me?
No, I was going to tell you that one of my, before getting married, one my roommates did online dating
yes.
And she had stories from each, from each person she met.
yes, no?
Why, why
yes, did, did any of them ended up being normal?
well, sometimes, what happened was that, weeks would pass and she'd do the screening and keep in touch via email with the other person but,
that, she didn't want to get to meet the person quickly, she wanted, like to let time pass, so, he, he lost interest and he stopped
he stopped talking to her because what he wanted was
Sex.
to go out everyday, meet lots of people, so, if you, if you are throwing the net to them, you get whatever sticks in it, and everything that fell outside the net, you just let it go.
Sure, it must be hard, I was told some stories about, they did get married and they met via chat but I believe those are not common.
yes, no, oh, I believe that, only few stories end that way.
Sure, I believe that too, I'm still single, hello, in the, I don't know, all the, all the lines,
But, I believe there are lines to look for Hispanic partners, I mean,
yes, yes, not yet really no, no,
I do
oh, I'm going out with, I have been going out with this guy, he's from Argentina, that's the problem.
Oh, well. Oh well
I still haven't tried to  look anyone from here, but, I don't think this is going to last, just trying, to waste my time, right? Sometimes.
Sure, sure. Sure, sure, sure. So,
How old are you?
How?
How old are you?
I'm thirty, I'll be thirty three years old in February. February twelve.
Oh, I see, oh, right before Valentines, no?
yes, yes, yes, yes, and and look, let me tell you, this thing about relationships, well, it's like, it's like a trial marriage because
in the end, the only thing that changes is that well, nothing, you leave, you just leave your tooth brush in just one place.
yes, no?
But, this dynamic, the communication that has to, sometimes, you have to guess what the other  person is thinking
Sure, that doesn't change, lets say, for sleeping, it doesn't go through the sheets
No, no, no, no, it's not through osmosis, no, it doesn't work.
sure, that's a pity, yes
It doesn't work. That,
my mom just got me, now, because, well, no, I'm telling you, I'm fine, lets say, I'm thirty years old and I got a doctorate and I'm I chose to work, to have a professional life
But sure, sure
I did have boyfriends and well, that's what happens? Nowadays everything is delayed but my mom has a nervous attack
Sure, sure
So, she gave me a book that says, oh, I want everything and I want it now, Oh, the thirties, this decade changes your life, right? It talks about the divorce at thirty because people married too young
and the relationships and if you marry during your thirties, and well, and I'm reading it and it's the first time that I read a self-help book
Aha, aha.
that my mom sent me and I'm reading it now but I think it's funny but well, it is funny, I mean, what do I know?
But, look, it's true, look, during the twenties, you you, everything, this, is experimental, I can take this, taste this, take decisions, change my mind and
and then, with, is like when you reach the thirties, you begin to think, ah, wait, that, for example, I, I did the same too, I finished my doctorate
I married early, I got divorced, I finished the doctorate, well, all that, those that, those things that are in the book, all that
Of course.
Then, when you, when you begin the thirties, the begins, am, wait, I, I have my career, to me that is important, but I want a family too.
And then there, you, begin to go out, but going out with, the goal, the goal is not only to find someone to be with now, but the goal is, okay,
well, let me think with whom I would like to form a family, yes, yes is him, Do you understand me? if that is what you want to do.
Of course.
So, eh, and, because then, in, so, you get like a more, eh,
Finest.
more, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Not more, you don´t accept anything. Do you understand me? you don´t accept foolishness from anyone.
Of course.
Yeah, well, if you are going to go out with someone, you are not going to go out and loose your time, you are going to go out because, because you are looking for something more comfortable, something that,
that makes you feel good, that, that, that the company is not only a thing that, that, well, lasts two or three hours, and then is over.
Of course, yes.
And then, well, the courtship becomes something different after the thirties. Because, yeah, then you, when you go out with someone,even though you say I am not going to, you know, I am not thinking in that,
in,in, in, in, the more remote, in the back of the brain.
No, sure.
that is always, you, or you are thinking on it. Right?
Sure, sure. Besides, maybe not, no, I don´t think anymore in marriage but in, I want to feel in love, to be with a partner. And, because you are far from, lets say, and then, I adapt
Of course. Of course, of course, of course.
and this but, but well, all of it, I know that everything gets, if you are nervous about it, you see? you become desperate and you won't go anywhere.
No, exactly, exactly, exactly. So,
Well, it's true, lots of times you realize oh, why can't I find it, why can't I find it? And maybe it's because you are, you know, chatting and maybe the guy you are chatting with
it's not the man of your life. You will probably be introduced to him by someone that is in your same circle.
sure, sure, exactly.
Or is like, if you go to dance in a place it's harder that you will find a husband there
Exactly, Exactly. It's just that in the end, yes, I mean, for example, this thing about chatting, it seems to me that
it's just temporary, no? well, maybe for women as we are always looking for love and well, we, to me it sounds like a
this pink story and well we think that we might find someone but I don't think that that is the same mindset that men have,
Sure, not at all.
I mean, it's just an easier strategy, you know, to get to meet more people without even having to fix your hair or wash your teeth in the morning
Sure, sure, sure.
So, but, but, you also have to think about, in a way, technology has changed  lots of things in our lives,
well, that makes sense, technology is changing also the way we fall in love and find our partners.
yes.
Right?
yes, that's right, that's the change that is happening to us, to our children, your daughter maybe
Aha, aha.
she's going to start chatting with boys when she turns ten years old.
Exactly. Exactly, exactly and look, for example
For example, I don't know, I know that there are some chat groups about music, so, you will also find it there
Sure, sure.
someone with your own tastes.
Sure, sure and look, if you think about it, before, the, the, what's the name? The celestina, matchmakers, the matchmakers,
yes, yes.
that was the way through which people used to get a couple, no?
Sure.
So, and then, well, the social changes have, well, people weren't looking for that type of things, so, well,
oh, to go out, to, to, to, to look for someone that is kind of similar to us, so, I mean, that was not the way in which things used to be done back then. Back then, they did, well
it was because of an economic compromise or to strengthen political alliances between families, what do I know! That one had more cows than I and I needed to have more cows.
Sure. A, a bull, a bull, maybe.
so, exactly, he has the cows and I needed them, I needed, I had a bull.
Sure
But, I mean, even, even if I now feel like I don't really trust the chats, I say so because my sister is one of the ones that's into them
she's started to meet lots of guys, she's trying to go out and she's using the internet a lot, but, I know, as you say, I tell my son, well, that's what he's going to get to know, and for him
for him, it's going to be normal, no?
Sure, as is.
The way in which things are done.
yes, besides that, maybe, due to us being women, we are afraid, no?
Sure, sure. It's just like a safety issue because, look, any idiot, any psycho can log in into a computer and say whatever he wants.
Sure, of c-
hello
hi
hi, How are you?
How are you? Fine my name is Roman, And yours?
How are you Roman? My name is George
What?
from New York b- George
what, Jorge
George
yes, yes aha
oh, And what's up?
fine, fine, And you?
What do you think about the topic?
From where?
What, what do you think about the topic? I can't talk too much because my throat hurts. what what do you think about the topic?
ah well, well I would say the topic of internet dating.
yes
the truth is that I never had one
no
but I think that I have two comments that sometimes they were positive and negative, you never know what you're encountering.
yes
it can be that you talked with a person and suddenly you find them and I don't know, it can be your grandmother
aha
I don't know.  Have you had any experience with this?
no, yes, this isn't right, a date with someone who you don't really know, to see it, and nothing happened, hmmm
ah you- you had an internet date with someone you met on the Internet one time
yes something like that, no, I don't believe many opportunities of meeting on the Internet, very little, I had a contact on the internet but really no, nothing happened
yes, I think that it's very difficult, very difficult
and where did you meet?  a website, what website was it?
no, I don't remember, this was like two three years ago, I don't remember, I don't really remember, someone on there wrote me and made a date but no
ah
no, she wasn't my time, so no
yes, yes
so everything ended
And are you married now?
yes, like no, I was, yes I was hmm but I yes, Internet really difficult even today people use it for the lack of time, lack of
sudden opportunity to go to a social event or one of those things to know people, sure
yes
I think that it's a good way with, with, oh, what do you think?
ah, and, you had, you told me that you were married, so you're divorced?
yeah right
you are divorced
yes
did you divorce a long time ago?
Excuse me?
How long have you been divorced?
Oh, last time I was on that process for about
oh, and you said, where did you tell me that you are living now, in which city?
yes, I'm in New York
oh in New York, how, how are women there?
there aren't many
are they, are they easy over there?
very few, very few, you don't have the opportunity to well, there's plenty of social life but, I still know very few people, no
yes
yes, it seems easy, there are lots of clubs, discotheques and all of that
are there many, choya, many Latin women over there?
sure, mhm, there are many but I don't really know
oh, that's fine
but, yes, there are lots of them, where do you live?
I'm in Miami
hmm ah no well it's sill better there.
here, here there's more, in reality here there are more Latinos than Americans, in reality.
yes, sure yeah aha
But there, it must be mo- it must be more difficult because the topic of cold doesn't leave, Or not?
yes, but the issue it stupid, it's not a question of
Sure, sure, here everything's open all day.
yes sure
night and day
yes
it seems like a city, it seems like a Latino city
a while ago yes, this,yes I know, I was in South Beach eh, I think the last time was about three years ago I was there
yes but there's a lot of ambiance and a lot of ways to meet people, no.
and yes, yes the truth, the social life is closer to the Latino
yes hmm I, I had, I'm Colombian
yes, yes
and before coming here, in the company where I worked we hired some people from Orlando, so there was a woman who said, it's not that Miami isn't from the United States.
she was American, and she said that Miami isn't from the United States, it's another different world
And how long have you lived here?
for five years
for five years
Yeah, like five years ago, right?
Yes, uh, and you went straight to New York?
Yes, yes, i came directly here, and I've been here, well, open to go anywhere, but yeah, i've really spent the last five years here
Yeah, and, how do you put up with the cold, isn't it very cold there?
Yes, it's like everything, i really prefer the cold than heat
Oh yes, uh, i'm, yes
Yeah, well, no, it's really something, i have a bad flu right now, but you don't, and
Yes
And later on you have to go out with a coat and all that, right?
The thing about
but
the football [soccer] thing, you can't play football there
Come again?
during the winter, they can't play football
No, but there are closed places, there are closed places where people play a little. There are a few, you know New York, right?
Um, what?
You have been to New York, right?
Yeah, I've been there twice
Oh, yes, on Manhattan, on the riverside, there are some Piers, there are warehouses out in the open, and they play there
Oh, well
there they play a little there they play a little and it's really like two months no more
ah
I really don't know if the people attempt to play Saturdays or Sundays in a park or something.
yes
I suddenly was last year trying to play after like five years that I got messed up and broke my tendon and didn't go out
but there are groups I imagine that try to play a little
oh, and I
is not too cold
I broke my internal ligament
yes
yes playing soccer also but yes,
eh
I, I was, I've been here seven years of which
yes
five I lived in Tennessee
yes
and that, another another totally different thing. Tennessee is totally different to New York and Miami
I imagine very calm, very calm for one, no.
Yes it's very
tranquil
very calm, very Americanized, all of it, it's nothing like our own culture, you are not going to find it there
yes
nowhere
Are you married?
no, I'm not, you can't be married in Miami
single
with all those women out there in Miami, one can't be married.
Oh well, then tell me about one experience you've had in your relationships, so to stick with the subject
oh, to discuss the subject, no, I'm a person that stayed with a girlfriend for a long time
yes
always with one or the other but
mm
between break ups, but I try to enjoy as much as possible before I start dating another one
yes
and when , when you are near, when winter is coming, I need to be with someone to be warm, I need someone to burn me up
yes sure but, well, how do you find new girlfriends, at discotheques, at parties, on the Internet?
no, my three ex-girlfriends
yes
they used to be my friends
oh, I see
so I already knew her, I had known her for a while
yes
and things happened and then we realized that we belonged to each other
yes
and all of my other girlfriends, we dated during six years and I dated with another one for three years
mm
and with the third one, eight months.
are all those women from your own country, or from here, how is it?
oh, two were from Argentina
yes,
and the other one was from Peru
Peru, haven't you dated Americans, don't you like American women?
yes, the Peruvian was American too, we were together for three months while I was living in Tennessee
yes
but, the truth is, I don't know if this also happens to you but it's different, you reach a point in which
the the
it's not that you don't understand it but you get to a  point in which you don't get along with that other person, and I'm also
no, yes, that's my opinion too, but you have lots of experience so I'd like to know, what was the difference, which points
are different or, what should I know about it?
yes, yes, the truth is
which one, which one?
well, I, in reality, when I started dating the American, it was something new for me, she was a pretty girl
yes
but, at some point, you need to use your own language to have a better communication
yes, I believe that, that's a huge barrier, it's very, very different to talk in a language that is not your own, to express your feelings, that's true.
yes
yes, I believe it's hard, I mean, the relationship cools off pretty quickly
that's right, part of the heath is different
yes, and, and
the feelings that you have for the other person
mhm, the way they are, I mean, the way they are
you can tell
the way they dress, the way they, is it very different?
exactly, Latinas also take good care of their man, it's completely different the way American women treat their men
yes, very different, they all live on their own
and they are very independent, Latinas are different, they rely on their boyfriends or husbands, their partners
yes mm
Americans are more independent in that regard
mm mhm
it's like, oh, they are more open, open mind, I'd say
Uh huh
And the Latin woman is dependent, she always asks you what to do, what to cook, everything
Yes
that, i think that's not, that's, uh, that's nice, to have something to look for, i like that, because they
yes
that's why i get more hooked up with latinas than Americans
Yes, and, are they passionate or is it a very cold attraction, how are they?
And
How was the reaction at least?
you're, you're talking about sex, right?
Oh, well, yes, maybe, it's, i mean, yes, it's important because
No, the sex, i assure you that the Latin woman is hotter than the american, it's not that the american...
uh, no, no, yeah, that's the concept i have, right?, suddenly the woman is too cold, too practical sometimes
Yes, yes
i think you're very used to the Latin woman, to be endulged, to them being passionate
Oh, exactly, it's
to them dressing, get dressed up, them worrying about their things, even the way they cook, all that stuff, isn't it true?
exactly
um
Speaking of which, the sex is more, it's more like, you find out
yes, OK
Good evening
Good evening
my name is Nancy
Luis, nice to meet you
nice to meet you, eh, what do you think about today's subject?
yeah, it's, ok, about meeting someone through internet or
the
well, not through internet, no. Personals, well, I don't think so, it's never worked for me, and I've never tried it, but
hmm
no, I don't think that, well, not for me
It wouldn't work
No, it wouldn't be essential
yes, it's better when you meet the person directly, yes
sure
You can get to know them physically, and know what they think and all that, through internet they can write
yes
a lot of things and you wouldn't notice
sure
Or what kind of face they will have, yes
yes
I've never participated before
Pardon?
you've never participated in having a relationship by Internet or by an ad.
mm, mm, no, nor would I like it because well
yes
is the same
yes, yes let's say in that
But, pardon?
have changed a lot, the courtships have changed a lot, before it was very
yes true
very different, yes because, from what I understand before they would sit, in the old times somebody would sit in the living room in the middle of the boyfriend and girlfriend.
yes
yes well now it has changed a lot
yes now yes, and even the courtships last less time, right.
yes that's one month, two months.
yes
Never know or no
yes
or if not goodbye and thanks, yes
Oh
That's true
And, have you met anyone on the internet or, or some personal ad?
No, no, i haven't been either, no, I'm not, i don't have that way of thinking, of meeting someone over the internet, well, i'm not interested
Yeah, you prefer to
I'm more like sharing with the person
Looking into its eyes, face to face, yes
Yeah, sharing and knowing each other better, having a more.. contact
Of course
More intimate, yeah, and that way you don't share that
Of course, what have been your worse dates?, well, if you have had
that way of thinking
That you've had
Suddenly, when you're at school, that was like just to mess, and then you said "uh, no, i don't like that boy anymore"
Um
Yeah, i remember once that, insisting, insisting and since that day i will never date anyone anymore like that
That, i know that like in my country, that's called "meloso", when they take your hand, kiss you, right?
And lets say, you're not on the mood
And
At that time you're not just looking
Pardon and where are you from?
I'm from Colombia and You?
Colombia, Mexico
Mexico, mm I thought so.
yes
Because of the tone of your voice
yes, yes
yes, I imagined it, yes and have you had long relationships or what
mm the truth no, and I don't like it
mm
mm, I think it doesn't work because, well I've always focused more on my studies, right now I'm in the university.
yes
and that's my priority right now
And what are you studying?
I study economics.
ah, very good
yes
very good, yes Now you should give priority to your studies and later,
yes, I already studied the rest, no and at work, entertainment, etc.
yes yes that, there's time for everything, I mean there will be time for everything. mm
yes
in reality no, Because let's say that right now, they aren't really for me, I don't share the idea that, let's say, they receive
their boyfriends in their houses for as long as they want alone and in the room, I don't share this idea.  Because now they say
they say that this is modernity, so no
Not including the adolescents, thirteen or fourteen years old.
hmm
A relationship at this age is
yes
much different than in previous times, no
yes you can't at least, since they're a little bit mature.  Not today.  They're, they're kids.
yes, they don't think about the consequences,
no, They don't think about anything, they live the situation.  But they don't think of what can come out of it.
yes, yes sure.
they get unwanted pregnancies and this
yes
due to this for me, what they said is that kids who are thirteen, twelve, sexual relations and

no yes
and before no, one would remain, well the women,
mm
will remain a virgin until marriage, right
now is very hard
And now
totally hard already
yes
that's already like practically impossible
yes
Because let's say, like for the liberation that we have in this time that they are not going to let let's say like their partners or something because
they have several boyfriends and have their sexual relations and all that doesn't interest them anymore
yes, okay

eh, well I think that well I see it as a date unless the person interest me, no. That many people that go
To impress the other person.

But well, in that sense
yes, no, let's say that like, one has a very different way of thinking, like more mature, I think
yes, yes
so then no is like One is like more old fashioned a little. not so so much
No well sometimes, sometimes I do think that techniques that were used before work.
before, yes
ah, well You want to be more original, no, I say
yes yes because all of a sudden, let's say before anything the respect, if one already exist, first the friendship, the courtship a respect then like, like is a nice relationship.
yes
That's the way of thinking, yes
Sure sure
mm Let's say that like that way of thinking was how I was raised, then, also. come here

Ah, for example that.
Eh?
Eh, Do I turn off the light from here? Do I turn off the light from here? Eh mm. Through internet. And yes, no, the truth is that they don't work.
Don't work in what sense?

Tell me, because I've seen you have a lot of experience.
What?
You tell me something since you have so many experiences.
I don't have many experiences, I have very few experiences.
You said, you were saying how many crazy things you had done in your life.
I'm a man of little experience a man who has been, eh beaten
Oh, sure
beaten by life, beaten by everything, right? By the women, by rock and roll by soccer, by everything Uh, again everything fell to crap. Damn it.
Uh, what are you doing?
Is that I can't do two things at the same time, I can't talk on the phone and try to arrange those boxes.
Ah, finish.
Is exasperating. And well. As I was saying, I'm a very beaten guy.
But tell me, you didn't say anything, why don't you tell me?
Life, life has treated me very badly.
Tell me one of your experiences
Excuse me?

Carlos from New York, Carlos from New York
what? Carlos, hi I'm Pilar
ah, good and you?
I'm Pilar, how are you? um um but is not Carlos I thought I knew you but no
oh no, where are you speaking from?
from New York also
from New York? oh how nice
yes but you are Spanish or no
no I'm
ah man forgive me is that
oh
I know a Carlos who's Spanish but he's from Anda Lucia so then you have a similar accent and when you said Carlos from New York I said ah well is my friend Carlos
yes and then
what?
and then what are we going to talk about, the equality ah
yes yes yes ah what do you think of this topic
hello, aha tell me
hello, what do you think of the topic of equality?
mm equality well there's no equality right?
yes of equal- eh how can the inequality that's in the United States be solved or something like that
hmm ahh
hey
hmm
you have to talk or else they won't count the call
sorry, I don't understand?
you have to talk
oh no
or the call won't count
yes what's happened is that my friend passed me the phone because she's pretty shy, pretty stupid
ah
so I'll talk better because I made the other calls, I already have around seven calls
hmm
out of twenty five, right?
they're, yes, twenty five
you're sp- are you Spanish?
yes
or French?
no, Spanish
oh Spanish, I was in Spain, I know Madrid
ah yes, I'm from Madrid
yes ah I used to go a lot to there near Spain square near the Collao station and near all those places
and, did you like it?
yes I liked it I have many photos the in the like they call these things of the, those very big castles that there were
castles in Madrid
yes ther are some castles, well like museums
the palaces ah
those palaces, the exactly many gardens, some big gardens and the palaces and all that
yes yes
yes I liked it and I was there in summer, very nice
well it was really hot there one
yes but I didn't like it because of the high cost of living, the rent is expensive, I used to live in hostels, and the hostel charged me a lot
yes yes it's very expensive it's as expensive as New York
yes, I like New York more
ah I like them both
and, have you been a long time here in New York?
a year and a bit
oh, and are you used to it?
mm yes more or less it's that I live at the University
ah you are
and and here at university yes I've gotten used to it, I don't know much else but well
Ah, you're like an intern at the university
eh no I'm, like, I live in an apartment but I have a lot of work, that I don't have a lot of time to go and see the city
no, no I Know the plan like a tourist, like, I've been
ah sure yes
to the tourist sites to visit but I don't go a lot
oh and, you're there like a year and after you'll go back to Spain again?
no, I'll still stay for longer
ah well you're studying there
I'll stay a few more years and then I'll go back to Spain, yes
oh, because you have a student visa?
yes
ah that's why, sure, what happens is someone's calling, I'm here but I could pass the telephone to my friend, she's gueiya, she's guey
so since she gets pretty shy when she speaks with women because she only speaks with men, she's a little shy so I listened to what she said, aha, hmm
that whenever she wants with someone, ah, I said, I bet you're talking with a woman, because I'm talking with a woman, and she's talking with a man, so she's happy
yes, look, the topic of today is equality, right?
yes yes yes we haven't talked about the topic but well
no well you know even if you don't talk about the topic they don't say that it doesn't matter, what's important is that they want to hear you talk a little for twelve minutes
yes
and the topic of today is equality so yes it's like if there's equality between the man and the woman
he no, in total, in general equality between rich and poor, equality between men and women, equality between
between all
the races all the equalities
sure I don't think there's equality here
no there's none
and nowhere, there never will be that's what we all would want for there to be equality of rights, equality of opportunities, equality of everything but that's not like that
no but you believe is possible for there to be a way to have equality
I would like for there to be some equality but like I tell you it's almost impossible I mean I don't think
I think it's in the human core to be unfair with others and
yes
I mean people not to treat you the same because I mean if you for example meet two people and you like one and the other you don't like
aha
well already already you are not going to treat them the same is that it's normal right?
sure that's why I tell you I mean that as much as we want for there to be one hundred percent equality that is equitable, there won't be
because that's like in the way I believe of the people of the humans, we are like this there's no equality that's why I don't believe in that of equality
and I say that there should be for example I find it unfair for example in my country, I'm from Chile
yes
and when they would put a job in the newspaper it would say lady cashier needed up to twenty five years old
mm yes
security guard up to thirty five years old in other words it's already limiting people that are older than that they already cannot give them the job
yes and that's allowed because there's work discrimination that's prohibited but
but they do
but in general, almost everything is permitted
Exactly, i mean, there are lots of thing that shouldn't be done but they're done, and even if we try to change the world and make things change
everything's going to be a never-ending story, it's always going to be the same
and, do you think there is more inequity than in the United States, for example in Chile and other places?
for example us, look, me and my friend, we're "guey", right?
Um
and there in Chile, we're like more limited, i mean, if you're "guey", uh, you have less chances of being taken seriously, they make fun of you, they do heavy pranks to you
yeah
and all of that, but here, i love this country, because i feel freer here, here you can, i can do
well, but this country, because you're in New York
that's why, that's why i say it
There are also other parts of this country where i think you'd  be probably worse than in Chile
yeah, that's why I'm telling you, i choose a good state to live in and now I've been here for almost two years like you
yes
and i like it, i mean, I'm not going back to Chile
Um
I'm staying, i'm staying here to live because i like the way of life, because here we have the same rights as anybody
yes, yes, yes
even though now
But there are also rights here, but, are there gay marriages here in New York or not?
No, not here, in other states, Massachusetts, Washington, right?
So, of all rights, that's still missing, right?
Yeah, no, it's true, but uh, i don't agree with that too because if i got together with someone i wouldn't like to marry either, have children and all that, right?, i think it's going too far
right?
Yeah, the truth is that i don't know what to think about that because marriage is something so
important, so serious
right, but i mean that it's something so risky like the tradition of men and woman get married and that's it
that, simply, to me a marriage between two man, two women, it just doesn't add up, right?, i mean, that
sure, i mean, me too, i think so too, regarding that if i like another man, i can live with him, share
have a relationship and everything you want, but from that to marrying like what Elton John is doing, spending i don't know how many millions with his boyfriend
that they're going to... one of the largest weddings of this time, one of the largest and most mentioned, because it's the first wedding
uh, that, with such prestige because they have a lot of money and they're important and all that
Yes
But that happens at all levels, i mean
Yes, yes
Other people can get married too, but I'm telling you, i'm not a fan of marrying or adopting children because, imagine, the babies will grow and they won't know who's the dad and who's the mom later on
No, but the, what's true, and i think the United States does have a partnership, or something like that, it's called
Um
That's, if you, that what's unfair about two people of the same sex not being able to get married, is that for example, if you live your whole life together
and one of they die well the person's goods go to the family of
ah yes
the one who died in stead of the other when the marriage, if the husband dies, he gives money to the wife or the opposite, no?
sure this is what they're fighting about, they want justice that if they're two couples, to men have been like you say, all their life together, and one dies
it's right that the material things should go to the one he spent his whole life with.
sure this is the only thing that yes, I see that
and yes
and I think it's good what seems stranger to me is what you say, the ceremonies and all this seem to me
this is what chocks me, like, it's not that I'm an animal, it's simply that I haven't been educated like this
yes well and no no
it seems pretty strange to me
me too, imagine, I'm with my family and me too, I'm not used to it because I find it strange and I'm put there but this and everything no no
I'm not a supporter of this because I think that they don't have a reason to get married
yes
why get married with this marriage, it makes me laugh, it seems pretty ridiculous to me because you don't know which one will wear the white dress, the other in a suit
yes if they're two men or two women
no the two men dressed as men I say
aha the two
yeah so the ma- that one of the men dresses like a woman yeah
this is more as a joke
it is getting worse
yes, it makes me laugh but as I said, I find it that it's not necessary to get married, to have a wedding so that two people that love each other, two men or two women that want to be together
they can do it
sure
they don't have to show it off in front of everyone else and have those weddings
mhm
but, that's why I'm telling you that I find it that there's no equality
no
there's no equality I find it unfair that women too, when some women can't when they are getting to good positions or when they are climbing up the social ladder
they just reach a certain topic and they don't let them climb up more as women can't get to those places
yes, that's true.
I don't agree with that, for example, in my country one woman is trying to be President, Mrs. Michell Bayalet in Chile, she's going to be the first woman to be President
and is she going to get picked, is she going to win?
they say she will, I don't know, she wants to on behalf of all feminist women, she's in favor of women showing men that they too can be
I think that's all right, that would be something good for our country, to pick a woman for four years
in Germany they already have a woman that won the last elections
mhm, I
the first President woman in Germany, she's going to be Chancellor of Germany the first one in Germany history.
isn't she, is she the iron woman?
no, that was in England
right? that was how is she called
Margaret Thatcher was
that was Margaret Tatcher,
and this one is, Angela Merquer is her name
in Germany
but it has nothing to do with Margaret Thatcher people thought it was not going to work because is a little bit weird woman
and of course
they don´t have the. Margaret Thatcher was a very strong woman, very strong right?
yes, it looks to me like that
and you saw her with the power but this one is like she was a physics teacher in in in the university but a teacher and I don´t know she looks like a little bit shy I don´t know it is so curious in has happened
of course I say to you that I would truly like a woman from my country there is Mitchell Bresalet that was the defense Minister
m
I would like her as a minister, and very important everybody loves her because we have always have left side presidents, and the ones from the left side the same as always steal money and promise a lot
and in the moment they do the things they do not do it right and then sometimes is always good a change and to try another alternatives
yes I think the best are the real changes
yes then we had our left side president and now we would like a president from the national right side and another right side party and
yes because the when the party changes there is always so much enthusiasm well not always but
exactly that is good
they put so much enthusiasm and they do well the first, the first legislature the good things begin to turn bad and then it is time to change
Hello, good evening.
Hello? Good evening.
How are you? Whom am I speaking with?
What? Pardon.
Whom am I speaking with?
Maria.
How are you Maria? You're speaking with George here in New York.
Yes, sir. how are you?
Fine thanks, and how is it going? Where are you?
Me? In Ohio.
Ah. In Ohio, ah, okay, how nice. And what do you think of today's topic?
Well, there's a lot of inequality here, right?
Yes.
Is a, they're topics totally as far as. if there's racial inequality.
Yes.
Mm.
Mm.
Eh, economic inequality.
Yes.
mm, maybe in our countries you don't see that or you see it a lot,
Yes, sure,
because the one that has, well tries to, tries to have and have more.
Yes, I think that all, all the countries more rooted in inequalities are more rooted in inequalities.
Yes.
Ah? From here. Mm.
Yes, in our countries, yes.
Yes, but it's too much, the situation here is that everybody is equal and no, well no there are inequalities like in all places, right?
Yes.
Not everybody has a right to all the resources or has access to all the resources, and do you think there's some solution or what would be the solution?
Well it's hard changing this because let's say that
Already, too much.
eh, that has to be made equal in Africa is different, a lot of poverty
Ah.
then there never will be any equality, because there's a lot of hunger also, so then, the ones that get it is for that.
Ah.
Mm.
And I don't know what, what magical solution
Yes, is hard, for that.
what magical solution, well I think that, that something can be done right? like in fact start by making the opportunity  in education equal, by making the opportunity in,
the health means
Hum.
eh I don't know, those type of things, no, we have to start doing something, right? It could be one, no
Yes, at least in I'm from Mexico
Yes.
and let's say crossing here is hard
Aha
and they always look at you as if you were different
Yes.
there are people that are fleeing.
Aha.
I wish it was but
Yes.
suddenly they just come to work and work
Yes. Eh, the border situation that's a different topic, right?
Mm.
it has the inequality, that on top of it the opportunity to work is here, right?
Yes.
And
And well, let's say one does a lot to work and
Yes.
and you forget the other
Aha.
the other factors, well studying, and learning other things, the language
Aha.  Yes.  And so, it's, there we can insist that it's also the fault of someone who's a part of the inequality, no, he doesn't look, doesn't try to overcome it, suddenly, no?
Yes, yes, it's the problem.
The thing is that what they give you, are the ways, another thing is that you contribute to overcoming these inequalities, right?
Yes.
So, well yes, there are people
Yes, because let's say they're presented with an opportunity but they suddenly reject it.
Ah.
Hmm.
It seems to me, I think that, that they have to go somewhere else, they have to go somewhere else and they, well, look for opportunities, if there's aren't
if it's difficult, well they have to look for it somewhere else
Hmm.
or, with a sacrifice
Yes, it's like this.
Try to overcome the inequalities.  And say to a friend well yes, definitely
Hmm.  You see
the directors of the
Would lower
of the country, of the world we
I would first help poor people a lot, I imagine to be able so that there is some equality and but it will be very difficult because
because rich people won't want to give something to the poor
Aha.
Mhm, it presents
Oh, God.
obstacles because we are in eh, you saw too, eh, people from Nicaragua
yes.
and they don't have the means to get over
Aha, mhm.
Mhm, so it's difficult for them too.
In what part of Ohio are you?
in Cleveland
In Cleveland? Mm, Cleveland ah , yeah. Oh, how far is that from Columbus? three hours or more no?
Like two hours and a bit
yes, mm, Yes?
Two hours. Yes. It's goot to live in.
And how the, the, the environment there? yes?
To live well, yes.
There's a big difference
Well the hard thing is because doesn't have transportation
Yes.
kind of because not,
You have to get around in car, mm, yes.
a lot of transportation, hum
And, and there's a lot of disparity let's say in the city, as far as the neighborhoods, as far as those types of things
You don't see that much
I don't know.
No, no, let's say like is something more, there's more equality.
Yes, because there are cities where there's a tremendous amount of poverty in some sectors, right?
Yes.
Mm, but you tell me that
But let's say,
that over there that doesn't come up.
Yes, no, but not here because let's say like , one has, the necessary and you can get it and the people don't, don't look like over
Yes, ah, okay, Mm.
the shoulder. Yes, no, that factor doesn't exist.
Yes, there are cities where maybe you don't see the disparities so well, right?
Aha.
Well each one goes, does what one can, works, each one has their house, their car, they get what they can, and, and mo, that's the problem, that's in almost all of Latin America, right?
Yes, that is the problem.
Where we have different treatments, where we have
Yes.
all different qualities. Everything is different. Here the majority go to public school and whoever wants goes to private school right?
Yes because the countries ah, one has to pay the school
Ah,
universities
Yes, is very costly and very
well one doesn't have for
Mm.
Mm.
Yes, I, that, seriously, well the majority of the people from the university and all that Mm.
But they maybe don't think in, in the future.
Aha.
A lot of people like spend more than what, what they make
Eh?
so then they don't plan that, they have a lot of problems like that
Yes.
But well there, there one has to go out oneself
Mm
bettering oneself
Yes, sure, and how long have you been here, in this country?
Of Eight years.
Three years? Mm.
Yes
Mm. Married, with kids or?
Yes, sir.
Yes? Mm.
Yes.
And your kids got into the city here or?
Yes, there's two.
Yes? Mm
Yes, they've gone
And how do they go?
What?
And how do they go?
Fine, they have gone to Mexico but they don't like it.
No? They already feel
No, no, No, they say they are Americans, yes.
Ah, really? Ah, really, And brothers of age?
Yes.
Ah, and how do they get along?
Good. Good, they get along well, no. But let's say like they always that they are Americans.
Yes.
We've tried to instill in them that no, that they are all the same.
Then you, and you have the voice, of instilling equality
Mm? Yes, because few end up instilling that no that is not the same they are
Sure, because
they are siblings and there's no reason to have differences in that sense.
Yes. Yes. because, well, yes every morning and between them
Mm, yes.
If you don't have
Yes, because doesn't know it.
is a very good job
Mm, yes but yes, they've gone and no, they don't like Mexico because
Mm, so that
that there's too much they say that too much filth, too much pollution
Yes
and that the transportation
No, sure, because I can imagine
So
Yes, and, in the sense of that
they are sued to the routine, so, no
Mmm, but
They didn't like it
But, you know that it's important, to get them insisted to know, recognize
yes, because, let's say, here there are
Really?, in the
well, it's celebrated the day of Kings, and the next day is for giving and gifts
Yes, so
Then, the problem is that you have to give the 25 and the 6
and the 6
Instead, other kids, not, because they are used that in King's day they are used to not
yes, they get used
yes, well
Well, you have an opportunity there, to comment
Mmm
the equality to know, right?, and other people in some conditions, right?
yes
Not so good, because they might, not, and well, what happens if you have the opportunity of also, going out an comment, right?
Yes.
They, they, this happens with a lot of people from here.  So they don't know the inequalities as much as we do, when you come from outside.  Hmm?  When people from here go somewhere, they realize that there are really people who
really precarious, no?
Yes, because they say, because here there are many poor people
Hmm.  Yes, hmm.
and in, in Mexico there are many poor people.
Yes.
In, In the United States there are too, that you see, that you don't notice much
Yes, you don't notice anything.
but they are there, hmm.
You don't notice the inequality as much as you notice in other countries but it's there, it's there, yes.
Yes because, Yes, because many kids start, the kids are dirty
And in the- Sure.  Hmm,
Hmm, and no, yes, they explain it as an economic condition
they have to explain it, they have to explain it because sure.  Hmm.
no, hmm.
Yes, this is important.
Yes, but they told me that the fact that they were poor didn't mean that they had to be dirty.  And, in this well, they were totally right.
Yes, this is true.  Yes, this is true, like they tell you when you're
Hmm.
small, you can be poor but clean and proud.
Yes, another because is like that they are poor but not, why don't they, clean themselves?
Ah.
Mm, one wonders
Mm
that suddenly well no, no has gone
Ah.
They sell those
Yes, they haven't had education, they don't have a habit
Yes.
of doing, doing these type of things.
Yes.
And your other kids
that's why I said, there's no equality
Mm. Yes and your
Because we don't have much but we are clean and okay, okay and suddenly, like they start talking a lot in English and then
Ah.
they look at them weird there also.
Really? Ah, exactly.
So they don't like it either, yes.
Neither the issue, right?
yes, because I thought that when they were out, from the school, to send them, but they don't want to go there, no
No, don't they?, No, but, if you have to go to them, si
No, suddenly
To know, to really know their origins, right?
Mmm
To be conscious, and suddenly help in the future of someone else, or like that, right?
Yes, because if they say that they save, that save to
And then
to when they are able
Mmm
To buy something there, well, it's like
Mmm
To have in case of going, but not to get there
Ah, well, yes good
Yes, so they
And how is school for your other children?
At first it was hard
A lot
because they arrived with 7 and 10 years
Sure, mm
then, it was hard
Yes.
that, that they fully got into it
Mm.
they felt strange
Yes, of course.
that they said that it was hard and that
But
that they weren't going to be able to learn
Mm.
but no they are already fine.
They overcame all that, mm.
Yes, Now that, find the money to
Ah, good.
to study to continue their studies.
To continue, they are already big, then
Yes.
Ah, good.
Yes, then there, there we go, to continue to work.
This is good.  No, I feel that it's giving, to overcome the inequalities
yes, this is true.
yes, because I think that well it also has to do with
Hello?  Yes.
Hello?  Yes.  How are you?  My no
This is George calling from Los Angeles and where are you from?
Hey, my name is Adrian. I live in Toronto, Canada.
and you are from Argentina
Exactly.
It seems to me that some time ago, I believe, we spoke.
Yes, that could be.
You, Adrian, how are you?  All is well?
Yes, that is yes, it's not very cold, that's how it is.
How is everything going there.  Is it, is it very cold there?
No, no, to the contrary, right now at this moment it's, it's raining, it should be more, 5 Celsius or that is, it's about 15 Celsius more than it should be, but
Or, or basically that is, what temperature is it?  Put me, it would be more or less?
It's not five, its more than five, positively.
Wow, that's pretty low, my goodness, my goodness.
No, but at the moment it should be ten below, eh.
Oh, yeah.  Really?
Yes.
Listen, listen.  Where are you from in Bueno Aires, from Argentina, Adrian
In, I was born in Villa Devoto
ah, Villa Devoto, yes, yes, yes,yes, I already remember. I'm from Lanus
in Bueno-
Valentin Alsina
from, from the west, no, not me, from the south
The Luz west, yes, yes, Valentin Alsina Very good,
Um, I remember a sister of my grandfather or of my grandmother, of my grandmother lived in Valentin Alsina, yes I have an image like that, of my childhood, of
of, of, of the ditch and the
The ditch yes, you made me remember the famous ditches when I was little, yes I remember those famous ditches, ah that
The, the, the ditch like deep
and a foul stench, and a rotten smell from that water, ah, how bad
yes.
that was, my goodness, yes, I remember when
What I, what I remember is that you had to jump it, that it was, it was like the curb
Ah, yes, it was disgusting, yes, yes
from Buenos Ai-
I remember yes, yes, the, the, the house, exactly in the street where I basically lived a long time there, I remember when I was, was very little, I was like four of five years old, more or less
my grandparents lived there, the house, the house was of, the the, no, the street was dirt
Mm
disgusting, those ditches, ah well Adrian
The the, the dirt, the eh
we have to talk
the street the, it was dirt but the the pasture, there where the ditch was and where the land of the house was, was dirt
yes.
but I don't know why it wasn't in the street, but
yes, it was a, it was, Aye, aye, aye the worst was the rotten smell that came out of these ditches
eh, and the mosquitoes in the summer, also.
Today yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah well, Adrian, for them to credit our conversation today we have to talk about equality, a really philosophical topic
No, I don't know if it's being, I don't know how it is, I don't live in the United States
eh
so I don't know exactly
Ah, you don't live in the United States
yes, eh, no, it's Canada, I live in Toronto, Canada
No, no, no, no, no, what I'm saying, no, I understand that you live in Toronto, I want to say, eh, no, I know that you're in Toronto
ah, well, this has nothing to do
yes, Canada, Canada is another country even though many Americans don't want to think of it as more than a state, it's another country, with another flag and
Oh.
another anthem and another culture and another
Exactly.  Eh, how many years have you lived in Toronto?
I've lived here for four years
Oh, that's litt- Good.
A little bit, relatively little
With-
yes, but the topic of equality and a couple of things here that, that in that, that demand my attention, uh, well, let's say eh
for example, the federal ministry of health
yes
eh, it's one, ah, I don't recall the name, but it's a person of Hindu background
oh, oh
ah, and he speaks with an accent, not a strong accent, eh, but he must be a person who has lived more than 20 years here, living in Canada, surely
just imagine!
eh I know he's a doctor, eh but, I don't know, it seems really satisfying that a person with an accent can be in charge of eh, such an important federal government, let's say
No, and just imagine, Adrian, that only after some 20 years of living in a place, basically,
yes, no, no, 20, 25, but no, the difference isn't that, the, to me the important thing is that a person who was not born here, eh, surely,
Exactly.
And didn't go to school, didn't go to primary school here because he wouldn't have this accent otherwise
And that
eh mm eh, from, I, you understand what I'm saying, right? for me this is
And yes, I understand. Yes, I understand you. It's a, this really signifies great equality. That apparently eh, according to what I read, to what I see on television or hear
and to what, ah, you are saying, this type of equality is something that happens much more in Canadian society than in American society
yes, you understand what I'm saying?
yes, yes, yes, eh, no, yes I would not imagine
I like it
I know that there's a Latin group with Bush but it's an exception, right? it's very, some of Bush's advisers have last names
oh, they must be Mexicans or something like that but, oh, no, no, I can't imagine, oh, oh, Bush's side, oh, in a speech, someone talking with an accent, oh
or at least with a non-Texan accent
You are so right, you are, so, so right
or, or, or, the color, yes, a different skin color, that too, the
Exactly, exactly!
there are, there's something, there's something, the, the, the one thing that I value must in Canadian people is that, one of the things that I value most is
oh, that they suck it up, the, the, they respect all the people, but there's a bad side to that too because you have to accept things that you don't really like
the, the, that's a talk that I often have with my wife, so well you can be open minded but you have to suck it up if something else comes up
Exactly.
so, you can't later, you can't later say, I'm open mind but not so much, I am but not for this, I don't like this or that, the
Exactly. Exactly.
the, the, one of the typical stories about that took place in the eighties when, I don't know exactly when but, one person that wasn't born here, but it doesn't matter, he was of Sikh descent
the ones that use turbans
His family was what? A family from where?
Sikh, oh, Sikh, Hindu, the ones that use turbans
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
the, the dream, I guess he came here when he was pretty young because he, his dream was, when he was a kid, he wanted to become a R-C-M a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer
Oh, yes.
see, the ones that have the red uniform and the little hat
And yes, yes.
brown like Yogi bear and
yes, yes.
he eh, well, his dream all his life was being a -R-C-M-P then, after he registered in school, he and, took the exams and passed and started to study and
the moment of the graduation came and the problem was that he couldn't use the hat of -R-C-M-P because he couldn't take off the turban
Oh, my goodness.
well and, what do you do there? and I know that here it was the ah, not too long ago I saw a documentary on TV on that and
I know that here it was something very, eh, important, so to speak, the discussion was, up to what point is good to bend the tradition to accept the, someone who is different
in the, and at the end, they did it, they changed, they made an exception with the uniform and when he was dressed in gala, he uses, the Sikh turban
but color, the same color as the hat of the -R-C-M-P eh mm
Okay
he, eh something like that I don't imagine, in a marine of, in
No,
no, I don't imagine the -U-S marines no
Unfortunately no unfortunately no look, eh more each day many people besides tell me mention it to me that eh Canada, eh eh, is a great country
in many things, that is a country eh, eh in many things really is a great country in the equality, in the, in as you say in the open mind
in the possibility, in the in, in the multiculturalism and apparently, in, in the freedom of expression eh, they apparently have many positive things that here in this country, in the United States
it cost a lot to realize those type of things eh, and, and, and, many people talk to me, I still haven't had the opportunity to visit Canada, but is
is in my immediate plans eh
And now, now that the Canadian dollar is high, it's not going to be as cheap as before, but the, if you want, uh, this place isn't perfect either but
the, what do i know, i met a, two or three people that, that came from the United States to here and, and because he [they] had bad experiences, uh
Uh, two, uh, two of them were Chinese or, or of Asian background and one of them was muslim, i don't remember, pakistani or
Yes
Or, i don't know where he was from, around there, and the number one reason why they had left is because they couldn't stand
i don't know if call it an estimation or not, i don't know what's the, the proper term, right?, i don't know if estimation is a strong word, the
i don't know, the problem here is that you're never going to become a millionaire because taxes are too high, you're going to die of cold
The... they're very high, right?
Yes, you're going to freeze the whole year and
That's true, except if you go to, Bri-, Bri-, Bri- Columbia, British Columbia, it has a more... weather
Vancouver
peaceful that resembles the one from, well, I'm in Los Angeles
It's like Seattl, it's not the problem, the only problem of Vancouver, it's a beautiful city, gorgeous, but it rains for three hundred days, like in Seattle
uh
Oh, it's a, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, always something
very similar to, it's very similar to Seattle
Hello, my name is Yolanda.
Hello, Yolanda, my name is Joe, how are you?

Yes, well, uh, it's been a very interesting study, talking to several people, from all around the world
Oh yes?
And, uh, i admire there's so many people from different countries, and uh, they're good, and they're making a better life for themselves, and i know that it's hard to be away from
their countries and relatives
Yes, it seems that's in the United States, right?
I'm, I'm from here
And, you were born there and all that, i mean, here
Yes, right, this is my, this is my country, yes, and were you born in Puerto Rico?
I was born in Puerto Rico, but I've been living here for twenty six years

yes, you know that your voice sounds like,  almost a girl.
Thanks.
how nice, what a blessing.
yes, it's a big blessing, and they are fine. The youngest one is married and lives in Nebraska.
Nebraska, yes.
and, and the, the oldest one lives with us. Ah, right now he decided to go back to school, return to school. And,
Ah, hopefully he'll finish. Right? How nice.
yes, aha. And, that's what we are working on, and and, you already see, when one has kids, there's always something to do
Sure, sure.
yes, and, and you've always lived in the Colorado area?
Well, I briefly went to New York. But, from there, I quickly moved to Denver.
Aha.
And, I've always liked it here, I like it a lot because
yes, is very pretty.
one can enjoy a lot like the four seasons here in Colorado. The mountains are very beautiful, if one wants to go camping,
Mm. yes, aha.
fabulous places, and there are a lot of historic places to see also, here.
yes. A lot, a lot of history, yes.
yes, is- Have you come to Colorado?
yes, I, I've passed by there several times, and I've gone there to, ah, Beaver Creek.
Oh, yeah? how nice, yes.
yes, I saw, eh, yes, very nice, very
Have you gone skiing over there?
Well, I just went to see, because, I don't put on the skis
But, yes, Beaver Creek is beautiful, yes.
yes, is very beauti-
And, and if you go more to the center of Colorado, ah, you would see like in, by there, you would see places that seem like a paradise, really beautiful,
Ah. Aha.
the beauty is incredible. I got my last vacations, eh, I went to, I spent it in Colorado, two weeks exploring the state, and
Aha.
I had a fabulous time. I had some friends, they came,
AHa.
we all went, and we went by those mountain passes that are very intimidating when you get to a certain height
Ah, yes,
in the ten thousand, twelve thousand, fourteen thousand feet, and one looks like that,
yes.
by the ravine down, and, you lose your sight, looking.
yes.
Is very intimidating. I always get a little bit of anxiety when I'm so high up like that. But, is something good, all that.
yes, is something, How? In English you say awesome.
Awesome, yes
of the greatness of, of the mountains, yes
That's true
And, and i went, we went rafting too, on the river, which river did we go to?, the, uh, Colorado River i think
Yeah, yes, that's one
And we were rafting and that was an experience too
What level did you choose, you don't remember?
Yes, oh, no, i don't remem-
Because, there are some that are, uh, the truth is that they scare you to the last, and others are more soft. But in anyway, rafting is pretty strong
Yeah, it was fine, well, soft. But, yeah it was, uh a little, it looked dangerous but no. Uh, i, oh, i, i was thrilled with the journey, um
Oh, that's cool
Yes, right
Did you go on Spring Canyon?
You see, it was on the ninety
Around then?
one, and i don't remember where it goes, it's that, when you're there for the first time, and everything you see is running water
Yes, yes, it's true, it's true, but yes, it's beautyful.
Yes, it was very nice around there.
Well, and speaking of today's subject, even though they allow us to talk like that, it's OK
Right
Well, I think there are many things that still separate the, the, the American people, right?
yes
just like the whole world, that are the political ideas, nationalist ideas, races, racism is still common in many places
yes, very. And, excuse me, but I didn't understand the word you used, what did y-....?
Immigration?
Was it..
Oh, immigrants
was it immigrants? I didn't quite understand the recording
yes
And, so, that was what they said. Immigrants, OK
yes
OK
But, I'm talking in general, about how you see the situation here in the United States, and
yes
about this kind of things, political aspects, races, and things that cause division. And still
yes, aha
OK
oh, sorry
sorry
Well ,you see. Among people of the same race, there is division. You see, there are communities of Hisp- of Mexicans, or Cubans, or Puerto Ricans, or even from here
from the United States. And, sometimes, there's like a little division in those,ah, I know when, I was growing up, eh, I didn't speak much Spanish because I grew up in an,
Ah.
an American world, speaking English.
yes.
And, I was very embarrassed to speak Spanish, because the people that came from other countries, would make me feel as if, I wasn't,
ah, enough to talk. I felt bad when I talked with them
Before there was a lot more prejudice about that, is true.
Mm, yes.
But, that is something that I'm instilling in, in my daughter, that she should never be afraid, to speak Spanish because, first, Spanish is a very beautiful language,
Mm. yes.
and also is, is very important that one is bilingual here in the United States.
Oh, yes.
And, she's learning, her kindergarten is in Spanish, although is mixed with English, because I want her to learn to write, to read Spanish well,
Mm.
because, is, is something sure that she will learn to read, read and write English, here, living in the United States. And, she is speaking both languages very well, and
words, she reads them well in Spanish and in English. And, I don't want her to forget I know she will need it, and,
and is how the parents, impose, or, or adapt them, like you say, Yolanda, that, that sometimes, the same pressures that they put on them, well, one like is already afraid, of speaking Spanish.
I'm very fluent in English. But, I'm never afraid to speak Spanish, wherever it may be.
yes. Well, now I'm learning, and now more, well, since I'm ah old, yes, I don't get, well, a little embarrassed, because I don't speak it very well, I speak it, I speak Tex-Mex.
Oh, you speak it very nice, you shouldn't worry about how you speak it.
And, oh, than kyou. M, ah, but
We all have an accent, all of us
yes
So, don't worry about that
But, besides, I am learning, to pronounce the words properly, and to use the right words. Because, you see, eh, here in the United States, some words that are uesd in other countries, may sound different
Right
yes, and I am leraning more and more
And you tell me! I was married to a woman from Oaxaca and the, the, the language, the words there, compared to Puerto Rico, there are lot of fifferent words, and others who have different meanings, and phrases too
yes, yes. Aha
I learned a lot with my wi, my ex-wife now
Aha
But I learned a lot of the dialect
Yes
they speak in Oaxaca
Aha
And also, we the Puerto Rican, decompose words a lot
Mhm
Because, I learned to talk more, ah, properly, here
Aha
I realized how we shorten the words. Instead of saying
yes, aha.
like for, we say, for there
yes, aha.
I'm going over there. That now upsets me, because is like killing the language.
yes. yes. Eh, I have some friends that come from Costa Rica, and you you. And, ah, more formal Spanish.
yes, yes,
And, um, I admire it because it sounds so nice.
yes, is very nice.
Aha. yes.
The Spanish, in itself, is a very beautiful language. Is how we treat it sometimes, that we damage it. But, the written language is beautiful.
yes, very beautiful. And, that, I also cannot write too well. Ah, because I don't know the accents well, and all, the grammar.
Grammatically, I can't write too well. But,
yes.
I can read it, and that's important.
Sure it is.
yes.
That's good. Well, sure, I imagine, your kids, speak completely  English.
yes, they, ah, but now they are trying to, to speak Spanish. They already see that is very important.
yes. Very important, yes.
They understand, ah, if one speaks slowly.
yes.
But, they can't speak very well.  But they wish, now they have the desire, before when they were younger, they didn't have the desire, because they said that they didn't need to speak
Spanish.
Well, notice that there are many people speaking Spanish here in the United States.
yes.
in Colorado, the stores here, advertise many things in Spanish.
yes, aha.
And the, the commercials, even on the normal channels, like NBC or ABC,
Hmm.
CBS, are having more commercials mixed with Spanish.
yes, it's because they're seeing the power of the Hispanic people here in the United States, we're here.
Sure, big market.
Hmm.  Very big, and well, there's money there, and they will try to, win, people for their products.
Sure, I imagine tha-
yes.  But, oh, sorry.
I was going to say that I imagine that there are many, many Latinos there, especial-
Hi, hi, this is Maria Ines from Philadelphia
yse, hello, ah, ah, my name is Blanca from Finex
ah, how are you. Where are you from originally?
ah, Colombia, Colombia, yes
Colombia, ah, I´m from Argentina
yes
can you tell?
I can tell
do you know what they say, if you can tell, you can tell
yes, I can tell easily, there are accents that are unmistakable, no?
maybe, yes, yes, no, at least I´m not from Buenos Aires
yeah
but, ok, dude, what do you think about today´s subject?
ah, well, inequality
yes
well, I think this is the country where you can see more inequality
yes no
yes, you can notice that here immediately, definitely
hmm, is it very noticeable in Finex?
yes, yes, here it´s very common, who would think that being an immigrants state, totally near the border, but you can notice it and notice it a lot
Look, it's closer to the border with Mexico
Oh, yeah, I'm up from the border, it's a border state with Mexico
Oh, and it's filled with Mexicans and
mexicans, mostly Mexicans
and there are problems like that with  the americans, lets say, with people like
oh, well not at this point, but closer to the border, because i don't precisely live next to the border
sure
But closer to the border, and specially, i don't know, between any people that's of a different color to them, or different physical appearance, or different features
if they don't like it
and they at least tell you, and on top of that, they tell you that, uh, you go somewhere and then, i speak really bad English
right
and so, i go and then they say they don't speak mexican, so i tell them i don't speak Mexican language, the language is Spanish
And so it starts, i start fighting
sure
with my bad english, and i start fighting, i leave
but it's fine, it's good you fight with them, i think it's perfect
Yeah, i go around fighting, it makes me so angry if i don't let them know that Mexico is not a language, it's a country
Sure
oh, they're so lazy and bold
yeah, what a mess, it hasn't happened to me here, but the thin is that this is a very big city
is that mm
eh and I mean it has happened to me that they don't understand me but not that they tell me anything but also I think that it is because they are very used to it because
ah
there are people from everywhere here what you do see a terrible difference here I don't know if over there also you see it with the African Americans
mm
there's an anger
is that I think that
there's a terrible conflict that the African Americans are
but that's not is not just there I tell you that is everywhere
look at that
everywhere you go and there's an African American community eh they are are very resentful people that all they have lived in the course of
existence of their past and all right?
yes
so then they are very forewarned people
yes, yes very aggressive right? do you also see that over there?
they are people yes
they are they see you white and they treat you bad and then even worse they see that to top it off you don't speak English well and they hate you even more it's terrible
yes
I didn't have any problems with the white people but with the black people yes and nothing I have absolutely nothing against the race obviously they are
aha
But, uh, specially, not the americans, which are divine, but the African Americans are tremendous, they're, it has happened to me many times, that they get me wrong in a business or that
I don't know, that they deal with you without looking at you
Yes, yes, and, it's very resentful people
Yes
It's very resentful people, but i think that's because of t, i have always said that's because of what they have lived in their history
Yes
But instead of wanting to stand out in a good way, it's the people... where you go, they make scandals or yell, it's very messy, dirty people
Yeah, you see?, they yell, it's terrible because, lets say, you see them and you walk in a different direction, that's it,  it's not being racist
But i don't like people yelling, if i see them all gathered in one place, i go somewhere else
Even more, yes
And i obviously don't have problems with people of color, not at all,i love them, i think they're so much better than white people at sports
But to hang with these people, with that group of African Americans, they're terrible, and, well, here they are
Yes, yes, uh, uh, no, that's everywhere, yeah, but there in Philadelphia, you told me you were, uh, yes, there are more there, there are more
Yes, yes, in Philadelphia, there are lots of them here too because they are poor, all that poor black people, you also see them here, i don't know
Uh
What's the cause but
Well, that's everywhere, I'm telling you, that, like, like they underestimate themselves, so, later on they don't try to move on with things
positive things, but others, and of course i know a lot of black people that live in other places, and it's normal, i think
sure, yes, yes, for example, my boss's husband is black, and, but well, he's African, he came from Ivory Coast
And he's phenomenal, he's a very educated person, he's very nice, very smart, but he came from Africa
m
I believe this is a social problem, not a racial one, the one that they have here
yes, it's mostly social and hard feelings so, there are people that think that since they had to go through all that, they are owed something
sure
so, they don't have to struggle to get out, to advance, they feel like everything should be handed to them.
m you see people, you see immigrants that  come here one hand in their back and the other one in front of them, they come to see if there's something they can do
yes
and they work, work, work hard and they do well, they are not poor and you would think they are Americans.
mhm
they are poor but they work so hard and they do better
yes, if you go to Miami, oh, you can tell the difference with the blacks because they caused a lot of racial problems a long time ago
mhm
oh, and you do see lots of poverty and dust and mess
you see
and you say, well they want to feel socially rejected, they don't wan to live like that but they don't do anything to get out of that
sure
so, here in this country you can have everything
if you want, in t his country, you can have good
sure
or bad things economically but if you want, you can progress, I don't mean that you can become a millionaire but you can do well.
oh you can't study, you can look
yes
look for opportunities for many things, I'm unemployed at this moment and I'm going to the unemployment office
yes
and they're going to sponsor my study.
look
so I can get hired then it's a bunch of things
I also, I knew a girl she was Argentinian I didn't really know is a friend of my friend and my friend would tell me that this girl got pregnant here
an Argentinian girl and all and the state paid her studies for being a single mother and really good see so I can imagine the things there must be for the Americans
aha
and more for them that seem like a minority group that should have a thousand things to their favor
exactly
and however nothing
ah but is because I think I keep insisting they want to continue like that
yes that I mean one understands poor people what they went through wasn't nice and and nothing but that was a long time ago already now they could say well
we are already in another time right?
sure it already happened I mean the white people that are now are not the people that had slaves and they are not slaves either I mean that's it we are human beings we are all the same
I don't know
eh these days I was filling out some applications and I found very odd that the girl told me directly is not that the paper said it because
eh in the majority of the applications it says ethnic group
sure, yes
and, and there, she tells me, which race are you, I'm part of the human race but I thought her question was pretty silly, I got so mad
sure, yes, yes, yes
so, she looked at me and asked me where, and I was like, no, I'm a human being,oh, what race, I'm part of the human race, what ethnicity, what origin?
I'm Hispanic, oh I felt like, what is wrong with this bitch, well those are really stupid questions.
yes, they do ask you that a lot here, that had never happened to me before, to be asked what ethnicity do I have
and which race, which race
in the beginning, I didn't know what to answer because they give you several options, I don't know you can choose Latin, Hispanic, or white
yes
what do I know, I didn't know what to chose and now I always chose Hispanic, I've realized that I belong to that race.
that race, let me tell you, they come up with such silly things!
yes
I don't understand it
why are they using it for? I think that sometimes, companies have to have a certain percentage of employees of every type, right?
m
it's established in law, something like that.
you think? well, I don't know but that's a very particular way of approaching you, when they ask you, which race you are
it never happened to me
it did to me, and I laughed so hard, I said, thank you, I'm part of the human race.
sure, I'm
yes that sounds like the little animal here let' see the cattle
sure no
that's what it sounded like to me and I those things so I never eh in in Massachusetts never I lived before in Massachusetts
ah look near here
I lived five years in Massachusetts and my husband was laid off from the company where he worked and then we came over here because we were tired of suffering over there
ah yes and there where you are the weather is nice
yes ah wonderful this climate here is wonderful is very bad in June, July and August is an unbearable heat
and but here too
but but there's no humidity only the unbearable heat and there's no humidity is wonderful it's a wonderful climate ah incredible I love it
oh what's the temperature there now
right now is around sixty more or less, seventy
oh how awesome
it's nice and without humidity, there's never humidity here
sure
only when it rains and here it hardly rains
aha here the summer is terrible, the summer is heat, heat, but a lot of heat and humidity and in winter you die of cold
and is very humid aha that's how it is in Massachusetts there the summer is humid
sure
and the winter well the snow covers you up
sure
it's extreme and it's a winter for like six months because you see three months of fall where the cold is crazy
yes
you have three months of winter that extend almost to the end of spring and so you only have a very short summer and so
to go out and enjoy, no, there really isn't
sure, well here a little while ago
Good evening
Good evening.
This is Carlos speaking from Houston, Texas
Hi, How are you? this is Gabriela speaking.
Where are you calling from?
form Vancouver, Canada
Ah, OK
And you from where?
What do you think about today's topic? Eh, Houston, Texas
ah, very good, What nationalirty are you?
a, Puerto Rican
ah, I'm a Mexican national.
OK, What do you think about today's topic?
well very interesting
do you think, that you, do you think that there are many inequalities nowadays, or not?
well ah, well, eh eh, I feel that it's that in the whole society where they have to live together eh, different, eh cultures, it's a bit difficult. Eh, at any rate still eh, in a country where culture,
it's homogeneous and where there's not much diversity in any way of inequality it's ah, it's apparent, I think that it's something that ah, it exists in humanity since, for ever.
yes I think the same, I mean I think the same.
What do you think?
in everything, in any situation there is going to be some kind of inequality, either about race, gender, eh, religion, eh
mhm
alw- always, eh, I think it is a part of our human nature, I mean, so much diversity
That's right, I agree
there is so much diversity in the world that, well, there will always be, eh, room for, for these inequalities to happen, there will always be, eh, the fight for the power,
mhm
it is human nature, there is always a fight for the power
yes
this kind of inequality
That's right, and the best way to, to know it, to know the future is analyzing history, eh, along human history there
has always been inequality, it is the powerful and the, eh, the less powerful, the one in the bottom, and like you said it is all part of
human nature, because, well, I think that we are competitive, and since there is competition everybody wants his best
Do you think that this inequality is, somehow, alright?
alright?
I think that the fact that there is inequality doesn't mean
mhm
one person is going to be better than the other, eh, I'll explain myself, I think that
yes, yes
the fact of one person belonging to a minority
aha
because he is Spanish or because he is Afro-american, and i think that many, many minotities
yes
they think that the fact of being a minority, they don't deserve, or no, they don't fight enough to be able to out stand and have equality
yes
and have, or end up, in comparison with a Caucasian person, or have a better social position
Yes, I agree with you, it's like, maybe
eh
really inside them, but, I don't know, in my opinion, I think that we all have as a goal the right of opportunity and is good
I mean, I think we all have right
Sure
But, I think, but what I, in my opinion, in many occasions, minorities, don't try, don't fight
Mmm
but, what they might be, they
that's true
In what's
yes, I agree with you
I mean, many times, I see that the fact of being minorities, they don't try to fight, I mean, I live here in Texas
And I see, many Hispanics that live here
Mmm
and well, they have lived all their life in the United States and even then, they don't speak English
yes, that's true
and, these kinds of things are a bit annoying, I think that since
hmm
yikes, it's not so difficult, eh,
No, and besides, it depends on the age you can, on the age it was.  you can learn the language, and if you don't learn the language you're out of the competency because
how will you express yourself, how will you communicate.
yes, yes
and from there, from there you're disadvantaged.
exactly in how
I have to say some form comes for, hmm, well if there's some key, or something you can do for the issue of, the topic of inequality, this
I think that eh, the fact that there's always been inequality and there will always be inequality, eh, this doesn't mean that,
forms part of something that you have to accept as established and whatever.  Even like you say, there will be people who maybe aren't, aren't interested
to rise above it because they feel that, that they can't, or maybe that a community or minority or race, or whatever, is inferior.
so, but, I think that in any way, diversity is necessary, eh, it's established by the same naturalness, for evolution, but well, it's also the free will to decide what side you want to be on.
but the same, like, and, it also corresponds to those, those in the minority.  Eh, and to say, like, if a person says,
hmm
eh, I don't think that, a person of Hispanic race, should have this position, let's say it's a company, eh,
hmm
that's completely Hispanic, eh, well,
aha
they will say to say, we don't want an, any Anglo-saxon to come and work here.
mm
eh, well, in in that there's also like discrimination, from the minority against minority.
mm
and or likewise that the discrimination of saying, eh, we don't want Hispanics, or we don't want a woman in this position.
aha
eh, but is, it would be, is hard to be able to fight it in in, against in that regard, I mean, to prove that a company to say it like that, has
aha
reasons for discrimination either for the sex, sexual orientation, religion.
yes, yes
They are cases that are extremely hard to prove
Yes is true, but
in, in the eyes of justice
But I think that, that in this case, the persistence, in other words not giving up. the, look for opportunities some place else, in another place,
and, and look that the persistence, has made the difference, we the women, for example right now that you mentioned the fact that there's discrimination because in, in some
companies they think, that a woman doesn't have the same ability, well eh, little by little, women have been gaining ground in that aspect and proving that, with
well, well, well
Hello
Hello, good evening.
Good evening.
My name's Maira, What's your name?
Eh, Nicolas
Okay.  Where are you calling from?
From Pennsylvania.
Okay.  Me, Philadelphia too.
And you?  Ah, what's up, how are you?
Fine, here.
Good good.
To
Eh, what's up?
Well nothing, What was the title about, equality?
Aha yes, Hey, do you studying at the University of Pennsylvania?
yes
Where are you from?
From Mexico.
Are you Maira from Mexico?
yes
I'm Blanchet my queen.
You're Blanchet?
yes
Oh lying. What are are you doing?
Well nothing. They gave me this when I got here, it was worth it. It's great right.
yes, it's super good. I sent a mail. You never saw it? I thought that none of the Mexican were home. Only Arturo.
Oh no
Ah, yes is perfect. Is that since you never told me your name, you always told me to call you Blanchet.
Ah yes
to know boy.
So how are you, good good.
Fine here. What did you do on the weekend?
This
giving the break
The break I went to Mexico. I was there a couple of weeks, ah, super enjoyable, and you?
Ah how nice. I was also more or less there and in, where else, I was there in, Charcatecas, in Guadalajara and
No I mean, you spent it super great my queen.
Well yes, it wasn't bad at all.
Ah how cool, listen, what envy.
Great, I saw the family and all that, like that like right.
Aye yes, really important honestly.  yes, that's what I wanted to return to.  Besides, did you go to the exam that they had on the last day of class?
So until the twenty first of December?
Aha
So yes it was really hard hey.  But that God I had the opportunity to return and I had a really good time there.  Honestly
I had a, still, on the twenty second. But it's been a year that I wanted to do it.  But no, I'm leaving.  I hope it goes well
And it stopped.  It didn't happen, I have to do this week.
Ah, wow.  And what's up, and did you have to be there for vacations or what?  You already knew really well.
You need to be studying, seriously, everything
That's really cool
I'm do- I'm doing the things to get a job.
Ah, ah, this is true.
Totally, Hmmm
This is really true, girl.
It's like this.
Hey, and how's the inequality?
The truth is that I'm not paying much attention to it.  What did they say?  That
They said that, something about inequality, in the United States, about race, and if you think that it's something that can be solved or not.
Ah
It's like Mexico, honestly.  I said, it's, they say that it can, honestly, it's something impossible.  I say, the people will never do it.
No, besides I think that here in the United States you feel it, no, particularly.
yes, it feels great
Everybody can't stop thinking about these things. If you decide something, if these are black, if these are, and so on. I am surprised
If you arrive to a city, ans, eh, the population is divides between the colored and the non colored, an so on
yes
Then it is very marked, honestly
But above all
What about the gringos?
the United States is made of, its population is made of immigrants, so I am surprised that still they discriminate ones and the others. I mean there is nobody American
That's right
Specially, they keep talking about the foreigners, and the, but no, they are all foreigners, I don't understand. But, I think that here in Philadelphia you can notice it much more, than in other places
And
than in other cities
The community, the black community here in Philadelphia is huge. You enter the University
Hm mm
and that is no longer seen. I mean, it's like another world
yes
Mm
Have you also noticed it here? Because inside the University it is the same. All the works, let's say, of low range, they are always
they are for them
and when you find something related to administration, no matter how low it is, here in the University, I think I would do anything
Aha
when you deal with one who's a bit higher than the others,
Aha
it's always white.  The stupider you see, it's always white.
This is true
There's a lot of that stuff here, like they do it until the university. Well it's not, like, it seems that it's the way of working here.  I don't really understand what happens.
yes, it's a fee, honestly, it's this fee.
But this bothers me a lot.  When I came for the first time, when I came three years ago,
Hmmmm
I saw, and I couldn't believe it.  Like, I never thought that I would feel it so much.
So marked, yes.  Well if you go there in Mexico
Besides
and identify with people who are foreign, I say.  And more in the city, but here they say that people really strongly reject you, well no.
Like, obviously there's rejection, and there always will be.  It's something that I say that will never be solved
Hmmmm
but also as marked as it is here, this you don't see.  You don't see it much.
it's more like they shouldn't be related to money, no.
Yeah, yeah, everything has to follow with wool.
because the darker you are, if you have money, well, you don't have a problem.  Everyone treats you well.
yes, this is very true.
I don't know.
It's rough.
Oh, how are you doing in your classes? yes, the university, life here
I'm doing fine, fine, hey, I have a lot of engineering subjects, hey.
you do?
I mean, I don't have a lot of time to do anything else, I could take a writing seminar this semester, which was something
cool, right, it's like a hobby
Okay
but everything else is, I'm now taking a mechanical engineering course and physics and chemistry and math, the usual stuff
Hm mm
Well yes, I'm doing fine. I'm holding on, I believe that this semester, I hope I do better because I didn't do that well in the last semester
Well, it's your first semester.
It's the same, I haven't done good in any semesters to be honest, I mean
yes
I always get a low grade in one subject and that lowers my GPA, it doesn't matter if it was, let me tell you, I wouldn't mind if it was outside
Aha
but it lowers my GPC, but I mean, I've now resigned myself to think, oh well, at least I can do other things to
Well yes
to justify it, well, I didn't do well
yes, and it's a tough university, honestly, it is. I mean, it's not one in which you go and say, oh well, I don't know
study your degree in commu, I don't know, in communication science in sweeper. I mean, don't. No my queen, here it is very tough. The issue
And more because of the competition, oh crap.
Ah
Is cheap.
I'm shocked eh. And imagine that here there's no much competition, I mean in engineering is not so hard than others.
Like in, like in Wharton.
So, I don't know what rubbish they do one to another,
Oh well, that's true. So if you go to ~MIT there it is but
there is, there is people
I mean, they want you dead, don't they. I say, that m- I honestly say I couldn't live in an environment like that. But I have had great times here. And more now that we are, we are involved in rushing
yes
about brotherhoods
Ah, which one you are in, in which rushing?
Fuck, I went to a good, I went like, that I all, I just came back from dinner, and I'm waiting to get dark to go out again.
OK
Yes, fuck. I don't know. I like the idea a lot. Because there are a lot that can be part of the, of the brotherhood and do not change until
when you want. So live a year, or six months, and you can be there until your senior year if you want
Hm mm
Then I like that. Because I don't want to live there the next semester.
Okay. The houses are very ugly. I don't like them. But if you can avoid living there, is ok, right?
Oh, that is true. Oh, There is one we went recently, that is, it is called the castle,
Aha
the one that is there, eh, besides the One college hall it is great.
That is great, that is very good. Even the parties they have there are cool.
yes, yes yes. There is like if I don´t know. I liked that one very much
Cool.
And what about you, How are you doing, fine fine?
I´m fine. Quiet. A lot of engineering ended. I would like to know when I will take some others I like, another classes, I think I am not going to do it. And right now I´m only doing campus recruiting
well that of, lets see what happens, I don´t have idea, the truth
yes
Hm hmm, is that, is very competitive. You feel that is like everything is because of, people from Wharton really work much more
than us to find jobs.
yes, it is that way.
yes, so, I am still with all, I have all for companies presentations, I cannot go, because I have classes.
That is.
So I have classes all the day, it is not nice. Then, well I don´t know, lets see. what happens, maybe something happens. And if not, I´ll stay here
yes that is great. yeah. I what, What I wanted to do was a dual degree But I need a super GPA and it is
something like an impossible thing the damn one - GPA is very difficult
What surprise me that there are people who do it eh.
and if there is a good, it is the worst, they ask you for a three point five, and as soon as you get the three point five,
but there are three hundred who have three point eight.
Ah yes
And I say, those who come in first are these three hundred before you.  So yes this is like
But here not the grade
Ugly
What do you want to do it in?
Well, yes, I'm, I don't know if I will do it with the astronomy and physics department, with the College
Oh wow.
Or in finance.  But I really like the astronomy option, wow.  It seems really cool.  But it's also really hard to get in.  They have a lot of requirements.
But you do this well.  Until then you don't have a lot of subjects, no.  I think that at best it will be easier.  I think that it doesn't even have six, to
No, but like, I would take two, no more than two or three subjects in astronomy and then I would specialize in physics.  But this, it would be with this department.
So they give me the option to, to take these three subjects, and
Oh
the rest with physics.  yes, astronomy is really small here.  There's isn't even a major or a minor in astronomy.
Hmmmmm Wow.
yes, it would be mixed with physics there.
That's really interesting, and you end up learning a lot of things.
yes, like I don't want to wait like this with my degree because maybe in the end I'll finish doing mechanics, and I'll change to something else,
Aha
I don't know what will happen.  I feel really insecure about what I want.  I need to spend more time and see what, see what I like the most and what I don't, because I'm like this, like how I don't know.
I need to put my feet on the ground for a moment.
Okay, you don't have to know yet.
Well yes there's still time, is what, is what worries me.
Okay, you have years and years to see what you do.
yes, besides all that I'm taking now, are like very general subjects,
Hm mm
So then that facilitates the movement a lot as far as my, my major
Okay
Then about that I don't have much of a problem. But yes, listen, there we are. And who will, will there be a Mex gathering at Penn soon?
yes, this week, we are seeing if Thursday or Friday.
In other words, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow?
yes
In other words tomorrow. Just send me a mail.
And is that they called me, they already called me here is, well is good, very good, Luly and I sure, if they call me we'll do it Thursday, and I say, oh okay, if you want send a mail.
And yes, they said that well yes, they haven't sent it, but maybe if we don't send it, if we do it during the weekend, what do you think, during the weekend people will come right, it'll be laid back.
yes, super laid back.
Maybe Sunday, something like that, the other day we decide, and then we'll send it, and for Thursday let's see how it goes.
To see what we do there. Let's see if we do a, let's see if we go eat to that restaurant that's on second street that they say is super good.
yes, there's several. We can do one of those. There's several restaurants that are very good.
yes, listen, something like that, because today.
Oh,I think that
I can't stand the food here, it's so bad
Listen Sebastian told me they were going to do community living
Oh, yes, I think we'll do it next year
So..
The next semester, yes, here in Harrison
Very good, very good, how many are you?
Eh, we would be about ten, I guess
Wow
Yes, since we live here, we'd rather stay. So we better try before they take us out and end up living in Kings Court
which I don't think would be a good idea
Hello, I'm Manuel.
Honey
How are you?
Fine, here in Florida.
Ah, me too. Um,
And-
Then, let's talk a bit about the topic. Right?
the equality in the United States.
yes.
Well, being a female, I tell you there's no equality in the United States.
That there isn't?
There isn't
Okay, aha.
I particularly see at my job daily.
Aha.
The attitude towards the Latin, I don't find it has changed too much.
Okay
I find that it's the same, if not worse.
Look, okay.
There's too much stereotype as far as, you know, especially what nationality you are, in Latin.
Ah, very good.
them, I see it a lot with, how can I explain, with the, eh, Dominicans.
Aha
this, the Mexicans.
Yes.
you know, I see it a lot.  Because where I work, yes there are Latinos.
There are lots of Latinos.
and, yes, unfortunately, the problem is that the company we represent needs their services because much of their clientele is in Spanish.
for that reason it's cheaper to employ a person that is bilingual.
Hhm.
than an American person that doesn't know Spanish, because, you know, they couldn't take the calls.
Of course.
And, I see the treatment and I see the reaction of my colleagues who are American.
Toward the Lations.
Exactly and the comments.
Hhm.
You know, you hear comments all the time, that how many Latino people are they going to keep hiring.
Hhm.
that this is ridiculous, that right now they are the minority, but they don't grasp the fact that one person is doing the work of two for the pay of one.
Hhm.
Do you understand? I see that too between Hispanics,
Sure.
oh, we here have lots of Venezuelans, Mexicans, two or three Colombians and a pair of Puerto Ricans.
Mhm.
And there's racism between them.
Mhm.
it's something that makes you say like, wow, still? Those divisions are supposed to have disappeared, lets not even talk about differences between men and women
Mhm.
But, just because of that, being Hispanics, I don't think we've progressed much.
Sure,  there are, so, do you also believe in? Wait a minute, oh, that there's more inequality between, above all, because of a people's origin?
And for their sex
and for their sex, isn't it?
In the company I work for, unfortunately, if you are a woman, I can guarantee you that you wont' go far
Oh, that's right, isn't it?
You know, they, mm,
Oh, it's true, we have companies here that have been sued because of that, right?
yes, they don't take those things into consideration.
Like, for example, how, no? If they are sued, why don't they oppose the work discrimination against women.
That's kind of true, in a certain way, I also understand, their point of view, do you understand? Women, in general, they are responsible for their children,
and the opposite sex, they might have children but they don't have the,
Is not here.
generally, the priority of having of being an employed father versus employed mother.
Ah. Aha.
You know that from the point of view of the company, I can understand it up to a certain extent. What I'll never understand is that, You understand me?
it's penalized for having them at the priority where they have to have it, although I do understand that the company has to see it from the point of view of production.
Mm. yes,
A mother, the probability of being absent more than a father is higher.
Mm. It should be,no, mm.
You know, there are very few fathers who are single raising their kids,
Sure.
versus the mothers that are single, that have their kids, that they have to care for, that on top of that, have to work the hours. And, even if they are not single, it could be that they are married.
But at the time a kid gets sick, or that anything happens,
Per-
I mean, generally is the mother who has to go running, go get him at wherever he's being taken care of,
Sure, there it mixes, well, a gender inequality, with a work inequality. Right?
Is more or less, is a combination.
Mm.
Those are the things they take into consideration at the time of hiring you, supposedly they shouldn't ask you the question during an interview, but they do ask it.
Sure.
And what are you going to do? Are you going to sue them because you know, you told them you have kids?
They ask you when they shouldn't ask, so, Right?
By law, in the United States they shouldn't.
But, it's done. Right?
But, I, personally, have gone to interviews, and they have clearly asked if I'm single, married, and who would take care of my kids if they get sick.
Sure, and they shouldn't do it, so, Right?
No, it's prohibited, it's a federal law. But, What are you going to do?
yes. Sure, well, they can't.
Let's see. Who are you going to go to and say, look, in this interview
aha.
they asked me this question, I answered honestly, and all of a sudden, well, the position is filled
Mm Mm
You know, How do you prove it?
There, you're right. No?
It would be your word against the person who interviewed you, judge, and I, never asked that question.
Aha.
You know that, I have seen it
But, that the question is asked, I do know it's asked. Right? when it's said they shouldn't.
I tell you that it's a law. It's prohibited in an interview, to ask that question, that's the same as asking if you are a homosexual or straight. Do you understand me?
Sure, mm. Mm. Mm
One thing should not have anything to do with the other. But they do it. And, I personally have gone through that.
of course
you know, I don´t believe equality is present in the USA.
There are many inequalities in many parts of the U.S.
legality and equity are right?
Mhm
they always penalize and criminalize the immigrant figure right?
I´m sorry I cannot heard you very well.
I think it's a negative stereotype of the immigrant right?
yes. how can i explain this you know I have family from the Dominican Republic.
Mhm
I am Puerto rican. Thank god I didn´t have to go through the process of obtaining a visa.
Mhm Mhm
but I have family that have been through that process
Mhm
I have relatives who have gone through all that and then you know you have to go through a lot and also have no rights
Mhm, yes
I have seen the abuse  you know that if they did those things to me I could claim my rights
Mhm
only because I am a citizen, you know you have to go through that process, they are trying to become citizents
of course
You know, and people, in general, mm, adopt a very negative attitude. They have the point of view that they are coming here to take their jobs, that
and they just can't realize, can't know the truth, They are not taking them any job, because any American can apply for that same job
and he'll be given it
Exactly, right?
But, they don't want to go to a farm to harvest oranges, for
Sure, that's true, I think it's the point of view of somebody who has little education, right? If he really thinks, I mean if he is really convinced that an immigrant will take his chances, right?
eh, if you knew, this opinion is, is very, very common
MHm
Even from people that I, let me tell you, I hear that in my job all the time and I stare at them, because they are so ignorant
They won't be that, that, that intelligent, then, right?
So, and they are educated people who are doing the comments. Do you understand? They are not ignorants who haven't gone to school or who know nothing about life
They are people who, mm, chorus the common voice
Mhm
The adopt an attitude without knowing, because they haven't been through the situation nor know anyone who has been through that experience
Mhm
And, and, it's sad, because I don't know, and specially it's sad for the Mexican
Mhm
who are, as far as I have seen, the most marginalized
Here in Florida
in Florida
Mm.
You know, and you say that you are Mexican, and everyone assumes that you are picking fruits somewhere,
Mm, yes
especially here where I live, that you have all the farms, and, Do you understand me?
Aha.
I see it often, and, you stay looking at these people like, and if they are women, they think the only thing they're good for is to clean houses.
Mm.
And it's a shame, because I know many people that are prepared. And many times, because of the language limitation, they can't find jobs in other things.
Really?
And, I'm talking about having studied in their country, and they have a title.
yes, well, no, that's the problem of the, it's based many times on, on the legal rights that they can have.
Mm.
And since those are close, they have to
And the language. You understand me? if, if you are not bilingual and understand English perfectly, you are very limited.
Mm, also
But, you know, nor, not for, the assumption.
Mm.
I mean, I had a supervisor at a job, that told me, that I shouldn't be talking in Spanish.
Mm.
And, I looked at her, and I told her, look, well, regretting the case, that's why they hired me.
Mhm.
And, unfortunately, you can't be offended because of that, this is my native language, that's the one I speak and sometimes, it is easier for Latin people to communicate in their own language than to try to translate it into English, specially if one of its colleagues, you know, is
you know, barely, like they say, starting to  learn the language.
Mhm.
And she's like, I know a way, you know, in which you could understand it up to a certain point, but only up to a certain point, right.
Exactly, right?
Because, you can't force that person to speak the way they find it easier
sure.
You know, instead of becoming shy, I know they are speaking, lots of things are involved and you are like
that's stupid, but they cause some problems within the workplace.
Sure, it also causes lots of abuses, right? Like, how, or they make some comments that are not well intended.
Yes, No, if you go to a supervisor and tell him, look this supervisor told me this and that, well you are always the one to blame.
Mhm.
I mean, you are causing trouble and that's not, I understand that you shouldn't be like that, it's not right, I don't understand you know, if it was them the ones that were speaking French or German or some other language, I don't think the reaction would be the same.
That's right. Exactly, yes, oh well.
Do you understand? I believe that we also have other coworkers that speak in Italian and I think, I find it, funny.
yes.
but, you can't speak in Spanish because they get mad.
Sure, they don't like you
I mean, I'm like, what's the difference?
Spanish, nor in, probably, nor in Chinese.
Excuse me.
They wouldn't like it that you speak in Spanish, nor in, nor in Chinese, probably.
No, that's the funny thing, there are two people that speak a,
But if it was a European language, yes Right?
one that speaks, um, Portuguese, and one that speaks Italian. If they reverse to their language, there's no comment. Whereas the Spanish, well, then they are, their faces mounted, and, and the attitudes.
Mm.
And, in my understanding, well, I understand that, is a form of racism.
No, yes, it is, well, no. I mean, if you, you that are American and have lived  here all your life, you know that there's racism in your country. Right?
You know, you stay like, and my,
Like there is in many places. Right?
my son has experienced it, and he's a kid.
Mm.
I mean, he came from school, and he told me he had classmates that, that he couldn't talk to his classmates, because the classmates didn't talk to him because he was brown.
Mm.
And, and I had to tell him, I said, well, my love, is that you are not supposed to be white.
Mm.
Where are you going to be white from? Your parents are not white. Your grandparents are not white.
Mm.
I mean, you have nowhere from where to come out white, and it's not meant for you to be white, and that's of kids.
Sure, there's no need.  No?
Like, this is what they hear at home.
yes.
Because, you put it in all the kids that
hello my name is Miriam
hello
yes good evening my name is Miriam
hello my name is Mauricio, how are you?
fine thanks
have you already participated?
pardon
have you already participated?
yes yes I've already participated
oh how nice, well the topic is equality right?
yes equality how is the equality in the United States
okay, aha
there's a lot of inequality, right?
yes I think there's inequality and I think that it's not only in the United States there's inequality in the whole world
yes, but you like you feel it more in the United States in what way
depends eh there's although they talk a lot about equality, of opportunity and all the truth is that is no is not equal I mean there's no equality
aha
I've seen it for example for the Hispanic right?
aha
I don't see that there's equality and eh also there's an equality that I say that when they talk about equality for example with the homosexuals, you understand me? then eh
there's no equality with the homosexuals
no I think, I think that here there is
how is that
as far as, as far as for them but
okay
but, but let's say within the freedom within the freedom but well is bad right? but as far as equality as far as Hispanics I think that there's really no equality there's no equality and there
okay
there's a certain type of inequality
and and but who would be the, the ones who make the equality
in in
who the employers, the government, how do you see it
the people, I think that the people
the white people or the colored people
the people in general yes the American
okay
the American and I think that to a certain extent you're right you're right to a certain extent because
why
well eh they've come to let's say invade their land, invade their house and apart from that they have brought a certain amount of different culture which affects, really affects the country
ah
so then I think that to a certain extent they have the right to feel like that
but remember that eh eh  North America is a country of immigrants
yes and
because they themselves immigrated from another place
yes, but and the
the American comes from Europe
yes but the the and the the
they displaced the race eh the natives that may have been eh may have been whatever old
no no but but but
partner
but at the end they are already here, this is their land so it doesn´t matter where they come eh eh this land is theirs and this is their home
but regarding equality well as human beings we are all equals and we are equal before God but the reality is that in the world there is not, there is not equality
if there were equality there were not wars if there were equality there were not problems between countries
yeah
that is what I think it could be that now everybody has the freedom to have more or to have least, lets say that we cannot go farther because each one
has that freedom, has his freedom right? then I I think there is not equality that it is a problem of the humanity not just a problem in the United States
in all the country if you are Hispanic
yes that is true because since the ancient times from the beginning of history man always tried to dominate man, the weaker
yes of course, and it will always be like that
right? it will always be like that because the
but there is freedom too you can elaborate your own course, right? but there will always be inequalities that does´t have, that is irreversible
oh there's always going to be inequality, some will have more than others
I see
always
and, so, you think that problem has no solution?
mm well, it does but it's complicated because, how can you, how can you do something to have the same things as your neighbor does, do you understand, you have someone beside you and how do you do it so that you have the same or what can he do to have the same things as you do?
I mean, no government is going to pass a law or make you believe that
you can have a government that can equal men in terms of food.
mm
I mean, are you talking about physical stuff or also about the
no, no, but when a government tries to create consumism
I see, but it didn't, it didn't
it hasn't worked, no, it hasn't worked, the result has been the same
and don't you think that the Bible says that one must think of God because God is always promising us paradise
yes
and do you think one should wait for
mm, well, if we are going to talk about the Bible, God always says that we are going to have poor people among, there's always going to be poor people, I mean, when he said that, it's because they are going
while the boyfriend is away, while the boyfriend is away he doesn't see Jesus
while, while
when you have a boyfriend you should enjoy it, something like that, there will always be poor people
yes, always, there's always going to be inequality, one  person is going to be fat and the other one is going to be thin, inequality, how can we equal a black person and a white one
so eh, equality let's say in the end that you will always have more money than the other, sure, how we make this equal, we will have to see
equality in terms of what I think that here in this country
no but I think that the question refers more to being unequal in the sense that I think that it refers more to discrimination and if there's discrimina-
and if there's inequality so how you suffer the fact that it's unequal
well look, this is a problem for all of humanity
and how can it be solved
and yes if we go there, then the Hispanic person also discriminates against the American
yeah
yes, or no?
I don't know, I've never been in the United States
yes, they discriminate because they speak badly, they complain about them
but there's a second, true, there's a second language in the United States, some states the second language is Spanish, right
aha
and where do you live exactly?
I'm in Charlotte
where?  and where is this?
in Charlotte in North Carolina
ah, and there are many Hispanics there
uh, there's almost more Hispanics than Americans, no lie, and where are you?
I live in Toronto, Canada
ah being in Canada's okay
yeah but in Canada they say there's a lot of discrimination, or you know when, when it was a very pretty government, a socialist government
yes
but here about ten years ago let's say, but it's been changing a lot now they say a lot, a lot of people tell me it's like there is this eh
yes sure
discrimination, there's a lot that they're already noticing
yes, yes
even though they try to hide it there are a lot white people that are getting together, they are separating they look, with a little bit of disdain for other people
yes sure because it's that
and they are killing poverty even more
still they feel invaded but if we went to Latin America and it's the same they would still complain about Americans you understand, this is a problem that's not just in the United States
that's it eh what country are you from?
I'm from Peru
Peru, I'm Colombian, the time in Colombia, the time in Peru, the time in Chile eh eh eh
or Colombian here
in any case, in any case everywhere there's going to be this problem because if you look Latino Americans complain about Americans more today
we complain but it's because they haven't, they haven't taken a whole lot
a notice of good well that's the the
they have looted us too much, they have exploited us
a bother, some news now is that Hugo Chavez wants to plant this certain idea that he's make an alliance with the presidents in in in Latino America and everything is counter
he Hugo Chavez is that the one from Venezuela?
he is Venezuelan, yes
and he's making an alliance with whom
he he with the presidents of
of South America
eh Latin America, of South America
for what, alliance for what?
well he always goes against the Yankee imperialism as he calls it
oh I see, I see because then Chavez is of a socialist tendency, right?
yes of course
right? I mean he the have wanted to get him out I think a couple of times and hasn't been able to
no no no
to Hugo Chavez they even tried to give him a failed coup, a failed coup d'etat
yes it's exactly and that also because inequality
but but
and and for example we go there and the inequalities because he has given let's say like that a hard time to the rich people
it looks like it
and he's in favor of the poor people according to what one reads in the news
but there will always be look, you can't please anybody I tell you because
ah well because of that
because many people that are not rich ah eh in Venezuela, but people who were middle class, say that middle class is the most fucked is the most fucked
because the middle class, says that they complaint about Hugo Chavez because they say that they were fine and now with his measures there is not work and there is inflation and so many things
then he affected with his measures he has affected not only the rich but the middle class too and many of them have come here and they complaint about the
yeah like that yes of course, then it is that way I think that it is not only a problem in the United States because if you are not in the United States imagine that
no but The United States is a world power
eh but it is a problem aha yes of course, yes
everybody talks about it and always even want you or not always aware of what is happening there
yes exactly but it is an excellent country and it worries about freedom but I I am Hispanic and I also see that sometimes they have the reason about discrimination
when there is that jealousy I think that that, it could be normal
oh
it can be normal can be normal because we are invading the land of another
oh I didn´t know it was like that I thought it was
Hello.
Hello, hello, hello.
Hello, hello, hello.
yes. How are you? Who's speaking?
Maria from
What are you doing?
in Philadelphia.
Hello Um, How are you?
And who are you?
I'm Federico.
From where?
Eh, I'm from Philadelphia. Certainly.
Ah, you were born in Philadelphia.
Eh, yes. What do you think of inequality?
Why do you speak Spanish? Eh,
What do you think of inequality, jerk?
Eh, is that there's no inequality.
Eh?
There's no inequality, we are all the same.
What do you mean there's none? We are all the same, but there are people that say that no.
So, well, then I think, I think that in this country there is no inequality
And what do you think about people who says no?
Ah, eh, well, that people is wrong
You see, it's easier
Do you think that for being, eh, white for instance, or other things, eh, you can be more than the others?
Absolutely, yes, yes. I mean, it's not that way
What do you think?
yes, I think that, well, it's all part of a wrong concept, from the foundations
What is the foundation?
And the foundation is that, mm
Oh, yes?
the foundation is always another. No, because the foundation is to believe that, mm, that, well, not knowing what you are
So, if you knew what you are, you would realize that the differences with the others are so small that they are meaningless. But you have to know what you are
You know what I mean?
Sure
The, the, the, our concept, eh, mm, occidental, catholic, jewish, chritian, whatever you call it, tells you that you are, unique, and you, you area product of God, the son of God, and some other silly things. So
you, mm, you, mm , I mean, that only increases egoism, I mean, the fact of feeling unique, the only one, of feeling
that you are something, and that push you away from reality. In fact we are no more that another living thing that breathes, walks, eats and shits, in this life, and
with very little differences with the others
It's being done
And that includes, it includes another animals, but, well, what do I know, there's people that still believe that they are born from a chicken and some think that
Well and that is part of their religion, right?
yes, sure, exactly, yes, I mean, it's ignorant.
Exactly.
And well, so, I believe that they should educate people, educate
sixteen century, around that time.
to teach the other people like we teach ourselves.
yes, yes, yes, a religion.
And well, there's no, no other solution. That's the, the basis of inequality.
yes.
Well, I tell them, nowadays in the United States, inequality is not between races origins, color or things like that. Inequality is
on education, I mean, if you are poor, you will die poor. If I go out and I'm a great basketball player, then you are saved.
Sure.
And if you are rich, you are going to be rich your whole life, you go to rich people schools, you have wealthy friends, you earn a lot, and you'll die
poor and that's inequality, there's no other way, it's not, I mean, it's the same, but, oh well, the poor, the poor, I mean, the wealthy and the poor, they make them feel that
it's good to be wealthy. So,
Sure.
oh, the rich people are happy and the poor people are dreaming about being rich. But, I don't know, there's people from so many many cultures, there's, there's, there's
there are other reasons to live for and they tell you that it doesn't matter if you are not rich, or if you are not wealthy, the fact is that people
oh, in life, they, they give up their material possessions and live an apparently happy life, right? Without material stuff.
yes, and many people also think that, what you have and what you don't have.
Well, of course.
To, right?
Oh well.
Oh?
For example, the difference is in the knowing, it's in, the, the, the, the, in the, in the real knowledge.
yes, right?
So, and oh well, but, how each head is made up
Also
we don't know what, what to think, inequality.
No, I want
What is inequality?
to talk about inequality, in fact, the word inequality,
No, well, inequality between people.
No, well, and what about that, that they came, right?
I don't know, why is someone is born in a family with certain resources and then
And well, so, it's part of
they can go to the university and you can do a doctorate and you can come to the United States and you can do whatever you want
and some other, oh, mm you live in, they are stuck. Oh, the parents, the mother is seventeen years old and they don't know who the father is.
They are addicts and he, he faces violence everyday and they end up in jail, they become drug addicts, and they end up being shot dead.
and well, these are cult- basic.
This is the difference.
And, I don't know.  Like, what did you tell me?
No, well, that, that
The last,
that, like you asked, that for you, like, where is the difference?
Ah.  You have, this cultural question.  Cultural and religions, and it's lasting, apparently.  Because the people who, the rich people are educated to become more rich,
In their majority.
And they want to educate people.
And, the poor people can't be inserted with the rich because they're already poor.
Sure, but the problem, is that there's a sub-message, a subliminal message that says that, like, the idea is that people
poor people believe that the only way to be happy is to be rich.  It's having a car, or having a house, or
Aye, well.
and well, so,
This is cultural, this isn't
No, it's good, for this.
It's ugly.
besides, I see it more in this country where there's a consumerist culture, it's so inserted in our city, where everything is to consume, everything is to consume, everything is to spend, everything is
to have, eh,
yes, more or less in the end, in big.
What?
Maybe the women
Sure, the biggest, the most, eh,
yes, yes, yes. That's why the last,
yes, yes, That's it.
yes, I already know.
What do I know? I don't know, How are the inequalities in your country?
Is in Argentina,
are there inequalities?
yes. There are inequalities, there are inequalities. But, no, they are not so, for me they are not as marked as they can be.
They are not so marked.
No, I mean,
But, And there's no racism?
yes, of course. But.
There's no, there's no xenophobia against the Paraguayans, the Bolivians, the Peruvians?
yes, no Sometimes
in the, I think there's a lot.
really?
yes, I think that in Argentina there's a lot.
This of, you need it?
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
Beautiful. I don't know You are seeing it, but you don't, don't see a limit
And, yes.
with that.
Is like that, I mean, yes I'm of origin, I mean, if you have some native blood, eh, and you screw up, the first thing you are, you are black shit.
is well.
And well, and, and there. I don't know? You were driving a car, and got distracted, and the one that was, eh, the one that was driving next to you, screams black shit
They don't scream prick or jerk, or nothing.
Well, but that also
Then, me blond, was blond shit. Or not?
okay, well, then it's good.
yes, but there we are.
Okay, okay, okay, I'm not saying that it's not. But, by there, comes that habit that the blacks are resentful. Because they don't have what the rich ones have. they are poor.
No, that, that, that of resentment is
Ah, that' true. You can notice that, you can see it.
that,
yes, because also, they also tell you, they say, of shit they tell you too, I've heard many times.
the
Rich shit I've also heard many times from, from other people. When you go to Miramar and the ones from Miramar were fighting with the coastal ones, and it was the shit.
And it does hurt the feelings, that is
the, that's where resentment arises.
I don't know, I mean, obviously, it's racism and it is racism because they feel undervalued.
Sure, that's why, no, but that's one, it's their reaction, yes.
Mhm.
I mean, it's like a reaction to all of that, I mean, that wouldn't happen if there wasn't a reason for it,  I mean, action and reaction.
Oh yes, the action when you push something, the energy that it has on you, that's the reaction. If you don't push it, you don't have that reaction. It's the same in this case.
yes.
I mean, it's a reaction that you are having. That's the social reaction that took place because you discriminate them and then, the other person feels discriminated and he feels bad,
so, what does he do? And well, he joins other and they come after you.
What about that!
That's it, and well,
That's fine but, what do I know?
Don't you agree with that?
Many times, you feel discriminated.
How?
Lots of times they don't discriminate. Or, or, I don't know, you know, what do I know? It's like they discriminate themselves, they make mistakes, at all.
Well, but there's a, a social reason.
Well, obviously, sure.
There's a social issue, the boy takes a look in the mirror and he sees that he's black, right? and then he turns on the television and all he sees is white people!
Do you think they feel bad about that? There are no, I mean, he, there aren't, well, in Argentinian television, there are no
Oh but
blonds, no, there are not, not all of them are white, how?
it's all funny.
No, no, no. Come on.
it's
and the publicity is calm, yes, the publicity in all the, milk, the mineral water, whatever it is.
It always has blond people, white people, a model, I mean, a, a, a guy from the earth.
The
No, sure, it's not a, it's not an average Argentinian, that's what I'm saying. It's an Argentinian that is part of
Oh, that's fine.
of a superior class, about ten percent o the, if not more, in terms of
Ah, good afternoon, John, from New York.
Miriam, from Florida
Hey how's it going Miriam, how are you?
Fine, and you?
Fine, how's everything down there?
Hot, hot
yea? That's great, because I'm going there in, well, in two- I'm going there in less than two weeks.
Yea oh
Yea
And it's, and what do you think of social security in the United States?
Well, I think that uh, uh that it s- no, no, it hasn't been bad, no, it's helped a lot and they have it pretty well organized because my grandparents uh they came from Cuba
uh, they were able to use it. My mom's now retired,
Hm mm
she's used it. And n- no, she hasn't been bad, but it needs a few changes. They need some fixes for the medicines because uh,
Medicare
yea yea, me- medicare the, medicines are really expensive, and, and so there are times when your insurance doesn't cover your medicine. And so- or they don't cover it all, and they're really expensive.
But I only have
Hm mm yea but they say they say that this, that for example, in a few more years that money won't even be there, and all the money they've taken from us
Yea
this, n- it's not going to be there anymore.
No, i don't think so, i don't think that, i honestly don't think that's
Ok, ok, we're not having it anymore
Right, even though they've said it, and they've... but i think that, they're gonna do things, uh, with the, the new people that are going into the
in the, the system, the work system, to support the system, right?, and i think that, god permit
Uh huh
But at the same time, we should be a little bit more responsible for our own destiny, right?, so i think that
Uh huh
partially, we should de-, de-, de-, de-, defend ourselves, right?, although there is a lot of people that, unfortunately, for lack of education or whatever
Uh huh
They can't, and we have to look out for them
Uh huh
right?
yes
Because, sometimes, for example, my grandparents came from Cuba, they didn't know english, they couldn't work, so they, uh
uh, they needed to, they worked a little, but they can't do... so these people can't defend themselves, the system has to capture them and help them
But the system has many
But
uh, problems, for example, uh, i have a friend
uh huh
she's a single mom with two kids
Hmm Hmm, right
underage,and this, and the government doesn´t, doesn´t help because supposedly she makes much money.
Hm Hm
She makes about five hundred dollars a week,
Hm hm
but you have to take into account the car insurance, she is paying her car,
right
she is paying a mortgage of a house, herself,
Hm right
without government aid,
right
the father of the children when he wants, he, he, he gives her money, and when he can´t doesn´t give money to her, because he is like that, he is not very responsible
well - right
And, I have a friend too who is in, in disability
Hm hm
he is thirty three years old, and they give him food stamps So, he has more than enough money, and the government gives to him, gives him, give him aid
right
How could the government give help to a person that does not have dependents, and does not have so much responsibilities like, like this person. This person
Hmm hmm
a hundred, two hundred dollars that the government gives to her would be of great help.
Yes
But the government thinks that she, I  mean, they are basing it on her income.
Hm mm
No, no, they don't take her expenses in consideration or the doctors or daycare and all of that, I mean
Right, right
the government should have to, I  mean, it's unfair that they can help an individual that doesn't really needs the help,
Hm mm Hm, well look, oh, talking about your friend,
Hm mm
oh, I'm telling you that it's different in every state because I'm telling you, here in New York the law says that
Hm
it's pretty aggressive with the fathers that refuse to make payments, they get them and they suspend their licenses immediately
Well, and the funny thing is that, she's from New York.
Hm mm
and she just moved here to Florida.
Hm mm
And she has, she has child, what's the name
Oh, child support
child support, yes, child support through New York because he's still in New York.
Oh well
And every time that he gets a job,
Hm mm
and, child support gets him, he goes to unemployment and when the unemployment runs out,
right
then, he starts working, out of the books, in other words, under the table.
right. Yeah, well those things eh, she has to, obviously she has to prove them, number one,
Hm mm
and number two, I know, I agree with you, that the system is not perfect and has a lot of problems but is, is hard, you - sometimes it's a little hard,
certify because I consider that
Hm
the person whom she was married to is a swine Right, and there are like that, but there aren't many,
Yes, that's what it sounds like Hm mm
no, because for more example look, I've been divorced four years, and I got married again, I have a daughter with my wife, and I've never missed a payment, to my son
I've always, have fought a lot to be with him, because this is not the problem on the contrary, that my wife my ex-wife would like for me to never see him,
and I had to fight very hard in, in court
Hm mm
and and to have him. And never and, and all the money I give her, she uses it to pay the house, to screw
to pay other things, instead of paying, use it for him, that it is what is it has to be for right.
The reason that you give it, aha.
And she has lived comfortably, working a part time job
Hm mm
so far, and now he realizes she has the rope up to his neck
Hm mm
and she  also lives in a house, you know, houses here in New York are so expensive
Yes
and she has used the money that I give her for the boy, she used it to pay the house, to pay for a car, a car
and those things, so, what can I do! I can't do anything about that, but I've done my part, I know I have
I'm very responsible and I, I'm going to continue being responsible because he is my son, what can I do? But some people just don't care and they have no shame and
hm mm
and they spend their lives fighting instead of being responsible and look for a job to get rid of that and pay what they have to pay, but no, they have no shame
Hm mm
So, yes, the law is tough, only for her, she can spend her time at court and every time she moves, he's behind her but, who has the energy to do that
It seems to me that the more help she gets
That
from the system, I mean, the more they try to help those people, the more damage they causes
Sometimes it is, I agree.
I mean, some win, they try to a certain point and they loose
Yes, I've seen that, yes, I agree with you about that. I think that there have been lots of good things done and lots of improvements
in the system because I've seen the changes and I know that they are now really hard with fathers that don't want to pay and
they have to give, they have to provide medical insurance for the children and all of that but like I said, some have no shame and they scape the system.
Hm
and the ply the system game, so, what can you do? you can do what you can do, and the rest is left is left to God,
to take care of someone like this, because if he is not responsible for his sons, then he escapes with the law little game
well, then he'll have to pay on the other side, I guess
Hm mm
So, but considering the system in comparison to other countries, all I want is the system here to be more like, mm, in health specially
to be better. That people can go to the hospital without having to worry for how much they will have to pay, or, or, that
he goes there and they heal him, that's all. And that
No, and, mm, I've had for instance my boyfriend, he got seriously ill once
Hm mm
And, mm, he had to be operated in emergency
Right
And then finally, I, mm, got informed and told them that we didn't have the money, because the operation would cost about thirty thousand dollars
Right
I told them, I explained them my economical situation, and they, very nicely, made me fill a form
Hm mm
And, mm, I waited for about two months
Hm mm
and I was told that they would pay the whole cost
Right Right
And that was, like a grant of, of, that the country had some money saved for people like us
right right
and, eh, I never thought they would pay the whole. Look, if only they payed fifty percent,
Hm mm
I see, then, you can manage paying in stallments
right right
But in that, in medical things, I don't spend, I have no problems right now, I can't complain
Yes, yes
Yes, I
And so, and there is also the, eh, like the case you mentioned of your friend, there are many cases of people who fall between the, eh, between the cracks, as they say
aha yes
Who, eh, who have too much, who earn a little more than the limits they request and then, and if you earn less then, oh
it's a mess, so, those are adjustments, adjustments they have to do
But how do they make the, eh, how do they calculate the amounts, what calculations they do
Oh, well, they use studies of how much an apartment costs, the average cost of electricity, gas,
and so, and they will give you, more or less, what they think you need, obviously you won't live like a rich man, because
No
eh, no, but for instance, my grandparents, who lived out of section eight
Hm mm
eh, and had an ap- had an apartment until they died, eh, they were given enough money to, eh, to pay the apartment, electricity, gas
and well, they still had some pesos left, right?
Hm
they had like one or two hundred dollars left per month with which they could buy things, or buy, or give themselves a little treat or
Yes
But they had enough, in my opinion, I thought that the system had coordinated it in a way in which, they didn't live with luxury but they didn't live
oh, they had enough to eat. No, if they wanted to eat seafood one month, which is a little more expensive, well, they were able to do it
because no no
Hm mm
So, those things that they need, they  need with oh
Igor
Eh, Maria How are you?
How are you?
Fine eh well the welfare system of the States, the social system of the United States
mm
And How much do you know about the social system of the United States?
well what I know is that through the social assistance system well eh, with the programs that they have they help all the people
eh basically eh, with the differences that they can't cover for example if, the social insurance eh helps with the part of the medicine, it also helps with the part of for example
eh, the part of the taxes that it's contributed, that's what I understand right
yes I, I don't know, oh I don't deal with that topic too much, I have heard many controversies
mm
as far as to when the state has to be responsible for certain situations and up to when it doesn't
mm
for example with this health system And that's what calls my attention, it calls my attention especially thinking in the, the wealth that this country has
and eh in how, the assistance doesn't reach all the people that need it in the way that, that I think they should receive it
mm exactly yes well I think, I think that one of the problems is that it hasn't been given I think that on the Government's part
is true that we are, a country that is a country, United States is a country with a lot of land and all that type of things but is also true
that there are many families with many needs because there a global economic crisis and here there's an economic crisis also, there are several states where there's a lack of jobs, right
mm
and people even lower income families that haven't been able to acquire their house among other things, nor much less even pay their medicines then they need this assistance programs
like to be able to go on, they even have kids and these programs cannot cover the great demand that we have
and so far, I don't understand this social security system oh, I'm sure it will go broke in some years, in a few years, they can't
every time they lower the budgets and the States have more problems.
Sure, it's a dilemma for me, how to generate a social assistance system that is not just, that doesn't just put out the fire but, I mean, that it puts out the medicine or
this food, but that it does generate a series of resources so that people can become self-sufficient, I think that's a bit idealistic to think
that needs are going to end one day but I believe it would be better to have a social system that has a series of strategic teachings, no
yes, it's important to m e for example, about the food, I had the chance to know more about the coupon delivery or bonuses there
the food stamps for the children and the school children that I don't think they will change the high or generate a conscience on them
what type of foods are healthy and how to have a healthy lifestyle, do you understand?
yes, yes, of course, I agree, the solution must be a global one because we really don't need to always have this, as you say
and not just exist, they are going to grow and then what's going to happen? If there's no, if there's no education included
if there's no a, a complete integration of all the elements then nothing will happen and as you just said, it'll be only a temporal remedy.
they gave them food and that's it, there are other things that are part of it and that's the problem, I think they should handle this in a global way.
and not as they are doing it now, giving them a palliative as you say
hm
putting out the fire instead of planning and preventing, working with the community and doing more to solve a problem because the has this money, the country has it
So, that's what I'm worried about because I see that, it has a high tax rate
exactly
and they collect
exactly
lots of taxes, oh, I don't understand, I don't know in Germany they have a social system in which no one gets discriminated because of their status and everybody has access to it, to
well, Germany, France and Europe, they all have access to medicine and certain basic things that are harder to get here
and I believe that to me, one of the biggest lies in this social system is that, no, I understand the society, in, in every, all the members that are part of it
And I think that they, that is put on the side, the put aside the people that don't have a legal status in the country.
and they are part of society, they consume
mhm
and they help society
that's right
but they are not part of this system and that creates several parallel problems, no, oh
that's right
aid and solidarity through religious groups or non governmental organizations but not from the State, the State doesn't, it doesn't take them into account to provide a service to them when they
oh, pay taxes, lots
that's right
they pay taxes but they don't get the benefits so, it seems like the system is fooling them
that's right
I can't see how, yes, like like, lets say the game, there's lots of money at stake oh, in a way, is a mask through which we are protecting ourselves
but the reality is that in the long run, if this goes on, if I give the kids money to eat hamburgers, don't tell me
tat with this they are getting the meat proteins that they need because that's not real meat
that's right
so, that', it's like, oh, it's a double moral, no, this
that's an structural problem I believe, of the system, it's a balance, as we were talking, we've included for example, in the case of a worker, no
mhm
and an employer so the system has a problem in its structure because instead of working to get a balance in which both sides can work and contribute together
sometimes it doesn't achieve that no, and they don't contribute a hundred percent or they do but only a fifty percent of what they should
and then we are talking about a big number of people contributing to this country's economy because many, oh oh
have you seen the case of people that are worried about contributing with this country and then the bureaucracy won't let them?
mhm
or the same, the same amount of information it sees that its everywhere but it's not accessible, do you understand, or it is accessible but not understandable.
for them for example, I'm talking about the ones that don't have a status, they want to contribute because they are part of the economy
and since they don't don't they don't get loans and they don't get help and this is what you can do to achieve that
mhm
and we are going to work so that you contribute and don't hurt the system
hm
but I think that as long as there's no control, I mean, well there are many of them that are making the system break
and it's terrible because even if they want to contribute they can't but they are part of the economy so we should solve that but they don't.
so, that's the problem of social services so, the other part of the people that are in the system, they do pay and I mean, they do contribute
as a whole, I see that I see it as a big cake in which most of the system is broke because they can't finish fixing the problem so that the people
everybody starts contributing notwithstanding the status that they have as they are part of the economy system and that's the problem.
oh, but in the long run, I've always wonder, if the social system or the social services system is compatible with a liberal or capitalist economy as this one.
mhm
because I think it is all related to productvity
that's it
no, I have heard a lot of complaints or claims of people who lives, who prefers let's say, eh, since this stereotype is often generated, eh, they prefer not to work because they prefer to live on the social system
and rather than seeing it as a problem of the person, no, I think it is rather a thermometer of a serious social problem here, because we are talking about
serious, serious
people, often from the afro American community, who were for a long time, whose right equity was not granted until quite recently in this country
mhm
so, it's, well, it's too easy to find an answer of this kind and attribute it to a particular individual or a race
exactly
but, what strategies or mechanisms were stated for this not to happen? I can't see it, I can't see it, I am living in the Washington DC area
and I think, I don't see that any change is generated form the school, from the school, no
exactly, the same case you mentioned about the hamburger, eh, I think it is a problem of the structure existing, it's like if the necessary controls were missing, because there are the campaigns
there is the campaign, there is the planning, what happens? there is something in the machinery, oh wait a minute, here there must be a nutritional system
and if we don't have the budget, we only have budget to give them a meat hamburger or give them whatever, but we can't give them a really good nutritional program, for instance
the suitable one, then let's study or let's see how to ask for that something additional for the district, through the scholl district or whatever
to solve this problem, then we go back to the assistance problem you mentioned, those who always want to live on the government, the government is my dad, I would agree with you
they think that the government, daddy government, always, and they don't want to work and so, but let's go back to the case of the control, whether a person should be given the aids,
and be checked, controlled, how? well, precisely, how, for instance like the gas companies do, they have programs of help for people who can't pay the gas, you know what I mean?
mhm
and, they accept a flexible payment, etcetera, what do they do? they give this support for a limited time peirod
How do they control it?, well, they make you sign the papers again
Honey
Hi, I'm Manuel
Nice to meet you, Honey
What's up?
Fine, what's the subject?, i couldn't hear it well, the healthcare system in the United States should mimic who?
Yes, that's the subject, the thing about whether it should resemble the European one or help should be restricted?
oh, help should be restricted
restricted, suppressed, suppressed or controlled, uh huh
Oh, restricted, oh, I'm sorry, well, but if they restrict it ore, no one will be able to qualify
What did you say?
Because, at the speed restrictions are going
Uh huh
The system, it was known the system was there to help the, the people that
Uh huh
that need it, and the way it is in the United States right now, people that really need it don't qualify
Surely, the truth is that i don't know much about the subject
unfortunately for me, i do
Uh huh
because
because I'm not american, so
so okay, here in the United States the benefits like those before were much easier to qualify for
hmm
not they need a, a number of things, for example you can't go and say that you live in a place, your neighbor has to write letters saying that yes, that you live there
that yes, that you don't have a job, that you have to go where a neighbor
hmm
to tell your private life, to humiliate yourself
yeah
so that after you get a little bit of help and I'm a single mother
aha
I was pregnant with a son with one already born and one walking and they coupons were thirty five dollars for him who hadn't been born, forty for the one who was here
and some additional twenty dollars for me so for three people, like one hundred and fifty food dollars in the United States
of, of Foodstamps
yes
hmm they didn't give, they didn't give for each one
no, for each one they gave, but a portion
ah for
for the one who wasn't born they say thirty dollars a month
hmm hmm
you know, this was the food that they supposed that I as pregnant spent thirty five dollars a month for the one who wasn't both, and the one who was here, forty five dollars
good, good
I'd stare at her and would tell her, hey you expect me to survive on fifty dollars for food?
mhm
you know, how, how can that be, if I spend one hundred and fifty dollars per week?
it is possible that they spend it so fast because it's not a lot of money.
you know, food here is expensive.
mhm
food here is not cheap, you have to pay taxes over what you are already paying
sure, mhm, yes.
do you understand? It's not like I'm telling you that if the price is seven dollars, you pay seven dollars, it's seven dollars plus tax.
plus the seven, no sure, it is that way
you know, I don't know how it is in Europe but here it's ridiculous, it's the same thing with the health insurance.
oh no, in Europe, it's much more complete, it has nothing to do with how it is here in the United States.
but I don't know which are the things that they use for, you know.
the medical attention is better, no
here it's ridiculous
oh sure, medical attention you can go to any place and
you go to a doctor
you don't have to pay for it
oh, not here
and they accept the health insurance provided by the State.
ah no here the state's insurance basically nobody wants to accept it because it takes years
mm. mm
for the state you know, to pay the doctors, so the doctors don't want to take the state's insurance
well here the doctors are also very bad, very unnatural
one yes, well doctors, don't think, what happens is that the government
but they never see any one
exactly, they prefer to stop earning rather than taking care of you
because here every time that I've gone to, a medical center the nurse wants to take care of me, the technician wants to take care of me, I tell them I'm paying with my insurance so that a doctor takes care of me
ah no
I don't want a technician to take care of me
here they want to send you a nurse
not a technician
exactly, here is the same, here they send you, and you know already the doctors don't take care of you, who ends up taking care of you is the nurse
sure that's bad, no sure because a medical consultation
who took a course a little more advanced
medical, right of medical of doctor that has to see, not a consultation of
ah no here you have to specify that you want
mm
to see a doctor, not to put you to see a nurse and you stay with whatever comes here I didn't come to see a nurse, I came to see the doctor.
sure, mm
then everything is a specialty your general doctor or the head to foot one can't do anything
yes so
that one is just there in case you get a cold
mm, mm
if you have anything else, you have to go to the specialist then the specialist doesn't want to get the state insurance
mm, yes
then to see the specialist is so much then you submit it so they reimburse you, well if I had to- if I had money to pay the doctor
I wouldn't have to request the state's insurance
sure mm
that then for them to reimburse me is a mess and each year they cut more funds
ah yes probably yes so
sad I feel sad about the old people
mm
this majority of the people that this is something that they take out of your check well I'm working and they take from me for the medicare
and for the income tax that I don't know what
mm
that supposedly when you get to be old you have already prepaid all that
sure and they don't give you, no
and no and when you get to be old they want and they cut half of the funds.
yes well no
you know that, that it doesn't make sense because is something that is free
mm
that's something that you have already prepaid
but they don't pay it, no
but they are not there when you go
mm mm
when you go and are going to use it, either you don't qualify or require so much to qualify that you know one gives up at the end and better
that unless I'm dying, I don't go
mm
you know that, that
yes well the, the attention is not good at all, there's not much help, no
no is that, is that they have made it so hard you know and is also because many people have abused the system, I also understand that
mm sure they want to like discourage you, one has to demand so they can give you, exactly, right
you know, many people have abused the system, but they can't pay the innocent for the sins of the guilty they don't see it like that, here for the elderly the medicine are prohibitive.
mm
a pill comes out to one hundred eighty dollars
yes well they are expensive
that a person that, you know needs these medicines to live, like a poor man who's retired, that has no income, that the income is six hundred dollars a month
mm
say that a pill will cost him one hundred thirty dollars
it doesn't die no
for that it will die
sure
that there where it's supposed that all that money they've taken from you from the check
mm
well it's covering it, that it will
yes that here there aren't many generic medicines, very little
and it doesn't even matter if they are generic, I'm telling you that it's a ridiculous thing.
mm
for the old people who are the ones that really need this plan it covers the medical insurance but not the medicine
ah look then the same as nothing
then what are they in, because if you go to the doctor you come out with a prescription
sure if you don't have health insurance, if you don't have the medicine you don't get cured, mm
it doesn't do this man any good to go exactly you went so they would tell you what's wrong with you, what it is you need to get cured but you don't have the money to do it
sure what good is it for, not for
you know that I don't understand the logic of the people that are in charge of the funds but they have funds for all the other things
yes that I think it has to do with the business of the laboratories that they don't want to make cheap medicine
that's one, my problem is that the United States has funds for what they want
ah also so, sure so
one has funds to go to a war but doesn't have funds to cover the medicines of the elderly
mm yes well there how much money have they spend and will continue to spend
you know that, that one know of and says but what are the priorities?
mm mm
in reality I don't care what they are doing in the country over there
sure, is not this country's problem, no but unfortunately they have a politic of harming its own people or doesn't care about the poor, right.
unless they are in mine you know but they don't take care of the ones they have to take care in the land here
sure
you know is something that one stays with the mouth on the floor you are going to tell me that there's ninety billion to send to rebuild Iraq that we went that we went and bombed them to start
aha
but you are going to tell me that there are no funds in the state to cover the medicine of so many people that need it.
mm
I mean it doesn't have logical sense.
you are right
besides that the priority is obviously what the government wants
mm sure that if
you know the, the priority because they can't argue that there are no funds when they have a war
mm
well then stop the war and put the funds where you have to put them
yes because they say it's done harm to this country to go there, that it has spent a lot.
no this war has finished with a
mhm, oh yes, it has gone up a lot
the gas is prohibitive the fuel went up, the energy
I've seen that since I have been here, it has decreased to two twenty or two thirty
we are now paying about the same, two eighty nine per gallone
you see, two years ago the price was one dollar
a dollar and fifteen cents
you see! sure, it doesn't make any sense
and there haven't been hurricanes and it's still up again, no hurricanes nor nothing, so, why is the price increasing again?
sure, and did you know that they are going to war to get cheap gas and then they've increased the prices
three times more expensive of what I've seen it in my life
to profit
the only ones that are making money are the oil companies.
mhm
they are going to say that I used to know that when there were hurricanes, they struck some towers but there are no hurricanes in January
no, nothing, none of that, mhm that's so true
and the gas prices are increasing, so, I mean, I, I really don't, I don't understand, we have good things but
there's so much injustice
there are some things that  you just look at them and they  make no sense, for example the medical plans that are so prohibitive
sure, considering the fact that
a family insurance
Yeah, well, you think that the country is so rich, because they really have resources, there shouldn't be so many needs
one
because they have a way to cover them and take care of them but
the one who's living outside sees it that way, the one who's here
um
to cover me and my family
Uh huh
An insurance is almost five hundred dollars a month
Sure, uh huh
And from where?, if my salary
Uh huh
i don't earn that in a week
You see
you know, how am i supposed to pay for a monthly payment in a medical insurance that's more than what i earn in a week?
With all the exorbitant expenses that you have here
Yes, well
the rent is prohibitive, the gas is prohibitive, forget about a car
Yeah, sure, everybody
i take care of them so that you can go to work, and someone takes care of your son
Yes, that's true
I know I said it once, for what I spend, I should stay at home, it's cheaper because my income is not equal, what I have to pay as alimony, thank God that I have one in college
mhm, mm
but when there were two to care for, the girl was charging me one hundred seventy five a week
yeah you see, sure
and in a month that's almost seven hundred dollars
yes well and it's that to pick them up it'll cost you like eight, eight hundred
you now, half of what I earn in a week goes towards caring for the girl
mhm mhm, that's true
what's more I have to spend on gas so I can get to work and then health insurance the majority of companies do offer health insurance
mhm, mhm, you see
it's awful what mine is offering but whatever they take eight hundred out of the check. so the what is the part that they covering, one hundred
you know what, I don't understand, not for more that I would want to give the hospitals here, they are prohibitively expensive
yes it's very expensive here, health insurance, and they don't cover hardly anything
and the emergency room
I also have insurance that costs me about every five, six months it costs like one thousand two hundred but it hardly covers anything
but here
for just one person
emergency room it's if you even step foot in the emergency room
mhm
and I went because I had gastritis
mm
emergency room
Luca
Hello
yes
Hello how are you? My name is Mauricio
how is it going? my name is Luca,how are you?
how are you? fine
where are you calling from?
eh, I'm in Charlotte
where is it?
eh, North Carolina United States
ah, and how's the climate?
awesome, like
yes
like, tropical
really good, what is not cold?
eh eh, no, is not cold
e-
yes it's cold, we're supposed to be in winter
yes
but it's, it's good is, today it was hot, where are you?
I'm in Boston
Boston, oh, that's sweet, cool
Yes, here, it's a little bit colder here
Yes, i can imagine, i can imagine, that's good
Yes, and how
Well, the subject, the subject's good, right?
Yes, yes, how long have you been living in the United States?
I, uh, I've been here for a year
Oh, and, and before, where are you from?
I'm Colombian
Right, and did you live in Colombia earlier or were you in another country?
I was in Colombia
Right, and, are you clear on the matter of social services and all that?
Exactly, uh, well, i have experience because I'm in a process with immigration here
Uh huh
and, it turns out I'm legally here, i have a work permit and all but, i got it, and my wife hasn't gotten it, you know how it is here, we both have to work
Yes, but, the, the, what, do you have the green card?
Uh no, no, i have, I'm in the process of political asylum, i, I've only been here for a year
wow
So, uh, it turns out i have my wife and three children
and, are you legal?
and, yes, all, all of us are under, eh, the petition that we have, we are in a process
yes
and, I already have a work permit, my wife is waiting for it to arrive, it should've arrived with mine
yes
but, it hasn't arrived eh, I think it's an excellent country and, and and, but I think they should get better organized, eh, as far as the service
yes
because, in my case I've had the need to take my kids to the doctor
yes
the only way to take them to the doctor is paying and I don't have the money
mm
or,or that it's something urgent but is not something urgent so, for example
yes
that he's seven years old and the teeth are coming out but the milk teeth, the first ones, are not falling, so they are coming out in back of the others
mm
and, and, and, well is, eh
sure
to me I find it worrisome because, in the future we are going to have to go to a very costly treatment here
sure, because the dentists are equally expensive, I mean, ortodo-
yes, sure
orthodontics, I imagine, it must be more expensive, but
yes, exactly and the girl, well she's worried about her little teeth.
mm, poor baby
and it hurts but it's not an emergency
yes
so, I haven't been able to  take her because, oh, we don't have, we don't have a doctor.
but, don't you have insurance?
no, I don't have healthcare insurance
but she does have a social security number right?
only myself
and that
I'm the only one that has because I'm the one that has the job permit, so
but, can't they give your daughters a social security number?
no, not until we get the authorization that we have requested,
oh, mm
so, it has delayed everything, we are within the legal immigration parameters, we haven't done anything but way for the law but they should have, for example, in this cases
sure
oh, take that into consideration because I have three daughters and my case is
yes, that's it, can't you contact a human rights organization? like for example
we've done, which one
The child right, uh, uh, exists, uh
Well, we've done anything, but
And it's international
Even the, the social service here, and, and the only thing they told us is, uh
you have to wait
While they don't have the, uh, social or, or an urgency
Yes
not even social, they told me a, uh, while there's no urgency, we can't apply, and
Um
And we can't apply for help because, uh
Because you don't cover-, you don't cover the needs
because we're not within the status
sure, um
do you know what i mean?, but, but I'm not illegal
Yes
It's absurd to me, right?, i mean, I'm in a situation i find absurd
But, are you working?
I'm working but i'm, I'm just working, my wife isn't because she doesn't have a permit
yes
Besides, we have three children
Um
If she would work, getting something part time or something like that
And, the oldest is five or do you have others older?
No, they are, eight, uh, no, how's that?, ten, eight and six
Oh, and, and the other girls, the, do the older ones go to school?
So we all, we all go, they all go to school
And, is the school private or is it free?
Oh, no, no, uh, that's free, free, and
Uh huh
And no, they give them breakfast an lunch thank god
Uh huh
Because what i earn, it's barely barely enough to feed us, so, uh
Sure, yes
I know there's, there's people that get a lot of benefits, for example, Cubans
Yes
Right?, they get here and they have, well, that, that's something special for them
But can't you apply for a special scholarship?, because they also have political asylum
Um, yes
Or, or
but the, the, she's, it's just that i don't have political asylum yet
Oh, i understand
And they haven't said no
Right
They haven't said yes, but I'm in the process
Uh huh
So, it's just that, but so, while i wait, what's happening?, yeah, so, i wait,
sure, right?
My girl has, uh
yes, yes, yes, i understand
teeth on the back and on the front
Um
And i don't know what'll happen while i wait
Yes, and, how long ago did your wife apply to, to get her, hr permit?
In, no, the thing is that, the permit, she apply-, we applyed for the same documents, all of them
yes
So, uh, she had to, had-, uh, the, the, the, what we expected was to get them all at the same time, because we have done all our paperwork at the same time
Sure
Just a package, let's call it that
Yes, yes, yes
So, all my stuff came, and i said, well, thank god it was mine
mm
cause I needed to work
sure
yes, but, but, we need other things because we've been waiting for the asylum resolution for a year and and
yes, yes, yes
we have, immigration documents, we have authorization to be here, I have a work permit
yes, sure, mhm
oh, we are in a legal process, oh, we are doing it through the legal ways
sure, but it's so, so slow, this subject
and I say, well, they should think about, our, situation, while we wait
mhm
and above all, the medical stuff, the children
is it expensive? yes
thank God we haven't had an emergency because I know that in an emergency we would still get help, right?
well, sure
but, but, for example, the issue about the girl, it's not urgent but it is delicate
yes, sure
when she, it hurts
mm, poor baby
when, when she drinks something it hurts her
and are you giving it some sort of analgesic?
Um, yeah, when it hurts a lot we give it, we give it uh, Tylenol or something
yes
So i, i think that, regarding the service, uh, they should look after the people that's also in a process
Right, sure
Uh, uh, i say that because of me
right, because this is
not because I'm making it up, i have lived it, i'm living it
Yes
But about the rest, i think that, when they give this help, i think it's an excellent help
Um
Give medical services to the people, even feeding, it's, it's something really good
yes, yes, yes
so, i don't have any complaints, except for my
sure, the health
my experience, i understand I'm also on hold
yes, yes, and,
but I'm here now and i haven't done anything against the, against the law
Yes, and, is North Carolina, uh, is the state expensive?, i mean the rent
No, uh, i-, i-, it's good, i-, i-, i-, it's good
Uh huh
It's, it's not so expensive
Uh huh
It's not so expensive
And are the clothes for the boys expensive?
Uh, more or less, i get it second hand, right?
yes
On these army warehouses or something like that, so i get
Uh huh, yes
It's, it's cheap
Oh
So, uh, as far as the, uh, my experience, well, that's been it
Sure
but i, i know people that, that get very good help
Uh huh
Excellent help, uh
Yeah, i really don't, i have no experience with social security because i never needed it, i mean, we came here in March
Yes
And we're, uh
Yes
Temporarily here, so no, not the way we are
Yeah, yeah, and, where are you from?
We are from Argentina
Oh, that's good, and, how long?
And, um
are you going to be here?
And, we're going to be here for three years more or less
Oh, yeah, yeah
Uh, we have to, well, my husband is, he's doing a, like a research
yes
and I'm trying to re-validate my title
yeah, that's good
uh, yeah, so i can work a little as, as, I'm a veterinarian
Yeah, oh, cool, that's sweet, that's good, that's good
Yeah, so, but it's hard, re-validation it's also very expensive and i don't think there any kind of social services there to help
Yeah, sure
It's very expensive, but
Yeah, no, we have, we have applied, but they have always told us the same, right?, we're not under the status
Yes
So, uh, we have this situation and now i have to look somewhere else, to do something, and i have to look for a plan, even if it's fragmented, that
Uh huh
Whether it's by quotas, because the girl doesn't, she's got some problem with her little teeth
sure, no, sure
Now, it's also nothing worth lying for, uh, to say she's delicate
that it's urgent, sure
not even on urgency, because they won't see her and i won't tell my
sure, no, no, no
so, no, no
no, besides, uh, if he/she wants to stay here for long
we haven't had, we haven't had any bitter moments
yes
regarding social services
Uh huh
i think it's good
uh huh
i think everything this country has is really good
and the little ones, do your kids speak English well?
and well organized, but, uh, me?
your children
my children do, yeah, they're speaking, yes
yes, and they speak English to you?, no
not me, eh, they do, sometimes
yes
sometimes, well to, to trick their dad, to show off, they are happy here
and your wife how is she?
they are happy my wife is also happy because well, we are alive, from Colombia
mm
we left because of threats so
wow
so any hard situation that we go through we always thank God because we are alive and we are together
yes, yes, sure
we haven't stopped eating, we haven't stopped having a roof but
yes
sure, it's no easy for one to let go, of what you used to do, what you had, in Colombia, but a life is worth more
sure, no of course
and that the family is together
sure
but, but I think that soon everything will be resolved, right
and, and where are you from, from Medellin?
no, I was in a city south of Colombia called Neibas
aha
to the south of Bogota
and, things are very hard with all that of the guerrilla?
with the guerrilla it is, is a quite guerrilla area, red zone
mm
hello, hello how are you I am Elena. From where are you calling?
hello yes I am Eliana Whom am I talking with? from Boston
ah from Boston look how nice, I have never been I am calling, I am talking from Vancouver
ah good lets say with cold too
here rains, more than cold it rains it is near the west coast and what we have is rain, rain and rain
ah, ah look
and is there, and is there, aha
here snows, generally snows noe right? in winter but
aha
we are having awesome days nothing of snow
aha
and today we had six degrees like never
ah very good and where are you from? Argentina
yes and You?
well I where do you think I am from with this accent
What?
where do you think I am with this accent
lets see I don´t know keep talking because I adon´t don´t
if a say ashtray
Spain
sure
but it's the first time that I've spoke with a European always with Latinos
ah yes ah well well it shouldn't, it shouldn't have taken too much, I don't know if we should have let's go what happens is that ideally they shouldn't be aware of this, of this program, right? and you, you've been
sure I came speaking with all Latinos and I say that how many where it will sure I didn't see anyone from Guatemala, not even from Puerto Rico, nothing of anybody like we say
and you've been living for many years now in the United States?
nope just a year
ah just only a year, that's very short and how's it going, how do you like it?
right now this moment in my life I enjoy
yes
but to live here for the rest of my life no
sure yeah look today the theme is is is, the positives of social welfare, I don't know how you you, I've lived in the United States and I have seen a little bit bit you how how do you think that
how long have you been living here
I've lived here well now I've been living in Canada almost like for three years well I lived in the United States for four years on the West coast in California
ah
but we go that I gone a lot, I go almost every time that I can, right? to where San Francisco because I like it a lot
sure that's good but I see it like this
mhm
look it's only been a little bit that I've been
mhm
and that my country is terrible but on one hand I see it better
sure mhm
I still feel that a lot of money is being spent in things that shouldn't be and they are leaving all the other things behind
mhm
education, health and the whole social system in here
mhm, mhm
right? Why spend so much money in wars and there are a lot of illiterate persons and more poverty here
yes, I, I remember that when I used to live there, I've seen that they don't have a system, I  mean, I don't know, I've never lived anywhere else
in the United States but in Californian and in California, San Francisco is a city that has a help system, isn't it? in fact yes
if you don't have the resources they help you right, sure, to me, it's something that I really don't like a lot specially coming from Argentina, that it has to be the same but in Europe
oh, you have doctors for example, isn't it, the doctor
oh well the health system is pretty bad in here
sure, oh
oh, no? hello
yes, yes, I'm sorry you were speaking and I didn't want to interrupt you
oh, no no, the health system here is not that much better as the one in Argentina or in Buenos Aires, the city where I live
yes, I'm, mhm
because it's so expensive, they charge huge amounts oh, no, I don't know, it's like I feel that I'm better cared for in Argentina that in here
yes, I have, you see, one of my friends, I mean, I've lived here in Vancouver, right? I've been here for three years and
they said that in Canada it is different than in the United States but, you still have to pay for the doctor, they don't just give it to you, if you are not working
you don't have access to it
ah
and ah I don't know I thought that it was so different in that sense and is not is not at all, I mean here you have to pay it what happens is that instead of costing you
ah
two hundred or three hundred dollars well here perhaps it cost you one hundred dollars right?
sure, sure
but is not so different eh is very similar to the United States and of course is not similar is not similar at all to Europe that you
work and and pay for your unemployment and also pay for your doctor, right?
sure, yes I let's say, was teaching
but mm
in Buenos Aires and had a social work for teaching let's say super
mm, mm, mm
very state, let's say when I was little through my parents I went to a private one but later when I started with my job what they gave me was the state one
mm, sure, yes
and at the end of the day it was really good because I could go to the school hospital that are the teachers of the kids that study medicine
mm, mm
and they would take care of me who was eh let's say that was getting paid a low salary
yes
and then anyone can go to the public hospital we call it because is for the people
mm, yes
and be taken care of let's say one sometimes chooses if you have a little bit of money and a private one in Argentina because everything is faster
mhm, mhm
but if you don't have money you wait
mhm
a month or two months and you get turns
sure, sure you are placed in a waiting  list
but it's like that even with the best neurologist, in the end
mhm, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes and do you work in the United States to  or I mean, are you a teacher
oh no, I'd love to but my English is not that good yet.
Oh
oh, right now I'm doing a post doctorate.
oh a doctorate in what?
in genetics
oh I mean, what did you study then?
how?
what did you study back in Argentina?
oh, biochemistry, I'm a biochemist and then
oh
oh I'm a researcher, I started to do some research and well my thesis is in genetics and I got to come here to study a post doctorate
oh that's great, great, I mean, that's good but sure, oh, how long are you staying here?
I think that I'll stay here for three years, I've been here for one
ah well
what happens is that I would like to return to my country but I'm specializing more here and that specialty hardly exist there already
sure, sure and you know ah ah I mean do you have you know people, you have friends in?
but
in Boston I mean it has been easy, since is the city
and the truth that well the climate is horrible
yes
at four in the afternoon it gets dark, is very cold and that I wait one can manage with subways everywhere you don't need to have a car
yes
here at one two in the morning is not like Spain, Argentina that one can go out at night until six in the morning
mm, mm
but one can manage alone without the need of a car and is like a city of schools because here there's like seventy universities, there's Harvard
-MIT then many people from the whole world come
mm
is a city of like young students
ah and they have told me that is very beautiful right?
yes is very beautiful, they say it looks like Europe
yes, it looks like Europe
sure is what they say that it looks like Europe
aha and you know have American friends or
Americans
Oh the voice is gone eh are you on the phone the voice is gone
ah yes I don´t have a good signal in this house is another thing now
yes yes now I hear you
ah, not Americans no the truth is that I do not have many friends, most of us foreign are who need a family and we make our own family
of course, of course yes
And what do you do?
well I right now I am well, I was working ah I came here because my husband is from here and we got married and well I said lets try
particularly is not that I do not like it, I do not like Vancouver for the same so I don´t like it because eh it is very sad, it rains a lot ah
here what you say, at four, half past four it gets dark and rains, we have had twenty one so twenty one days raining steadly
is not that terrible
yes and very boring so it is a beautiful place for people who like open spaces, the mountains, blah, blah, blah, blah.
And I like it but we go limited limited it is not what I like the culture, I like eh to have access to a series of
cultural facilities that there are not here right?
ah here it is full in that sense and seminars and lectures everywhere, in each neighborhood and
yes, here do not, here people likes nature bicycles but very little of culture so there are some places where you can
it is in Montreal but there is also cold then not particularly it is not a place I like and besides that the level of work is very eh
here in the United States that is different right? you can find a job here you are asked for a group of requirements that are,that you must have what they call Canadian experience
so if you do not have experience you cannot find a job and there are many people here with careers engineers, doctors and they cannot exercise and are people
that come from their countries and I have friends from Argentina and and one, I think he studied Biology
yes
he has been here for fourteen years and all he achieved was working as a, eh, computer re-placer, moving boxes
I can't believe it, I didn't know
yes, yes, it's just that he was quite old when he came, he was almost forty-nine or fifty, right? I think so
sure
but no, I may be wrong, he might have come with forty-some
yes
and he couldn't speak in english, but in fourteen years all he had been able to achieve was that, that's hard already, really hard, you have some bad times here
in the first years, I mean to reach out, it's not like in the United States where if you are good enough, you know, here
sure, sure
there is a big protection, specially from the professional associations, engineers association, lawyers association, medical association
oh
who don't let people, I mean they just tell them your title is not good so you have to study your career again
and who would study back his medical career in a country you don't know
no, sure not
I mean, you say a lot of people, sure there is a lot of people living here but they work in pizzerias and they may be computer programmers, so it's hard
it's not like in the United States, I thought it would be easier, besides speaking Spanish is worthless here
ohh
thew, ehh, the Hispanic population is very small, there are much more asians, specially in the eats coast
oh
Yeah, there are just too much.
Hello?
Hello, what's up? My  name is Karina, oh,
Hello, what's up? My name is Leticia.
How are you? Oh, well,

Look, are you
well, I wonder
Well, I'm glad that I got to talk to a fellow countrywoman. Oh we have to speak about the social security system, right? But, here in the United States the truth is that I don't really know.
oh, how it works, neither the European one.
Sure.
Oh, so,
How long have you been here?
yes, for a long time, I mean, this is my fifth year
Oh, that's a lot.
But, the only relationship that I have, with the social security system is related with social work, right?
Sure.
what, well, I have one play that is cheap, lets say. So, I believe that all my complains have to do with that.
Oh, what do you have?
But, I don't know, it's, it's something called permanent Kaiser.
Oh.
Have you been here a long time?
No, just eight months.
Oh no. You have just,
yes, I mean, what do I know, I don't even know how to use the social services yet
I'm still in a cultural shock because it takes some time to get used to this, right?
yes, yes, yes, you can't even, I mean, the social work, it's, they are expensive, those things, right? But,
Aha, sure, you don't have a social work, I mean, I don't know.
yes, I have, I do but no, no, no
Don't you use it?
I haven't yet.
Mhm. I, luckily, haven't used it a lot, but the system that I have, I'm a student at the University, no?
yes.
So, well, we don't have that much money, but we need to have social security, it's mandatory
Sure
oh, so we took the cheapest one, almost everyone does and the problem that I see with that is that's a different system than the one that we have in Argentina, they have a general doctor
Sure
and you can go with him and you can't, there's no, how to say it, you have a medical card
No.
for example, if you need an ophthalmologist or a gynecologist, well,
No, as is.
it's centralized so, you first have to go to this doctor, this person that in general, it takes, I mean, it takes a lot of time for you to be referred to a specialist.
Sure.
I don't know why, I mean, so, it's more bureaucratic. And, the truth is that it's pretty expensive.
Sure, yes, yes if you want,  if you want to
Mhm.
you can pick your doctor, you have to pay more, no? There are social services that are like that
yes yes that's why I'm telling you, I mean, it depends on how much are you willing to pay each month, but most of them are centralized.
Sure.
And, and, but in other it's easier that the internist, let's say, sends you you the specialist. Now, when they work very well, is when you have an emergency, or something. Luckily, nothing happened to me, but, I had a friend that had a gallbladder surgery, laparoscopy, everything, and it covered great, everything. So,
yes, ah, yes
like for little things, any rubbish, you want to go, I don't know, to, to a, this, a dermatologist because, whatever?
yes, yes, yes
eh, eh, for those things that are not emergencies, they put you more barriers. But when there's a thing like a little more, a surgery or whatever, it sure saves you. Because,
And, yes
if you would have to pay, would be very expensive. Right?
No, yes. How things are, it is already itself, the social security is very expensive. So,
Mhm
eh, if one is not covered, someone, like an employer, or I don't know, whatever, eh, we will pay everything, it's more expensive than what we,
Sure, here at the university. Are you a student?
No, no, I work at the university but I'm not a student.
And they don't pay part of your social security, why?
yes, yes, yes, yes. Look, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Ah. Then. why in my case, it's like that, I mean, they pay a part and we have to put the
yes
the rest, and well, it depends which one you want, it is more expensive or cheaper. Right?
Of course, but the pa- I mean, I p- also I have to pay am amount, bu the amount I have to pay, is minimum compared to the cost of the social security
Sure, me too. I don't even want to think about
It's very expensive. So, it can be more than three hundred dollars per month, a cheap one.
Wow, yes, yes, yes, yes. I, honestly, didn't find out too much. But, yes is a, an issue. Right? I don't know how other people do it. Because, I tell you, since I move in the students' circuit,
but I think there's a bunch of people that don't have social work. I mean,
yes.
near where I live, for example, there's a Latin American youth center, or something like that,
yes.
that, mm, they have a place called the town's clinic, that functions kind of like a hospital. I mean,
Sure.
I don't know, that help the, especially the Latin immigrants that they know don't have
yes. yes, there's no social work, truthfully, is, is all an issue in this country. For me, is a system that I don't like at all.
Sure. I don't know if there are, for example, public hospitals. I don't think so, that,
I think there are. Here, at least in Philadelphia, they told me that there is an area where there's a public hospital. But,
ah good.
also, the appointments are for any year, and, well,
Sure, there aren't that many like, mm.
I don't know, I wouldn't like to be without social work.
Sure, sure.
What do you study?
I understand. Eh, I study literature, on top of, that no, there's not much scope, but no, yes. I'm happy. I mean,
Sure,
I'm finishing, this is my last year. I'm writing the thesis. Then, I figure that I don't know what I'm going to do. I mean, I'm in that.  Do you plan on staying a long time?
Ah. And, the truth is that I came with my husband with a three year visa, I don't know
Sure.
if we can stretch it more, but I also don't know if I'll want to. I mean,
Sure, yes.
is all a combination.
Ah, well, but one starts getting accustomed. I also, also started the master's, which was for two years, and then I stayed to do the doctorate, and,
yes.
and well, one starts saying on the way. But, but it's okay. I mean, that
Are you from Buenos Aires?
I'm from Buenos Aires, from a part of, of San Martin. I mean,
Ah, I'm also from San Martin
Really? I can't believe it.
yes
I can't believe you. I well, my mom lives in Villa de Satellites. But, when I moved, I moved to San Martin. I say San Martin for the
Really? And what school did you go to?
no I went to, went to Santa Ana when I was little.
Ah.
And later, in high school, I went to one in Florida. But,
Ah.
but I don't know. I mean,
I went to the Jose
ah, look, in, yes, yes, yes.
yes.
Very good. I can't believe it.
How crazy.
How, how strange. Right?
Do you know many Argentinians there in, in Washington?
And, well, there yes. Many, my friends of, a couple, Dolores and Mariano, who are from San Isidro, but they've been here a bunch of years.
And, well no. The others have been leaving already. Because some were from Cordoba, and I don't know? Then,
Sure,
that people go and come, See? That is also a, why one starts to also want to stay because you know people
yes
and you feel a little content. See? But, the people also move. Then,
yes. yes. yes. A bunch.
You don't know what to do. Eh,
yes.
I don't know? Is like that, Did you, meet many Argentinians?
A few, since I've been here, I must have met, I don't know, like fifty, I don't know?
Ah, how nice.
A bunch. I mean, I'm not saying that, that I always see them all, not at all. I mean, I met many, well, and I don't see them often. But, some yes.
You see, that's good.
yes, yes, but, well, I suppose that there must be more of them in Washington, I don't know.
Well, there's a group that gets together and have barbecues, what do I know? I'm going, I'll get it by email but I'm talking about the ones that are close to me, the ones that go to school with me.
Sure.
We are just a bunch, literature, it's not a very, very
Sure
popular career lets say, so I don't know. But,
yes.
but I don't know, and the problem for the, for this Spanish thing, I have just started getting these calls, I don't, no, mm,
I have no experience I mean, I just, this is my second call, kind of, so, I have no idea.
Oh, I see. Not me, I think I'm halfway through them, sort of, the calls.
Oh, I see. I don't know how they do it with the facts, or the statistics.
So, I believe that, I think that I'll get an email with, updating me on how we are doing,
Oh, that's nice.
and giving me a more information because I haven't been told much so far
yes, I can't compare the subjects or anything, for example, this one about health, I mean, the, the social security does it mean the social works or also the pensions and all of that?
I don't know, maybe I mean, it's a
An excuse.
it's of help, but you don't really need to speak about the subject.
Oh, oh, that's good because I wouldn't have known what to say.
yes, from what I understand, I mean, they tell you because, there, you don't know what to talk about, and, and well,
Sure.
they throw you a topic, but no I think that
No, well,
they study the language, no,
Then, from us they will,
no, the opinions.
they will realize that we got, emotional for finding a person of the same culture.
yes, and also from, from San Martin, I can't believe it.
I live, I have an apartment in and Mateo.
Ah.
Now, Right? Where my mom is now living, but when I moved, my parents lived in, in reality,
Ah, look at that.
I moved like thirty blocks only. I mean, closer to San Martin but,
yes.
and I studied in the San Martin conservatory also, music. I mean, I spent a bunch of parts of my,
Ah.
of my youth in San Martin, in the plaza, in a bunch of places. Right?
How old are you?
I'm thirty five.
Ah, I'm thirty one.
Ah, well, but we must have crossed by, by, I don't know, by the what is it called? the library. and
yes, I mean, is big and is not big, so to speak, I don't know? By or by, I don't know.
Probab-
It would go more to but,
Sure, look at you.
yes, but how crazy.
And how? Impossible. No, but, well. See how we ended up in the same place? Well. yes.
yes, the truth that
Is a lot,
And have you seen much of the United States since being here, or?
mm, look, at first, I mean, it was quite bad, in the sense that I came here alone, In other words that
Ah.
is harder, I think. Then, I had a very hard time adapting,
Sure. To study, basically, I mean, to
sure, to do the master's. Then, nothing, I wanted to return at all cost, I was a little bit bad.
yes.
But, later, I started getting used to it, and as soon as I got a little stabilized, I tried to travel. See? eh, more than anything, looking for conferences,
Ah.
that would help me to do something of mine, and at the same time in some city that I would like. Then,
Sure, sure.
I went to New Orleans before that
Ah, how nice, how nice.
there was, yes, Katrina. Is a very beautiful city. I mean, if you can go, I mean, I don't know how it is now because this was terrible. Speaking of the help of
yes,yes, yes, is quite bad, I think, yes, I don't know if I'll go there now, maybe after a while.
No. You have to wait a while. But, eh, is very beautiful and is very different to other cities of the United States.
yes.
And, later I was in Pittsburgh, because, ah, I found out to, be closer to Philadelphia. Right?
Ah, look, yes, I know Pittsburgh yes, is near here, I have family that lives there.
Look at that, I wanted to do the doctorate in the university. I was going to transfer, but then I changed my mind and I stayed in the same one.
Ah, You like Washington?
Then, I went to know the city. I like Washington a lot, yes. Because I got to know it little by little, I became fond of it. See? Like
yes.
one already has the neighborhoods one likes, or the cafes or where you always go.
Sure.
Eh, I don't know. And, the people that I met here. Right?
yes, logical.
And mm, Later, What other one do I know? I don't have many. Let's see. To which other one did I go? I went to Boston, now that I remember, which is also very beautiful. Because I went to do a seminar there during one summer.
Ah, yes.
I liked it a lot, is quite expensive, that's the only thing.
yes
And, well, New York, which I try to visit every now and then because, you from Philadelphia may also have those Chinese buses that are so cheap
yes, yes, yes. I go on them, yes, yes, it is ten dollars from here, so twenty dollars both ways
Sure. So, perfect. Much cheaper that
It's very good
yes, well. You must go often, right? Because, since it is such a big city, I
Sure
the first times it overwhelmed me. But then I started feeling comfortable with it, right?
yes, yes, it overwhelms you
After being there a couple of times, right? So, but then, nothing else. I didn't travel a lot, actually. Oh, and I went to visit my sister who is living in El Paso, in the border with Ciudad Juarez
Oh
doing a master. And well, I went there to the desert only because she was there
Sure, of course

with what
ah the ones from Spain
ah you confuse it with the Spanish accent

sure because the Spaniards talk a lot with the s like this
that is true
the Spaniards and they talk more of you you are, you more of you us is more of you, you is all very
you aha that's the difference
che, che, everything is che
oh yes
che che so
my friend who travels with us he's from Colombia has corrected me a lot

and they correct me they tell me no you're saying the words wrong
ah they correct the the words
and I just laugh because
yes and sure the Colombian accent has like its little accent
it does have
eh eh all the countries there like Caribbeans have a similar accent
mm yes that eh for me
yes I don't distinguish it too good, Venezuela, Colombia is like
aha
the Cuban one you can tell there the Cuban one if you notice the Cubans and the Mexicans also
have their
the Mexican accent you can notice
is like a little song
sure they all talk like this like is true is true
aha
that's true so you live in Chicago
wow I I studied in ah in Chicago yes is a suburb of Chicago we are five minutes from the Indiana state line
yes
but we do get to work in Chicago everything in Chicago
and, are you married in Chicago, do you have family or something?
yes, I have a family, I've been divorced for seven years and I'm forty four years old, my girls are twenty five and twenty six years old
do you, your daughter is what?
I have daughters, they are twenty five and twenty six years old.
oh sure
I see, one lives with me and the other one is married and is now living in Missouri
oh
and my mom still lives, she's eighty years old, that's why we came to Texas because my dad was looking for a job, when he was young and was around twenty years old, he had just gotten married
and he left for Texas to look for
they moved from Texas to Indiana so that he could work in an industry that was not so popular at the time
he had some fields in Texas
they were farmers, my grandfather was
sure, they had a little farm
oh I see
and the fields are nice, it's nice, isn't it?
yeah, it's nice and my dad was
there were some bad harvests or something like that
exactly, the had cotton
and he had to
horses, lots of animals
that's so nice, it's nice to live in the fields, it's nice to go on vacations, for a month or a week, but it's a hard place to live in
yes I no m
to live you have to be a bit hard
precisely that's why I chose this job to know other people from the United States but for me they are very nice the states are
the states
good they have eh yes they are very different for example I just got out of Louisiana and there there is a lot of French influence
yes, yes
and the food reflects on the names each person if they're white, black, Latinos eh
and the truth that they're different
even the indians, they have, yes they have French names and the habits are very different for example
do you know much, no? the United States for for work, no? what did you say
work, yes I like it a lot
that with but you travel through the entire United States or through the coasts eh West or more or less everywhere
mm more in the South, more in the South and West simply because I chose my states for them to send me to
you that I didn't hear you pardon me
and I prefer or I chose the states that I like and
ah and you go to wor-, ah look at that
yeah, yeah yeah because to the North I don't want to be it's very cold at that time
yes no
yeah and in this occasion
and what what what is the nicest thing for you, what is it htat you like the most from there
me
United States
the nicest thing is when you see the mountains because in Chicago we never have it
sure
and the fact that the people can live really comfortable and have a good, a good view from all the rooms in their house
sure, sure is true
and how peaceful it is because Chicago everything is so fast too many people
everything so
there are too many fast steps eh
mm
the people have like too much stress
mm
and here in the south for me is very relaxing I want to return to live in the south whether is California, yes I love it
is beautiful sure, is good
my next step I would like eh
a lot, a lot of people no? from Mexico
a lot of people yes is true
is more like the roots
aha they are the roots to have the
and if the Americans don't eh go are some
Uh huh
They're like kinda cold, right?, the americans, it's like
it's true, uh, i have always felt like that, because our races, we're very affectionate and
right, well , Americans are like kinda, um, i don't know
with arms wide open
Your ex, was your ex husband mexican?
Yes, they were Mexican too
Mexican too, oh yes, there's people around there that
But no
i mean, that's more
Yes, i want to find again
like you but mostly aren't, right?
No
We don't share much
It's not true, uh huh
Personality, the thinks that
Exactly, i agree with that
Um
Who, in this job, in this instance we all speak spanish, they send a work where they kill the chickens
um
And it's a company where i do appreciate a lot what the local working people do and
Yes
Only the Mexicans like to work, because they're catching chickens, killing them
Yes, and the Mexicans are hard workers, they're
Uh, and they're hard workers
The Mexicans work hard
Yeah, a lot, and then
Yes, yes
To me it's something
And that's why the people, uh, there are lots of them in the South  of the United States, the native, lets say, that's why the Americans aren't many either
Um
They don't like the immigrants, you saw the whole problem with immigration, that they're even building a wall
Yes, it's a
that's terrible
Oh, terrible, but my brother lives in
Because, i mean, the Mexicans go there, and they work hard and
right
but the people, the employers, they abuse
Uh huh
They pay them less and they get the job done, but they work more
mm
American, that's good I mean
no is not good
is good I mean that that that the immigration seems good to me that Mexicans go and
mm
work if they are hard workers
but yes that there's a right way the president
I mean it can be perfect the way is not to do a wall with that you don't achieve anything
mm is true
I mean is all a fundamental problem and well that the and Mexico is doing bad in all of South America all Latin America and the things are bad and well
okay
the people are forced to go to other countries where there are more jobs like here here they give you more opportunities
and is a shame such a shame that I feel
but is all a fundamental problem
correct
everything is very complicated is all
but yes that of the politic I don't understand because it can't be done according to those for me is very easy because they need hard workers
sure
to be able to offer them some change right that they learn to speak in Spanish
and me yes
the English
i don't know why it is, i don't know if it's xenophobia or discrimination
there's so much that they can offer, yeah, that's it
they don't let pass, i really don't understand why, it must be discrimination, i don't know
Uh huh
i think
right
and the subject was like, how was it?
i don't know what the subject was, i forgot
It was that if so- assistance, well, you know more, the thing is that i don't live here
Oh, where do you live?
in the United States, I'm in Philadelphia now
Oh yes
Uh, but i came because ... lives here here in Philadelphia, five, six years
Right
My girlfriend's brother, so i came here with my girlfriend
Uh huh
Uh, besides, my girlfriend's brother is a biologist
Oh
And he's he's working here in the University of Pennsylvania
mhm
and I also study, we both are studying biology so he got us to come to work here
excellent
during our summer, let's say the winter here
mhm
until the middle of March doing like an internship, a rotation
oh yes
and of course we're here it must be about fifteen twenty  days that I've been here in the United States so that
mmm
I don't know how is the
m
the welfare system the truth is that no
yes to the me neither, I work so much
the truth is that I don't know but I imagine it must be bad I don't know
well
I don't know, I don't see it as a very a
the welfare system here m I know better the welfare systems of other countries not the one here
sure ah from other places, no? from
aha, because according to what you're telling me
not from here, I sounds that it must be bad because here yes
Uh huh
Here, uh, i mean you're in the system if you have money, right?, or if you have a good job
Uh huh
And you can earn money and a part of your, your medical assistance and your stuff, right?, because here you don't have, uh, you don't have public hospitals or anything, right?, it's all private
social assistance and all that, it's all, all private, right?
that's true, yes, the public help has melted, well, a lot of the, uh, has created to me a... a family where poverty... because the people who has
Hello, my name is Soledad.
Hello, my name is Martin.
No, oh Hello, how did you know that I was about to call?
No, it's like, I was going to call Cuco.

Yes, i, did you get talk to Ela?
So I'm seeing you. Yes, it's, she told me she was gonna give me a call in a while, because they were deciding with Herni, if Herni was coming or not
Right
And if she came with her car or not. The thing is i think they're gonna want to leave very late
It looks like what?
That they're going out really late
Oh, well, if not, you come, get here by bus, on the Chinese
Sure, i mean, it wouldn't, i wouldn't mind to save one trip, you see
And, sure, yes
But, on the other hand
But the Chinese is only ten more dollars
The Chinese is fourteen a time
Ah
Eh
Did you find out.  Are there Chinese at Baltimore?
Yes, tomorrow I am going to call.  It's been half an hour since they answered me.  I know they will stop, they had told that.
In Miami?
That they stop in Baltimore, eh?
You said in Miami.
No, they had told me.
Ah.
that, that they stop in Baltimore but fine.  We will see then.

Yes
That's fine, but call Laila, because she's leaving, she'll be upset otherwise
No, but she told that that she was going to call me.
Yes, but if it's ten-thirty and she didn't call you, call her.
Okay.
Pay attention to me.
All right.
What was I going to tell you, that is, why do you say that it looks like they are leaving late?
Because these ones they are disorderly.
yes, yes they are wishy-washy. What I don't understand is if he doesn't have to work.
That's what happens. I want to go out fine at what time can you go out. That's why I told him, talk it over with Herni, and give me a sure data. I
And Francesca?
same, from the time they give me, I add another hour.
Sure
One more hour, if they tell me eight, well, I don't know . It would be ten thirty,
Okay

Eh incredible this of the coordination. We have ESP.
Man, and Francesca is coming or not?
Laila didn't know She didn't answer the mail, I sent her a mail she didn't answer it.
Well, later when you talk with her, ask her about Francesca. Still Francesca if you tell her, she'll tell her tomorrow at night in the evening.
Another one who you can't trust too much A disaster, eh.
yes, she was going to see yes, but France, even less.
No, but you because you're going, Francesca that was coming, I don't know. What happens is that I think that, eh, eh, I still think the most dangerous ones are Laila and, and Herni.

I Mean, they may be able to tell you yes, that they come, and later on they come and tell you "oh no, we're not going"
No, I'm telling you now, please cancel it, to cancel it before three in the afternoon, because i have to know

Everything's fine, everything's fine. It was [just] a day, a hard one.
Oh, god, yes
But that's it, it's gone, it's over
I know
Um, well, i guess i will call the cable tomorrow
Well
The cable or the, the phone, and we'll see what happens with that. But it seems that they won't be able to set it up
And
What, what did the message said?
That they can't put Cele, nothing else, what i told you
That they can't
But can they at least give us service?
Oh
I don't know if we have to install something else, if we have to I don't know.
Well,
Or we have to let the telephone company know, I don't know.
Just the same ask, downstairs.
yes yes
Because it seems strange, before we could have internet through the phone, remember. We could have
Even the girl that gave us the apartment said we could right, or am I crazy?
yes, no.
But we have to call and ask. Then there by there we have to, I don't know, change something.
No, but find out downstairs. First.
I already told you that yes.
Okay, because I then with that can tell them, but how can it be, if they told me that in the building there is.
Sure Well, I'm going to find-
What happens is that like that, is not even good for us. I don't know, the phone. I don't know. We would've planned things differently. We would've gotten cable with with -DSL
Sure
cable with cable so to speak.
Sure sure
Plus is an additional six sixty only.
What thing?
Everything.
to speak with wireless?
yes I don't know
And how much is it, the phone with the TV?
No, it would be much less. It would be forty.
Aha
It's the same, we don't pay for the phone. Understand.
When we put it?
And, no, we already have a contract on the phone.
You can also cancel it.
I don't know if it would be good for us. Besides I already paid the activation and all.
yes
Like a shot. I don't know, I can say, that no, in reality, this is not good for me, no, I don't have -DSL eh
Well, we'll see. Tomorrow, we'll resolve it.
Well it's not a big deal.
Eh? Ah
It's not so terrible. But well, what a shame.
Well
Um I anyways will ask him tomorrow.
I also asked
No Eh, did you see the movies?
No, not yet
Aren't you going to see them?
Eh, I don't know, I may see one tomorrow
What do you do in life?
Eh?
What do you do in life, there in the apartment?
I am, I was, I came and then I was cleaning the bathroom, afterwards,mm, what else?, I was checking some things still, and I washed
how you call it? I washed the clothes, I still have some more clothes to wash. And then you came and I ate

and watched CSI and it's eleven already, I don't know.
Oh, you are watching TV, does it work alright?
yes, a little rainy, but alright. Some channels better than others

We'll see, about the telephone. And cable, and so. We still need to have cable and so
Well, we'll see
I think
I love you silly
To have it. Eh, tell me something more
What else can I tell you? I already know where there is a, a, a gas station
Very well
Uh, what i still can't find near here is more like a Rite Aid, or a CVS nearby, i just don't know where they are
It's ok, we still have Esteban there, right next to us, in case of anything
But yes, today i bought in Target, they had the, the condoms
Oh, well, that's good, share it on the prom

I, what Ponchis, it's something in, in Spanish
Pom-pis [buttocks]
Ponchis
Ponchis
Eh When they listen to that they won't understand anything.
And what does it matter?
The language this people speak.
What was I going to tell you? what a coincidence that we found each other on the phone
Poor Cuco.
Poor Cuco, I wonder who he's talking to.
yes yes nothing, he probably talked to someone. What happens is that Carla was going to talk to Cuco, and, I called and said, no, well let's talk
I was going to call you, to tell you that after, if you wanted to talk with Carla. But well.
And well,
what can you do. Eh, I'm on Marcelo's phone, so I have, this is one more number.
Ah, that's good.
yes yes
Are you having a good time?
yes,
Well, I'm glad
what was I going to tell you.
What?
No, and nothing, nothing else. I have nothing else to say. My, my life is kind of boring.
Very boring?
I sent the things.
yes
Eh
Any gossip, nothing?
Hello, greetings from John of New York, how are you Marina from Philadelphia, how are you?
Hello, this is Marina from Philadelphia, it's all good, what about you?
that's great, I'm fine. Where, where are you from?
I'm from Argentina, yes, where are you from?
oh, it seemed to me that had an Argentinian accent right from the start. I'm from Cuba.
oh Cuba, now that you've mentioned it, yes, I can tell.
well, aha, how long have you been here? oh really, wow, do you miss it? no, I, I've been here for over forty years, it'll be forty years this year.
I'm now learning to identify the different accents, now that I'm here in the United States, since a year ago, and you? wow
so, and, and, what's the name and and do you miss Argentina?
yes, I miss it a lot, no, Mar del Plata, it's
where is that? The capital? Oh, I was in Mar del Plata in the Alean avenue which is pretty popular isn't it?
yes, really? sure! Specially during the summer it's quite popular, yes
yes, I was there in the summer, about fifteen years ago, yeah, yeah, really nice, so, what do you think about the subject. Couples that break up
well, you see, we must have made a mistake, I don't know, I believe that it's something personal or a decision of each couple, some find it easier to break up with someone
mm, mmhm, yes, yes, mmhm, yes, yes
I don't know, I struggled with that a lot, even when I really wanted to break up with someone, I had a lot of problems doing it, I really didn't like to make someone suffer or whatever, I do think it's a difficult situation.
yes, yes, well, it depends, I think that if they make a huge mistake, well, then it should be easier or if she finds him in bed with another woman, well it should be easy.
oh sure, sure, that's easy
but when it's not like that, when it's because the love is gone or, well, it seems to me it's a bit difficult
sure, you are right, you are so right
so, and also, if they have been living together for many years it is also difficult
yes, and if there are children it must be even more difficult
well yes, sons, forget it, that's completely different, but when you live together for many years, eh, you get used to the  defects of the other and often, there is a saying that is better, how was it?
What is known is bad, that is good to know
yes, better unknown, yes, so, imagine you say alright I know the defects of this one, what if I find another one and he is worse, then you say, alright I'll keep with the one I know because I already know his deffects and can handle them, etcetera, etcetera
sure, and convenience too, right? you have the home mounted, your routine, you go along, I don't know
yes, yes, aha, that's it, aha, that happens, that happened to me, I was married to an Argentinean
I don't know, I mean, it's not nice, but it happens, I know it
yes, so, I have a son thirteen years old who is now with me, this weekend, but it has been a bloody battle because
she didn't want to let him, she wants to punish me because things didn't turn out fine and we were married for nine years
m
so but I saw that love was already over but I tried, I told her what she wanted to hear, but she, she already had me, because we were married she thought she had me
for ever
yes, so, it has been, unfortunately it has been very hard and difficult, because unfortunately she has used the child to try to punish me
oh that's disgusting, no, no, to me that is, I guess when you are inside the situation you don't realize and you do it, I don't know, it must be, well, we shouldn't judge people, but
aha, yes, aha, no, right
you have act right, because the poor child has no fault, he loves his mom and loves his dad, and that you two can't work as a couple doesn't mean that
yes, right, I have tried, I've had to fight hard to achieve the time I have him with me, every Tuesday and every Friday
m, sure
and then every two weeks, on weekend yes the next one no, I have him almost all of the time, it is a miracle that he is, he is upright
what it can you know, is she puts a lot of garbage in his head and then it has been, it has been thank God he has come out straight and knows
sure
and he's taking his path but I know that on the inside he has a lot of wounds from all that he's gone through
and yes and has it been a lot of years that you separated
yes it has already been ah eight years but believe me that up to right now December I was still in court because every time that
ah
every time that she feels like it she takes me to court for things that she invents and things that, she suffers from unfortunately she suffers from bipolar I don't know if you have
yes I don't know too well what it is, no I don't know well what it is
is a eh yes is eh eh then
like changes in the mood, like that
yes she changes yes she gets depressed eh then she gets very excited she was, was under medication already for like fifteen years she's been under medication
mm
so that also I think that contributed to that because well at the beginning one realizes and but already with the years it seems that that disease develops more
and well ah yes, that has been one of the parts that has affected us a lot
as a couple sure
to all of us and I've tried but every time I try to be nice or try to have a dialogue with her
yes, oh that's so bad
she waits for the moment to hit me, no and then eh that has been very hard and it hasn't been hard because we are already divorced and all but it has been hard because she has not wanted
to move forward and I pray to God to give her a good man so that she's calm and doesn't bother me anymore
sure ah look
so, when I got married, I have a two and a half year old daughter and we are so happy, the kid, we have, my current wife
oh the boy is, she's with him since he was six years old and she treats him like he was his own.
that's nice
and at the same time she says, I'm not his mother but I love him as if I were his mom and they get along just fine.
that's so sweet, isn't it?
yes well, I honestly have had to really make an effort and he has too, he's good to my daughter, when she was born he and my wife
would spend the whole night by her side because I had to rest since I work and well they would stay up all night and on the next day I'd find the three of them sleeping in the same bed and with the baby between them and
that's nice
oh well, thank God, I've worked so hard, I've made so many sacrifices and
it's hard
and efforts because, let me tell you, it's been hard. What made you go to Philadelphia?
and I well, I came here to work, I actually study biology in Argentina.
oh yes, aha, aha.
and well I had the opportunity to get a job for two or three years in here so we came here, yes
that's nice, nice, yes, Philadelphia is obviously not like New York, have you been to New York?
not yet, I'm about an hour away from it and I've been here for a year and I still haven't been there.
oh, yes, you should go visit and you'd see how much energy that city has, well you should visit the Argentinian neighborhoods.
and there are, yes yes, lots of them, yes lots of Argentinians and Uruguayans.
there are lots of Argentinians there, yes, oh that's nice.
yes yes, the neighborhood has changed a lot oh, its name is Jackson Heights.
How is the neighborhood called? Jackson Heights.
yes Jackson Heights and the wave of Colombians was in the seventies and well after that their way of living got better and between the, in the eighties came the Argentinians, Uruguayans, Ecuadorians
and took the place many of the Colombians went to the outside where there were better houses well the neighborhood is not bad it is very good and
are they apartments
but if you improve your way of - economy and then you want something better
of course, ah
and then now all the Mexican are there now are all Mexicans in that area but there still eh eh Argentinian restaurants that have steaks an and yes yes
oh how delicious here there are not, here there is not any Argentinian restaurant
yes it is a miracle because I understand that there is even a Cuban restaurant there, yes yes, yes yes
yes, yes yes there is, there is a very nice Cuban restaurant, I have nor gone but the outside is beautiful but not Argentinian there is not Mexican well obviously Mexican here  they eat a lot
yes there are many there are many Mexicans here in Philadelphia I know yes, yes someone told me also that
yes a lot, there are many Cubans too yes I see I know a Cuban guy that worked in the cafe I always go to eat eh and my husband also worked with a Cuban man
aha, aha, yes well I work in television so I was working with Univision, Univision has a station there in Philadelphia
yes, yes
and well I eh do many business we are launching a channel right now in Direct TV from Uruguay
ah see
eh, eh Latin Television and here in August we´ll launch a channel named MejiCanal that is from Mexico
ah
and we are eh planning to launch a Portuguese channel also from Brazil so in that we are
ah look how good, there are not so many Brazilians right
eh don´t think that there are a lot, there are a lot because in Miami, in New York
ah yes
in New York New Jersey there are many they have their own town in New Jersey the Portuguese have their own town
ah look ah
it is an area and in New York too but smaller
ah
they are not little groups here and there but there in New Jersey there are there are many and in Miami I know there are many too
ah ah look that I have never meet a Brazilian the truth is that you know many Brazilians, they are very funny they are characters
yes yes
they are very funny well we are very near them like to travel a lot in Argentina we travel a lot to Brazil too, they are people very
ah yes yes Brazil I I like it a lot I was there yes yes I liked it a lot too, so eh Buenos Aires and Mar de Plata only
and you were there ah and what else did you knew in Argentina besides Mar de Plata ah and what happens in Mar de Plata beaches compared to Cuba beaches is nothing
well you know that I you know I like the atmosphere how do you call those cabins that are there
ah no, no, pictures
eh the truth is that I like it a lot yes the, Have you been in Cuba? oh yes the beaches of Cuba are spectacular what I remember, right
because I left it very young, yes yes a beautiful place and I have not wanted to come back because it is so sad not because it is said that
it is said that it is beautiful yes yes
Hello, good afternoon.
Hello, Mara
Hello, Mauricio's speaking. How are you?
Good. You?
Very good. Good, good, good, thanks.
Good
Eh, there was, there was, after the indication.
Mm
there was a question I didn't understand, that if breaking is what?
That if breaking is, um, hard eh,
Ah, okay
yes
Yes, yes. I understand the topic regarding the breakup of couples.
sure, yes with the age, let's say, if when you are older, is easier than when you are young, or the opposite.
Oh, okay
yes sometimes is easier to break up with, with the partner for some reason.
yes, I I think, as far as the breakup.
This,
that, that if one gets married, has to
yes.
for what it was, for the whole life,
Mm.
even if there are exceptions.
Mm.
I say about the exceptions, why? because, nowadays, the couples get married easily, and they divorce even more easily.
Totally, I agree, yes.
Then, eh, I, I think that it doesn't make sense, to get married, promise each other
Mm
love for the whole life, in wealth, and in poverty, in sickness, in health, in all, what the notary says, or what the judge says, or what the priest says,
Mm.
or the priest, or the pastor, whatever,
yes.
to later easily say no. I mean, is not, is not a game. Because there are lives ahead.
Mm.
Starting with the life of each one,
yes, especially if you have, yes.
second if there are kids, there is even worse.
If there are kids, yes. For me, if there are kids, is, is quite complex the issue, let's say.
Sure, yes, and, and even without having kids, is, is, is hard because there are broken hearts, wounded feelings. Then, I think that, that is a commitment, right? Eh, is a commitment
Mm.
and I don't agree with it breaking. Now. What does one get, with getting rid of a person, so to speak? We say, okay, that's it no more.
Mm.
But, tomorrow we will need another one.
Mm.
And, that other person will also have problems. Because, nobody, there's no perfect person.
Ah, no, that of course yes.
Exactly. Then, eh, is changing the, the good thing that one had , or the bad, another person will also have that good or bad.
Also, I tell you, depends, for me, also, what is the bad thing a person has. Because, if you tell me, for example, excuse me
yes.
that I don't know what, suppose that your husband or your wife, well, depends if it's a woman or man, um, has been unfaithful, for example,
Aha, yes, of course.
or if has a problem, for example, I don't know, that is violent-
yes, of homosexuality
or that he's violent, for example,
yes.
or of drugs, or of alcoholism,
I agree, yes.
see? All, I mean, it all depends, especially if you have kids, let's say. If I have kids,
Aha.
and was with someone, I don't know, who's an alcoholic, or that, or that is violent.
Sure, it's a problem.
Do I want to give my children a home like that, have them grow up with a father like that? No, I mean, so
yes, sure and with a bad example. That's why I,
sure, exactly, exactly
I believe that, oh, I don't agree with that, with some exceptions, for example, the ones that you just mentioned
Sure, yes.
oh, certainly. Because,
yes, yes, yes.
if there's violence. A woman can't, they shouldn't stand to live like that.
Sure, exactly
A drunk man, or a criminal,
Sure, sure.
or an immoral person, or a cheater.
Absolutely.
And, no, no, no, we are not subject to
Sure.
to live having to carry the other person because the other person is not
Exactly, yes, yes, yes.
We can forgive them,
Well, but,
There's the option of forgiveness, as long as the other person corrects its path
Like, like, as long as, being
i'm sorry?
Yes
As long as the other person corrects it's proceedings, right?
Uh huh, yes
Well, it could have, uh, made a mistake, right?, but, yeah, in case of adultery
Uh huh, yes, yes, yes, i understand
And, asks for forgiveness, and corrects its, its, its proceedings, i think it's worth taking that opportunity
Yes, uh huh, yes, what do i know?, there's also people that don't, for example, i don't know if i could forgive that
Yeah, sure, that's why, uh, but it's only a choice
I don't know if i could forgive
You take it or leave it, the person
No, yeah, oh, no, no, totally, i concur, i concur, yes, yes
Yes
I, in particular, don't think i can forgive that sort of, yeah, no, no
Yeah, it must be hard
It's very serious to me
Yes, yes, sure, it must be hard. But, but, there is people who do
Yes, yes, yes, no, and i respect [them].
And, for love itself, right? for love itself.
Mm, yes, Mm.
For love itself. Then, but, no, I don't agree and I don't share the the idea of a light break up.
Mm, yes.
And, maybe, as far as the old people, the young people, I think the older people are more stable
yes, totally
that have been around in life, the experience. True?
Mm. yes.
Eh, while the young people no. And,
Is, yes, there's more
and the, the young people easily break, break relationships and they don't care about anything.
Mm. mm. yes,
Though, there must be some mature young people. Right?
yes, yes, yes, is because of the inexperience, the impulsiveness. I believe you must have patience, in love, you must have patience.
Mm, yes, yes.
You have to have patience with the other, because we all have flaws.
Exactly, we are not perfect.
I mean, then, exactly. Then, if one wants to be with someone, well, you have to cede. I mean,
But, then, you and I agree that is not easy to break up, I mean it shouldn't be taken lightly, right?
Mm. No, no, no, For me is something, I mean, It all depends, let's say, but it's not easy, it's not easy at all. For me, it's not easy breaking up.
Oh, no, no, no.
I believe it's easy to break up with someone, for example, if you don't love them.
Mhm, yes.
I mean, if someone doesn't love the other person, well, if they don't care, they break up.
yes, I agree.
So, but yes, if you are in love and what do I know? It's a complex, complex subject
yes, sure but so, oh, that's where love comes in because, if you are in love, that triggers a lot of things that
Mhm.
take you to, to act, in a correct way,
Mhm.
although we can still fail, right? But, but,
you do your best
but, lets say, occasionally, exactly, exactly, that's right.
So, oh, breaking up, I think that it shouldn't be taken as lightly
Lightly, yes, yes, yes, totally.
It's not like,
yes, it's,
it's not like, changing one's clothes.
yes, I'm sorry. No, exactly. Not at all.
It's not easy
At all. yes, likewise, um, I mean, one things is to break up a marriage and another thing is to break, for example, I don't know, a courtship
The courtship, mm, yes, of course.
and of a short time, let's say, right? I mean,
Mm. yes, those are two, two different areas.
I think that, different, sure, because,
Because, because, the, the, in the courtship, the people are simply getting to know each other and preparing
is
for a step ahead.
exactly. You still haven't committed one hundred percent with the other.
Aha. We are getting to know each other.
Exactly.
We are simply getting to know each other.
Mm.
And, is a process. Then, there, I think that there, there is the option to break up
Mm.
without becoming enemies. You understand me?
yes, absolutely. I agree, yes, yes, yes.
yes, yes, yes, ah, without there being a need for
yes, because one, one, sure. Is that one, precisely, because eh, one has a courtship, let's say before getting married, to have the chance of deeply knowing the other person.
And, to say, well, yes
Aha
I am going to, to really choose this person to share my life with. And then I get married, figure,
yes
and I want to form a family, and so on, or well actually this person doesn't get along with me, or has some problem or whatever
Aha
and well, you leave, let's say
Exactly, and, and, in a good mood, just not
That's it
we are just not made for each other
Sure. Exactly, I didn't work out, so
As it is also an opportunity where the relationship turns closer, right?
Mhm, mhm
For instance, look, I don't like this, I feel like this, then the other person, eh, tries to correct and, and you can go on
So, it is a process of knowledge
Absolutely, yes, mm
where you can, you can break the engagement
Mhm
Right? who are somehow getting ready for marriage. Then, if they realize during that stage
Right
That aren't, they just break up. But i imagine they must keep being friends
Yes, yes, yes, likewise, i mean, in the way that, because you get attached to people and
Oh, yes, sure
lets say, if you love people, right?, uh, it's hard, it's hard that way, to break up, because you miss the other one, but if you know it's gonna work, you see?
And, it's gonna hurt, yes, it's better to put
What for, why would you go on gor?
"colorado" [red], like they say in my country, getting red [blushing]
Uh huh
a few days, and not your whole life thereafter
What, what?
So, it's better to be embarrassed for one day, one moment, than your whole life after that
Oh, it's, well, yes, totally. And besides, if tomorrow
Yes
you'll be forming a family, what picture of marriage do you want to give to your children?, the picture of a really happy marriage
Yes, yes
And that you want to be with each other. So, you're not gonna marry someone that
And, that's everyone's wish, because, i think no one is going to get married thinking "tomorrow
sure, yes
I'll get divorced", and i think that's a mistake that many people make
Uh huh
Precisely, because, can't they see it, they  have no consciousnesses about this being a real commitment.
yes, exactly, mhm.
So, they easily say,oh, I'm getting married and if doesn't work, I can get a divorce.
Mhm, mhm.
So, that's where the  problem comes from.
yes, yes, yes, yes.
That's where the problems start.
So, there's people, I believe that some people get married thinking that maybe, well not thinking, oh, yes, I'm going to get divorced eventually but with
that possibility in their minds, well, if it doesn't work out
Sure, yes.
I can get a divorce because, there's people, you know, the ones that sign prenuptial agreements?
yes.
it happens here in the United States,
Oh, yes, yes.
They divide their assets before getting married?
Aha. e-
In the event that they get a divorce.
Aha, yes. That's right.
Well, they live with, did you see? They get married but,
Oh, there it is, they are taking precautions.
And, yes, they already have a foot in the divorce.
Exactly. The first step, already, backwards.
Sure, exactly. I mean, I respect it, let's say, each one. see? do in their life what they want,
Oh, logically, obviously, yes.
of course. But, is strange, see?
Because we are here. Then, simply, a very personal concept, and very personal.
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. But, is strange, I don't know?
Same, each person has the freedom to think however they want.
yes, totally.
But, but, yes, there are people that lack that, so to speak, ability of, of committing.
Exactly, yes, yes, yes, yes. Totally, yes.
Hello Hello
Hello how are you?
Fine and you? with whom
I'm very good, is Sylvia, eh I'm Sylvia I live in Chicago.
Whom am I speaking with? With What's your name?
Silvia at your service, How are you, good evening?
Silvia, I don't know if we've talked, my name is Lourdes
aha Lourdes, How have you been?
From Texas
oh, how nice.
Listen, What was the topic? I didn't understand
What?
What was the topic that they gave us today?
I didn't understand either because I was busy eating and talking.
ah, it was, it was something of part-
It seems like it said that the system of
of couples, ah breaking up
The couple breaking up, I don't know anything about that
You know, when it ends, you know when the relationship ends
oh, what do we think, that if they remain friends or not?
yes but ah, and there are some relationships that are easier to end than others.
Oh, yes there are relationships that are easier than others, I imagine. Especially if there are kids, they have to talk to each other, be civil, not count
girlfriends you've had, either of the two.
yes many people stay in the marriage when there's kids despite being very unhappy
No mm
With the marriage
I aha, I did it, and got quite hurt, because staying like that was a bad example for my kids and, now they tell me, that seeing, that they weren't blind, that they saw that
ah, well that I did need a partner and that for them well I didn't want to. Then they fear that they're going to get
a bad man, that they don't know how to choose because they couldn't
A stepfather yes
Okay no, they didn't have the chance to see, have a father in their, in their home.
yes I mean How long?
But
How long have you been divorced already?
No well I've already been, divorced seven years but, I separated immediately after three or four years of being married, then

yes
Like that anyways, I wasn't going to look for a boyfriend, nor anything you see I stayed with my daughters and like that so that other men would respect me I told them
that I was married, and I would always say that, so that my friends wouldn't bother me and so.
Yes
My mom, but she did bother me, she said "marry again so that you'll have at least two incomes"

Okay, okay, that's fine, yes these are the hours they call every day right.
yes there, there are people, not me I mean I've stopped because I've been very busy these weeks so I stopped I said that only Fridays and Saturdays.
oh,
And you, you are receiving calls every day.
Every day I ask them but they hardly call me, hardly
yes the, the first times they would call me, they would call me but they couldn't find anyone to pair me up with so I said but this is a waste of time so
aha, that happened to me many times, I would wait and wait like twenty minutes.
um
ah well, this topic like I tell you I can't tell you much
yes well what I think is that in the couple each one thinks separately, each one decides according to the situation of each one
hmm
You know, and then there are men that it is easy for them because they are with different women it is easy for them to end a relationship and there is another one waiting.
hmm yeah
But then when you are married with children always, the woman always wait for the children
that is true
yes unless that, unless there is, that you are in a relationship that that the husband is beating her or something. and then yes, the the thing gets serious.
but
wow but I have seen many couples that get more friendly, or whatever they are best friends and because of that they get married
yes, yes the best partners are those who begin as friends
hmm
And, and you have met him for a long time and you get married
yeah, that is like that
But there are people, there are people that get married too fast without knowing each other later they begin to know features of the other person. And say hey who did I married  because I don´t know you.
then, the again when you reach our age
hmm
and you know someone, you don´t want to loose your time.
hmm it is true
I mean dating and dating for years and years
hmm when dad died
But listen and and do you think that you will marry again.
I think
Hi, my name is Miriam
Hi Miriam, how are you?
Fine, and you?
Fine too
That's good
Where are you from?
Uh, I'm from Lima, Peru, but i'm speaking from Toronto
Right
And where are you speaking from?
From, from Washington
Oh, Wash, i think we have spoken once
Yes, yes, we have, well, yes
Right?, about
I think it was immigration
I don't remember, immigration, yeah, yeah, ok. Uh, and, how have you been?, what do you think about today's subject?
Couple's breakup
Right
Well, i think that it depends, right?, if it's hard or not, it depends on how much in love you are, that's it
Oh, but, and do you see the?, the couple, i mean, it's not, it isn't, they don't get along, then
Oh, sure, yes, yes, but, uh, it could still be that, it doesn't work and you're still in love, it's hard to make that decision
yes, and it won't let you, yeah. It's, it's hard, right?
yes
And then, has it been hard for you in your past relationships, in your experience?
I have both experiences, it's been hard and it hasn't. I hasn't been too hard
Oh, it's
And, and you?
Hmm, I've had four experiences. And I, I almost, I've never broken up with anyone, more like they've broken up with me. Because, with the relationship, I've been like
a coward, and always like, like I grow used to it, I think it is
you wait for the other person to take the initiative
Eh
to break up
No, I feel bad, I feel bad about breaking up, I feel bad, I mean, I grow used to the other person
Hmm
And then, I mean, when I analyze the situation later, the past relationship, yes, the relationship was not working
Sure
because we didn't understand each other. There was a lot of indifference, but I didn't take the initiative, then, the other person saw that and took it
Right?
Sure
But I've never left anyone. I mean, yes, I think you should take up arms, and when you see the relationship is not working
didn't work, you have to say, this is it
yes. yes, I have the case of a friend that, she has, well, she had, she already finished not too long ago, she had years, years, probably ten years, with the person, perhaps
eight years, living with, with a, a , with a partner,
Mm.
and once, she ended it with him. What happens, that apart from not getting along well, they have very different objectives.
Aha, aha
For example, she wanted to get married and have kids, and not him, he didn't want to get married, he didn't want to have kids.
Aha.
Then, she knew, for many years, that, what her partner's stance was.
But, she, perhaps, thought he would change, eh.
I think, I think that she thought that at any minute, things were going to change. He
That, that's the problem. Aha.
was going to become more mature, and was going to want to have a family. But, before that time, nothing ever happened.
It never happened, and the woman becomes older, and later, she's not even going to be able to find,
Exactly, yes.
and the man doesn't make a decision, is true.
yes, Then, I think that sometimes one makes the decision when already, eh, is too late.
Yes, is true.
I would've made it much sooner.
Is that, you know? I saw once, the syndrome, in a book I read the syndrome of Beauty and the Beast,
Aha.
in which says that the women, since little shouldn't be taught Beauty and the Beast, yes, nor any, of those fairy tales. Right?
Aha.
Because it says that all those fairy tales, they teach them, and already since little, for example, Beauty and the Beast. Beauty eh, expected for the monster to change,
change, And the monster was a monster that was very, I mean, how they portrayed him, is that he was, like that, bitter. Right?
yes.
Bitter that would tell her many things, he rejected her and everything, and beauty with her, with her love, says that he will change, and finally, she gives him a magical kiss, I think, and he changes.
Right? Then, we, it says that the woman is born, grows up like that, with that ideal. When, one knows that the human being, when is already a monster, the monster when he gets older, becomes more monstrous.
Exactly, yes.
Is very hard to change him. Then, Would that, be the syndrome that many of us have?
yes, I think that it's true, I think that women think that they can change the man and
that cost us. Aha, with my love he will change, with time he will change.
Exactly. I - I will make him change, I will make him stop drinking, or I will make
Okay, And, is a mistake, because, eh, it cost, is a, such a big responsibility, one has to change one's self, instead of trying to change the other
yes, or change the other person. Find another.
Aha. Or find another, is better
yes.
Then, there comes the question, Do you think, then, that it's easier to break up when you are younger or when your are more?
I think that only for the fact of the age, that, I think that, the women think they have more possibilities when they are younger.
or more
Easier. And, in fact, I think that there are more available men. Because, since they are young, I don't know, they haven't been married, no,
Because, Ah.
in general, let's say. There's more
Aha.
availability, like to
And also, when one is younger, one thinks differently. See?
yes, yes.
Right? Is younger. Is more adventurous, more adventurous, I don't know, more possibilities.
yes, you don't think things so much, so to speak.
Sure.
yes, I think that. And, when one is mature, on one hand, also, ah, knows what they want, and, and, on that part also is a little easier.
For example, if one meets someone, and, and spends some time with that person, one realizes that no, I think, either way, because one knows more what one wants,
as a woman. Right? But, on the other hand, is the thing of the age, and all that, there are women that think that they won't find another partner,
Right? And, and they stay there, in a relationship
and they stay there with him, with the monster, like you say.
I, What can I tell you? Already, the monster, the monster is made but. I tell you also, because my children's father, each, each year that goes by, he becomes more of a monster, doesn't change.
And, finally, we have left each other several times,
Sure.
we have left each other several times. We've gone back, but, this last one now, just last week, I made the decision, and told him, You know what? this is over, I told him.
But, perhaps, he takes it as a joke. Because, we have broken up so many times,
Sure.
that, I don't know. But, I want him to change because not I'm changing, I mean, in my maturity, I'm becoming Christian, I go to church,
How old are you?
I'm forty.
Ah.
You?
Thirty five.
Oh, you seem young. I, You remember what I told you? You sound like a young girl. And then, I'm becoming very Christian. Oh, I met him when I was thirty four, see?
Sure.
Then, my monster doesn't change. And I, we had a son, and he, nothing, he alone, like he wanted only not even the boy's responsibility, is only mine.
Sure.
He just comes and that's it, and later, bye. And, me suffering there with the boy. Then, I cut him loose twice, because of that. I told him, no, if you don't want to get married and have the responsibility of the family,
I don't want to be in, like that of never living together.
Okay.
But, then, he would leave and come back, and I would accept him, and again, and we've been like that. But, right now, I've told him that no, I don't want to.
Do you think that breaking up eh, is harder when you have a kid?
Is very hard, I tell you. Is very - is worse,is not even about the age anymore. Because,
You think of the kids.
I've seen, eh, already honestly when you are already a mother, unless the man really smokes, drinks, and not even then, I've seen
women that not even then. They receive the fathers
Only for the kids. But,
yes, yes. It is really difficult. You think of your son a lot
but, you know what? I think there is a, there is a difference, because you, even if you want to, you can't change the fact that, that he is the father of your son
Even if you n- I mean it is fact, that's all. And although you end the relationship, I think you must continue the other relationship
from a father-son point of view. Because the son does have a father, and he will always
Aha
be his father.
Aha
Oh, I think that, when you have sons, you are right. Breaking off is much more difficult because there will always be a a relationship between the son and his father
There will always be. Aha. Always
Although you don't want to see the father, he will always be there
Mhm. He will always be there
present, let's say
And so, those ah those meetings, the couple doesn't actually break off
Sure, right
You know what I mean? Sometimes you live a love-hate situation
Sure
you are together, then you split up, and, and it's an ugly situation for the children to see. That's ugly
yes
Really ugly, really
U- let's say, it's a little, like, I think
But,
they don't know, no, I mean, they don't understand, they don't know what it's about.
is a vicious cycle.
They confuse a little.
It's a vicious cycle, and already, and the children are born, are born very confused, they don't know.
yes.
But, What do I tell you? We have been separated for many years. I mean, I with him, we have been more out of the relationship than inside the relationship
But, and, When you were out, he saw the kids, right?
What?
When you are not in the relationship, does he still see the kids?
No, because that's what many men have.
Yes.
Many men are like that, vengeful and hateful. That when they don't have anything with the woman, sometimes they don't see the chil-
Sure.
So, my kid's dad, is that type of man.
Is he Peruvian, also?
Eh, no. He's Dominican.
Okay
Ah, unfortunately. But, he, yes, of other fathers that the relationship breaks up and, and they continue as friends and see their kids. See? Not this one, this one, if the relationship breaks up, gets away from everything,
yes.
and doesn't even want to look at the boy, i don't know, doesn't that hurt?, i don't know
Yes
Sometimes, yeah, he tells me, i want to see the boy, but it starts to
You have to talk about it. If you're talking about it clearly
Um
it would get better, right?
I have never seen a man so tough, so hateful as him, my child's dad, do you have a boyfriend now?
I have a hus-, i have a husband
Oh, are you married?
I have two kids
Oh, that's nice, that's nice, well, I'm glad, i
Yes
Because, yeah, because you're outside of a relationship, i mean, and still, my situation is very sad
Uh huh
Uh, i go to church a lot, and that has helped me a lot
Do you have two or one?
One, no, one
Yeah
A little man. And yeah, i go to church a lot and look for support. And people is really good, and it's very nice to me. It's a different environment
So, i have gathered more strength, and i put an end to him
Sure,
And, I want him to change, he seems like, there, he sometimes wants to.
Whoever changes first, then, we talk.
Because, he eh, ah, Who changes first?
Sure. Then you talk, let him change first, and then talk with him
Well, yes. But, is that, the people don't change on their own. I think that the people, I, I've realized that you can't change on your own.
If you want to, you need to want to, is true. But, you need a group.
yes,
Eh, you can go to church, or, or I don't know? A group of, uh, that sounds bad.
Hello?
Hi
Hi, good Afternoon, my name is Mayra
Wood aftr- uh, my name is Leticia
Where are you talking from?
From Philadelphia
Oh, really?, me too
Oh, yes?
Yes
Oh, look at that
Right
Where are you from?, uh, I'm from Argentina
Where are you from?, oh, ok, I'm from Mexico
Oh
Uh huh
And, what are you doing here?
Here, I'm studying, i'm on my third year now
Oh, where are you studying?, in
Uh huh, in the University
of Pennsylvania?
from Pennsylvania. yes.
Ah.
yes, I've already been three years.
Ah.
So then that the thing comes out
Okay.
What do you do here?
Eh, I'm here because I'm also in the university, but working, because my husband came to do a post doctorate
Okay
And well I also started working in the university so but I haven't been here long, it's been eight months
Ah, really?
yes.
Alright, how nice.
So, is, no is
Okay, and what are you working in?
I'm working in in a laboratory that does research
Okay.
in, in the University of Pennsylvania.
Alright.
So, and and well, and what do you think of today's topic?
Well I don't know, I have a lot of opinions regarding things about religion
Mm, yes.
I have strong opinions because I do feel that to live in many things, I mean that it creates a lot of conflict between other religions and between people and, I mean
there's a very long history, right? of religious wars
yes. yes.
and it bothers me a little that they are always excluding people, I mean that they are I don't know, that a religion has to exclude the other, and that ones that are not in that one, yes, go on because then they don't see you the same and things like that
yes, yes, yes, that the people
I don't know.
differentiate themselves by, by the religion that they practice, right?
yes, exactly.
yes.
Or that one can simply not accept the other, I mean, is not necessarily that they accept it but rather that they can't leave them alone
I mean, maybe it they would leave them alone, it's good.
yes, as is.
More peaceful the thing.
yes, yes that they can coexist, last that they respect each other, right?
yes, yes, exactly, at least that they have tolerance.
yes, yes.
There's a religion that I like a lot, is the Buddhist
Ah, really?
And that's not against anything
Oh, look at that
i mean, yeah, it doesn't, it has nothing to do with that, so, i like it because you tell it "hey, but what, and catholics do, well that's ok", i mean, that's how things are
they have a philosophy of life like, well, look, just be, like it ended up
Sure, sure
and they have no interest in fighting with others
Yes, i understand, i understand, uh, that's the religion that's practiced in Japana, i mean, in China, right?
that's right, yes, over there, over those places
Yes, yes, yes, it's interesting there's another way of looking at, i mean, seeing thins, because the truth is that besides, there are lots of extremists in religion and
yes
And they take things too seriously
Too much sometimes
Yes
And i don't like that. For example, here in the university, i think that you haven't felt that, because you're in the lab, but in general, there's a huge difference among the Jewish in college, that deal with jewish
yes
and christians, that some are, yes, they're very extremist, i mean, they're very orthodox, so much that i can't even talk to them, i don't want to hang with them either
really?
yes, it's
the christians, but not catholics?
Well, i don't know, Christians from here
yes, the protestants would be.
I mean, kind of alright,I don't even know from where, I mean from some that, but they are, you see them and by there
that the religion was like that one hundred years ago, I didn't know it still happened.
Ah, really?
yes, I mean that the people continued to behave so closed up, so like that, they can't go out, they can't do this, they can't do that
Ah.
I mean, I have a friend who lives in a little town where many couples either get married right after high school or during high school
yes.
and they already don't go to the university, and he says that nobody has a boyfriend before getting married, nobody. And nobody kisses another person, even if they are boyfriend and girlfriend
yes.
until their wedding day, yes, is like that because
No.
alright, I thought that was a century ago, I don't know
How incredible, I didn't know that kept happening on that level.
it's still happening, at least here in the United States, I've met many people that are like that and I'm really surprised, I never thought
I mean you can't interact with those people, practically.
no, is, is impo- I mean I can't, I can't talk with them, we can't talk about anything, because they don't do anything and I don't want to offend them or anything and is impossible
And in turn, the Jews also, exclude themselves, I mean they don't interact.
but that surprises me a lot They don't gather much amongst themselves. I have some Jewish friends but they are kind of special also and I mean, after all, they can only go out with other Jews
Sure.
so, how nice, they're excluded in any way
yes, apart there, there's many judges.
A lot.
yes, eys, yes, it's, it's incredible what happened, no?
Hmm.
And no, the truth is I didn't know, what the level of the university people was and all that, I didn't know how it was, I thought that
that, that everyone respected each other, that nothing happened, that everyone has their own religious but got along with everyone
Well, it's, like, how the whole world does this but the problem is that, well, so they aren't related, they aren't those, like, those who are really strong believers in a religion
have problems relating to us
Sure.
from other religions.
Sure.
so, but
And with the rest of the people, for example, I don't know, people from India, people from, I don't know, from Asia
There I think the thing is more cultural, like, there aren't problems, I haven't had problems with them about beliefs
yes.
nothing more than since it's cultural, they have their role and they get together with each other, and go to their parties and everyone for himself.
Sure.
But, yes.
Like you, you get along more with, with Catholic people, in some way, or, or with
Tell me. I think, yeah, I relate better to international people, I try to go out with international people.
Right.
And of course the majority of them are Catholic, but none of them are super, super, super Catholic, that is, they're very relaxed people anyway
Right,
and, they like, that is almost all of their friends are international, so, I think that when it's like that we're a little more used to, the same tolerance and what we were saying
What, yeah, the truth is that I didn't think that that meant so much, I thought that, that that existed, well, religious differences because, in fact in this country there are a heap of religions but
Mmmhmm
I didn't think that they segregated themselves that way
No, it's really interesting, it surprised me a lot too when I saw it, I couldn't believe yeah, it was like that, like wow, I never imagined
Yeah. Yeah and in some way you should belie- believe more, right? Because
Well yes, ah, they just can't or, I have a friend who tried to go out with a girl who was Jewish and he was Catholic and they couldn't because she didn't want anyone to see her giving him her hand
Because then in her community they wouldn't accept her
Ah.
so yeah, it's pretty complicated, the thing where you can't shake hands with your girlfriend
Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, and more than we
but I don't know
there, we come from countries where there isn't so much religion, or the other religions are very much the minority, right?
Yeah. Yeah, we don't have those problems, I don't think.
But there is, it's like there's an impressive mix.
But I don't know, I'm thinking about an example of of when religions unite a people.  Mm, I don't know, I think it does have, it is
I mean, inside a religion
yes.
that is something that unites people, right? I think,
yes, yes, yes, yes. it unites within the, the same ones of the religion. And with Muslims, for example that, do you also have Muslims colleagues and that?
Mm. A few. I know a few, not many, honestly.
Ah. Ah, sure. yes, but that's interesting what you are saying because well I always notice that the Jews help each other
Mm.
and that if there's someone whom to favor, they will favor, the other Jew.
yes, yes, yes, it works like that.
that definitely
yes, that's a fact.
that, that, is already like that but but I didn't think they expressed it like that so openly, right?
is is funny, I mean, maybe they don't do it on purpose but no, is more cultural, I mean, with that of having to go every Saturday all of them and all
yes.
well they get along really
Sure, sure
and yes, there are many events that are just for Jews
yes.
I don't know and maybe well they are the, the ones relative to the religious days they have, but well
yes.
I say, I have felt it a lot like that, I think that, I don't know if I have I mean, I have a couple of Jewish friends that I talk to once in a while, but good friends, none.
None, sure.
I mean, I'm sure that there are other people that do.
Sure, sure, I understand, yes, yes, yes, yes.
It's only that I have not I have not met them.
What part of Mexico are you from?
In the city
Ah, from DF
from Mexico. Mhm.
Ah.
Listen, and in which laboratory do you work?
It's a laboratory that works in the part of the of lipyd matabolism
Come on.
this like that that good this, and well, related to cardiac illneses and all that I don't know, do you study something related to science and with medicine or something?
yes, I study chemical engineering.
Ah, look at that.
yes.
Ah, that's good
And where is your laboratory?
It's in the BRB
Wow, where is that?
the, in the building that says  Penn on top, you can see it from afar
Oh, I know which one is it.
that building
Wow.
it's so high
Yeah, it's amazing, I love it, how much research is done here
yes, a lot.
I mean, the hob, the university is amazing.
yes, it is amazing the amount of research done in here, you can't believe it.
No.
there are so many resources.
yes, that's it, that's one of the reasons why I came here, well, yes, this is where the money is, right?
Sure, yes.
to do stuff, it's so much harder in other places.
yes, yes, yes, yes, what do you have? Are you on a student visa?
yes.
Oh.
yes, yes, yes.
Sure.
But, well, i work here, inside the university too
Oh, you also work?
Uh huh
Oh, well,
Of, work study, i mean, for undergrad's
yes
there are always work studies, so, you can find several jobs
Oh, that's interesting
Uh huh, uh huh
Well, ok, i mean, you can, uh, help, help support yourself while you study
Yes, that's precisely what it's for
Sure, and, yeah, yes, sure
Yes, well, it's like they check you, the package you have, and well, most of us get some kind of scholarship
Yes
And then they don't give you as much and then you have to work to get that much
Oh, sure, sure
And so, for example, i have a, i mean, i don't know, a minimum amount that the university makes me pay anyways
Oh
Plus my own expenses, there's still enough for my expenses
Right
And well yes, until Saturday, but really good, I don't know.  I don't think that they could do it in any other place, any way.
yes, not he truth is that pretty good, because if not it's impossible.
yes, yes, because, like, for example, if I were working in Mexico, they wouldn't take out the money to pay my expenses, I think.
No, no.
Hmm,
No, here education is really expensive, and
Hello
Hi- Hi
Good [afternoon|evening], yeah, good [afternoon|evening]

Sure, sure but not
that's why I'm asking you, it should be so cold up there

Okay, so, what do we have to talk about? I didn't hear, I didn't listen to the girl because I was watching a movie so I don't know what do we have to talk about
religion, yes if religion unites or divides people and to give examples, for example if Christians and Muslims would be close to each other if it wasn't for religion
for example if homosexuality is discriminated because of religion, things like that
that's so boring kid, well lets talk about oh
we can talk about that or we can talk about something else, you can tell me what you are doing there in Miami
yes yes we can talk about something else because I really, I don't care if you are Catholic, I don't mean you, but the people
yes
if they are Catholics, Christians, Muslims, as long as they don't do anything to me, I don't care what type of bird you are, I don't care.
yes, neither do I, neither do I, I, I'm a believer but
yes, no
anybody can believe in whatever they want
yes no, all the problems that this world has, and I'm going to think now, at this hour if this or that, no no
yes yes yes
Look, lets talk about something else, you know that here in Miami
yes
here in Miami it's all good, picture that, most of the people here are Catholics or Christians and once in a while, you can find a
as I said, a Muslim or an Hindu, those are crazy, the ones that have dots in the forehead and
yes, yes, yes
and they start to talk to you about the Bible, oh no, I can't stand any of that boy, well, tell me, are there many Hispanics in Baltimore.
How, how?
Are there many Hispanics in Baltimore?
lots of what?
Hispanics, Latin people
I can't hear you Hispanics eh, I don't know just, just yesterday we moved we are, are living in Philadelphia and now we moved to Baltimore eh in Philadelphia there's a bunch of entire neighborhoods that they are all Hispanics
but here in Baltimore, I don't know really don't know, I know there's a neighborhood that's quite full of Mexicans
yes
but but is a small neighborhood, is not, is not like Miami or New York where
you have, you have
there's a bunch
Have you been in Miami?

You know that in Miami they have some tremendous Argentinian restaurants with, with some delicious meat
yes
no I don't exactly remember what they are called because
yes, yes, yes
eh, I haven't gone there in a while, but in, in a little city called Hialeah and in one called Kendall
some delicious, delicious restaurants really.
yes before I take a trip to Argentina by there I'll pay a trip to Miami and I'm going to eat there
listen And how are the Cuban girls there brother? The Cuban girls listen yes I don't know if you've been with a Cuban girl brother but the day you get with a Cuban girl
you will forget that the world exists because these girls throw themselves on you as if you were something so delicious, I at this moment I'm in Orlando, but I'm going to Miami tonight, I live in Miami.
yes
but here in Orlando there are not many Hispanics
yes
almost ninety percent of the Puerto Rican population,  there is not people of other nationalities
oh
with the damned Puerto Ricans
no, it´s just
it is incredible
I think most are Puerto Rican in Philadelphia too.
you do not see
there is a dominican, a Cuban
okay, there are not many of us.
but the majority
it´s only us.
yes, yes, yes, yes,  In fact I only know one Cuban that works near my job.
in fact everyone I know are from Argentina
of course
I know most of those who are almost all Puerto Ricans
I believe that among Puerto Ricans and Mexicans make the Hispanic population in the country
yes, yes,
I came to Orlando two or three times only.
yes
but I've never, I've never stayed more than a week and I spent like a month here on vacation
yes
and and, I say damn maybe I move up there, let me see how things are, a very nice city. eh, there are a lot of people, the people are very nice and all that but,
damn when, when you don't find people from your country
yes, is, is
come on one feels a little, excluded, you understand me because one likes to have the
yes, yes, yes
though, though you are Hispanic and I'm Hispanic, we have the same blood you could say
yes,
but always, is always nice is good finding a person who you can, you know, who understands your jokes,
yes because
to talk to you clearly
sure yes, yes, yes besides, even things like the food there are different some customs, is, is good someone like from the same country, right
sure
yes, yes
in, is very interesting to know the customs of other people, but I always in Miami wake up in the morning that I'm going to work, and I always stop in a little store, any store I stop
and there are two or three different people but at least there's a Cuban you know one can talk drinking a coffee
yes, yes
this one saying that if my wife was unfaithful. You understand me?
yes
It's the, no, I take her and I push her against the wall and I'm like no, but fuck, you can find the Puerto Ricans upstairs and I have nothing against the Puerto Ricans but fuck they are all criminals.
oh oh, at least here in Miami, the Puerto Ricans are nice people but the ones upstairs are all a bunch of criminals.
oh yes
they have gold teeth and their pants are showing their asses, come on bro, are you showing me your ass? You are wearing the pants in your knees! What's up with you? Are you crazy or what?
oh yes, I see
yes, they are dressed as if they were black people with golden teeth and with your ass showing, look, I got up the other day and I told him, hey bro can't you pull your pants up or what, or wear a skirt then or something.
wow, one, or a belt, if you want I can buy you a belt because every time that I see him in the morning, his pants are half way his ass
come on, what's your problem! Do you want them to stick it on you or are you selling yourself for twenty five cents? What's your problem.
sure, sure
But oh no, they are nice people, fuck you don't have their, their, their
yes, yes
you are from Puerto Rico you are Hispanics, you can have your own personality, why do you have to act like the rest, no, no, no, I get crazy, I can't live like that man!
yes but Puerto Rico is a very particular case because they have so much American influence.
yes, that's true.
so, they have a mix of traditions
it's true, you know, you are so right about that.
no
they think they are gringos and they've forgotten about the fact that they are not gringos at all.
sure, so, yes
they are Puerto Ricans.
yes, yes, yes they exaggerate some things there  I mean I don't know
let's say, let's say that I generalize too much, but well what I've seen here, is like that they believe that they are gringos and they speak to you as if they were gringos
no, no, no is that you are right, yes
and I see them I tell them listen talk to me in Spanish because I know Spanish and you also know Spanish. don't come to me with the English that you are gringo that you are a dumb ass okay, be still
yes
is that I the only gringo that has blue eyes and was born in Baltimore, in California that's the only gringo okay, you because you were born there
in your little country don't come pretending to be a gringo, no is that they don't even want to talk to you in Spanish brother
sure, sure yes, yes that's happened to me
you understand me? you talk with them, and you tell them a word in Spanish, and you have a conversation with him and he keeps talking English, brother talk to me in Spanish that I understand you.
yes
What's wrong with you? Did you forget where you came from?
sure
don't mingle here, these gringos will break your head.
yes but well eh And how long, how long ago did you arrive from Cuba?
oh no men I came from Cuba when I was I don't know. Let me see five or six years, I came
ah, very little
no, I came here when I was a little boy that couldn't even read yet.
sure
no, no I yes, because although although - And you how long ago did you arrive from Buenos Aires?
no, no yes we came almost four and a half years ago, five years more or less
And how did the country seem to you?
I got accustomed after awhile, like you know at first I was shocked because it was so different
it's very different that's true.
eh and yeah, big cities they seem like Buenos Aires a little but, like a city but no, the people are very different it's a lot more
truth, truth that people are kind of dry, they don't like
it's drier, it's colder, yeah
There's no, there's no warming like the Hispanic kind that comes your way. How do they say? y
yeah, yeah
your neighbor greets you in the morning and you sit down over a coffee, you know How's it going, how's your life? Here everybody just leaves to go to work and they forget about the rest of the world.
sure, of course you can drink some mate with a friend
yea
that doesn't exist
eh, I think that it's a very developed country but the, the people they're like brainwashed that, that they're like zombies, You know what I mean? I
a little and that is the other impression, yeah, yeah they are always going to do the same thing and they don't ever stop to consider the rst
yes yes very cold, let me ask you something, because I, I enrolled in a program it's, this, it's was like the second call that I got and I didn't ask them
the other, other girl, because she was Chilean and I didn't ask her. What's the point? of why you all talk to other people in Spanish, what is the, the
getting to the bottom of all this ah ah
Hello
Hello
Hello, what are you doing, Veronica
yes, Carina
How are you
What are you doing, how are you Carina?
Eh, see that we go the topic of religion.
We got the topic of religion, I tell you that I had a friend who was a priest.
No, I can't believe you
yes, he was a priest, and it turns out that later, eh, he left that, got married, but well, a big mess, and ended up a faggot.
Ah, I mean that, but I thought that the homosexuals within the religions I mean, have a better time. I thought that all the ones that were in, in the monasteries like, kind of like
had those tendencies.
Well you know that what he says is that in some way, he discovered his homosexuality
Inside the monastery.
in a monastery, precisely.
And you think that unites people, instead of
Sure, I think that, look, I think in the long run, the religion is like a screen towards the outside, of, of laws and of
discrimination, I think that internally the religion is something very open, that the people feel very free, that the convents or the monasteries are spaces where the people
can connect and this of the spiritual ties, wait that another phone is ringing, what a thing right.
Eh
This, this to getting a spiritual connection seems to me that also takes you to look for a physical relationship, because the whole religious topic, you know, is really
like really abstract.
It's really abstract.  It's like platonic love, and really transcendental.  So sure, I imagine that you must want to communicate in another way with people, no.
Sure, sure, so the thing that makes more material.  So, including how, no, it calls my attention that
that they sometimes use some objects, really cult to the religion like almost as toys, like sexual toys or for these kinds of ends.
Uye, but this must be, we have to ask your friend, because the truth is it makes me really curious but, I don't have informants inside the
the experience that they have through these, things to ask them, no.
Sure, look.  What called my attention was this, I tell you that what they think at times
they can repress the homosexuality, this, entering a religious group, or in some religious order, I think that in this case, the same thing happened to this boy,
and I think that in the end he repressed his homosexuality, entering in another institution
Until he left.
that is about marriage
Repressed his homosexuality getting into marriage.
That's another
And when did you he discover that he was homosexual?
So, I think that he discovered it when he was in the monastery.
And so, in marriage how did he fake it?
Sore, what happened well after, since he had created his, his sexuality, um,
It didn't work very well.
he got into a, sure, he got into a religious crisis, because he said that he didn't see God anymore, and so,
I couldn't see his face.
So, after that, he decided to leave, oh, quit, oh, leave the monastery, well, he met a girl and he was younger than him, a lot younger than him,
And he got married, the touch.
it's like, how?
He married and then I don't know.
Sure so, he got hooked, he married and all of that, but after that, he realized that, no, no, that's not him, do you understand?
I believe he should see, this, so
And
try the religious diversity too, he should try with a Muslim or a Buddhist or a Catholic or a Jew and that
But always from the opposite sex?
Well no, they could change and mix, no, we are talking about if religions unite or dived people, I mean, well, we have a  pretty good catalog don't we?
I had a friend that was trying zodiac signs, a Gemini, a
Sure
Cancer, Libra,
Aha
I don't know how did it go or if she got the twelve zodiac signs, I don't but
Sure, sure.
it was a pretty interesting experience, I'm sorry, I interrupted you
Sure, no, no, no, no, no. No, I can't think of, lets say, there are so many forms of, lets say, you have zodiac signs and then you can have
constellations and then other horoscopes that always have, you have constant resources to keep on trying.
Sure
Or looking for alternatives right.
But well, the homosexuality is something kind of fascinating, right.
Is like interesting, because I think that the interesting thing is the transgression.
Sure
Now, I ask myself sometimes, right, if religion can't be a transgression,
No, because they are institutions, right, Now there will be a religion that promotes homosexuality, because see that more than anything is something concealed, within, at least within the Christian religion, or in Catholicism.
you don't talk about that. Until it comes out in the newspapers, no, the
Sure
the terrible news, of what they do. But generally everything is covered there right.
Now, in other religions do you know if homosexuality is allowed or do they discriminate against the homosexuality?
Ah, I have no idea, that's why I was imagining how it would be a religi- a religion that would have as one of its selection criteria, the homosexuality.
I mean that, for, that- hello
Hello? yes yes yes. I tell the
that to belong to that religion, you understand me, you have to be homosexual.
Sure
As a value no, no like a
Sure
Is there any of that? We are already being delirious right.
No, no I don't think so, no, but I think that like sometimes, like sometimes I find it contradictory, right, because there's a very discriminatory facade, I mean this whole issue of homosexuality
so, but they let any kind of ideology, this, that goes against the values of my own religion, and if
punctually the Catholicism, eh, the evangelical values.  Like for example, for me it doesn't have a lot of this, hmm, much feeling and seems like they're
so absurd, like other things, the thinking of Catholicism and the liberalism, you know.
Hmm
Or a neo-liberal doctrine, and what do I know, in Argentina, for example, this, education, no, in the religion to be a good person, and recently
sustain a neo-liberal doctrine and screw with people to me seems more absurd than a homosexual inclination.
And it's much worse, sure.  yes, and besides, well, if you go to the priests and so, I don't think that this is prohibited or anything for the style, no.  I remember, I don't remember if I saw a movie, or where it came out this of
this, it's a passage of the bible where they read that there were perturbing things.  I don't remember very well the world that they translated and said that, that these kinds of relationships are prohibited for this.
Since it appeared written in a part of the,
Sure
I don't remember if in new or old evangelical.
Sure, but these prohibitions, I also understand them as a way, or a necessity of understanding the, let's say, the necessity of human beings to procreate so
to sustain the system.
Sure
So it seems to me that, that is has more of an economic connotation if you want.
Hmmm
That,
More than moral, or
well, it's that, but a large or big part of the economy ends up constructing a part of, sorry, the moral finishes building a part of the economy, because
if you don't have a family that procreates, and you have kids, they today, society grows, and how will you sustain the system.
Sure Well, and the marriage is also about that right. Is kind of
Hm mm
an, an, an economic pact. Let's live in just one house so that we both don't spend, let's
Hm When I think deep down you end up spending more.
really
And, I think so because you share expenses but you also do other things.
Sure
And if then you procreate there you screwed it up, because you spend ten times more.
Uh, there, sure already the finances transform into something much more communal.
Sure, and I think that in the - I think that's why the topic of homosexuality is so difficult, and, and, and, I don't know if, if it will get to be institutionalized.
And until it's institutionalized it won't be accepted, right. But
No, and I think that in the religions neither, even less, because they are more conventional than I don't know what.
Sure, because there you have all the tradition that weighs more than any other thing.
Sure.
Hm yes.
And how is it going with your friend, since he discovered he was homosexual. Is he happy or?
Sure, I think that now he feels, he feels better. Mm, as it happens my friend shares the house with us. And sometimes look that it worries me because since I have a boyfriend.
then, is like I'm scared that he gets the club, see.
you're scared that he falls in love with you? Uh, God how, how complicated.
yes, yes. But but well, like he can keep himself, like he says that he can separate the things. Mm, but well, and yes, they are like, or that, respect
but you see that also, like one always stays like that with the idea and I believe that also is cultural that one stays with the idea and the doubt, see.
Regarding what, the homosexuality or
That ah no, like you always have that suspicion there, and what happens see if I go to Argentina one week, and I leave them alone.
Ah, no. And is like a challenge right. yes, I would be doubtful also.
But I don't know if it's a cultural issue, no, that deep down the repressive thing emerges from me, understand.
And but would you leave a girl friend in the same situation?
And I think so.
You wouldn't be scared to leave if a girl friend stayed in your house, however with him yes?
But I think that there yes. I don't know.
There you would leave without any fear because your girl friend is loyal to you, or what's the deal?
yes, I don't know, I don't know because you see in, concerning homosexuality there's also much of an issue of how, behavior um like it, it's labeled
eh, the homosexual is like someone more, eh, more frivolous in the relationships, of more unstable partners,
Like they like to try everything.
sure, you understand, like they don't have a moral limit like
Ta
it already transgressed everything, they don't care to transgress even the loyalty of the friendship, you understand.
Sure
So then I think that, that and that
You distrust, of that
sure, look, eh, and, mm I don't know, like I'm realizing now that I'm talking to you, see.
And what are you going to do on your next vacation?
Eh, I don´t know, I think that I am going to match it, with his vacation, see. Because I prefer to let my boyfriend alone.
So, you don´t want, you don´t want to travel with your boyfriend.
see it No no no no. No no no.
Because that is a solution too right.
No no no no no No no no, because it is like, when we travel,
And it is to keep a
we are free, do you understand me. Then ii is like we consider an open relationship, it is like we give freedom to each other, to do good things, the things that, that could interest us, and later
could enrich the couple, do you understand.
Of course I think that have a homosexual one can enrich the couple, because you can ask a lot of question that others could not answer.
Of course, totally,
I'll be back in like twelve minutes.
Hello?
Hello? Hello.
Hello.
Good night, how are you?
I'm fine, how are you?
Oh, fine, fine, fine, my name is Marco and I'm in Philadelphia.
Oh me, I, I'm Roman, I'm from Argentina and I live here in Miami.
Oh, in Miami, I grew up in Paraguay.
Oh Paraguay, have you been here for long?
I, I mean, I grew up in Paraguay but I came to the United States about ten years ago.
Oh, good, well, kind of, I came here seven years ago, I lived in Tennessee five years and a year and a half ago I came to Miami.
Oh, okay.
Yes, I've been more
Religion, lets see. What is religion?
Which religion do you follow?
Oh mm. I really don't practice any.
Atheist, so.
Excuse me?
You are an atheist.
No, not necessarily, eh.  Atheist is to not believe in anything, in any case, I would be more agnostic that basically means more, eh, I believe in the possibility that
there's a superior being but I definitely, don't believe in the Catholic version, in any way it's certain in no way.
Eh.  It's a little, yes I've seen, there are several different, eh, I've seen several different eh
Culture, religions.
religions and yes, including, I've been to the sections on Sundays, eh, the Unitarian
Yes.
Eh.  And it seemed really interesting to me at the beginning but, eh, I went to the, during the summer, and during the summer they didn't do the
in the cathedral, like, in the bigger church
Yes.
the did it in a smaller place and it was more
Eh, where?  This is in Paraguay or in Philadelphia?
eh, no, here, here, here in Philadelphia.
Ah, look at that.
Eh.  It was a place that was more closed, smaller, with a small group of people who seemed fantastic to me.  Eh, eh, except at the end of the summer
we went to, they returned to the bigger church
Yes.
and it had the, it had the feeling, the same as the Catholic, basically, obviously of being from Paraguay all Catholics, always, the first communion, everyone
after a time you see basically if it's Catholic the only thing they try to convince every Sunday is the fact that we're all going to hell, basically
And, and each religion, no, yes, each religion, eh
everything, yes.
suffers because more she's also the person with the with the that there is, I I am Jewish
yeah
and I studied, and even more I studied at a high school in Tennessee hig-, Tennessee is a ah, a very religious state and they were all bap-, baptist, baptists, or all kinds of catholic
yeah
and the truth is that each one that would talk to you, they would want to convert you to their path
yeah, exactly
they wanted you
that, uh, uh you realize that it's eh, they are the eh, they are the Christians that are trying to convert the whole world
exa-
normal, ah, eh, the eh, that there are other religions that normally don't, don't, don't, you don't find yourself in the street with Buddhist that's trying to convince you
of a, of a, or a Jew or anybody else that is trying to, only Christians
yes, exactly
yes, they are in eh, they are in every, in every bus station they are in ever, handing out eh, pamphlets saying eh, you have to save your soul
you find your salvation in the church, please donate your money to one thousand eight hundred in one eight hundred
E
and so on, so on
Exactly, exac-
it's it's
eh oh well, that, that's what bothers me about all the religions that
yeah
me my family is Jewish but I in reality, I participate in all the holidays but I'm not much, much of a follower
I really, what I remember in Paraguay, that the people are in
but
theory, eh, in quotation marks eh, are big believers but, eh one thing is that you never see them behaving in a way it would be if they were really believers
eh they are, are going out, are mm, sleeping with the wife of another, are drinking, are eh eh, all, all my friends and the people that I knew
eh, were Christians there and of course, all are eh have eh sexual relations before marriage that basically means going to hell according
Exactly - eh
according to the Catholic religion
Yes.
eh eh, eh, and all those things, and now to top it off I had heard, I was reading eh a few months ago that the Vatican is
saying, is talking against the use of the condom
Exactly
eh eh, eh saying, even getting to the point in the, ah, the, ah, bold enough to say that the condom is not a way to
to prevent AIDS
Yes, yes.
is, eh, eh, are they maybe are they trying to go back to the times
old
past to say
Ancient.
ancient in eh no, the sex is bad, the eh you should never have relations with anyone except with your wife that doesn't happen, that doesn't happen since one hundred years ago.
Yes, no, no, the truth is that I don't know, it's a subject but I'm telling you, each person that is a follower, each of them they always try to, try to take you take their
opinion, to their path
Yes.
and and, it's like, I don't know if this happened to you
Sure, my path is the best one.
but
Sure, my path is the best one and oh, you don't know what you are talking about
Exactly. E-
oh, so obviously you are not reading between the lines of your Bible, oh, I don't know, I don't know, oh, it seems to me that the worse, it seems very
I mean, they are two-faced, oh they speak about the people, the people that do things that they shouldn't be doing but you know that they are also doing that exact same things!
Exactly.
in, oh, it's, oh, it's, it's very, they are two-faced, very, oh, yes, in the end the laws, you listen to all of it, you listen to what they have to say
oh, you, basically go to hell.
Pretty much and
Oh, oh,  that's the, why complicate things, why not, lets go straight to the point. We are going to hell. We are going to hell.
Yes.
We are all going to hell
Yes.
we sing, oh, oh, in my opinion, it's just stupid.
Yes.
it all seems good to me, it seems important, it seems to me it was very important, specially when the religions appeared, about two thousand years ago
oh it was necessary, and it divided the world into several sections.
No, and, if you remember how it happened
oh we are
all the religions started with just one and then each prophet began to express his own opinions
Exactly
and they started to differ from the others
Oh no, my God is bigger than yours, my God is bigger than your God.
Sure, but in reality
Oh, that was
we all forgot about the fact that there's only one God
Oh. You know, oh, it's really interesting, to me, oh, it makes me, I remember that it's easy, the Christian and the Jewish God, for example,
is Jehovah, it's the same, the only difference is that Christians believe that Jehovah had a son that became human and he was God himself.
Exactly, and well
Theoretically, it is the same and something that I really liked, I, I remember that I once met someone who was of the Bahai religion
Where's that religion from?
and no, oh, I don't remember, oh, I don't remember where Bahani's are from, it's somewhere outside Chicago, I believe it's here in the United States
Yes.
oh, well they believe in the nine biggest religions of the world, the nine biggest religions have actually, the same God.
Yes.
that because we are depending on the places that geographically and on the eh, h, that's why they have such distinct appearances but if you look at the rules it's rather, ra, basically it's the same.
don't kill, don't sleep with another man's wife, don't steal, don't lie, they, they they are basic rules, eh, rules
yes, yes, no, all the basic rules are followed by the majority of the world's religions
yes, they are basically the same thing, eh, the, the, what's different is that, that, how they interpret eh, the edicts that simply depend on the
eh the, the geographic region that changes the appearance, the, the kinds of
Ah, look at you
eh,
I didn't know that.
that is very interesting, eh, it's a very interesting idea, that at least, the thing is, I don't I believe I believe a lot in the power of the
the, of the human mind I believe a lot in the power of the human mind in creating, of, the , and also of creating a good story well only to create
yes,
eh, to create a story, that's eh
and well.
and, wh-, in a, a while ago it was a lot easier to convince people that if they didn't do what I, the king, said
eh, my
yes.
my, eh, my boss is the superior king, go is coming and is going to burn your house and is going, is going to send to the
hell to all the family that's basically- in the, in that way it was useful, religion. It's very useful in order to keep the rules
yes.
to the people, to the to the, to the simple ones, to the poor, eh
Yes, yes, yes, poor people as they'd say
Yes, it's
But, I mean, if I tell you the truth that they call a religion, in reality it's more like a, the destiny that we all have.
Yes, yes. Each one of us, oh I think that each one of us has oh, that other thing, I believe that we create our own future.
Yes.
I believe that we, oh, each one of us, depending on the way that we live our lives, that's what comes up, what turns out from, the result of
O- Obviously, obviously.
Yes, and and and that's seems obvious to me. How is it that it's so obvious for, but at the same time, it is possible
that with this, with this Fisher thing, that they connect you with someone that so strongly believes in religion
Hi, my name is Eliana
Hi, what's up?, my name is Federico
Oh, hi Federico, how are you?
Fine
Where are you from?
From Argentina
Oh, i thought so, how are you, is everything fine?
Fine, fine, where are you from?
Argentina
Oh, very well, where are you?
In Boston
In Boston, look at that
And You?
In Philadelphia
Oh, do you know Mariana and Lety?
Who?
Mariana and L-
Oh, yes, Mariano and Leticia
Mariano, let's see, who else, well, Mariana and Leti are my friends of
Well, Mari-, yeah, they, well, i know them, but they told me that, i started calling because of Martin, do you know him?
Martin and Soledad. You talked to them
No, Soledad, I talked to Soledad
You talked to Soledad, right, Sole told me, because
look, and you?
It's been a long time since I saw Mariano and Letti
A long time since what?
Since I saw Mariano and Letti
Oh, I don't know, I got Letti this week, I think, Hello?
Hm, hello, hello
Oh, I thought it had cut off
No no no. No, Letti makes the best pasties
She cooks great, and besides
eh, in the world. No, besides she makes the paties
I was saying the same
spectacular, spectacular
Here I buy the pastry from La Salteña
yes, here it is also sold in some places, but you have to go a supermarket quite fart away
But hers are spectacular. It's more than the party, whatever it is
Oh, seriously, so
She fries the pastry, it is spectacular
I have to ask Letti for the recipe. The truth is that they are divine, they came home, well I was now with an Argentinian friend of mine, doing an internship in the, my laboratory I got her,
Hm
and, the twentieth of February which is a  holiday, we are going over there.
Oh, really good. You will love Philadelphia
Really?
No
Beca-
I don't know, maybe yes.
But
No, is good, I don't know.
Letti and Mariano told me that is more is a line to Boston, but you have it cleaner, something like that.
And yes, Boston, Boston is much nicer, cleaner. The people are more pleasant. But well
Really, so much?
yes, yes, yes. But well, nothing happens. Is not serious neither.
Obviously, no, sure.
You'll have a good time, you'll have a good time, you'll have a good time, but
And also to know it
but well, no, is not Boston
Know another place also. What are you doing there?
I'm a biologist. And, and well, I work in a laboratory. I did my -PhD here and, now I'm doing a Post Doc
Ah, in the same laboratory?
mm, no. Eh, in the laboratory below Mariano I did my -PhD
yes
And And well, I already know Mariano, because up there there's a bunch of Argentinians. In reality, there aren't a bunch of Argentinians. No, because there some Spanish guys live.
and Mexicans, and, Paula, a friend also in common, works in, in that, in that center. And nothing, that besides they all know each other, we all know each other there from Argentina.
Sure
The only bad thing that Mariano has is that he's a supporter of Velez
Ah
That's a very serious problem that he has.
Ah, wait a second, let's see there if, no, because I'm here with a friend
yes
that was chatting with her husband, that her husband is in Buenos Aires, my computer reheated poor her, and it turned off. So I have to put it to
Man, and how long did your friend come for?
she came for two months
Ah, ah, my sister also came for two months to do an internship
Also biochemistry or biology?
She's biology. She's studying biology, she's in that, she's in the process of
Sure, wait.
of
Wait, wait five minutes. There it is.
yes yes yes
No, no, I tell her, to wait five minutes to turn on the computer.
Ah
Well, and ah, look, and you are married, because I also talked with another girl, who was married with a biologist, and I don't know if it's your wife.
Oh, no
From Mar del Plata. no.
From Mar del Plata, with Ines.
Guadalupe, something like that.
No, Ines is from Mar del Plata. But, but Ines, Ines is the biologist. She's not married with a biologist.
Ah, yes, is true, one Mar del Plata, that she was a biologist. Sole, eh
Sure
Soledad, is the one that's not a biologist, and she's married with a biologist.
Exactly. Well I, eh, now I'm doing the Post Doc in the laboratory where Martin works, Soledad's boyfriend.
Ah, and what are - what is it about?
Embryonic development, in mice.
yes
More or less.
Ah look at that, that's good
Mm, what do you do?
I do pharmacogenetics.
Ah no, I did my thesis in the pharmacology department, here in Penn
yes
and, and no, and now I moved to the embryonic development.
And what do you like more?
No, in development, that's why I moved.
Ah, really?
yes, there I pulled about, about the pawn of my thesis I had done one
No well
a little work with zebra fish but I worked with some proteins, some receptors of
yes
and then I did some experiments on zebra fish and, and well, I moved to the embryonic development.
Ah sure, not me. I more than anything do let's say, my thing is more clinical, no.
Okay.
Population studies, some control cases, and measure some Nipps variation, in the genes
And where, where, where do you do your work? Eh
In TAP, TAP University
Ah, yes
There, in a building dedicated to the nutrition.
Ah
More than anything my thing is like pharmacology, but since is in pharmacology where the, the drug that decreases the cholesterol is more than anything work in the laboratory of
of of, cardiovascular illnesses, lets say
It's all right.
So, look, well, we've met for sure
Do you know any more Argentinians in Boston?
Yes, a lot of them a lot, for a moment, he's a boy from Philadelphia he's Letty's and Mariano's friend, oh yes, lots of them I live with a friend, an Argentinian roommate.
yes
We met in school and then we have a lot of biologist friends
Oh, like who, for example, biologists?
Estani, Miguel.
Estani, oh yes, Estani, I know Estani.
He's my best friend, yes
Oh really?
Yes
Uu.
Why
I don't know if he'll remember me, Estani but
I don't know, lets see, and Miguel too
But,  I didn't, I met him at some meetings, I'm friends with one of Estani's friend.
Who, Barbara?
Gabriela Gabriela
Who? Here in Boston, no?
NO, here in Philadelphia.
Oh you see, well, Stani is leaving on February first, he's going to live in Buenos Aires.
Oh, he's going back?
yes, he's going back.
That's fine.
yes, and then
And have you met Sebastian?
Sebastian?
Sebastian
Mm, no.
No? Sebastian
Sebastian, no, I don't know any Sebastian
No? And well.
Maybe, maybe I do, but well, I'm so bad at
There are many of them
Oh
Argentinians
yes, I well, then, Paula, biology, Laura biology, how old are you?
Twenty nine
Oh, she's thirty four, thirty six, Stani is
Sure, they are of different generations
So, if you are twenty one, biologist, do you know Nicholas?
yes
Oh, Nico, well Nico is here.
Yes, yes, look at that.
With his wife, he's doing neuroscience and then, oh well, another one, I worked with here with the monkeys, Lula, they call him. Luciano.
Luciana, but where is Luciana?
No, she's in Buenos Aires but she's working in the lab that I used to do my doctorate in, in digital genetic prints, in the pharmacy and biochemistry school.
Oh, oh, but Luciana does population studies with monkeys, primates.
And well, she wanted to start doing paternity tests to those monkeys.
yes
she came to my lab to, lets say, my, my
In Boston, was she in Boston?
No, no, my lab in Buenos Aires, where I did my doctorate.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I see, yes, I was a good friend to Luciana, oh when we were studying
Oh, really?
Yes, in fact, she was my best friend's girlfriend.
Oh I see, which one, I know everything about Lu.
yes, really, Nacho's.
Oh no, I don't remember that one, I'm Marley, so bad. She's now married to Maxi
No, is she married?
yes, she got married last year, I was at her wedding.
Oh wow
yes, it was huge
No, well, I didn't know, no, no because I haven't seen here in a while.
Oh, you see.
I came here six y years ago
Sure, you left as soon as you graduated.
So, yes
Are you staying here? What do you think?
I don't know, I don't know, I'll see what happens
Sure, that's fine.
where, I don't know
I really
I have no idea
I want to go back.
Where? To Buenos Aires? And do what?
To Bueno- yes. I have no idea but
Oh you see, we are all in the same
what happens is that I came to a conclusion.
yes, what's your conclusion?
This new year.  Well, I'm going to, we have a, hold on, stop
yes
it's incredible how with the Argentinians, the conversations I have here at Pennsylvania are much deeper.
Why?
I don't know, for something, something we Argentinians have, we can talk about deeper things, you know.
And s- what do I know.
Well.  It doesn't matter, this is another thing.  But, anyway, eh, my, the new year, I stopped and decided that my life, I wasn't going to be ruled by work, you know.
That where there's work I'm going to live.  I'm going to live where I want and after look for a job from there.  And if I don't have to work in biochemistry or science anymore, I won't do it.
But I don't want to live in a, for example, Boston gives me all the opportunities, but it's really cold, it gets dark at four in the afternoon,
I have to live with a roommate because I don't have enough dough, I can't have steak, and all these things.  Why do I have to live in this way?
But how long have you been in Boston?
A year
A year and you already complain so much?
No, well, it's not that I complain, it's that I don't end up liking the rest of my life, this kind, this style of life
Well, but in Buenos Aires it's good, it's not cold like crazy, but it's, I don't know, you don't get to the end of the month,
they don't pay you, no one's giving you owed back pay for two years, eh, the scholarship you can get is shit, eh, only certain people win the contests,
eh, the subsidies too, and they are three thousand dollars, for years, to investigate, eh, that more, they work you in the street,
No but this is why I say, but you
you get kidnapped, express
Sure, oh yes, that's
and you are there, and I follow you
No, sure, sure, but oh well
They catch you and they put the money in a corral.
No, sure, there are thousands but
Oh, they devalue the, oh oh the three hundred percent.
Okay, no no, that's the
Oh no well, so
that's understandable, it's like you decide what to do, I rather feel a little bit of a danger that to the weather, my friends, my family, my people and
and the warmth, all of that but did you see? I'm saying this today but I might not, might not
Well, I don't know, I don't think that now we are here, oh, we miss a lot of things but oh, but
in the end, if you'd still be there you'd be complaining and here you have covered all your needs, do I make myself clear?
How, how?
No, I didn't. That you now miss things that, things that you left back in Argentina.
yes
but, in the end, those are just small things, I don't know how to explain myself. Those are small details that you miss
yes
I don't know, the people in Buenos Aires they spend their lives complaining that they don't have enough money to reach the end of the month, that money is not enough that
all of that, so I don't know, they can't go out to, to, to, what do I know! They can't the last week of the month, they cant' buy anything, they can't
go out to eat, they can't do anything, because no, I don't know, don't know, I think that the economic topic, bothers.
yes Sure
I've been here already six years, and when I arrived
Hello, my name is Mirian.
Hello, Mirian How are you doing?. My name is Karina.
Hello, Karina. Eh Eh. About the topic, Do you think that we women are abused?
Eh, well, eh in my personal experience fortunately not, I have not gone through that experience, but I think it is a problem of
contemporary society right? And, how good,like many times there is a taboo or an education in relation with certain things that we don´t talk about
it is a little bit complicated, to find a solution right?
But there is a lot of information, about the women should not be abused, police force now protects a lot women eh, before it costed a lot
it costed a lot for the police for example the domestic violence it costed a lot for the police to intervene there were trials and lost of money and all that.
To take into account women rights right?
Of course.
but Do you think that even so, women are abused? Even with all that information, with all that
yes, I think so Because the, the
yes, right?
the training and education in relation with - the laws that, that now act in a more direct and efficient way. Eh No, what they do is to protect women,
women but I don´t think they avoid it to happen No, so is like the, eh the defense law give to women, a security, that if she makes the report
she is going to be heard, but I don´t think that will prevent domestic violence So it looks to me that women are less afraid, they go to make the report, eh time ago it did not worked that way
the legal system, or the police I don´t know, turned a blind eye. The woman felt like, if she made the report it was worthless it was worthless
It was worthless, of course and gave the man more, more power
of course
aha, they were afraid.
You thing that anyway this is related to, somehow related to the social starta
I think it is. The pure American hits his wife, it's often seen, he hits her. The Latin hits his wife
mhm
Third world people hit their wives also, but now we are going to see in the ... I think it more often seen in the
third world countries. They take women as second class or something like this
sure, because, because you think that in culture there is a big gap
A bog what?
A big gap, I mean there is big lack of education in the Latin countries, there is a lack of
aha
eh, of conscience, right? of that problem, maybe because the Latins are more chauvinist, it could be so, right?
Yes, and not only because they are chauvinist, the culture is like that, women is intended to be in a second term
Because in those countries women are, you know, submissive to men and have nothing to say
Right, it's like she is educated to bear it
And poverty as well
Not just, let's say, a marriage that may not be due to love or whatever, but everything that comes along with that man, right?
aha
but, anyway, I think it's a hard to revert situation, eh, because it is a cultural matter, so it's hard, right? not only, I mean, you have to
promote new laws being created, about it, but you have to sensitize women, right?
yes
Like, I don't know, like educative programs or something like this, that
Look I once read eh a Psychologist that said that: The woman in any part of the world
mm
have the Beauty and the Beast complex
Beauty and Of what?
in the
yes, "The beauty and the beast" complex.
"The beauty and the beast" okay, because she says that with our love we with that story and all the fairy tales
yes
eh, believe
That we can change the man, mm
that, ah change ah, my love she will give, I'm going to give the beast a kiss and the beast will reason as
such a beautiful prince. Like we expect but doesn't know that, in the real life the beasts that we have become more beasts when they are already old, Right?
Sure, one
and also with so much abuse that the woman has put up with, sometimes she looses her spirit and all that then she says that: they shouldn't teach those fairy tales to the woman when she's little
Fairy tales, of "The beauty and the beast"
yeah
But no, I stayed thinking about what you were saying of... is true, the woman woman perhaps has this illusion that even though the things are bad and, and
and the man, doesn't behave as expected eh, she can change him right, but also sometimes it has to do with a problem of limits, Right?
up to, up to what limit accept Right? Something that is bad.
Well, is that, the matter is that is not about up to what limit you accept, what happens is when the woman
They are not doing it anymore, women feel they have no value and she knows that she has rights but she doesn't know that just for being a human being she is worth
mhm
Her self esteem is so low.
Sure
So, she doesn't know when if she's going to say no, sometimes, women I don't know, in our mother's years, they had to withstand this until their deaths.
mhm
How many of them left their husband, just a bunch of them got divorced
Sure.
But women are more rebellious now but they still accept those things, the abuse, maybe men can't abuse them
physically but they emotionally abuse them
Sure, that's why, there should be some limits
it's tough
No? sometimes it's not that much physical violence, yes
I see, aha
but a bunch of other things that the husband does, what do I know!
I see.
cheating, or, or, or, lowering her self-esteem, no?
yeah, yeah
And she should set a limit, that's why you were also saying, no
aha
so that to the best you think that with her love it is enough to, to make a change in attitude or you think that it's something fleeting or momentary
and it goes on building the relationship, that cannot be. I don't know, I also believe that another of the problems in relation to the issue of Family Violence is that
that also, it's like a social marker, right? At times you are a bit ashamed to make that sort of complaint.
mm. I think that perhaps if the woman thinks that this is wrong, I think that this was before
hmm
but not now, now it's expect- that the woman is more aware and will say, "If you abuse me, and that's as far as it goes."
Of course.
But here, you didn't see this information before. Of that, the, you know, the police have the right to protect every citizen, including
the woman in "Female Violence" of course
of course it's more the obligation, no, to defend
pardon me, the obliga-, the obligation is
yes
and we have the right to be protected.
Of course
Every citizen, children, everyone, right? So now there is a lot of information. I see lots and lots of information, I see community centers, I see pamphlets around here and there, so then
I don't know if it's fear, I don't, don't know, perhaps, perhaps one of the questions would be, "should the Government make some law?
Hmm.
but I think that the law should be regarding little ones. The law should be educating, teaching men that this is not good, and teaching women that
Of course
when a man, of course, when
It shouldn't let you
grow up and if you are abused by a man or attacked by him and he says things to you that are not valid then, it should end. It's not love.
Sure, sure
It's not love and you need to leave, get out and not let you be treated that way, you see because
I don't know how the legal system works around here, oh no, the truth is that I have no idea, I don't know if there's a law or something that protects women against
that's it, yes, I guess. If a woman goes and reports this
there should be
I mean, the police should follow, they should investigate or something
aha, aha, yes, because the police has been in trouble for that, there have been movies about it
for not answering to this reports.
They thought, oh, that's just domestic violence and they wouldn't do anything but there have been women that have been murdered by their husbands and oh, so, when the woman tried to leave them
they murdered them. And the police was not there. Why didn't they arrest that man if he had already been reported
They had reports about that man.
and all of that so, as I was saying, oh, they took the case, and the policemen are forced to protect the citizens, including the
all the members of the society, including the ones within families.
Sure, yes, yes.
and there it goes, in which State do you live?
I live in Washington DC, I work in Maryland. So
Is it far?
From where?
Is where you go far from where you live?
No, no, it's close, like I can take, it's a train and it's like twenty minutes from my house.
hmm, very
so I'm pretty close.  And you, and where are you from?
And what do they say there?  I live in Toronto, Canada.
Ah wow
But, yes, here too, like I told you there's a lot of training, but also yes, you see, I worked a lot with a girl and she was really young.
and she had hits on her face.  And she said: Aye, I fell down, I fell down, but it wasn't this, they were hits from her husband
And, and she didn't want to recognize
she didn't want to, she was scared, she was scared
hmm, and in the end when she trusted, yes
No, no, no because, I don't know where the issue stayed.
no
Even if she went out, but I told her: Do it, do it, do it.  But, I also gave her pamphlets and all that, but after, there was one time here
Here in Canada it's often the case, around when a girlfriend leaves, sorry, a couple breaks up.  The woman left him, India, from India.
yes, and he
So the woman went back to her house and the father received her and so the so-ciety, the man took it as a big offense because
in the Indian society, yes it's that, aha
Sure.  Other cultures have other consciences, No?
Yeah, yes it's that the woman left the husband, so she must be rejected by the family.  The man wanted the dad to reject her, but the dad
ideas that are a little, you know, more advanced and beyond his daughter.  Want that it's his your daughter
Sure
he had her in his house, so the man said that he felt really humiliated and he went, eh, and bought a revolver and
went to the house.  No one expected him to do it.  And, bam!  He killed at point blank who
The father, the girlfriend
And after the father, the father of the girlfriend died, the other sister died, and I don't know how many were there
how horrible!  This was in Toronto?
It was a carnage, no this was in Quebec, I think
Ah
It was a horrible carnage.  So this happened, when I advised the girl, I told her: better not to put myself
No, sure.  You made the association
Because it won't be that the husband.  Yeah.  It won't be that the husband says, she was telling me, and so I'm going to make carnage
Same I have the impression that in Canada it's a little more community, that there are more laws than here in the United States.
yes, yes here still, for the moment everything more or less the police respond.  They've seen really few cases
yes yes it's like everything works pretty well, right?
For the moment yes, but there are some small cases that they've seen, maybe on the low you know.  Because there are cases that they've seen of corrupt police.
Not as much as in the United States, because I think that the United States has a lot, right?
yes, I think so.
But here they've come out, a few cases really strongly resonated
Have you been in Toronto for long?
Yeah, ten years now
Ten years, do you know how long I've been
Yeah
going to an interview, because i want to work there, and I'm going there in February
Oh, that's good
So, I'm going to Wester Ontario University
Right
which i think is two hundred kilometers away, right?, from Toronto
Ontario, maybe, yeah, inside To, Toronto, in Ontario
Maybe, yeah, inside To, to
right, yeah, it should be outside of Toronto
in Ontario
Yeah, i don't think it's too far, and where will you reside?, right there at the university?
I mean, I'm visiting now, and i have to pass the interview, i don't know if the job will work out, but i'm very hopef-
right
ul regarding Canada, because i have been there several times for visit in Mon-
right
Good evening, Mar-, my name is Maria
Oh, hi, my name is Maria too
Oh yes
Where are you from?
Nice to meet you, in Pennsylvania
Oh, me too
No
From Philaelphia
Oh, Philadelphia, and, um, where are you original from?
From Argentina
Argentina, i am Puerto Rican
From Puerto Rico, look at that, are you also in Philadelphia?
Um, no, I'm here in Allentown
Oh, oh, but it's near from here, right?
About an hour away
An hour
Uh huh
Oh, oh, and it's nice, right?, smaller
Yes, yes, it's nice
Uh
Well this, well then she said the topic is crime against woman
Against women what do you think? I don't know, eh, I don't know what the laws are here in the United States actually
Well Well well I think that no, the laws don't sufficiently protect women. In my own experience. Eh
Look
I was married for awhile, with someone who was very abusive, I tried to call in the law, let's say, so that, I could help myself
yeah
and the law covered me but it didn't cover my children, or you know, because the judge according to him thought that well this that he never would try and hurt his children
Sure
Or rather, it's it's, not, it's not covering us sufficiently, because this, it' the easiest way to become a mother is to have a child right.
yes, and yes.
So the laws don't offer enough protection for women.
Sure, and, but What is the law? It covers or rather does it protect you, but it puts, the children
Well, let's go
he can continue being with the children, you say
yes, exactly, yes, nobody if they don't control, if not it has been
of control
violence against the child well in his opinion well not him, this, thought that no, that he would never hurt the child, because it's a child
Hm
I understand but
yes yes yes. But it's not like that, no, a person that's violent
it's not like that.  Hmmm
sure.  Sure, aye, how terrible.
Always, hmm
Ah, look.  No, I didn't know anything.  No, no, I'm not familiar with the laws here.  I've been here for a little while
Well, compared to, a, years before, yes it's
I didn't know
gotten better, but there's still room to improve.
Sure, sure.
Always yes, but So, how long have you been here?
Ah, I've been here for a year.
Hmm
For a year, yes, yes.  But, eh, I'm also here temporarily, let's say that, I'm going to return to Argentina.  I came for
Hmm
for, work, it's a two or three year job, and
Well
and after I'll go back, yes
Hmm
And you, for how long?
Eh, always, since I was little.
Ah, since you were bo- since you were sma- wow.
Yes, I was in Puerto Rico, I studied there for two years but we have now returned.
Oh, oh, I see.
But yes, well I don't know, because she doesn't have any options in the laws here, she doesn't know them, but how
I don't know them, sure
How is it back there in Argentina?
In  Argentina, you see, I believe that, I mean, I haven't met anyone that has that same problem. I think you can report it, and you have some protection but oh
I don't think you get too much, I mean, you listen to stories
Hm
of violence and also of
Yes
it's so hard for a woman to report it, for her to move forward because of fear and
Hm mm Yes, because the consequences are always for the worse
Sure. Sure, they have to take a decision to leave.
Hm mm
Because
Yes
I think that if you report it, then you can't go back to live at your house with that person and
Hm mm
it's much more, but I think that it's pretty common, oh, it's pretty common.
Hm mm
Eh, no, but the laws, actually the laws are like that, no, I don't know how they are
Doesn't know.
If they're very strict or not. I think that yes they should be able to accuse, and that yes they can protect you, to put an order, so that that won't get near, I don't know the name. Those orders
yes they don't talk about protection, it's like the ones there are here.
For protection.
yes
sure.
but like I told them, the, the, the, order of protection cover women
Just the woman and not the children.
Not the children.
Sure, I that no, I have no idea how it is over there, either.
hm mm
but I think that we should be lot more progressive, I suppose it should be similar no
yes, I would guess so because like that
How is it in Puerto Rico, do you have an idea?
It's more or less the same.
More or less the same, ah.
Yes it's, it's more less the same. It seems to me that the laws protect the man much more than the same wife
yes, and it's that it's hard no, I guess, also to legislate it. Because how you do it, what do I know. It should be, where you put the limit, whe- no, well, I don't know it should be
those things like uh, domestic, they are very difficult to regulate.
They are, difficult.
It must be terrible, I don't know, so, it's not easy, they are playing with, what do I know, people's feelings, I don't know, it's weird.
Hm mm
It's weird, what do I know.
Well
So, I'm leaving and which part of Puerto Rico were you from, from San Juan?
Oh no, I'm from Fajaldo.
Oh, oh, no, I haven't been there, I just know San Juan, I haven't been there, I've just heard the name before.
Yes, San Juan is the capital of Puerto Rico.
Sures, yes, yes, yes. I
Yes, it's a small island, with about two thousand, it's like one hour away from San Juan
Ah
Yes,
Sure, yes, sure, it's tiny. Its surface is
Yes, pretty,
Oh, do you visit sometimes or,
Oh well, the last time that I was there was last year.
Oh, that's nice.
So, I do like to visit, I have family there. So, I do visit often.
Look, one of my friends is from Puerto Rico and she visits every year, she's been her for a lot of years, like seventeen years.
And every time he returns, he wants to go live to Puerto Rico, because he says that is so nice, that the people have so much vibe, that everybody is
Yes is beautiful Hm mm
is that, is another history that here no
Yes, but now one goes, and it seems as if you were here because everybody speaks English.
Cla-
Almost the same
Sure
You don't notice the difference much.
That's true And you, how is that issue because now the situation exactly of Puerto Rico how is it, Is is a state?
That well there's always been that deception that they have there, there are people, the old people of Puerto Rico that think that it shouldn't be made a state,
Hm mm
and the younger ones say that yes.
Sure
Let's say that they see it as a state now
They are comfortable like that.
Okay. Yes
Yes no, they have certain privileges, but they continue being quite independent.
Hm
Yes is weird, is weird. What happens is that little by little the American culture is getting in.
Hm mm
Go, like you say, that everything
Has changed a lot, the culture for us, the culture has affected us
Hm
Already is not the same as the one before. Before there was more culture, though that always happens when one gets out of
Sure
of their country, goes to another country.
Hm mm
Whatever, but now even in Puerto Rico itself is not the same anymore. The culture has changed a lot.
Sure, the young people must be totally different to what they used to be Sure
To the ones before Before I remember that my mom or my grandmother would talk to me, and one would lower the head Now the five year old babies that look one in the eyes, and tells you, what?
Sure
Yes
Good things come in, but also the others come in
Hm mm, yes, it has changed a lot.
What are you going to do. And the English like that, everybody speaks English.
Yes, in the school, in the street.
In the street. Look, how strange that, right. But they keep speaking both languages right. Spanish also.
Yes, hm mm, hm mm
Ah, ah
Is that is just more, is quite modernized
Hm
It's modern.
Ah, that there are words like that
Eh, yes.
new and that, but how is it?
What?
Modernized?
Modern, moderni- yeah
Ah,
Modern
How funny look at that. It must be a very interesting transformation. You seeing that you go once a year right, or each whatever.
Well yes. I, it had been a while that I hadn't gone, and I went last year
Hm
before that, there were like three years that I hadn't gone. And each time I go to the island, I see some incredible changes.
Sure
I stay wow
Hm mm, And to come here is also much easier now right? Is like they have, much more rights to work, and to
they have papers and everything. If you get out of Puerto Rico
Well yes, because we are citizens, we are born citizens, yes.
Sure
Hm mm
Sure, yes, because you see a lot of people from Puerto Rico around.
Yes, it's very different.
Around here,
because you all have, you need pass- papers, and passports. Even though I have, I have passports for my children
Sure sure
But because I've always liked having one, but that hasn't been necessary, no, like other Hispanic countries because they need
Sure, sure, we need a passport, and visa
papers. Oh yeah, no, no.
Or rather, in order to get a visa, you have to go there, in Argentina, Buenos Aires, to the consulate, to see the consul, they sign it for you
Hm mm
they check into your past, it's a whole process, it's not easy, they will give it you, but you have to do a
Yes, I imagine that
a week of trials.
I would think that if Puerto Rico would say that, becomes independent, I imagine that we would arrive at a point were we would have to do the same. To get a visa and all that. I don't know how it would work.
Sure
But in the meantime, nope.
And how many years, was it like this, with the visa?
What?
Like way back, before all of this, being part of the United Sates, was it like this having to get a visa, like everything
No, uh, it's always good, to my knowledge, it has always been like that
Uh
I don't know, yeah, no. They've never been completely independent, they have their flag, this flag has a...
Sure
A star, right?, like the, the United States one
Uh huh
But their, the two
Look
But, yeah
Oh, i didn't know that, i thought that they had been for some time
What?
Oh, i thought that they were completely independent before, and that it just had been
No, no, not to my knowledge
Oh
I mean, i don't know that much to bring history, but never
They never were
Or from my grand mothers, i never heard anything different
Oh
Yeah, no, it was because the United States went into Puerto Rico, and from there the situation [kept] growing and changing
Sure
Yes,
Look at that, right?
Yes, it's interesting, yes
It's very interesting, yes, yes, yes, like
I'd be more about finding myself, uh, my past
Sure, and, but it shouldn't be
Because, what?
so, so hard, right?, to find a little about yourself
No, it's just going on the Internet and looking
Sure
Yes, but
Sure, and there you... uh, you, are you with your family here in the United States?
Well, my mom, my dad and my brothers, my husband, they're all here
Uh
But, uh, my aunts, my grandparents passed away, but they were all in Puerto Rico
Sure
I mean, the fam... lets say the rest of the family
Sure
It's all there
I mean, the closest are here and the rest there
Yes, yes
Ah, and they are all there in Allentown?
Almost no, we are, almost all of us are here, but we are all scattered in New York
Ah
in different parts. In Florida
Ah, they are warmer
Yes Yes Every once in a while I tell my brother to send me a little heat
And now the cold started. I don't know how it is there, but here is really cold.
Let's see if it comes. Yes here is cold. Yes.
Yes, yesterday it snowed a little, and it already started.
Hm, see, we still haven't gotten the snow.
No, here, like some wind with a little bit of snow. I don't know if it will pile up but yes, last night it snowed.
Hm mm is cold
Yes the truth is that the ones that are in Florida
Hm mm
Are to be envied.
I can imagine
Well and in Puerto Rico also, not to mention.
Yes, in Puerto Rico is hot too.
The whole year is hot, right, there?
Yeah, it's tropical
That's nice, that's nice
Yeah, it's tropical, we're great there, the frog that only exists there in Puerto Rico
Look at that
Yeah, it's called Cosqui
Coqui
It's a very little frog
Oh, what color?
I don't, i imagine it's green or brown
Oh, oh, kinda
Because sometimes they show it as brown, sometimes they show it as grey
Oh, look at that, and they go around the houses, everywhere?
But it's very little. Yeah, you can hear it outside, when it's raining and at nigh
Oh, that's nice
You can hear it singing all night
Luca.
Hello?
yes.
Hello, yes is, ah, Jorge from Los Angeles, eh eh, sorry, whom am I speaking with?
With Luca, I think we already spoke once.
Ah, you, Luca
Eh, Tamara is my name.
Oh, oh yes, how are you Tamara?
Fine, what happens is that I have a, have a nickname.
A pleasure talking with you. Well, the topic is all yours. The violence against women.
yes, exactly, but I don't know how the laws from here in the United States are. You, you, eh, have been here longer.
Ah. Okay.
Is that I don't know, eh, if you ever came across with some with some kind of trial of those or not.
No, but, I've never come across one of those trials but the, the laws are very eh, very tough in general
yes.
when you talk of all types of discrimination or whatever, or whatever, especially against against women, isn't it true?
yes, I can imagine.
Eh, basically, what are the laws eh I forget the questions that they make eh, if the laws are tough enough and, that's it basically, isn't it true?
yes, yes, yes, yes what happens is that, no, I also don't know how it is, since the, the topic, here the trials are by juries
yes, okay, yes, yes, yes, yes.
So, I know what you see in movies, no more, no
Is very similar
Of course, so
is very similar, is very similar.
and what you see in the movies is not so beautiful but
No, no, no, no.
and it is also the whole issue of sexual harassment  and it is very
That one, that one, the issue of, they directly of, eh, it is gone eh, is the subject of the day sexual harassment against women?
yes, no, no, the subject of the day is the law if it defends properly or not the, the women eh, but but well, the truth is that, no, no, no here
yes, yes, yes, yes.
but what I do know is that when you go to work, eh, lets say, all the, training courses and those things that you make
the first day of work eh, they include a lot the issue of, the sexual harassment
Oh, of course, yes, yes, very serious.
the, sexual harassment and, and harassment and all that, so, I imagine that all the men have it eh, below the surface.
Exactly, yes, ah, it does not looks that there is more emphasis here than in Argentina, that is what I see, right? what I remember
yes well, in Argentina the issue is that there is not, there is not much justice in general, lets say whatever, that is the whole issue, I don´t know if you
were in Argentina or, or saw the news what happened was eh, the Maria Soledad case, do you remember it? Right.
I don´t remember that case.
Fine, The Maria Soledad case is a case, a very known case because eh, it was involved eh the governor´s son or the intendant´s of
Catamarca that, so the girl was taken, eh, they got her into a black party and, well they drugged her and everything, and then she was raped by many
and they killed her
Oh yeah
and they left her, and all that obviously happened eh, not, not unnoticed but they did silence marches, there all the topic of the silence march which didn't exist before started
eh, a nun eh was helping her parents try to do justice but since, since it dealt with a powerful person, and more than anything, it was the son of a governor
and the Saadi family was involved
Your friends?
I don't know if you heard the yes.
What did you say the family was called?
Saadi.
Ah, yes.
Well.
Okay, is, eh, yes, ah, okay, finish and then I'll, I'll ask you a question
No, and all that then eh eh, it was a known case eh, but, but the laws are not for, for the women, they are for the one who has money in Argentina, but is a topic in general
Well, unfortunately-, yeah yes, yes, yes, yes, In what, what, in what year did it happen, do you remember?
in ninety three, I think.
Ninety three, oh ah
yes, and that was a girl eh, all in all, from a family not at all powerful but it was sort of middle class from the
In the Catamarca society
from the Catamarca society.
Then
No? A girl, was finishing a private school tell her I'll call her later
Eh, then basically what happened was that the gove- eh, the son of the governor in the party said he abused her.
yes, and well, it was a party where a lot of people participated.
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. But, basically all the, all eh, eh all was, was basically directed to mainly accuse the son of the governor.
yes, because he was the one that was there.
Okay, okay, and the girl, said, she died at the end, right?
yes, yes, the girl died.
The girl died and, and because is the Argentinian law, how
yes.
no, eh, the case, at the end, was the governor's son was accused or not?
Eh, they locked up, eh, the one that was locked up was the one that, let's say, her ex-boyfriend, who was like the surrendered
Okay, yes.
eh, and and some of , of, of the nephews of the governor, but not the son and no, I mean
Sure, sure, sure.
not all the people that participated nor the cops they caught, because the girl was in a hospital, because she had decomposed
Sure, oh, I mean, she got to
eh, and
to testify before dying?
No, no she didn't get to testify but the, the place where they took her they knew how to cover up the tracks where I mean, they took the girl to a hospital to
be treated, and since they couldn't revive her eh, the doctors or nurses themselves that treated her in that place, said, well throw her in such area
Ah.
so, this, since there are many people put in this.
yes, exactly, sure.
In, but they didn't all fall,
How incredible, how incredible, good
so it's good,
so, well, it was, it's very, this is very regrettable, this, it's, it's, eh
but well, yes.
it's terribly regrettable, unfortunately, sometimes eh, injustice happens to whoever or also against whoever with, with people who are more powerful in the United States too
yes.
eh, like, the United States is not an exception.  A few years ago, eh, not a long time ago, I think it was two or three years ago the trial
decided and declared guilt on, eh, if I remember right, eh, eh the details, it was, eh, a member of the Kennedy family
many years ago when I was a teenager,
yes.
the, eh, it's a cousin of John and and and, of John Kennedy, from the family
Hmm.
but he, when he was young, a lot of years ago he had abused, eh, a young girl too, his age, when they were both
teenagers
Hmm.
well, this issue was in, eh, suspense for many, many, many years.
Mm.
You know that the Kennedy family is a very powerful family in the United States.
Yes, yes.
So then, eh, it was a few years ago, eh, this topic eh, resolved itself and they were found guilty, in the end
Ah, really?
in that case, yes.
And that, he, he was imprisoned?
It seems to me that they sent him, to the, to the jail, it seems to me that he is in jail, etcetera.
Mm.
But that was quite a few years ago.
Mm
It was many years to obtain justice, and basically it was, it was a case of, of, of sexual violence.
Of course.
All because he was young, because he was a minor, they argued that he was a minor.
yes
and, and, that, because he was basically a minor in the United States, it's probably the same in Argentina, they have other types of rights, and besides the
yes, yes.
being a Kennedy he had a lot of money, and he had eh, eh, eh, the best, eh, eh, eh
yes
defense that he could possibly have had, well, and it's very unfortunate, then
yes, sure.
eh, he, he, eh, eh, the reality of the sexual abuse eh, or, or, or all type against, against eh, the women and the injustice exists nowadays
Yes. Mm.
and has always existed, eh and unfortunately how, eh, how the reality is, when the person sometimes has more money eh I don't know, the law like, the law, exactly, has more money
Has more power. Mm
means more power, then the law I don't know, is bought, is bought, is bought
Agrees with him. yes, sure.
and there have been many cases like that, but eh
yes.
eh, apparently those things are changing nowadays and
yes.
ah nowadays each time the law is being much more and more and more eh, hard against
The violence.
all, against all type of people and especially against the sexual violence
yes.
against the women eh, in the United States, eh
Mm.
luckily that's changing a lot.
It's good. No, and another thing that, that I saw, I mean, I don't know if it has to do with the day's topic, but is since
eh mm I work in a hospital and I always ask the girls that have kids what they did for, because the, there's not a lot of vacation here
Exactly, exactly
And, and, no, the subject of, of pregnancy license isn't there
The what subject?
The one about license for pregnancy, for giving birth, for maternity,
Exactly, OK
No, that doesn't exist, uh, it's like they give them, i don't know, i think one month, something like that, and they get back to work afterwords, and if they don't
i mean, they can go for three months to... i don't know, to give... to nurse or something like that, but no, it's without, without payment
So, that's, it's, it's really, uh, it's pretty crappy, a very complicated subject, yeah, it's true, because, because a woman, i mean
they have to give her the right to be with her
of course
son for at least three months to immunize him
Of course
with breast milk
Exactly
So, but no, i don't know if that's a subject of the day, but yes
Well, no, but it has something to do with the discrimination part and all that, I'm not very familiar with laws in that way
Yes
i know that, uh, i don't, i don't know how long does the law grant, i don't, i don't, I'm not sure
yes
I know there's some time, isn't it true?, of course
yes, but for what I heard
eh, it can be taken before or after, but I don't know how long it is
Sure, I've heard that, no way, the woman won't get paid if she takes three months
I don't know how it is in Argentina either, but I lived in Israel, and in Israel when a woman had to give birth and stay the three months with her
son, the first three months she got paid
Hello!

Yeah, where are you living now?
¡Hi!
Uh, what's up Emma?
Carla
Where are you living now?
¡Hi Carla!
Uh,
Everything ok?
where are you living?
Philadelphia, in the Five Hundred Ten South Forty Seven Street, you?, you too?
Me too, what a coincidence, right?
And, we're in the same home
just, they just communicated us, but aren't you living here?, you're away i think, right?
I'm, yeah, i mean, you got there and here i am in Penn, I'm doing a
Uh huh
A sort of internship
Hi
The baby is crazy
Yes, she's laughing, hi
So you, well, let's talk about the matter at hand
We'll proceed to the subject, it, it attains us
That's violence against women, right?
Violence against us women
And it's, i think it's completely justified, all these
Because like everywhere
And that, uh huh
No, no, no, that seems to be pure maleness
And yeah, they came out of a, but if they came out of a spank is because they deserve it, if not, we'd hit them
No, no, no, no, i don't think so, i don't agree, i don't agree
Sometimes they make you mad, like you want to slap them
Oh, no, because you don't
It's just a "take your place" slap, to help you find your place
No, because you don't
Huh?
You don't
Yeah, also, it could be, why not?
We'd have to kill you too
The thing is, no, no, no, you don't have enough strength, you say, right?, you're "the weak gender", that's the problem
Listen
If not, you'd do that too
What?
Hit the man, if you were stronger
Yeah, well, well, but men are evidently stronger than women
Sure, that, that's the thing, right?, don't you think?
I do everything a man can, let's see, sure, oh
¡Hello!
Hi, hi
Yes, i got bored
It's just i, the baby comes on
Yes, yes, you bore me, baby
Tell me, hi
You bore me, I'm talking to you and
Well, there's a lot of people in this house, that's why, the conversation is complicated, there it is, there it is, there it is, they're gone
And, could you go somewhere else?
You don't cook, maybe, and, do you really cook?
Sure, so, what else were you saying?, yeah, the laws were good
No, i was saying that men are stronger than women, that's why women can't hit them, but we don't lack the will
What can you, what can you say about violence?
what can i say about what?
Male, what can you say about male violence
towards women?
yes
huh?
I don't know, the laws are good, the laws of the United States  too
I don't understand the question
Oh, baby, what's wrong with us today?, what's wrong with us Argentinian?
I'm hearing you. I don't hear anything.
We are crazy.
You're crazy
Crazy,
But what do you say of the violence.
Nothing that here what it said is that, we discuss the laws, I don't know that in United States also the laws that protect the women.
I don't know the laws of the United States, I don't know them.
No, ah, then give me your opinion about the ones in Argentina. You don't know them either.
I don't know them, I don't know them.
The Argentinian ones, either, also.
Eh, also, the truth I also don't know them, but well also I don't agree with the violence.
No, but of
of the laws or not laws.
Sure, no, We don't agree?
I don't agree
We don't agree
Do you agree? or no?
No, me neither I was proposing that, that like for
To whom? a man that hits me.
Sure. No, for some law, yes.
A hitter?, I'd take him to a psychiatrist
A hitter, a psychiatrist
Oh, yes, yes, he evidently has a mental problem, because hey, to hit her
To jail, right?, to jail, right?
To hit someone weaker
No, to jail, right?
Uh, yes, well, uh, but a mental problem, also people who beats, people who kills, they've got problems
They've got problems, right?, they've got... it'd be
... murder, they have psychological problems
behavioral problems
Sure, the, the problem here is that they're leaving and you have to say hi
Uh, i think what we should do is
What
Let's say
What
The system should make it easier for a woman to report an act of violence like that, right?, there must be places where a woman can call and have
Well, there are in fact places
Assistance, uh, right?, emotional
There are places, there are places, the problem is that it's not very well disseminated, it seems
Emotional, legal
there are places.
Really?

Good evening, I'm Joe.
Hello how are you, good evening, my name is Soledad.
Soledad, where is Soledad from?
From Baltimore.
Baltimore, I was born in Puerto Rico, but I live here in Colorado.
Ah, in Colorado,. I've never been there.
Eh, are you from Argentina?
yes, Argentina
yes, I've had the chance to talk with several people from Argentina in this type of program.
Ah, yes you are the Puerto Rican with whom I'm talking. I've talked with quite a few Colombians in reality, up to know.
yes Oh yes
yes yes
And how are things there in Baltimore?
Eh, fine, in reality I moved here not too long ago. Um, at the beginning of the year. So like I'm starting to get used to the city, I'm not so
so familiar still so to speak.
Eh
But, I like it for now.
Are you in the university?
yes, yes I'm going to the university, that I still haven't started, I'm about to start in a few days. And, yes, I mean, I'm with, here with my husband, that he works here and well, I go to the university.
how nice.
So, yes yes, we are, for now we are happy.
It is curious, because people from Argentina whom I had talked to, the ladies all of them, are at the university, have something to do with an university career America
and have their husbands too studying there, and or, and have their career over there
Ah yes
yes the, some are from Massachusetts eh from Pennsylvania then now you are from Baltimore
yes yes, I moved short ago. The reality is that, we were living in Philadelphia. we lived there for dour years, Four and a half years.
Is there a?
It was time
an Argentinian population there? In that part of the United State?
yes, we know some Argentinians around there, in Philadelphia, yes yes.
Oh, how good. Well the subject of today, well is delicate,yes and I think that in, the law in the United States, uh protects a lot women, but there are some places
that, or some States that don´t protect them as much as others.
Hmm hmm
The rights could, maybe they don´t respect them. But here in Colorado women are very protected, and and of course, it is not permitted that
they are abused and nothing like that, but when those laws come eh for example, there are restrictions, like not being near them and that, but
sometimes they have to base on things, little details like the man has not done this or that, well, they don´t put pressure on criminals.
Hmm Hmm
And sometimes things end in a tragedy.
yes yes, it could be. I am not, I am not familiar with the laws related with violence in general. Eh, I know they are stable in all the States, but
it looks to me that many times, the, the major problem too, when there are cases of violence is the woman making the report, not, the
let's say that most of the women, in the beginning, they don't want to somehow accept that it is happening, or they don't want to, I don't know, they somehow believe the other person
will change, or won't do it again, or just once. This, or whatever other excuse the other
is using to manipulate them, right? Because usually, it is weak women, eh, psychologically, so the other person can manipulate them, somehow
Mm
I think that they come from, that maybe one goes to where there have been violence, and maybe they consider it normal
Hm
yes, and of course, it is never normal, but what I mean is that sometimes happen serious things, but actually
it is that they have not been well educated about the matter
Hm
ant the other is because of, feelings, to their wives, because I have seen cases in the TV about
the wife who is very tolerant because she don't want to break the family, because she is afraid of the husband, whatever, and unfortunately those things end up in a tragedy
Sure, sure. Yes, you are right. Mm, yes. About the laws, I am not very aware, but
about whether the woman dares to report or not, I think that after all, they usually have the chance here in this country
of claiming for respect, and get someone to defend them
Well, on of the countries where the rights of women are more protected
is
I know, for some friend's experience and from my ex-wife who is from Mexico, that in many parts of Mexico
Hm
women are usually abused, and actually, even nowadays, they are not given their rights
Hm, it is true, I heard that in Mexico the women
Or
can get the so, it is not easy to ask for divorce.
Society is very religious.
If the man asks for it, it is easier for him right.
yes, it is very religious society there. It is like eh, Mexico eh, Catholic, and to get divorce there it is - very difficult for a woman
But yes yes, there is divorce of course, What happens is that it is more, it is a mixture of hmm, of, of that family, the church, the culture, all that stuff.
Ah if not, eh no, the truth is that I don´t understand, because it is not that I am religious, or that the church could defend in the sense that
eh, even with the divorce It is easier for a man that for a woman. So that is I don´t know, it looks to me so weird, no.
Eh, that yes, but here not. Here and it is, when there is a question of divorce and
Ah
and there is not - the other parts because they don´t agree to be together, well it ends, and if there is a part that does not agree, and the other one wants, anyway
it ends. To, the, here what they do is to send them to a class first, before taking that final step,
Hmm
to see if they change their
Ah yes.
of,in some states that is a must right?. Here in Colorado that is a must. if one of the two parts disagree, does not want the divorce well
they take them to counseling. They have a, take the, take the counseling as an obligation, to see if eh, it is possible to do something. If not, well then it ends
the divorce proceed.
Ah I have never heard about a problem of that style, how interesting.
yes Well it is, really , it is to help sometimes, sometimes sometimes unfortunately in this, eh, modern age, anything can cause a divorce. A
fight, and I mean fight, but not a physical fight, but an argument,
yes
can end up a relationship, because it is very easy nowadays giving up to anything. I am already tired, I don't want to keep
married, whatever. So they divorce
Hm
And, that, is too easy nowadays, nowadays divorcing
Sure, sure, sure, I know what you mean
And I think that the, when you marry, the relationship is very deep
yes
And it is based, it must be based on love and principles
yes
And, well, things must be based ob understanding, respect, loving each other, and when these things don't work fine, then
come all the other problems
Sure
But in a marriage, in any marriage, there will always be a problem. I mean, you have to get over it. I guess that you, with your husband, you can't agree with him all the time. Maybe now you have a
harmonious relationship. But maybe in the past you had some fights. But you learned to work together
yes, yes, yes I think every couple has their own Code book, right? For instance we, I don't know, we never
yes
no matter how angry we are, we never insult each other. There are never insults
Right
So, since the first day we were boyfriends, that was eight years ago, so, we tried not to insult, so, I think that never was, never made such an insult, never.
So, because not, it looks to me that eh, respect is very important. If you don´t, so, do not show respect for the other person, then I don´t know, it is like it is difficult
eh, lets say love without respect, no no I don´t know, like it is not love, no.
Exactly
So but if, also other things we were watching at, at the university, I remember that in a class we were seeing that violence was not only
only the physical, but also the emotional.
Oh, yes.
Or, I or I, there is for example, the issue of insults or,
Very destructive Well of course
and it is mutual. In that of the men. I always hear that there for example today when they gave the topic of the violence, they said in the woman. It is also very specific. but there are also many cases that are the opposite.
there are many women who abuse of men. There are even many women, physically abuse of men.
Ah, it is fine.
The typical, for example, the typical teenager movie, whatever, that that the girl, I don´t know, saw the boy doing something she did not liked, and suddenly hit him, to me that is violence, physical.
Of course
It is that, and yes, because, it is like if you see that the woman hits the man, is like it is not so bad.
So what happens if the man hits the woman.
Exactly, I see it the same way.
the action is the same, but you see it with different eyes, and I always think that, it is the same. So I do not see any difference.
I think the same that hmm, in this case both should respect themselves, and if one of them break the rule, the two of them, are as guilty as the other one,
no It does not has to see the sex. Well if the person is male or female the one who did it, in the modern society and also in the past.
yes, the man does something, well, it's more condemnable.
Hmm
Eh, yes, what the woman did.  But, it's true.  The, oh, I've been in relationships where the woman has been, really insulting, and
and this demoralizes you a lot, and, it's destructive, very destructive.
Hmm, yes, yes.  It's very d- Never, I don't know, I think.  I try to, I hope I never do it.  I don't want to be in a situation either
eh, very limited.  Like with, with my husband always, I don't know how to explain it, for example I never knew, I don't think I've done it.  For example to be with the other person.
Eh, I don't know.  So there are situations where sometimes, I think that there you can but a little limit, no.
yes
Eh, that if an insult escapes.  No, I'm not saying it's justified, I'm saying that it can happen and well, nothing happens.
But the topic is that here, especially the young people, in this country, I see a lot, and in Argentina too, and from there we go and try to very
very disrespectfully.  So how it loses the value, I don't know, that it mixes
It's a, something that contaminates
the things.
the relation between marriages and courtships is what's included in the business, in the
Inge
William Hello
Christian?
My name is William
Oh William How are you?
Fine and you? What is you name?
It looks like we are talking again. It look like we are talking gain.

Very well and you?
Fine, I am cooking, a bread-crumbed steak, tutun, rice, black beans.
look how you punish yourself, ah.
Sure baby the more greasy the better, more energy.
They say so
Alright. What are we talking about today? because I was cooking my steak and I don't even know what the girl said
The, the woman said the subject was, um eh, where would you like to live? do you like the outskirts or the city? what would you rather?
Where do you live now? Is it city or country? Basically that. I live in the outskirts. Near Washington though. But in a small town, not too big
Oh, I have never been to Washington, but I've heard it is very, how you call it? I don't know the word in Spanish but in English it would be uptight
mhm
It is very uptight up there?
mhm, No, well, I don't live near Washington, honestly. Let's say close, but not in Washington
yes, and I never
I live about one hour from there
Have you never mer president Bush around there?
No,
hasn't he knocked on your door asking for the vote or something?
No, not at all
Shit, what a bad guy!
yes
With all the Hispanic votes he got
But
eh, but was the name of your relative, Camila?
Camila?
no, I was wrong,  It is that I have spoken to two or three girls, ho my god...
really, have you talked to someone else from chile?
yes I talked to three Chilean, that never happened before
and I think I have met only offer a Chilean in my life, and by phone I have known three
so where do you live?
well, you want to talk about that I live in Miami
so do you live in the city?
oh, yes definitely, the truth
do you like the city?
oh I love the city,
why?
because there are many things, there is always something happening, there is people from everywhere, but well what can I say
yes
I truly love the city because this beach, W e clubs, there are beautiful women around the world in Miami, I went to New York, I went to Los Angeles
I went to Tennes, I have been to many places in the United States and have never seen such beautiful women as in Miami, everyone is here
women are very sexy, the only girl I met from Chile, a very pretty girl, of German descent
okay
but she was very pretty
mhm
you should visit Miami some day
yes I've gone a couple of times
You don't like it?
Three times I like the beach of course, very pretty, but I don't like the cities I prefer to live in the outskirts.
Three times. You like to live in the small towns
Yes I like to live in a small city, not too many people, not too much noise, full patio, full garden. I like that, I'm not a city person, I don't like it, I lived all my life in the city.
ah aha
When I was little, and the traffic and the people, no.
But, but from what they tell me Santiago de Chile is quite a big city.
Is very big, yes is very nice, is not that is ugly, but honestly, I prefer the tranquility, with nature those types of things.
listen
I like to have my garden with flowers and all that.
ah, then you like, spending a lot of time landscaping putting your little flowers and making them grow
yes exactly, exactly, exactly
Ah what a thing, that's a very nice thing in women, is a very feminine thing.
yes but no, besides that with my husband we are very into peace and not night life.
No
No we were when we met, but honestly, now already
I, I ask you. eh,
we do other things,
Inge, I ask you something, How old are you?
I'm thirty five,
twenty- ah but you are young girl, you can still go out every now and then.
Well yes true. Neither of us likes to drink, no, we don't drink much. No, we are not too fond of it.
No, but you don't have to go out, don't have to go out to drink to have fun. A couple can go out to dance from ten at night until five in the morning aha.
yes but you know that we have two small kids, then
Ah, but one, is what I tell you, every now and then when you can get a babysitter or whatever you want to call it. And you go out, because I think a fundamental thing in a couple.
would be every now and then, not also do it like we used to do it when we were twenty years old, no but every now and then go out, and dance, and have a good time and
yes
go out a lot.
yes we have a good time,
How, how long have you been married if you don't mind telling me?
um five years, no six years.
six years.
mm
And how is married life treating you?
ah very good, very good.
Very good, Where is your husband from?
yes he's American.
wow ah But you made out good girl just so you know.
but really I was lucky, because he's a very good person, very good person
You know, we the Latins with the Americans, I think they can with us
Why?
because I think they are a lit- they have a more passive mentality
mhm
a mentality, we the Hispanic have more liveliness, more blood, we can beat them if we want
mhm
But no, if you are happy, it doesn't matter if you are American, Peruvian, Chinese, nothing matters
I think it depends on the peronality of the person, because I have never, I never had a couple who was not, like, stranger, but I never had a Chilean or Latin couple
never, no
No
No, I never
and
I had a lot of friends, yes, but as acouple it didn't work out
And so
Let's say I never had
in other words, you always liked the Americans
No, I always liked the foreigners. Because they were not chauvinist, that was important to me, they were not
now, tell me something, what is chauvinist to you? because every woman, or most of them have a different concept of the meaning of chauvinism
what is chauvinist to you?
mm, it's not just one thing, I think it is a way of thinking, a way of seeing life. It is not one single thing
Okay, explain it to me me so I can understand it.
Lets see, hmm For example in my country men think that, the fact of having much experience and many women, and going out with many at the same time, very macho man and they talk a lot in a way
so much dirty language, many things lets say,
And the foreigners.
What happens is that I studied engineering, so I was in an environment of men,
okay
then after a time, you know them, they are friends, and you know all how they think, and how, lets say that not every body is alike.
but, most of them are, a little bit sexist, a little bit,
Then, then I would not stay
less flexible.
Yeah, okay, then I would not be wrong in saying to you that American people and foreigners are much more flexible in treating a woman.
I well, I find, my experience is that, it could be that, that not.
you know
as American and European women are in general much more. emancipated than Chileans, I would say
Well see, I am going to tell you a thing, my wife, is American,
hmm
she is an American from Minnesota, now I am going to tell you a  thing, I am going to give to you an example, maybe. To, I am going to give you an extreme example, see it.
When I was with Cubans or Nicaraguans, or with any Latin woman. I told her, look I am going to go out on Friday, eh, I´ll come back, at two or three I am going to go out with my friends, we are going to go around and dance, you know whatever
oh, but you are crazy, what do you think, that, do you understand me, that crazy thing, they broke a stick on your head.
aha
My woman is American and I Always tell her that I would come back in a few hours.
well.
okay, I will wait for you until three oclock , You know what I mean.
yes
the problem for Latinos is the way we are raised as children, that it is not good for men to have a lot of women.
the men can have many women, as long as none of them has dreams of being wives, A men could have al the women in the world as long as the know it.
and you?
is is only a concept because I believe in my country I can not talk much about other Latinos because I do not know them.
mhm
In my country the men are individualists
so, how are women like?
they are the owners of the cows, in that sense
Okay, okay, and how are the women over there in your country?
Women are always trying to please man, dress nice,there is nothing wrong with that because everything is a game between women and men.
okay
but the man is usually the king and the woman tries to please him.
It is true. in my country of Cuba is the same but there is more equality
yes
for example you see how things are in your country.
I believe that. When I tell you that I have been to many countries in South America, as I have been to many places in the United States, I went to Europe, etcetera.
but in the Latin countries women live as in the 50
yes
you understand something like a trophy.
exactly
but when women leave their country and come here go all the freedom that women have here.
what do you think about us when we watch TV shows such as the following:
Hello?
Hello?
Who am I talking to?
Oh my name is Vilma
Vilma, where are you from?
I'm from Bolivia and you?
Bolivia, I'm from Puerto Rico, but I live here in Texas, where do you live?
I live in Maryland
Oh wow, way up there
Yes, on the other side
How did you ended up there man!
Oh yes, a lot of years ago, and you?
I've been here for over twenty years now.
Okay I've been here for about fifteen years
Oh yes, well, almost the same
Yes. Do you live in the city or kind of far away from it?
I do, I live, I live a bit far away from the city, about twenty minutes away from the city.
Hh mm, but
So, I'm oh, I'm a bit close but not that much, and you?
Yeah, uh, me neither, I live far away from the city. Where I live there's no public transportation.
oh how is your work?
Well, I have to drive all the time.
Oh, OK how much time do you take to go to work?
yes, it is about 20 miles and when there is no traffic I take about 30 minutes.
oh, but you like to live out side of the city right?
Yeah, well at first when I got home from Bolivia, I would have loved to live in Washington, because I 'm Used To live in the city.
Cars, people and everything but living in the city could be dangerous
yes
I used to drive in Bolivia and then I came here.
The roads are the same, the truth is that I got a little scare, I didn´t want to drive.
so I had to wait for my husband to take me to places, such as the market and things like that.
yes
Once I started to drive, I began to work out side of the House. So, now I love it, because it is very simple and calm.
the neighborhood, it is truth that when we arrived there were not many Latinos , until now there are very few Latinos that live here.
really?
Hm mm
what about you house is it closed or very far away?
Oh, there is a lot of houses in our neighborhood but there is not public transportation near the house.
oh, well but it is an old town that´s why they don´t allow public transportation.
yes
Ah, to, like five minutes away from my house, you can  take the bus that leaves at like six in the morning and that takes you to the metro.
yeah
but there's only one at six, and the other one is at night, at six. And that is all
Do you, do you have children Vilma?
I have, I have three
How old are they?
Um, my children, the older, he's already twenty-five, and the other small one is twenty.
Oh, ok, I wasn't going to ask you, yes that, eh, that's what I would infer about you, in order to move to the city. Because for me, that is what keeps me outside the city, having my children. My kids right now are
Hm
uh, now one's thirteen, my girl, and the boy he's already nineteen, but when they were smaller, that
Hm
eh, influenced me a lot. So that, eh, to live outside the city.
Sure that's the truth. When we came here at the beginning, we came to Virginia, the first year that we were here.
Hmm mm
and, the truth is that we were a little scared, because I think that already by the gangs had appeared, like those from El Salvador, and all that
Oh hmm mm
well then, mm well, to move us here, far enough away from the city, I that more than anything it was for my daughters, because they were just so small, and I didn't want them to have to grow up in that kind of environment, that
you know, that sometimes they go out and you lose your influence and all that
No, sure, sure. Exactly. But and everything, not that they're already older.
But
yes, and, and if the opportunity presents itself of moving, closer to the city, would you move?
Um I don't think so. But you know what. From what you say, it seems to you that it was far, but is not, because Washington
eh, the capital, driving is thirty minutes from my house.
Hm mm, sure, that for you ah
I mean, that in other words the truth no. yes, if let's say I could find a job in, in Washington in the capital. I would love to take the subway
but not move to live there. Uh uh, no.
Yes, yes Yes, for me, uh, well I, when I moved to this house, eh, the things were very remote. But now is like the city is catching up to me.
Exactly. Hm mm
So
yeah you're right, because here the same thing is happening. When we had just moved, there was a lot of space, that, uh, I even think there were mere farms here.
but now if you see, everything is construction, construction. It has totally become populated, that
Hm mm Yes yes
I imagine that perhaps from now to a few years, they will decide to put, public transportation
Yes, yes, they most probably will, is that they are progressing so much,
Hm mm Sure
so, ah, me, eh, the street, that, that's before my street, the transportation comes up to there.
Ah, how wonderful, so then you don't drive there in Texas?
Oh yes, oh, I don't go in bus anywhere. I've always driven, but anyways I tell you that, although is the next street, eh it's quite out of the way.
Is, is, is, no like that in the neighborhood, the street there, no.
Hm mm
It's like, as I'd say, oh, ten minutes.
Oh okay
In, between street, between
I see
oh you know, it's kind of far away to go by foot.
And also, oh okay
For example, my son, he's looking for a job but he can't go there until I buy him a car, he can't
Oh
I'd have to drop him off pretty early in the bus so that he could go somewhere.
Oh, but is your sold old enough to drive?
Hm, yes he does drive but he doesn't have a car.
Oh.
Yes, he had one, I bought him one but he had an accident and he totaled the cars son, no, I haven't bought him another one. I told him
Oh yeah
that I thought he wasn't ready for another car.
Sure. You live in the city's outskirts because of the danger?
Yes, when I got here, oh, I'd always, because the children were small, I mean, they were born here but since I got here I'd always tell myself, oh
Oh, stay out of the city.
Hm mm
because of the schools and all of that and now I'm used to it, but it is quite far away, so, as I said, it takes me around
I mean thirty, forty minutes to get to work.
Oh, driving. Yeah
In the morning, driving. Yes, are, eh, it's twenty seven miles away, but with the traffic and all that,
That's the problem, mm mm
Yes, eh, it makes it long-
Yes, that's why I, I leave super early. I leave my house at six thirty. Then I avoid all that traffic, and that
Yes Well, I leave late, because I take my daughter to school at eight, and then, I get to work at nine.
Hm mm So you live, you work in the city, in the city?
Yes
In the center
Yes, I work near, near the downtown of Houston
Oh okay. Uh, the traffic there must be terrible, I can already imagine.
Ah, terrible, I've, had to learn all the little, little streets that go by the back
Hm mm
to be able to get to my house, when I leave here. because in the morning there's not much  you know, much work arriving because I already, leave quite
late.
Yeah.
But, when I leave at five, five thirty from here to get home, I have to look for other little streets. That take me
Because if not it takes you two hours, hm mm
And sometimes those streets, and sometimes those streets also, because everybody starts to learn about those streets, and then continue
Yeah
going out to other places
The only, the only disadvantage is that, um, when it snows.  You can delay any quantity, it can come up to the house.
Yes, here
Above all if it's a heavy snow.
we don't have snow here, but we have, when it rains, eh, how they say, a lot of water, it floods
Floods?
Floods, we have a lot of floods.  Yes, and and and they don't let us go out because of the floods, it will be like two in the afternoon and I don't get back to my house until seven at night.
Wow
Because where I wanted to be, eh, there was the water was, eh, really high, and I couldn't, in the end I had to
You're talking about the recent ones that they had this, this past year?
oh yes.  And, and this, this month we haven't had it like this, but last year we had a lot like this.  And I gave myself up in the last one, stopped in
a gas station, and I stayed there until the water went down.
Oh wow.  And tell me something, and once your
Yes, but
your kids get out of high school, will you move or do you want to keep living there?
I don't think so, at least, I don't know, I just bought this house, six months ago.
Yeah
So, yeah, I'll stay here until I die.  Because I hate to move.
Yes, truthfully, I feel the same, I don't like it at all.
And the, the thing with this house is that, the elemen-, the elementary school is
Uh
Uh, it's behind my house
Uh huh
So, i mean, I'm thinking about the future, when my children get married and have children, well, they can bring their children to go to
school there, they can come to my house
Yeah
So, I've thought about all that, you know, so
You're really thinking about the future
Yeah, because imagine that, my daughter's thirteen, and my son doesn't even have a girlfriend, so
Oh, the, the, my oldest is twenty five, but she hasn't thought about it, so
She's still like
She bought her house last year and she moved out
Oh yes?, that's good
Um, that was sad
That's good, and, hey, what do you work in?
I'm sorry?
What do you work in?
I work for the county, for one of the counties here, of the school
Oh
Yes
So, uh, you work directly with schools or
Oh, i wor-. uh, one word, we work directly with families, we sign up all families that come from, from all over the world, that speak a second language
That were born in another country, we sign them up on the county i live in, or the one i work for
Oh, so you're practically with the government
Yes, for the government, do you work for the government too?
No, I'm uh, with a private company that uh, rents tanks
Oh, OK
The tanks that uh, carry beer or
Uh huh
Or
Yeah
Uh, chemicals, or different places, so, it's a private company, European
Oh, that's wonderful, yeah
Yes, and how did you find out about these studies?
Um, one of the counselors at my work let me know and, uh, and i signed up. I find it interesting, because you meet people from different countries and
Yes
that are in different states
Yes, me too, me too, i have been talking to a lady from Chicago
Oh yes?, can you get to talk to the same person again?
Yes Yes sometimes well, like, sometimes is the person that they put you with, they pair you up with a person, but I've gotten the same one twice.
Oh, how nice.
You know
No, the truth that I, this is the second time, because the other times that they've called me just happened I was doing something important, and I can't talk
Then
Yes
the previous time I spoke with, that I don't even remember his name, eh a guy from Paraguay I think, I don't remember. Sorry, what's your name?
Yes Oh Lurdes
Lurdes.
Lurdes, yes, from Houston, Texas
Mm, okay.
Oh
Hello?
Hello?, good afternoon
Yes, good afternoon, my name is Gloria, from here, from California
Hi, how are you?, my name is Mauricio, I'm in Charlotte city in North Carolina
Ok, nice to meet you
How are you?, fine?
Fine, thank you
Oh, well, the subject is cool
Um
Uh, about the city
Right
Well, uh, i like to live in a quiet city more than a smaller city
Uh huh, uh huh
Uh, that doesn't have a lot of noise, even though I'm now in the noise because i'm at a gym but i'm out now
Right
Ha, so i would like a smaller city, uh, i think that the one I'm in is a pretty small city, and besides, uh, so far, well, the part i know is quiet, right?
Although I've seen other cities like that, around Charlotte, uh, that are of a more like, more country-like style, right?
Uh huh
More country-like, and i like the city like this, quiet
mm,
of country, I was even, was living in Miami but we decided to come, come here searching for peace also, searching for peace.
mm.
Then, eh, I think that the, the best for me, for my family is a small and peaceful city.
mm.
I don't know for you.
Eh, well, um. Always, since little they got me used to more than anything to live like that, more eh isolated from the city, let's say, in the country.
yes.
But as I grew up because of the studies and all that, I had to decide already, so to speak, to be in the city, where there are more opportunities, right? although
Where are you from?
Eh, I'm from Guatemala
Is that Mexico?
No, Guatemala, Central America.
Ah, Guatemala, sorry.
Aha.
Guatemala.
Eh aha. And for the studies and all this I had to, let's say, leave to the capital, to the city
yes.
where everything is very different.
yes.
Up the the kind of people, and everything is very different, right?
yes. it's
But they go on, they go on adapting themselves to the environment, to, to the social frictions. And the house of my dreams itself doesn't have any
illusions because I know that maybe it will be fulfilled sooner or later, but I don't like wealth, let's say it that way.
yeah, yeah.
I like, uh, emotionally, sentimentally and economically, no, let's say not like a millionaire, but enough to pay for the necessities, right? And, yeah, my, uh, my dream house, of course I would like it
yeah, of course.
that way in a remote place like in the country. Uh
yeah.
I don't know, I imagine like a paradise
yeah, that's cool.
Um.
I my, my house and my dream, the, the, in a a little quiet tranquil place like you said, a little remote in a, in a, like, like in a field
but also at the same time close to the city where
Mm-hmm.
you suppose is the source of, of employment, right?
yeah, it's like that.
So it's, that's my, that, that's my dream.
Mm-hmm.
I had it in Colombia, but because of the problems there with public order and threats of guerrilla warfare, we had to leave there for the US with our family.
mm.
Because we lived in, in, in in a city, in a town how we called it over there, that was near a city, about thirty minutes from it and it was like that
the climate nice and among the vegetation and all. But well, here there's also that chance, I think, I've seen eh, here in North Carolina, very beautiful sectors.
What happens is that everything is very expensive.
Mm. Mm.
but but that would be my dream, to be able to find a house eh, near the city, but at the same time, away from the city
Mm.
away from the noise but near, where there's vegetation where there are trees, where one sees green, nature
Mm.
and that would be, that would be my dream
Mm.
that I think God will make it a reality is, is my hope.
yes, that's worth dreaming
Is our hope,
Mm.
And, and and the big city - I don't like it or I would like it as a vacation for a while a city for example like Miami well
of going on vacation and returning, of going to
Mm. Is more hectic, I say, here is more complicated I say. The running around of every day.
yes. That's how it is.
Mm.
That's how it is, he runs, he runs everyday.
Mm.
Then that, that's what we want, right? To be in a, a peaceful city a house in the country
Mm.
eh, where there's not a lot of noise and that we can that we can also work. That is near work. And where we can eh let's say raise our kids
Mm.
that God gives us then, I think we agree with eh, with the place, the place to live in where we live
yes.
where we want to be, so
Mm.
well we want to be
It would be very nice.
and and here also, eh well I'm now in a gym because here also, the, the, the city leads one
to not exercise not walk, everything is in the car.
Mm. Mm.
eh, rather, everything has changed for us since we arrived here to, to the United States but the same there are many places where one can
go to exercise, is a matter of organizing your time.
Mm.
and, eh and, and be organized in your, in your things because also walking is good.
yes, is like that.
It's very useful, and sometimes you don't look at that but it's a matter of getting in order
Uh huh
managing your time and all
Uh huh, yes
So, do you have the chance to exercise there?
Oh, yes, uh
Are you in California?
Yes, i go like that, i have, what, forty five minutes to go and forty five minutes or an hour on the way back
Oh
I go to school
Yes
Uh, I'm studying and all that, yes, i like to walk a lot
Yes, yes, oh, yeah
Because, here, all the comfort, let's call it that, everything's near and all that, so you stop exercising yous muscles
Yes, and, how long, how long have you been in the United States?
Oh, i have what, like, i don't, i don't, i haven't been here for long, like eight years
Oh, you're... I've only been here for a year
Oh
Yes
But you do have to get used, right?
yes, sure, yes but like I tell you, it also depends of what one wants what one wants because sure it depends of the opportunity there is of exercising a job but
but one can get organized, one can look, let's say, the way of finding the ideal place little by little, right?
Mm.
little by little I for example up to now we are coming to, to exercise, to come with the kids, to do sports because is necessary, in life is necessary
is necessary.
yes, it's true, mm.
And, and the same the dream we have of, of a house is, is usually something that it's peaceful something that is, that is like rural
Aha.
but that at the same time is near the city.
Mm. What happens is that yes, no, I don't know, no well, just not so far from the city for the same that sometimes there are emergencies and all that
And for work also.
Also, well is that here in the place where I'm at, there's not much demand of work, there's not much work and if I find one, that it pays too little.
No? yes.
It cost a lot.
No, yes.
The truth yes, it's hard with that of the jobs, eh, they pay too little and I was telling my husband to immigrate to another place, because here really no
yes.
there's not a lot of work, eh. Bring some applications in several place ah, one calls immediately, and, and they have one like that
yes, sure.
Mm.
Sure, yes, and, and well in, in your case then, the topic and the question they asked eh, if you would like to go to a place like that.
I think I'm in a place more or less like that.
Mm.
Everything, where there's vegetation, where there's nature
I would like a place like that.
and, and there are many little towns or cities nearby.
Mm.
where they are thirty minutes, twenty minutes away is, is the possibility, right?
Mm.
Is the possibility, and and we are happy here, we're good, good
That is the, the important, thing is being happy in the place, right? where
yes, yes, we are happy thank
Mm
God, we are happy and we are
Mm.
are thinking in, in settling down also, right?
yes, that's it.
In settling down
yes, I would like to change course because here is not too good.
Okay, yes.
The truth is that the outlook is not too good.
yes, yes.
Things are getting more complicated with that that they don't want to give licenses and all that.
No, yes.
Everything is getting complicated, each day the doors for people are closing more, then there are less jobs
yes, yes, sure.
There are less jobs.
yes, sure.
Mm.
We, thank God, have the blessing of, of, of having the papers, right?
Mm.
We have, eh, work permit and like that well
Mm.
it has been easier, so to speak although it's been hard, but, but all in all it's been easy. It has, it has been easy.
That's how we are, on that, on that part we are fine. That's what I tell my husband, why stagnate in one place
when one has the opportunity to progress, right? That the most important thing is, eh
yes.
for one to have something which to rely on, a good social and all that.
Sure, sure, yes, sure.
But since he has already been eight years with that company where he's working he doesn't want to leave anymore.
Oh well, that's good too.
Mhm.
To have, to have stability in your job and all of that
But, he's not earning that much money, he just works.
You know them, no, you shouldn't experiment with, how?
He earns too little and he just works so, we are never going to be able to get a umm
Oh I see, I see.
Oh, we are never going to reach our goals, right?
yes, sure, sure.
Mhm.
yes, oh, is the lady not working anymore?
No. I don't want my girl to, she's just eleven months old.
Oh, she's a baby, sure, no.
Aha, so he doesn't want me to because of the girl.
Oh, no, no, she's more important.
yes, the girl can say if she is being well treated or not. You know, some people here treat children very badly.
People that are caring for them.
No, no, no, she's our priority
So he says, no, for some
Hi, my name is Miriam
Hi, what's up?, my name is Luca
Hi, Luca, how are you?
What's up, did we talk?
Yeah, Luca, it seems i find you at this hour, i never find you at nine, beyond nine
How are you, how's the weekend?
Quiet, yeah, it's been quiet
Yes, oh, you had a holiday there too
No, not a holiday
Oh, because it's a holiday here, Martin Luther King's
Oh, no, no, there's no holiday here
And, how's the weekend?, how was it?
Quiet, to church on Sunday, swimming on Saturday
Yeah, where?
It's a community center i take them to
And, they have what, a closed pool, right?
Yes, a closed pool and the water is a bit cold, but you have to move, otherwise, you'd freeze
And don't you, you don't get sick, you get a cold after that don't you?
Yeah, there was a terrible cold, but thank god i have a car, you see, so we get into that old car
Oh, it's OK
But yeah, you have to take the bus, imagine the, on Saturday it was very, very cold, a horrible wind
And did it rain there?
No, it didn't rain, it didn't rain, but there have been other days when it has rained, but
Oh
we can't, we can't complain, on saturday... it's cold today too. But no, we can't complain because i don't know, winter's usually cold, like today, like saturday, but
Yes
However, it's warm, other days it has been, it even went up to eight for a day
wow
And it's supposed to raise tomorrow
Right, because yesterday, it was freezing cold. Terrible
Yes, it's very cold here nowadays, but it will, it will get warm again right?
I hope so, but yesterday i, they lent us a car, a car, and the door handles got frozen
Uh um, oh
You couldn't open it
And what did you do?
Uh, nothing, we had to, we were waiting like that
Right
And there was a sort of icing on the glass
Right
And, we weren't used to it because we didn't have a car until now, so we don't have a stick to take the ice off either
Right, right, oh yeah
I don't know what's it called in, and, nothing, uh, my husband went there and got, he brought one of ou, uh, like the
right, right
the bath dryer, the one we use to dry the floor
Oh, that too, when there's a lot of snow i use that too, because i do it "rum", rum, quickly, from the ceiling, because that's
yes
that little brush you're talking about
Yes
that one takes a lot
yes
It's smaller
But you know that, the snow, it wasn't snow, it was icing, like a frozen layer of ice
eight
Uh, i don't know, it probably would have been better to get it out with hot water
oh, later on, yeah, but it's true
And, how
But i see now that in some stores... I'm sorry to interrupt
Yes, yes, yes
I've seen some commercials in stores now that i was watching TV
yes
That the defroster seems to be instantaneous
Oh
that you have to buy it or put it
But, it's like a liquid
It's like a liquid that
That you put on the windshield
Yeah, but you put it inside
Oh
the hood and you plug it to i don't know which tube, because it looks in the flyer
Oh
And it says it's very easy, that you plug it i don't know where
Yeah
It's just a matter of knowing where to put it, i think they tell you, and it says it gets defrosted right away
wow
the wendows, but i haven't dared yet
Sure
Yeah, and when the door doesn't open, you need to have alcohol at hand
And, oh
They also sell that at stores, it's cheap
Yes
Because sometimes they get to settling down, I saw a boy in the Church who couldn't even open the door and a gentleman loaned him a quarter right there
ah, I didn't know that.
It's, and I told the gentlemen that it's that, and he told me, it's like a liquor that warms your gut really quick
ah but they threw out into the street
yeah, and he took it
ah
Prum, they threw him, they tried to enter the handle, so that he would move
sure And your son doesn't like anything?
Yes, the only thing he likes is having a good time.
A ha.
Everything, anything that is, he loves it.
And nothing good, nothing good?
he learns, when he's with me when I'm at his side, he gets into anything. Because I support him
yes
I tell him sometimes, I don't want to tell you, yes you can like that, you already know, getting the kids all excited
yeah
It's very important,
And are there many children in the pool?
No, there weren't many around for us, two families more and that's it
mhm
But when is summer, like that, you have not even a space in which to move.
Sure
Already in winter is nice because not that many people go.
And in, in summer, are there outdoor pools?
also there's plenty of outdoor pools,
How nice.
I went here to a, that in summer we go here to one nearby. And tell me speaking of, of pools and all and that the time gets cold and all.
then you live in the city or outside of the city.
eh, is a city, that I mean, that has the name of a city I mean city no. Is not eh, is not as big as a city, eh let's say there's the city of Boston which is big.
mm
eh, also is not as big as the cities of South America, right.
mm
eh, and this would be like a suburb.
Oh, aha
But it's called city, and but is not like country. eh, is we all are, all very near, we, imagine that we don't, don't need a car.
oh
eh, there two blocks from us is a big supermarket. four blocks away there's another, five blocks away in the center, with restaurants. Then there is, is not country.
And I don't know, How is it where you live?
eh, also like that.
yes
It's the city, Peru, i lived outside the city
And, uh, it was like houses very far apart from each other
No, the houses were together because they were like organizations
Um
but anyways, you had to go Lima to find the most important things, to downtown
Oh, yes
Yeah, but now, that was in my time, now i have heard that, well I've gone there too, i went on two thousand and two, uh, it's more advanced, you can find everything, everything
Sure
Having your money
Sure
Work, you don't even have to move from there
Yeah, and, would you like a place perhaps a bit less centralthere in Canada?
No, you see, I'm very much the city type
Yes
I don't know how to live in places, far away like that, i don't like that
Yes
I don't trust loneliness
Sure
i like things closer
yes
like for example, you see the pools, I don't know if in places like that there will have, I don't think so.
yes the truth is I think that you are very dependent of the autos, of the cars.
And of the electricity
yes
I'm very dependent, I like the light, and the heat eh the microwave all those electric things that work without effort
yes No sure.
yes And you Luca?
And me, well in Buenos Aires I lived in a city, and I never had the chance to live like that in the country, but since I always liked the animals I thought that I would like to live in the country.
mm
Eh, and in -when we lived in Israel, eh, we lived in a city that is more, eh, more rural.
aha
city or no city is the same.
Oh yes
Because, because everything is little and, all eh, Let's say, there are people that live, perhaps like a little bit close to farms, but, is not also too far from cities, then if you need something,
Oh,
there's always a supermarket nearby,
Oh
but, I always thought that I would like to live in a city, in a country.
no
Eh, but, eh, I don't know how I would get along, I think that perhaps to raise the family, it must be nice.
Okay
But it also depends of the places because in Argentina is like, The countrysides don't have very good education around. The schools are like rural schools and are not as good like,
But and you don't worry in emergencies, the doctor, would have to go far and
yes, yes, it could be, perhaps since I never lived in the country, it's like a hope that one has.
Okay mm, mm
And
And why don't you try?
and because here in Boston, the country is very expensive, no.
mm
eh, in the United States is very expensive, and in Argentina you live, if you have your family in the city, I think that the city is better.
yes is true the majority go to the city because imagine, to
Eh, so that they help you. yes
so that your expenses are less, also, yes
yes Now, yes me being a veterinarian, it would be more useful living in the country because one has more, perhaps closer to the cows and the horses and the sheep
mm
But, but I don't know if other people perhaps don't have much work in the, in the country.
I think that a veterinarian in the United States would make you good money, because in the United States they charge a lot for the consultation.
yes
The veterinarians are really expensive.
yes, yes that's true, but also there are many that are, are very pressured with the issue of,
Okay
of the trials.
Okay, oh,
Here are, are the whole time with the topic of the trials,then For example a horse, that the horses are very expensive.
mm
eh, if one does malpractice, perhaps not malpractice, but, eh, one does something that, that doesn't go well, because is true, it can be that a treatment,
affects the horse, there are some that are susceptible and one, doesn't know.
mm
then, there's the trial, and the trials are so expensive that,
Oh,
all the, all the veterinarians have an attorney and have to have insurance,
Their body, their body of veterinarians I imagine, eh,
yes, you have to, but, like one gets out of college and has an attorney and, has to be very insured, same also with animals, with with
small animals
oh
if one, does a bad treatment or, or the dog reacts with an allergy, the, the owners are capable of taking you to court and one has to be paying them for life
for something you did, that wasn't that is not malpractice, that it has no reason to be malpractice.
oh
so, many people that were veterin-, I know three people that were veterinarians of horses in Argentina.
mm
And came here to the United States and they worked like ten years in horse veterinary. And they say is very stressful the pressure that the owners of horses put on them.
The owners, oh.
Then they left that on the side and started to do small animals.
Oh,
The same they say that it makes a lot of money, but, eh, until I see the money, I have to give all the and that.
I honestly, don't, don't know anything about that, and I've never heard anything, they only thing I know is that people complain that they are expensive.
Having a little dog, or a little animal is very expensive in Canada or in these countries.
yes, yes, yes, yes yes
Not like in our countries, that they are sometimes left there poor ones they just give them a shot I think and
yes, yes, yes yes here a lot of shots are mandatory every year.
Okay
and you, you don't have any animals.
Today, no, almost almost I was in the store, I remember ready to
yes
buy some birds because my son wanted,
yes
and I said that to teach him responsibility, but no, no. My mom told me, better a plant, to start with a plant. And he let the plant dry out and all, then me with the dog,
oh
Hello.
Hello, how are you? My name is Karina.
hello, how are you? My name is Leticia.
Ah, what eh
Are you from Washington?
How are you? yes.
Ah, I spoke with you the other day.
Really? I can't believe it.
Argentina.
yes, Are you the girl from San Martin?
yes.
And could it be they connect us on purpose?
How funny.
I can't believe it, is the first time that this same thing happens it hasn't been that long that I've been using the system, right?
That you talk twice with the same person.
yes, has it ever happened to you?
Eh. yes, yes it happened to me, but not that many times I think it happened just once.
Girl, that we should I don't know, play the lottery or something. But well no.
How funny.
Terrible. Well, we have to talk about where we live and that possible and if you want later we can keep on talking about San Martin.
yes, yes, yes
What does it have to do with that?
You who live in the center? center or
look, I have a story quite appropriate about this question of where to live, because when you change
oh
the country, first you don't know where you are going, you meet the truth when you arrive, and then
yes
I came to Maryland university and thought it was inside a city. I never imagined that the outskirts here were so diff-
different to the outskirts in South America
yes
So, I imagined, I don't know, that I would walk the streets, or get off the metro and I would be in the University
And no, it's not so, I mean, here in Maryland
Mm
eh, well, how is it on, what city are you in?
in Philadelphia
in Philadelphia, I wonder if it will be the same, but the outskirts area is for people who have a house, car, garden
yes
and obviously there is no sidewalk t walk
No, yes
I mean, it's all roads and highways, even to take the bus you have to cross through dangerous places because it is like stopping in the middle of the road
yes. yes. yes. yes.
And at the beginning I lived there in College Park near the University of Maryland and then sure during the first year I felt that no
I wasn't living in the United States or at least in the United States that I imagined, right?
Sure. yes. yes. Because, How far is the University from let's say the center of Washington?
And if you take the subway to the university in twenty minutes you are in the center.
Ah. sure.
Eh, in twenty minutes you are in the area so to speak of the bars and the cafes. If you want to go to Downtown which is where it is
yes
for example, the white house where
yes.
the mall is you take a little longer but not more than half an hour.
Sure.
in train, right? Which is how long it would take me from San Martin to the center. Ah,
Sure. As which.
Then I.
yes, but here the suburbs are different here in Philadelphia also. The suburbs are prepared for the people that have cars.
Sure, the same happens to you. You want to do things. Let's say on your own or even use the public transportation which that is another issue that
yes, that there isn't much besides.
no. The truth that no.
And what did you do, did you then move?
Sure so, well, I stayed there the first year because well
yes, I didn't know yes yes
you really don't know anything and right away I didn't know where to look for a yearly contract, I was near the school, so lets say that that year
I came to Washington around five times, I mean
Sure.
to visit the museums and all of that but it was just so hard
And yes.
because the subway station, even if you lived, for example, I lived in an apartment that was oh, about five minutes away from the subway station and I could even walk there
it was about eight blocks away but you had to walk through
yes
open fields, below a
Oh.
a freeway, it was impossible, really dangerous, it was
yes.
all very lonely, I mean and and
yes.
dangerous so, I was angry because the station was right there but I mean, if you wanted to go downtown you could do it but
You couldn't walk there, sure.
yes, if you didn't have a car you weren't able to, do you understand? So I moved to D.C.
Sure.
and what I prefer to do is take the subway since I tell you it takes twenty minutes to the station and there there's a shuttle right? that almost all the universities
Ah.
have a shuttle to
yes.
that takes you by the different buildings in campus, see?
yes.
Then there's one that goes from College Park station to the university. If you want to walk is fifteen minutes walking if not, well take that shuttle
Ah, very good.
then
Sure, and now that you are in the center of D.C then
Sure, and now I moved. Eh, to the center well to the area of Columbia Heights no is not the center because the rent is very expensive in that city. I don't know.
Ah. yes, here too, well I don't know
Is terribly expensive.
yes, here is also expensive.
That's also an issue because each neighborhood according
yes.  yes.
here they call that centrification and is that they are renovating neighborhoods that were eh eh, of old houses but
yes.
that many families lived in the same house and they were destroying all is being renovated, increasing the rent
Ah.
companies that buy houses cheaply and fix them and raise the rent, then the Afro-Americans and the Latinos have to move out of the neighborhood.
Of course
So then, this is what is happening in that zone. If you can, I ended up moving as well for that reason, how, how they were raising the rents, right?
Of course, I mean let's say you aren't right downtown but you are in, let's say, D.C.
Of course, no, no, what happens is that I lived there before, eh, like I'll tell you, to go walking from the bars to my house, if I
stayed out till two in the morning when they closed the bars I could go walking to my house or take a taxi that wasn't very expensive
of course, of course.
instead, now, I moved to where a metro station was before, the metro comes up to here, because then I can return to my house
ah.
But we say that it's more residential where I live.
Of course.
There aren't many cafes nor bars nor that kind of thing. But like all, all those who come to the university I recommend that they try and move as well because in reality
the rent, if you look in a neighborhood like mine, is the same as what you would pay to, for a rental near the university because they take advantage of being near the university
Ah
The difference isn't great
Of course, of course, of course.
The only advantage for students is that nothing, it's closer to the university, but the truth, I don't know what it is, it depends what you want to do with your life, right?
No, I understand you. yes, here there are cheaper ones but you also have to have a car in the center, in the center of the city.
uh-huh.
but if you were to live in the suburbs you would have to have a car. I do because
And what is the advantage of living in the suburbs? Because here in D.C rich people prefer to live in the suburbs.
as I know. well, first place if you rent for the same money that you rent in the center in the suburb you can rent something with a gym, with a house
Uh uh. Of course.
with a little park, I don´t know.
Uh, uh.
That. And for other part I understand that people who have children say that school are better but
yes, that is the same thing that happens here. So, It is said that schools in D.C. in downtown are very bad
Of course.
and then because of that the suburbs have their, their rent with respect to good schools around the area.
Of course. besides that well as an example If I would like to have a car in the city For sure it would be very expensive so more expensive that if
Uh uh.
don´t pay in the suburb. Besides, sometimes so if I had to pay for a parking, it is very expensive and if you don´t pay, you have to park very far.
yes, the problem of parking here is terrible too, yes. And how is that?
Many times from where you live.
And what do you use, eh, public transport?
yes. yes. yes, because so inside all Philadelphia the center what I know is that the center of the city is good it is that I, it is like the center of Washington that
well you have paths, it is a very normal city in that sense.
yes, yes.
and you have a lot of a lot of
So, those are not these suburbs? Hmm. So too because I never was
yes, yes, yes, there is also a trolley and the trains go to the suburbs but overall it seems like a city in teh United States that normally does not have much public transportation, here there's a lot
how nice
It's not same as here in Argentina but obviously
yes, the difference is, how patriotic, but I'm not that way, but what I see here is that only the young people use public transportation here
yes
eh, sick people and me or let's say people like us
yes
On the other hand, in other countries you see a mix of things in public transportation
Of course
subway and a there's a kid and a guy that asks
Yes
but the people mix in that area
Yes, as such
On the other hand here, not such much in the subway, but I would say in the shared transport more than anything else
yes, yes, yes, no.  You also notice of the difference here, yes, yes, yes, yes
I don't know why.
It's like big difference with what they went through at least in Argentina
Of course.  And you think eh
But
Do you consider if you want to go to the city or that is?  In regard to where you would like to live?
oh, I don't know what.
You never lived in the suburb in Philadelphia?
No. No, I don't know. The decision is like complicated. I mean yes, I like to live in the city but I would also like to have a house. I mean
Sure, in the house, fine.
is like both things it would be good to have a house and not live in a small apartment, I don't know.
Sure. Well I here, rent a house with two roommates because we don't have enough like to rent a house for just me in D.C. no.
Sure. Sure.
And in general the apartments well yes they are a couple yes, if they aren't also, you have to pay it alone
yes, no
the apartment is a lot, I mean.
yes, that's why eh. Is like that contrast. On one hand is good. Plus I don't know I travel a lot
Sure.
in the daytime but I don't know
But there
on top here in Philadelphia, well is is like between the center of the city and the suburbs there's a border
head, eh
that surrounds Philadelphia that is horrible.
ah, no, sure, is like you are in an impassable belt.
Is a terrible, ugly, belt.
Mm
dangerous and well then, either you live in the center or live in the suburbs you have to
But is not such a good statement.
I don't know is that you also cannot live a little closer to the center because you already get into that area
Sure.
no, then is kind of,
Is like there are no places like those that are not in the center but
Sure, no because is I mean
but they are like neighborhoods.
is much smaller I mean.
Sure.
It's not of having
No yes.
those neighborhoods.
Sure, but here you do have dangerous areas. Only sometimes the statistics, they say that here the statistics
yes.
everything and there are really very dangerous neighborhoods, in D.C. they tell you, well no. Don't rent by there.
Ah.
Supposedly where I live is good because recycling I don't know but also there's for some students of mine for example that I'm very of living here.
I don't know because the people from the suburb think that the capital
yes.
know, but the neighborhood would be like the collect, right?
Yeah, right?
I don't know, it's all very...
Yes, yes, yes, they're afraid of a lot of things, but also the suburbs
They're not so safe either, sure, sure, there's no
Yes
Yes, and it's a matter of paranoia, i don't know
The, the nice neighborhood there is Georgetown, right?
I haven't been in that neighborhood, like saying, it collects, i mean, for
Right
for us, right?
Because it's beautiful
It's beautiful, it's one of the oldest there, there's where the Jesuit's university is, Georgetown University
Oh
And the most expensive stores and cafes are there, like for older people too, i mean, teenagers don't go there, there aren't any disco's there, so
Yeah, sure
for teenagers, right?, then, the very nice neighborhood called
Oh
It's a gay neighborhood, you see, but the elegant gay trend, it's more like artsy
Yes
There's a bunch of

I live in the city, really deep in the city.
Did you live in the city there in Argentina
yes my life yes, but what happens is that the city where I lived in Argentina is a small city
Okay
Is not as big as here, like Philadelphia then Eh, it was more kind, kind of a city, but kind of a village also I mean
okay
Which is a city but also it was like a forest outside a village, it wasn't such a big city like here Philadelphia.
yes,
Then We had the ocean and that makes it all a little Little more warm, everything was smaller Not here, here is all cement
Okay
many people, but at the time you are here is good no Eh, is not the house of my dreams where I'm at, the apartment of my dreams but
Well, sure you are already living in Texas, ah, where?
Well, eh, I'm in Houston, Texas
City with
Eh, I'm, ah, I live in an apartment, eh I really well ah, I like Texas a lot, eh basically I mean being from Puerto Rico well, is like
I run from the cold, for me whatever is cold, I don't like too much Ah, okay
Sure
Eh, I can go, eh, I've traveled, mm, to many different states but always just in case the most that I've been in has been
I don't know how and well that well, I liked a lot but even so
is it nice there?
yes is too cold like that like saying Pennsylvania or Canada, or something like that no not at all
No,
So that I well yes, yes, eh I have to live in the city Well I like the, I like both, I like them, but mainly the city
Eh, I've always, eh in Puerto Rico I lived in San Juan
Aha
Which is the capital, is the All is very urban so
Sure
I need eh, to have buildings near me, I need a lot of stores by the apartment, eh, I like to go to the bars and things like that.
Ah, that's good sure
And also ah, more for the social life, I like to well Go out
For the social life
eh, I like sports, going to concerts,
Sure
things like that so that's why no
a real city dweller
That's why I wouldn't like to live in, like to say in a rural area
In the country, in the middle of a mountain alone
Exactly, not that But yes, yes I like, yes, I love to go Camping things like that so yes, eh, for me when they say the house of your dreams well
What I would like to have Well my house
mm
On the city, but i would also like to have a cabin, uh, where i can go camping or spending a weekend on the mountains, see the snow
Right
But that, that's
for vacations only
Exactly, right?, like
Just for a few days
Not to live
Um, uh, my dream home, i would like to have money, have money and buy a condo in front of the sea, that would be
OK
A condo in front of the sea
Oh, uh, i remember, uh
Oh, that, i would be the happiest man in the world there, i wouldn't, i don't ask more, just a condo in front of the sea and that's it
I remember watching on tv, uh, on television, uh, they were doing a report about a surgeon's home. And, well, he had a beautiful house, but the thing that caught my attention the most
He has a pool, uh, you basically open the door and the pool is just in front of the door
Uh huh, beautiful
And, so, the pool is basically at the top of the win-, you can open the window, and when you open the window, the pool is
right in front of the window
Right
So, i don't know, i mean, it's like a tall pool, i don't know if you understand me, uh, you basically open the, you open the door
yes
And, and goes directly to the pool,
beautiful
So and, and it was extremely beautiful and anyways and How they built it the pool was, eh, the same level with the house Ah
how awesome,
I don't know if you are understanding me, but it was
yes, yes, yes
I, eh, I saw that and I like that
I think so
I would love to have that, ah, eh, I mean to have something like that in my house
aha
But basically, I know that is a, unless, unless that
aha
I win the lottery well is not going to happen,
you're, are, are, are far right, are far, are far
a little
Well, no, no, no You have to, have to insist, have to keep dreaming anyways is
yes, exactly,
I also I also keep dreaming with my floor in front of the ocean and up to the last minute I will be, determined is that,
For, for, for me well Being from Puerto Rico that the beach is not a big deal for me, I always lived five minutes away from the beach so that
eh, as beautiful as it is, I mean for me is like wow
aha
well I rather I rather have a house here in the mountains,  where I could camp in the mountains and things like that.
Oh yes, I see.
Oh,
Me too. In Argentina I used to leave by the sea and I miss it a lot. You see.
yes
I'd love to, yes, have you gone camping a lot here in the United States, no,
Well, here in Houston you really can't do it, there are no mountains so I go camp in Handsville, Texas.
It's about an hour away from Houston, to the North of Houston.
aha
And there's a bar, they have a lake and you can row and stuff. I really like that. When I was in Tennessee, well yes
I used to go camping often, oh, we would go to the river
that's so good
we used to go to, to do all kinds of stuff
Oh, well, that's nice, yes
so, to me, yes, to live like that I have to be in the city I need to be able to have contact with music, theater, all of it
Beautiful, sure, yes, yes, yes, yes, you  need to.
No, but, well yes, once in a while, once in a while I like to like be in the woods but I wouldn't really like to live there
Oh, I really like the city and I also like all of that but I believe that I could live in the mountains, in a lake, in the middle of the woods, I could live a quiet life
I'm a loner, yes, even now that I live in the city and when I used to live back in Argentina, no no
No, I don't go out much, no, I don't go some
It all depends on, it all depends on the person, on the person like, I think
Sure, sure, sure
How they are, are, ah, yeah I was born, grew up in the city, or, for me, eh, and I'm used to having access to all these things
for me, going there and going to the country and not having access to anything, well this is why I don't really like the attention
It's a suffering, sure.
eh, but all the same, I think that the person is born and grows up in the country, eh, well has to be a little afraid
ah, when he can go to the city and has to be, use- ah, get used to having many, many people and the buildings
And the traffic
the traffic
sure, yes, yes, yes.  Oh, but it's in the personality of everyone, there are people who live in the country and everything and love the city
yes
and well, they want to live there, I, no, I feel good in the city, I'm comfortable, I'm not suffering, but, the house of my dreams wouldn't be here, if I had a lot of money, I won the lottery
I would buy, I'll tell you, a good house in the mountains or by a lake.  Or I'll tell you, in front of the sea.
Well, ah, ah, really, like I think that this, it's extremely difficult to decide on how to say, a house of, of your dreams, eh
well I want, I would love to have a really big house, many rooms and more, but I would also like to have ah, how do you say, an apartment in a good building, on a high floor
Ah, where you can see the whole city from there.
Nice,
I think, I suppose
Sure, depending on the money, no, with how time goes
eh, obviously
as they arrive each one starts getting used to it. Eh, sure to the house of their dreams, okay, okay, okay Has it been long that you don't go to Puerto Rico, Right?
Eh, since October
And how's over there? was it nice?
yes, eh I was only there five days because it was basically all family Ah,
Sure
But well But real, real, I well for, for work well is eh, I'm going to stay here, no, and really I really like Puerto Rico a lot but no, but
The same it will be, will be like visiting family No, like I was saying Puerto Rico wouldn't be the place where, where I would like to live
Ah
Aha
Always, I've always said that I would like to live in Australia Well, well there's the beach
do you know Australia?
pardon?
Do you know Australia?
Eh, I've never gone, always, I've always wanted to go, ah Eh, it calls my attention a lot, ah, eh eh, I have many friends who are Australian and
Ah slides
Eh, well from what I've seen well eh, the beach, eh, the ah,
yes they say is beautiful
It looks, it looks, it looks good, real good. Besides that, the Australian accent, drives me crazy
yes they say is beautiful they say they are, They just say that the Australians, are very warm people Are very nice people.
yes yes
yes they are, ah, I don't know they had told me. My brother in law was living in Australia for some time and he was also very,, very happy, he loved Australia and he always is

Mm.
I lived here before but I returned a year ago.
Mm.
And I like it but is that the cold is too much. And I've lived here in the United States many years.
yes.
But is that already as I get older well the cold bothers me.
It doesn't surprise me because the same thing happens to me here no I don't, um No, I mean No, ah it is cold because
in fact they pay you the conversation precisely to explain where you live Eh, the west coast of Canada.
Uh uh.
is like, is very similar to Seattle.
Mm.
eh, Vancouver which is where I'm at. Is a city that rains and rains rains rains rains, all the time, is terrible.
Mm.
And I've been here three years well and the first year was horrible, horrible, horrible. I couldn't get used to it.
Well I've lived in well in Pennsylvania, I've lived in New York.
Mm.
I lived in Virginia three years.
Mm. Mm
Is colder than here.
Yes
Uh, i have traveled to a lot of places, i have traveled to Florida
Um
to Canada, like i told you, to the west coast
Um, um
And the place i liked the most was Florida
Sure, sure
Because the weather is nice
Sure
Warm
Well, California is very good to, i have lived in California
Uh uhu
And California; if i had to choose a place of the United States, i would go to California without a doubt, i wouldn't think twice
Well, I'm a bit scared of it because of the earthquakes that happen there and that
Oh, well, that's true, you can't have everything
yes
Yeah, it's true, earthquakes are, yeah, i lived there for four years and i had like three, that i noticed, like whoa, whoa, whoa, this is moving a lot
Well, Florida is, tropical storms that occur there and earthquakes
Of course, sure, sometimes you can't have it all, but it's cold up there
Yeah, here is the cold and the snow
Oh, is it snowing now?
No, it hasn't snowed these days, but it is pretty cold
How's it, how much is it?
I don't, know, it feels like less than twenty, more or less, because you can feel it and the wind has been really strong today
Um
Um, but it drops until it goes below zero and, oh god, no more
Yeah, well, here, below zero, yes, i believe we're five degrees today
Wow
Yes, and the most cold I've spent here has been like minus ten
Minu
Minus ten, and for me, that was horrible. That's the most cold i have ever had here, i mean there's less in Canada
Forty, minus thirty, something horrible
Yeah
When, what's the maximum in Pennsylvania?
Well, i don't know, because it goes below five, i mean ten, but with the windshield, i mean, what they call the wind
Um
Well it actually goes lower
Um
It feels even colder, so
Um
Uh, it drops a lot, it's called "frisa todo" [freeze all]
Um
Yes,
And what, did you went there on work or?
Well, yes, because it does freeze, snow fell or something. It gets frozen today, that's terrible in the morning
Yes, uh
To
What can i say, if you live in Pennsylvania is because you, uh, work there or?
No, because of my family, yeah, all my family is here in Pennsylvania
Oh, sure
Uh huh, um
And, uh, do you work?
Uh, no, I'm retired
Oh, well, you have a voice, i don't know how old you are, but you have a very young voice
I'm young, yes, but, uh, i got retired because of a car accident i was in a few years, about seven now
Oh, oh, that's a shame, and, what happened?
Uh, you see, a drunk man in Virginia hit me
Oh
On the back of my car
Yes
and the car went one hundred fifty feet
Ah Oh
yes, then he was going one hundred twenty miles per hour,
Oh, my god
yes, so then it hurt my spine
Ah.
Mm.
And did you stay in a wheel chair or?
No, but it did cause a lot of harm in the hands and in the legs.
Oh.
Let's say it moved my spine.
Ah okay okay. I mean how Good.
Exactly, so I retired.
Well, And do you do some hobby or something?
My son saw computer. I was a computer programmer.
oh.
So no in reality. I told my sons. I have two sons.
Well, so that is a, is a hobby.
Quite big
yes is not too much work
yes, I was pregnant with my
Uh uh,
when I had him
yes. And right now I'm in in school. well, today I started and is a business course.
Mm.
And they ask me because is a previous course they ask me for a certificate to verify that I've done that course and that's what I'm looking for.
And I say well, I'm not going to, I'm not going to get. To get nervous I know it I say.
Mm.
Relax and if I find it, fine, and if not, there will be another solution because that exam is there, they will not
yes.
well, they'll remove it but well that And well, here life is very peaceful, too peaceful.
yes you could see. I went there with my mom and my sisters everything looked really peaceful, it looked nice and the people looked very pleasant.
Okay.
No, no I don't know like I liked it but what happens is that it's also cold.
yes. No me. Every year for the no Is not I don't know, is not bad no not at all living here.
And where are you from originally, you told me?
I'm from, from Madrid, from Spain.
Madrid. Oh from Spain. Oh.
Mm. yes, so that and yes
and have you been in Canada many years?
is three years.
Three years.
yes, it's already going to be three years and they've seemed eternal, eternal. It's been three years since regrettably I haven't gone to my house.
because here everything is very expensive, eh.
Mm.
That is interesting because the United States and Canada are very different right and here the planes are very
yes.
very expensive.
yes. Ah that
And, and well. And the salaries are not too high.
Mm.
I mean the salaries are quite low but Well perhaps is another advantage right? But well, I don't I don't see I don't see any greater advantage.
That the one I can have in my country.
yes.
But, ah I'm here because my husband is here and the time that I'm here which won't be forever, obviously
Mm.
well eh, I will make the most of it so precisely, this course I'm doing is a course that Human Resources here has sponsored for me.
Mm.
in Canada is a course that well, you have to take advantage of, right?
Sure.
I mean that, do you live in a house or?
A house, uh, a two family home
Um, great. And, are your kids older?
No, one is six years old and the other is four
Oh, well, little, yes
Yes
That's good
They don't speak Spanish at all, you know
No
No, no, no, since i was here in the United States, well, i thought it was better to teach, for them to learn English first
Um
Backwards regarding everyone else. I say, they can pick Spanish any time. And now they are, they can speak English pretty well
Yes, um
They speak it like any american, well, now I'm trying to get them to learn Spanish
Oh, and what, they don't want to?
Yes, they get two or three things
Oh, well, that's good, i mean, do you talk to them in English or in spanish?
Yes, and  my mom, well, she always talks to them in spanish, and they understand her, they're getting it now
Oh, well, i mean, they will, because it's so important to be bilingual or trilingual
Um
ah, later all that in the United States here is not so important.
yes.
Here one that speaks good more because really the majority of the people that live in Canada are more immigrants all.
Mm. yes. There but they talk
And well it depends where yes. But for me for example it hasn't helped me at all.
Mm. No. Look.
at all.
Eh, I thought that yes. What a thing.
No. I get here saying, oh I don't have a problem. I speak French, speak English and no nothing, nothing very bad.
Mm.
No, because is the west coast, in the coast a lot of Asians
Mm.
then maybe, the market is a market very concentrated in Asia.
Oh, I see already.
No, French is not so important and of course Spanish, forget it, it has nothing to do with the United States. Here there must be by the
ratio of Spanish it must be one percent. The ratio of Chinese thirty five the city where I live is like that they call it how do they call it ah
Hong Cocer is full of people that came from Hong Kong.
Mm.
There are many and what that has caused is that they've increased the prices of everything.
Oh, I see.
Because they were coming with a lot of money from Hong Kong because in Hong Kong they don't pay taxes.
Oh.
Then they bought the houses eh raised the prices and well ah the prices have increased, have increased a lot here
Wow
but the salaries don't increase.
see that also now the prices on everything is increasing because the economy is very bad now.
Mm Mm.
yes, the prices are, of the gas cost
yes.
Right here is two thirty five the gallon.
yes. Wow
Mm
Well, yes that's true because I went the other day to the United States and I was by there also.
And already it's gone down a little.
And have you seen any difference between states you who has been, for example in Pennsylvania, in Virginia as far, which is the most eh
I don't know the cheapest where you can live better?
Well, like I was telling you. I liked the South.
Mm.
The people very pleasant, very peaceful.
Mm.
The way of living for
Hi
Hello?, good evening
Who's this?
Nancy
Oh, Hi, Nancy, this is Maria Ines
Maria Ines, how are you?
Fine, where are you from?
Um, I'm from Colombia
From Colombia, oh, I'm from Argentina
Oh, how are you?
Fine, everything's fine, where are you calling from?
New York
Oh, close, I'm in Philadelphia
Yes?, oh, what do you think about today's subject?
Yeah, about today's subject, it's just, look, uh, you caught us talking about that subject, a few friends are reunited here, and we live in the city and say "it's so nice that you live a little bit on the outside"
To feel a little bit of the smell of the grass and all that stuff
Yeah, nature, everything
Yes, yes, yes, that sometimes you feel like you live in a little box of shoes
Right, yes, because there's no building and that's it, you go out and you see the same everyday
Sure, sure, do you also live in an apartment?
yes, yes, in an apartment. Then, is like, one becomes too immersed. You need the, the trees and all that.
Sure, What?
that you need the trees and all.
yes. Right? Even if it's having a little garden or something.
yes, at least.
And, that in Colombia is very common also, Right? Having a garden, having
yes. yes, that's very common.
is more common than here.
yes, because yes you have your house, and garden and the garden in back, and all that.
Sure, yes, in Argentina is the same even if is, if you have an apartment, the apartments have a balcony, or have a little terrace, or something like to
here is more Right?
You live there in, in an apartment also?
There in Argentina?
No, eh, here in
No, here we have, yes. we live in an apartment. And nothing, it has no garden, nothing, we are floor, then, we look at the trees through the window.
And how would the house of your dreams be?
Ah, let's see. How would it be? It wouldn't be too big, I think, big, I don't like the houses too big. But yes to have a very, very big garden to be able to have a lot of dogs.
Ah, you like them.
I love them, yes, yes, yes, yes. And, I don't know. I don't know? I don't know. White, for sure, I like white houses a lot.
Aha.
And, What else? I would like it to have a place to like that, with, to watch TV, and to watch to listen to music, that is separate from the rest.
Mm.
And, nothing else, I think that would be it, I'm not very ambitious. How would yours be?
Well, I would like it to have two bedrooms, have them, separate .
yes, yes.
Eh, for it to have a very nice garden,
Mm.
something that like maybe I can put a swing set or something like that, to be able to go out with him there.
Ah, how nice.
And, yes, it's TV room and of, of one being more peaceful Right? More relaxed.
Sure, yes.
I would like it, also not so big.
That's nice, one here has everything together.
And not too big neither because then you have to clean a lot.
Sure, I thought the same thing, if it's too big, you have to maintain it, it has to come, with someone who helps you, the house of your dreams.
And, suddenly that, we need the people that live in the country and all that.
What
what, What do you think of that? Would you like it? In the country, country. Right? What they call country.
To live in the country, country. I think I would like it but for a short time, I think that long term I, I would get bored a little, like
i didn't come from a very big city anyways, but, it was a city, and i mean, living in the country, a little bit, i don't know, i think it would be kinda boring
A little like to rest
No, and i would like it, a month or two in the country, but i think that more, i don't know I've never lived [there] so, i don't know
Right
Later on I'd love to, but i think i'd miss the people a little, the noise
Yeah, you miss all that
And you, would you live in the country?
No, maybe for a week only
It's nice, it's nice to go horse-riding, take a walk
Yeah, right?, for short vacations
sure, you have the theater, you have, i don't know, bars, restaurants
Oh, but that, you see, cows, horses, yeah, that's different
After a while, yeah
Yes
Everything's very nice, but you have to be very [...], well, get used to it, since you're little, right?
Yeah, but kids also get bored when you take them to places that
Maybe, when
That are too quiet, right?
Sure, you have a son, right?
Yes, i have a son
Oh, and how old is him?
Six months.
Oh well, he's so little.
I can still take him wherever I want.
He doesn't get bored yet, he doesn't care.
No, he does get bored.
yes.
yes because they get tired, if you have them sit they get tired, they get tired of being laid down, if you change their routine.
Oh oh, oh, you have to sure, you have to entertain them, it's harder to entertain them because you can't make them watch television or anything because they are so small.
Mhm. No, they don't like anything, yes, they watch it for five minutes and that's all, they are not excited anymore. But he does watch Dora The Explorer during the mornings and that's it.
Oh yes, does he like it? Does he recognize her?
yes sure he likes the colors, he hears the voice and he turns around to watch it, I think, mhm.
Oh, so little and he takes notice, that's so sweet.
yes yes so, that's it. Mhm, yes, but really, to live in a building is hard.
Ond yes, yes, I mean, I can imagine that there are buildings that have all the services right? But you live in an average building.
No, well, I don't have enough money to live in an apartment.
It's expensive, sure, yes. If you go live in those buildings, the ones that have
Aha.
that have a gym or all those things, they are nice but it's an average building, it's not that fun.
But the rent is expensive.
Sure.
Our budget is not enough.
Is better not to. More in New York.
yes, yes, that is, yes.
There besides, I think that is much more expensive than here.
You've never lived here? No.
No, I'm very close, and I never went. I have to go to, ah no, we are like an hour away. But, we have gone to much farther places, and still not to New York.
yes, but or it's too hot, or it's too cold, or we don't have money. Always something happens and we never go.
yes, now is quite cold. It started yesterday. They are the coldest days.
yes, Mn. What's the temperature?
yes. We are in twenty two, twenty eight.
Ah.
And, before it was decreasing more. one prefers to stay home.
yes, no. Better to stay peacefully, eating something,
yes, even if the walls bore you. But, well there one starts to do something different and gets entertained.
What, what? I didn't hear you
And, that one starts to do something and in the meantime is being entertained,
Sure.
Mm. And how is the climate over there?
And here is cold, but no, not so much. It must be like thirty I'm not too used to the Fahrenheit yet. But,
To celsius, that's what you're used to
Yes, it's, let's say there's no, there's no snow, but the puddles on the street are frozen, i mean, it's cold, it's cold
Uh huh
But, i think it's always a bit less cold than New York
Yes
Here
And, is tenement expensive there?
Likewise, no, i mean, it's a lot... from what I've been told, there, around there, you can't find a a one room apartment for less than one thousand dollars
Right
And here you do, here you find for six, three hundred dollars, you can find one
Oh, it's cheaper, more, more accessible.
Yes, yes, yes, pretty much. Even in some neighborhoods, well, they're not, I'm in the neighborhood, since i work at the university, i'm close to the university
Right
And well, it's convenient for me because of that, i go walking, everything, but, if you want to go further, you can get them cheaper, so
Oh, yes
It's more accessible, i think
Yes, yes, it's good, it's a good idea, you know
Have you been in New York for long?
Five years
Oh, did you came straight from Colombia or where you in other...?
No, direct, so no, well, I've traveled that way but, a short, no no that no, I don't know much.
Oh did you come with your family
Here, yes.
Or alone? Yes.
I'm here with my husband and a baby.
Oh.
all in Colombia.
Sure, have you returned to Colombia? Have you been able to go visit?
No. No, no I haven't.
Hm.
No, we are asking for asylum. So, you can't go back there yet.
Sure, and you also have a baby, it's kind of complicated.
yes. That's why, but, we'll see.
maybe you'll be soon able to go visit.
yes, maybe in five years. Maybe that will happen when this shameless guy has a girlfriend.
If he marries a rich girl he could take all of you there.
You think? God willing it'll be like that. Do you own any dogs or what?
What?
Do you have dogs?
N, no, not here. I used to have some in Argentina but, well I can't have them here since I live in an apartment, so, I mean
Right
Without doggies, and without kids too, we're alone, with, with my husband
Oh
Until we go back there, the idea is, we're here for a while, yeah, and when we go back, we're gonna have dogs and children, both
Oh
Here in the United States it's very expensive to have all that, so, no
Yeah, babies, that's the good thing, they help you with them too
Sure, it's true
Yeah, that, at least they give me milk for my fatty [baby]. So, it's a lot with that, because he eats a lot
Yeah, right?, it's a little budget
Ugh, yes
But they're so cute
Yes, they're very cute, they're gorgeous, and that amuses him
What's your son's name?
His name is Julian David
Leon
Julian David
Julian David, that's so nice
no, and he gets bored when we're in the apartment for too long, he gets bored, he needs to go out
Oh, and when you're on the phone, for example now, what's he doing, is he sleeping?
Now he's taking the pacifier.
Ah.
Ah, he's supposed to, to sleep.
Wait til he starts to, Is he already crawling?
yes, but ah, he has to start, I have to start crawling with him, to teach him. because he's very, very fat, then, I have to teach him so that he doesn't
And there he's going to start driving you crazy, when he starts moving. Right?
there I'm going to roll around with him, but I have to, I have to take him out, because he gets bored locked up in the house.
Sure, and with the cold, how is it? You have to really bundle him up or no?
yes, but, but he goes out and sees the people in the street, and is like his environment changes.
Sure, and he likes to look.
yes. Because, when, but, Saturday he was sick the whole day yesterday, yesterday I took him to the clinic, and how he looked around, and he got happy when we went out. And, we came and he's already fine.
yes. Sure, and he gets bored, poor him, sure, he's a little social
And I tell him, you need to go out, don't these four walls bore you. And, he just laughs, I say, hm. Mm, yes they need it.
yes, the same as us, we also
Well, and while you're at it you also have fun, get out for a while.
yes. There little by little we socialize more.
Sure.
Aha.
Do you work there?
yes, I work.
Oh.
Right now I'm just working two or three days,
Mhm.
it depends on the person that babysits my son, but, I'm not this week, I don't work this week.
Sure, that's fine.
they are not coming, so, I have a "forced" week off
And you have to stay home and not go
yes yes but well, we are doing fine, little by little, going out shopping

Oh, it's, is it country-like?
The, the subject is
The, uh, the, lets say, the, the house, the area.
No, no, no, they're not houses with, with, that have a yard between each house, right?, it's not, it's not a suburb, it's not so country-like, there aren't many fields
Sure, um, lets say, right?, it's more like a neighborhood, right?
Yeah, no, but

Yes, but ten minutes from here, yeah, it's
There's the city, there's Manhattan, right?

A little more
Ten minutes from here, I'm in Philadelphia. But also, ten minutes to the other side is the country, yeah, you find...

The fifth one?
Yes
And, so, do we have to talk, do we need to have said something by twelve minutes?

Oh
you can avoid the subject if you want, it's the same
Oh, it's the same
A page tells you about that, yeah, i don't know, it's kinda weird, yeah, at twelve minutes, the voice sounds, the girl's, the one that talks to you when you call
Uh huh, uh huh
And, it tells you that, ok, you have thirty seconds to follow, ciao. And, uh
And that's it
And, no, you studied it, right?

Uh huh
By a student of mine, i, i teach at nights here in, in, in, in, at high school
Yes
For grown up people
Oh, look at that
People that had, that had Spanish in their high school many years ago
Sure
And uh, they want, they want to review their spanish, and a student, that had married a Panamanian and
Yes
wanted to learn Spanish to, to raise her kids bilingual
Bilingual, sure
Was the one who told me about this, this study
Oh, she recommended you this..?, and, and what do you teach in
No, i'm, i'm, I'm a mother, i'm a forever mother
in school?
And, this, this is more, uh, um, uh, i mean, this is a part time job and, i also teach Spanish during the day, my degree is, uh
Oh, yes, it's spanish, look at that
Yes, my degree is in Industrial Design, and my daughter, the youngest, she has three, uh, in bio-engineering
Right
Um, biologic
Industrial?, oh, biologic engineering
Right, and the other one
Maybe
And i have another that's graduating now from high school
Oh, two daughters
Yes, the other one, uh, is between, i mean, she's looking for a college to study civil engineering
Oh, yeah, that's two more, that would be two, or three daughters you have
I have two, two daughters
Oh, they're girls
I have two daughters
That's it, yes, and, are you married?
Uh, divorced
Oh, divorced
Divorced, so, that's my job, that's what i do
It is fine, it is
yes staying here,
it is perfect.
I hope no, not, they do not get spoiled.
Of course. And do you like it? Do you like to live here?
Ah, yes, well, of course, imagine. I am, Cuban, I am exiled, no, it is not that,
Of course.
it is not that,
Why did you leave? Were you in disagreement with the regimen?
yes, Well, my parents. Right?
You, of course, you were very young.
yes I was, I was an infant. I was two years old.
And, for the, there was a disagreement, lets say it.
Tell me.
Right? For sure you still disagree, lets say it.
the
Then now it is bigger, and lets say, you are older, and,
Oh, I
and,
yes, I, I don´t think the problem of the, is , eh
Fidel Castro
Uh, what helps him is that it's an Island, right?
yes
And, it's completely
Um, it helps him
Exactly, that's what helps him
That's the problem, and, yes
If he was in, in mainland
It's, um, yeah
Oh, it wouldn't
It would be different, yes
I think so, i think so
In which way?
Oh, i think there would have been more, um, exile of people, people would have gone in, uh, a lot more, yeah, in, in
Oh, they can go more, well, do most of them there in Cuba disagree?
Um, i think there's a lot, a lot of people
More or less
they're, well, they're very resilient, right?, lets see, is resilient Spanish or not?, people is, right?, of very hard skin, right?, with lots of, lots of,
A lot of experience
yes
I believe that if it happens to you, oh well, get a life but if you look for one I think that it's not that much, there are no disagreements, but
No, it's like
They stand it, right?
Exactly, they stand it, they have lots
They stand there but they don't like it.
I  don't think so. No.
Oh, I think it has some good and some bad things, right?
Aha, I believe so, well,
It has,
I believe it's more like,
good things for example, the people
I believe that they are isolated, they are completely,
eat
ah, separated from the rest of the world.
Of course.
I believe that if they had contact with more countries and if they could see, oh
And then after that, it's better.
I don't believe so, Castro wouldn't be there now. If they had realized that oh oh, how the rest of the world is living,
Sure.
the technological, social advances, I mean, there have been many cultures that have been, England has the, oh
?
the, you have the, oh, yes, they have you covered,
Industrial development.
oh, well, no, no, no. No, no, no. Wait. The, oh England, oh England, France they have a health system that is completely free, just like in Cuba.
Sure.
But you don't see, you can realize that they are not as poor, do I  make myself clear? There's a
Sure.
Lots of countries survived. And, and, well, and what
No.
the reason is that if Castro had, oh, oh, hadn't, mm, I forgot the word. Wait. How can I say it? Mm, people that cannot read or write.
Sure.
Oh, illiterate.
If there weren't any illiterate persons.
yes, if there weren't illiterate persons, if there weren't any, if it was just a free healthcare system and free medicines
The good things have not been mentioned.
yes, there, there, well, lots of countries have an illiterate rate,mm,
No, I believe that those things, for example, the cultural, educational and health areas
mhm.
he, he did good
yes.
That i think that poverty and all that, comes from a blockage from many years ago, and that the United States made it, this country
Right?, that, uh
A very [...] blockage
But, do you think?
very strong
But do you
Commercial
But, Matias, do you think that?... that the American people, really, you think that?, don't be so naive, but, don't you
And, it affects it's economy, it affects the economy
But, do you think that Mexico doesn't have half a foot there, and the same with Japan?, i mean, no, forget about that, Holland. There are many countries that already have
oh my
they have helping them a lot, the blockage is only
Yeah, it affects, let's say, the economic and commercial part of the country
Yeah?, but there are many other countries, uh, right, i mean
And, they make... do you know what i mean?
No, look, oh, don't be so naive, i don't think that, that Cuba is where it is now
Yes
Because the United States hasn't bought, uh, raw materials, or
yes
Or other, i mean, the only thing they produce at this time is tobacco
Sure, yes.
There is no sugar, there is no rice, there's nothing, there's no basic. They import a s- today even sugar.
Sure. Sure.
do I make myself clear? H- he could, if he wants to,
Hello?
Hello?
Hello. How is it going? My name is Seledad.
My name is Christ, a pleasure. Where are you calling from?
Eh, I'm calling from Baltimore.
Ah, Baltimore.

I'm calling from Houston.
Oh, Houston.
We are a little far.
Ah, there, you hear me better there?
yes,
Ah, good.
Yes you hear me?
yes, yes, I hear you. yes, yes.
Ah, okay. Perfect.
What's your name?
Mm, Chris.
Ah, Chris, okay.
yes, What do you think about the topic?
Eh, well, the topic was, the place where we would like to live, or where we like to live.  Eh, more than anything, I like
more the city, more than another thing, to live.  So, more than the suburbs.  I like the city more, the, the buildings, the people,
Hmm.
em, I like to be able to walk everywhere if I want, these kinds of things.  Like, and you, what do you like more?
yes.  Well, I like everything.  Everything, I think that it depends on what you want, what your job is, what you think, what you think during your whole life.  No?
Obviously, if you go to work as a sales agent, or something, No?  Well, in a city.  If you're going to be a farmer, well, in the country.
But, for me, in general, I like the city more, yes.
Did you live in the country before, at some moment of your life, or have you always lived in the city?
The cou- No, I've always lived in the city.
Ah.
so the country when, so, my grandparents' town for vacations
Sure.
when I was a boy.  And yes, I liked it a lot, the animals, the horses, all that, the river, it's pretty.  But, well,
yes, I like it.  But, I also think that after a few times I couldn't, like, I couldn't live in the country all the time.  It seems it would be hard for me to adapt.
I've always, hmm, I was born in the cities and, and I've always lived in the city.  So, I suppose that it would be difficult for me.
yes.
And you, where are you from originally?
yes.  I'm from Mexico.
Ah, Mexico.  Mexico, eh, DF, or Mexico?
From, from Cuernavaca.
Cuernavaca. Ah. I have never been to Mexico, I've heard it is very nice.
Mm, yes, there are very nice places. And where are you from? sorry
I am from Argentina, Buenos Aires
from Argentina, aha
yes
yes, yes. I've had to talk to some people from Argentina. Two weeks ago I was talking to two, three people from Argentina. They say it is very beautiful also
yes, it is nice. It has, honestly, Argentina has so many places to, well, if you like cities, Buenos Aires
yes
is, is very interesting, is very nice to know. But we also have glaciers, waterfalls, mountains, the truth is that there
are some landscapes, it is a very beautiful country. Well all Latin America, the southern part, Brazil is also precious, and, and Chile has nice places, the truth is that it is, it is a
nice place
Mhm. I guess so, yes
And you, the other question they did was where would you move to if you had to move, or what would be the place
of your dreams?
Aha, and get the house of your dreams
yes
And what would worry you, right?
yes
Ah, what do you think? Where would you? If you had the chance to go somewhere else
Mhm. I think that, if I had the chance to go anywhere in the world, I think I would like to, I mean, I'd go back to Buenos Aires, because I have all my family there and I was born there
And, to me it looks like a good place to raise children, and
Hmm
this, hmm, I like the environment. if I could choose, I would choose Buenos Aires. If it could not be Buenos Aires, hmm, I don´t know. The truth is, I don´t know if
If I could live well and have all the comfort, I would like any city, lets say relatively, well, like in the United States, I like the cities which, that have, diversity, and don´t
Hmm.
yes, that, that have more people, so, not, not only Americans buy also, from all places. Because of that,
Hmm, yes.
New York, for example, I love it. I don´t know if I would live my whole life, but I love it. I would love to live there for a couple of years, for example, New York.
yes.
So, but I think that, that, the, eh, if I had to choose today, today, I would come back to Buenos Aires.
Having all the comfort. Right?
Hmm. yes, yes, of course. And what would worry you? Any preoccupation?
Well, I have just, really, moved  two weeks ago. I was living in Philadelphia.
Hmm.
I lived there four and a half years. And, now we moved here, to, to Baltimore. Then, hmm, well, and, when, ah, in the moment we decided to move, well,
we were worried, mostly. was to see because hmm, my husband, well, he was going to work here, but I was going to the university. Then, to choose the city
And,not an opportunity to go to New York, but he was going to work alone, so, to live alone in New York looked to us as a little bit risky.
Hmm.
Because it is very, it is very expensive. And being in a city like that, and not having the possibility of enjoying anything it was not the life style I wanted,
to go there.
yes, mhm, sure.
This, mm, did you? well, the reasons why we chose, because for the job, to be in his job, oh, it's the cost of living, it's cheaper.
No, we were mostly worried, when we were searching for a place to live in. We wanted to be in the city but in a, oh
safe area, no? In a safe area with no crime because I know, I don't know that much but I believe that Baltimore has a couple of dangerous areas.
yes, mhm.
So, that was, we were worried about that and oh, safe places and and, to be in the city, near downtown, also
that it's easy to reach work from there, well, to me, in my case, to be close to a train station or something like that.
so that I can go to the university yes yes, if I don't want to take the car or whatever. So, well, we had to consider lots of things. I guess
our number one priority was safety and and number two was, to be located in the city and and convenience, no? to go and come and
to have a comfortable life.
yes, sure.
So, I believe that those  three things were the ones that we had to take into consideration when we had to move
yes, yes. It's very important.
I don't know how it is in your case. Would you have to move, have you been living in Houston for long?
Well yes, I've lived here for seven or eight years, but, I wouldn't want to stay here forever, right, I'd like to go to, Mexico, for example,
Which one.
or somewhere else, for example, Spain.
yes.
Cause, cause
They say that Spain is really nice.
I really haven't gone. But, they have told me and they say that is very nice, and there are a lot, well, I don't know, is something different. Right?
I would like to go over there.
yes, Europe. Do you know any part of Europe or no?
Pardon?
if you know Europe.
No, no, no. No, I would like to go there, It would be one of my choices, Mexico or in Europe, in any part.
Ah.
The truth.
And, you work there in Houston?
Mm, no, yes.
Oh, you are in a university.
yes, I'm in the university, full time.
Ah.
yes, in Houston. And, well, I'm going to graduate already. I mean, I have a semester and a half left,
Ah, how nice
and, well. I'm thinking
What are, are you graduating of?
Economics.
Ah, economics.
Same. Right? yes, here is nice right? and all, you have the comforts and everything, But the lifestyle well, I don't like it, is more, is very different.
yes, right? it is, American style is different but the style is more Latin.
yes. No, well, I don´t know. I do not feel so comfortable.
yes. Right? Why, what, what is what bothers you the most?
Well, I don´t know, I try, that is what I ask myself I right? I say, I have everything, but, I don´t know. I don´t know what is left.
Of course. Do you live alone, or are you with someone here, as your family I say?
yes, with, with my parents and my brother. I have a brother who is nineteen.
Aha.
And, well, we are here since eight years ago, seven since eight years ago we have lived here.
Wow, eight years and you still feel, feel different.
Pardon me?
You have lived here since eight years ago and you still feel like, like you don´t, you don´t like, lets say.
yes, aha. I am used to everything. But, well, well, like I don´t. I would like to know other places right? Other places.
yes.
Other cultures, more than anything.
yes. yes, yes, I understand, I perfectly understand. Is that, this, this country has a lot of good things, and on the other side, is like if, well, well, I don´t know if you have gone through the same, it happens to me that sometimes, It does not seem to me,
like to be a part. Right? Always for, Whatever? for anything, is like they always make you feel like a foreigner.
yes.
Hmm, I don´t know if it happens in another countries that are not your own country. I suppose that yes, I don´t know. Well, but you, you,
I can, I can have a life, I even have friends and all that stuff, well, in Baltimore not yet because I recently moved, right?, but in Philadelphia, eh, I had friends, so,
Latins, and I have friends from Europe too, and I had American friends. But, it like always when you, I don´t know, when you think home, you think back in Argentina. Right?
Hmm, yes.
yes, it is difficult, but if, so most of our friends were, are, eh, Argentinians or, the ones from Philadelphia. Argentinians, or we have a couple of Spanish,
yes, other pair of Italians, eh, we get all together, is like, eh, all the foreign that don´t, that don´t, I don´t know, that
some couple from Europe, from Latin America, and we all got together. We had a group of friends, so, we have a lot a in common
yes.
that with the American people right? I don´t know what it is and neither how to describe it, but, it is like that.
yes. yes, yes, I understand. yes, me either, like that, with friends, mates of, of classes, I see them,also from different nationalities. But, well, I don´t know.
And, hmm, What was I going to say?
Hello, yes, Martin's speaking

ah, yes?
yes eh, I was, I was reading on, on the Internet eh, about
yes
a thousand texts that, that they want to teach in intelligent design in science classes
yes
it turns out that th- there's a new theory that is the theory, the theory of the flyer spaghetti monster
flyer and spaghetti, no really
flyer and spaghetti monster basically says that, everything was created by eh, the magical touch of the noodle, slash spaghetti monster
ah, no
and that, then they want, that if they include intelligence, eh intelligent design they also include this
ah, well, what I had heard? that, that sounds like a delirium and they won't do it, I mean, I understand the purpose but what they had said is that if they include design
intelligent the question is, let's say that they include from the side of I don't know, the Navajo beliefs that, you see, they have their mystical delirium too, I mean
the beliefs who?
of the Navajo, you see? the Navajo Indians that they include, I don't know what they believe, the Buddhists, that they include the ones that believe in eh, all of them let's say
and then it's a mess there, o- obviously they don't want to do it either they're not interested
yes

he did it all openly, he didn't need the things eh, all, all the illogical arguments he puts them all in a very logical way
yes sure, sure

But, well, they didn't go to work, uh
Oh
so i don't know, Marcelo probably, i don't know, no offense, no offense, I'll ask him later

No, but the ones from Philadelphia are here in Baltimore, the dumbass
Baltimore is a
Baltimore is the worst
Baltimore is a mass
No, it's, it's the president
No, no, it's not depressing, it's, very good, uh, you can go walking on the bay with the, with the son right next to the

Poor thing, you're so mean

And but, but would it be as as reliable as the others?
What?
Will it be as reliable as the others?
look, they were saying yes look, you now, if on the Internet you put eh, DVD rental eh, there's a, there's, a page comes up, like the third or fourth that
yes
a table that compares between DVD rental
ah, that's good
and the only thing is, that, mm nex flix and and and blockbuster has they say four thousand titles
yes
and this they don't say how many, they don't say the number
ah
it doesn't say the number, but it says that they have the wor- they have eh,that, that it doesn't, that the number that they don't put the number, it doesn't, how could they not publish it
and, and the price is a lot cheaper and if you get into it, the other place you see the movies that they have, and the new reviews that they have they are always the new reviews of the other
sure. but over there they only the newest, they don't have international movies
but, but pay attention,
you have to see it yes, yes
not sugar but, I think that, I think that it'll come out, I'm sure that it'll come out, I can't explain it right now
Oh, did you get Net Flix?
Yes, because i have fifteen day for free
Yes
And i almost change to the other, i have a free month in that one
Sure, what was i going to say?
And, you know, play station, and, and i rent

A little bit of that, that could be, that could be
Yes, it can only be... what was i going to tell you?
Everything is possible, you know, when you score a goal against Cuba i also celebrate
oh, ye?, but, but Toly is a half-breed
Yes, it said something about teaming up, teaming up with Jan, you know, teaming up with Jan, and Janis and i also played against Toly and we bested them
Yeah, yeah, but Toly goes backwards
Yeah, no, Toly goes backwards, but the girl makes an effort
Oh, yeah, she makes an effort, she does, but

But, Cuco is having a son

Cuco is, Cuco.... is Cuco your son already?
Well, poor Cuco only
he's not bad, he's not bad, he has little defense, has little defense
yes, yes, what?

and little attack but in the TV with four inches televisions
I already explained to you that this is wrong

no, that's why the old ones
ah, what does all this mean?
sure my king
what definition does a four inch television from the seventies has?
those old televisions, see those that came real little eh?
you have to say, it has good definition for a four inch TV from the seventies
I think sure, yes, what happens
go, yes
yes, yes, you want to go to Canada?
Hello
Yes hello,
yes, How are you? My name is Veronica
Veronica, what a pretty name, my name is William.
Okay, eh, Why so pretty?
From where No is a very pretty name. Veronica a name. A name like yours is placed on top of the chimney, with one of those you know exotic paintings
Then is exotic, but the exotic can also be pretty.
and damn, if it's a Picasso painting,that you can't put, that's beautiful.
eh, William, Why do you have that name?
yes
And have, Why do you have that name and have a Spanish accent?
what? Spanish accent.
uh um
and is that I'm Cuban, I'm Spanish.
Ah, I didn't recognize the accent. With the damn, with the damn I thought you were Spanish from the Iberian peninsula.
No, no is that I had to say that I was from Spain.
You gave me a false damn. Sure, that's why, I thought, I told you Spanish accent, I'm from Argentina and we say Spanish accent means from Spain.
In general every time we refer to the Spanish.
Well
We are referring to the things from Spain if not we use the Castilian to refer to the language we speak.
ah, is that look you are very right, but my, my grandmother and my grandfather in Cuba, they were born in Spain and since very young they went to live to Cuba.
I would say that like when they were ten or fifteen they went to live to Cuba and there they had my parents and from there I came out.
And from there you left, you left to Spain.
No, I visited Spain, two or three times, but I think I'm more Cuban than anything.
Very good, very good now where are you here?
I'm in Miami.
Ah, okay, I'm in
I'm visiting Miami, regularly I have my apartment in Miami.
ah, okay, okay I'm in Washington.
And you, you Where do you live?
I'm in Washington, in Maryland, next to Washington, DC
A curious questions, are there a lot of Hispanics over there in Washington, DC?
There are a lot of Hispanics in the area I'm at.
yes
yes, yes, yes it was interesting the topic of the housing because, look that here in the Washington area.
Aha
Accurately in the area of Maryland There's a very big community of Central Americans, but a little bit more, not of the islands, of the continent, of Salvador and of Guatemala.
And
There's a very big, big community.
I would've thought that many Puerto Ricans, because they tell me that, that in Washington, in Pennsylvania, that in those places there in the North.
there are many Puerto Ricans and many, how do you say?  Mexicans.
Yes well Mexicans yes, I think that there are Mexicans all over.  So, I don't know, i don't know where, where I would say that more in the west you have
much stronger communities, more formed, here you have a lot, a lot of Mexicans.
eh, eh,
But the majority, a great percentage of the El Salvadorian immigration, are settling in this area.  In the state of Maryland, and above all in the state of Virginia.
a, the pro, this, this is really good, because in any case the Hispanic where we want to be
Which is in the south,
and any, any little word that we get wrong here or there, we're all Hispanic and speak the same language, and we all understand each other in the end, right?
We understand each other in the end, sometimes we don't understand each other, or sometimes we make a mistake, eh, your cono was tricks for me, because Cubans don't use cono, believe me.
Girl, without this word we don't exist.
A look at that.
we put cono on everything, cono mommy, cono my girl, cono, what's up?
You know I didn't know this, I didn't know this, look at that
yes, yes, so you se- it's a really integral word in our language, let's say the street Cuban.
Sure.  Sure.  Sure, sure, of course.
But I, I came here.  One, so if I was going to move up there in the north, I wouldn't have any problem either.
Tell me
in buying some good black beans, white rice, some tostones, good bananas, you know, a steak empanada.  I can go to a store and buy this, I don't have to live like an American, let's say.
William I'll tell you the store and you go and you buy everything.
Hopefully one day I'll visit up there because I remember when I was,
look what, this is,
Tell me.
This is interesting because, there are lots of difficulties for the Hispanics immigrants but specially for the ones that are undocumented in the United States.
yes, I can see that.
However, I believe that you can make a living here, in a way, what do I know, the food, music, shows, going out.
You can, keep, you can really keep in touch with your culture.
That's really important because I want, I want to tell you something, look, for example, here in  Miami, I was raised here in Miami but,
Aha
Here in Miami, lots of people, I mean, it's not because I want to say something wrong about the Hispanics, my own blood, but for example, lots of Hispanics,
Lots of Cubans, lots of people that come from our countries, they come here and they forget where they came from, I really know that, I've been here for five years now
yes, um oh
and I've never forgotten how to say, fuck, or about eating my beans with fried steak, or how to treat a woman like she was the last one on Earth.
ha ha, that's so,
They are confused here, they think they are gringos and they forget about it pretty quickly, they forget where they came from.
you see, one of the things I find really interesting is that in our countries, we are not used to this consumerism system, so you go shopping,
and I mean, I'm sure that when your parents were in Cuba, ell, they'd only buy the things they needed.
sure
And if something was broken, they'd fix it.
aha
But I've been here for four years, and it's really interesting to me to see that I'm thirty five years old, I mean, I've lived most of my life in Argentina.
But it attracts a lot my attention. Like here, this is one of the ways, I wonder if for a cultural or identity question, he has of feeling a part of
But since the consume levels within the Hispanic community are so high
Very high
Just, just like the American, right?, the credits, let's say, the whole system here, the debts, credit cards, I don't know, all those things
It is , excuse me for interrupting, it is a system, that although it works fine, it works very bad against us the Hispanic. And when I say us the Hispanic, I mean us the Hispanic
who don't have the luck of having born here, and getting a, what you call it? a jump start from our parents
Um uh
aha, who gave us a lead, who left us something for us to start with
Right
And being able to leave something to our,  we have the bad luck that we are coming to a country to improve, because I consider myself Cuban American. Because I can't say that I don't consider myself a little American because
it's true what you say. The consume of everything, if your, if your vacuum, for instance, gets broken
If your vacuum breaks down why will you go and buy a new one when you can fix the cable or the fuse that will cost you twenty or thirty pesos
Right
The first thing you think of is bu-, and it is true what you say because you see a commercial on the TV that says 'I bought a new vacuum and bla, bla, bla'
Right, and the same with cars and every thing
So, aha, it is the American culture, that even if you don't want to, you just get used to it. But I talk to a lot of people, and when we talk about this subject, I say, don't forget where you come from brother, we are Cuban
And if something breaks down, my brother, fix it. Why will you take one hundred dollars and waste one hundred dollars to buy a new one, if you fix it it will work just as fine as before
Sure
It's the same. But it is a pretty diverse culture, this is, this is an amazing country, to be honest
Un hu
Very, very incredible, I don't know how it works there in the north but I suppose that it's not too different down here.
well I think that the, the, those type of things are the same in all places. yes is true, look that here in this area, you don't have a lot of Puerto Rican community
there's a lot of Puerto Rican community in New Jersey, well and of course in,
In New York and New Jersey.
In, in New York, I have seen. But not that many Cuban people here.
No, we always stay in the south, we, we basically,
Look
we stay in what is Miami, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach.
You guys need to be closer to the Caribbean.
yes, yes since we are not allowed to visit the place where we were born,
um
eh, created our own place, which is what it's most similar to. It's like a reflection, right. But, but we don't have the same laws, but well that is, is what one has to do when,
pardon, the word, when we have to be screwed.
Uh uh
But well, ah, one thing I wanted to ask you, you said that you came, five years ago.
yes four years.
Four, five years.
yes
What, what, What is the difference in your opinion between this country and your country?
uh, look, what I can tell you is that there is a difference between what, between what I saw, of this country the United States from outside, from Argentina.
aha, I, you know that was what I was asking to you which I did not specify very well.
no, no a thing is what I saw from this country since Argentina and another thing is what I see in this country being here,
So they are two totally different realities Of course United States as an economical power on all. So, it is, it is a, it is an appearance, like an ideal paradise.
Of course
Do you understand me, and as the idea of well to come to America
um
So But, well reality is very different.
Very different right.
The reality is very different and, and it depends, yes I think that Hispanics here suffer eh, we suffer, many realities I came here to study
And eh, lets say I am in a very privileged space,but it is not like this, the situation of people who come here to.
No, it is not what you thought it was in your country, right.
no
Nothing I, I tell that to many brothers, many brothers, when I say brothers I am talking about my Cuban people that they,
No, no, no.
I visit Cuba once a year.
Um uh
And every time I go they tell me, no I want to go there, And I tell them, see I know that you want to go there, and there is a thing that only you have hear about, and you have seen pictures
and this and that but wait a second. when you arrive there, money is not going to, to fall from the sky.
You are not going to be in your house having a coffee with your next door neighbors or something like that. Things are not like that there, there, there you are going to have to get up early and break your back every day.
for a person like you, like me who have to study, more than anyone and get prepared more than anyone because it is not an easy thing
No but, besides that, I mean, I believe that people come here, they really want to, lets say, work and do well, because
they have no other options and they can't progress in their countries and that's the reality, I don't deny it, but the problem in my opinion, is more serious and
all the laws that are being approved against immigration, they say that they come here to join what I call, a new form of slavery.
That's, and yes
I laugh, I laugh but I think you are right, I had never heard that expression before.
And that's I know, it's not
Honey in Florida.
Eh, Manuel also in Florida.
And what was the topic, the?
The housing. yes renting versus renting, yes. Pros and cons.
Uh. Actually I'm almost in both situations because is with option to buy.
Ah really.
But that it's a house
Mm.
your apartment. You know that I think there is the big difference.
Why? do you rent a house?
Exactly. Okay the same I'm renting a house, but is with an option to buy. I have to rent it for a for a year. And in a year, if I want I buy it if not
I keep renting or I move to another place.
Okay.
The advantage that I see of one renting is that at least you have someone who comes and fixes everything if something breaks.
Ah, also sure.
Versus if you are the owner of the house, and something happens,
Mm.
you are the one who has to do that, you understand me? If the air conditioner breaks, there's no maintenance.
Mm.
You have to find the money one way or another or else you stay without an a/c.
Sure.
But that on the other hand almost everything is you understand me, is lower when you live in your own house
Mm.
apartments and all that well the water is more expensive, the light is more expensive even the cable is more expensive.
Ah, look, yes well.
Because they have eh the city goes you know for him since they have so many people that leave or move and don't pay the bills,
and all that, so the city takes all that into consideration.
To make the charges.
Exactly. They charge the people that are there.
Mm.
Because in fact I work with a company that that's what they do, the water bill of the apartments.
Mm.
And is one of the things they take into account.
Mm.
You know that you have a house that is bigger than an apartment
Mm.
that is rented, the people live there, the way they see it is that you bought a house, the probability is that you will be there for a couple of years, what you know.
Sure. You have more possibilities of staying longer.
Exactly. And that the price of your property goes up. Well, they know that you not in a place.
Mm. Mm
Ah that another
Sure. I think some also to buy to later sell them, right?
Exactly. Also, you are paying for what's yours.
yes well no. And also here the purchases almost don't I don't know. It takes to long for people to pay their house, right?
Exactly.
Like twenty, twenty five years.
Is many people because they stay stuck you know with, and and the only disadvantage it has is that when you buy a house, you are already there sure.
Sure.
You already don't have the same advantage if you are renting in a place and I want to go to Miami or I want to go to such place, is like as soon like look I'm leaving.
You just leave, well right,
Exactly. In a house or in something that's yours, be it a condo or whatever, you know you have to sell it
Mm.
fix it to sell it you know is not as simple as if you as if you were renting I'm leaving, I left.
That's how it is right.
You know that's the only disadvantage, I exactly would recommend a person to buy better than rent
Buy, you would prefer to buy?
buy it than renting it.
Mm.
Because when you are renting, you are like you say, paying to another jerk.
yes, well no also because if you have a little bit of money to send a down payment and rent it to buy it, later you can sell it
Because of that, because of this option
Um
Because when, that's what they say, leasing option
Uhm
Uh, they give you time to do what you pay rent with, it is kept for your rapid
Um
you know, you go paying upfront what a regular rent will be, but that percentage, when your [...] is over, for example, i did it for a year
Um
A percentage of my rent is going to be saved for closure
Oh, look at that
You know, i don't have five, six thousand dollars to buy something
Um
You know I'm gonna have to do something, but that's not a big amount
It's not so much, right?
And on top of that, you mind your business because you know that in the end you're paying rent, bu it's going to be yours
Yeah because here In the United States you have the big advantage that a lot of people buy with re-financing, i mean that you
Um
Without, uh, without being full owners, because you aren't, right?
Um
Because you're still paying, many times you have only paid thirty, twenty percent of the total cost.
Mm.
they can sell it, right?
Exactly.
Is a figure that for example doesn't work too much in other, in other countries of Latin America because the property is different right?
No. No. Because there first I don't even think that the refinancing exists.
No. well. There's none.
No, I haven't heard of those options nor those facilities. If you don't have the money to have it built,
Mm.
or for you know to give it there at once then
Mm. Sure generally many purchases are on contradict and also there are some financing with the banks but
but you have to plea that they didn't leave with your money that
uh uh.
don't belong to the government,
Mm.
you know that is not, is not the same.
Mm.
I know, well like I tell you, when you are paying for yours is yours.
yes well no if you know that you are going to stay and all those things.
yes, that's the advantage that I see. I don't see any sense in renting.
Finally you have
yes it can be avoided
Mm Mm
You understand? But is also like you say that not everyone has that amount
Mm.
or credit, because here in the United States the problem is not even the money.
Mm.
You can have all the money in the world but if you don't have this fabulous credit,
They don't give it to you, right? Sure.
they don't give it to you.
Mm. Is true.
For example,
I don't get, what?
I don't like my check to go in bills, you understand me?
Sure. Sure. Mm.
And I've seen myself in the situation that when I go to do something what jumps out at me is that I don't have enough credit history.
Sure if you haven't bought a lot on credit you don't have credit.
And to me, to hastily to be picking up a microwave in Kmart and I stayed looking at the man. And how do you say something like that, if I already have a microwave in my house?
But yes, is that I think that the credits are built in any part of the world. That is true.
You have to
Is always better why do you want to ask you have to pay whatever you can with credit.
And that is what I, I like I don't like because I've never liked that. If I don't have, better not to buy it.
But perhaps the
And I've come across the case now that well
Sure.
look what a strange thing.
Sure, that's what they recommend is like what that man says. It's nor precisely a good example but. I mean the daily shopping doing it with the card and paying at the end of the month.
I look, I turned in even all my credit cards and everything. Because I saw myself in a situation that I was paying for that which they put to the card, right?
That if something happens to you or you stay without a job, supposedly the insurance
yes, Sure, it covers you.
it covers you or it stops until a certain time
A year, I think, yes.
and when I went to activate it because I had a car accident they told me no.
that no?
That no. And I told him, how can it be possible that you are telling me no?
Mm.
When already for a year and a half
No you've paid it.
I've paid it.
Sure. That are like yes.
Then, that no. I had to have notified them thirty days when
After the accident.
after the accident.
Ah.
And I, but you wanted me to answer in thirty days if I was in the hospital?
Uh uh.
That's the least I'm preoccupied with.
Sure.
That I have to call a credit card to tell the credit card, they have me hospitalized. Three broken ribs, a leg by here.
Well sure.
That's already impossible. No, then when I did that I got the card paid it and cancelled it.
Sure.
And for that I use my debit card.
Mm.
that it's the same thing but I'm only using the money that's in the bank. If there is, there is. If there isn't there, there isn't.
Sure, MM. Sure is whatever there is in the account, right?
And that has affected me you know for the purchase of the house. I have to wait a year
yes well. Ah, that's why they give you that lease
Exactly. Because I have to increase the number of my
Mm.
of my credit, the score.
Mm.
I have a bit of a history. I mean, this is the only country in the whole world.
Mm.
where they send you, what a mess.
yes, well, no.
they should be living check to check.
Mm. that's right.
When they are not supposed to live like that, do you understand. They are trying that people shouldn't get that much, to have a better quality life.
Sure.
I was shocked, I mean, I well.
Mm.
Only in America.
yes, well, no.
But as long as, it's I
But
there are some things that I do miss. Like with a house, the problem is that you need to do it yourself.
Mm.
But if you are leasing an apartment, there are people that do all of that.
Sure
But, at the same time, you know, you have to wait for them to come out.
Mm. But is not yours, so. yes well sometimes they also don't do it.
No, so I moved, that's why I moved.
yes you have to be in a place that is more or less expensive so that they give you everything fast and you are good
Ah, goodness we already are paying almost an arm and a leg but for everything it was a
careful with the other You see.
A drop
uh uh.
we lasted three months, four months with water coming out of both.
Mm.
By the. By the corners of the house.
By the yes.
Because the apartment had a leak.
Mm.
You know who it is, that is also not that easy.
yes,yes, is also not like that. No you have to close it very fast.
I that I. For me is better, for you to buy it.
Sure. is always better, right?
You are already in your own, you are paying for yourself.
Mm.
You understand me. When you already have enough time you can get a loan against your house.
Sure, isn't it?
You know it's not like that, it's not the same as when you are leasing, you don't own anything.
Mm.
You know that it'll take a toll in the short term.
yes well, that's right.
But, that has been my own experience and I particularly wouldn't recommend it to anyone, if they can
Mm.
If they have other options, there are some programs that help you buy your first house.
Yes, well there are some. There are some for teachers.
Exactly.
Uh uh.
And for people that are buying their first home, if you've never bought a house before, I think it's called the FHA loan.
Uh uh.
They help you.
Look at that.
And they give you a certain percentage if not all the money.
Uh uh.
You know with the income tax and that, the mortgage company has gone mad because they know that everybody has two thousand, you know, Pesos.
Mm.
That are going to be sent to the government.
Uh huh
And they lower all your credit
Sure
That's the best time to go out and find, and, i don't know
Uh huh
But that's been my experience, i don't know yours
yeah, well, no, i don't, since I'm not gonna stay here to live, i just rent here, but if i were able to rent, i mean, buy and then sell
i would have done that too, because I'd be making some money too
Yes, that's true. And here in Florida, the prices of properties
Uh huh, huh
Go up, properties don't go down here, they go up
Yes, exactly, that's what I've seen through comments from other friends, right?
Because unfortunately, this is the country, you know, the state where everybody wants to come
Uh huh
it still hasn't
yes, that's true, that too right?
They just come to lead twenty miles per hour
Uh huh, but, you see, that's ultimately better
I mean, they don't
If you finish paying it, it's yours, right?, if not, you can
right?, if you have, you know, any emergency
negotiate, earn some money for yourself
Exactly, and in any emergency, you're forbidden to get any loan at the university, do you know what i mean?
You have a, right?, sure, uh huh, a mortgage, you're right
You're going to find your mortgage and how much you have in equity, you have money now
yes, yes
You know it's not the same when you're renting
Not anymore, when you rent you lose a lot of money too. What i do is, i mean, you lose a lot of money a year
I barely heard that last one
That you lose a lot of money renting, you lose a lot of money annually
And, almost, yeah
Matías
¡Hi!, yes, my name is Martín
Martín
Yes
what's up, Martin?, how are you?
Fine, you?
Fine, everything's fine, everything's cool

Yes, yes, yes, a little further after Ramos
Everything's fine, what?, what?, after, right?
Yes

Everything's fine, everything's fine

Uh, I'm in Philadelphia now
Oh, me too
But, oh, look at that
Yes, yes
Uh, but i recently moved to Baltimore
Oh, yeah
Yes, yes
And, what are you doing in Baltimore?
uh, i work in, I'm starting to work at the Neuro Sciences department
Of Neuro-. oh, look at that, that's good
yes
What are you, are you a Biologist?
yes, yes
I, me too
Oh, look at that
I'm also a biologist, yes, what's up?, you studied at the "Uva" [grape] right?
Yes, I'm at the U
In Buenos Aires?
yes
Oh, it's ok, exactly
yes
Oh, it's ok, but you graduated long ago
I spent some time there, yes, i just..., I'm about to get a doctorate
Oh, look at that, i, i, I'm a student
Oh
I haven't, i have't graduated yet
Oh
I have a few more years left to go
Oh, well
For that
Well
I'm in third
Good look with that
Thank you very much, thank you, i came here to study uh, I'm doing a, uh, an internship, i'm not working
Oh, look at that, that's good
Here in Penn, in Penn
Look at that, that's good
What?
i said that's good
yes, yes, yes, the truth is i managed to get "laurito" here, through a contact, and it's good, you?
Uh, I'm at Penn University now, but
Oh, you too, here in Penn too
Yes, temporarily, yes
Oh, maybe, maybe you'll even see me on the hall
Maybe
Right?, while you're working
that could also be
it could be, right?
Yes, do you rent or?
I
are you an owner?
I'm, I'm standing now in the, i'm here in, i think I've been here for two weeks, and i'm leaving in two months from now, i'm staying at
my girlfriend's brother's house
Oh, look at that
Right, so none of that
Oh, look at that
I don't even rent, I'm just a guest here
Sure, is loaned,
You?
I've, rented a while, I mean since
Here is common Right? that of renting,
And yes what happens is that buying is, is very expensive now
So expensive.
yes, is very expensive especially in the cities, now is getting too expensive.
every day is more expensive.
yes,
okay,
Well Philadelphia particularly is very expensive now. Comparing it to how it was four five years ago.
And Baltimore?
And Baltimore is starting to increase now. But also, they are increasing the prices of everything, yes
It's getting, it's getting Top
No, no, so much like all, no, but
But little by little
But yes, as the city grows, the prices are increasing
a little, Is Baltimore nice?
Is small, Philadelphia is nicer, but
Is small.
Yes, but, there they go, the crash is right there
And, and are you renting there in Baltimore too?
Yes
You were renting here and there too
Yes, yes, yes
What's cheaper, here or there?
It's a little bit cheaper, yes
A little bit cheaper
yes, it's a little bit cheaper
But it's almost the same
Almost, yes, in fact it is, i don't know, maybe ten percent cheaper, five percent cheaper
and, an apartment or a house?
It's an apartment, yes
Apartment
Yes, houses are very expensive
Yeah, right?
Yes
And also, better than the one here?, than the one in Philadelphia, the apartment is nicer?
And for the same money, sure, for the same money you can rent something a little bit bigger, with more services
Oh, more, does the hotel give you a lot of services?
it's
i'm sorry, the department?
Yes, yes, it's, it has more, uh, more things than here
Sure, sure, sure, sure, and so the subject, the subject was housing, right?
yes, yes, i was, that's why i was talking about that
He precisely said something about a witch [a "burbuja", bubble], right?, what did he say?
Oh, no, what the witch [a "burbuja", bubble] means is
I didn't hear
We throw the witch [a "burbuja", bubble] to that which, that properties are kinda overrated, i mean, the price is higher than what it's really worth
so they call it the witch [bubble] because they say that at some point it will get punctured and the prices are gonna go down again
Oh, that's why
Yes, i mean, the witch [bubble], they say that in New York and Los Angeles it's, it's about to get punctured
Because the witch [bubble] started growing ten, fifteen years ago
It started ten, fifteen years ago
However, here in Philadelphia, yeah, here, on the other hand, it has started, five years ago it started like that, so they say that prices might go rising for a while until
the witch [bubble] breaks. I don't know if it's a witch [bubble] or not, but the prices went up a lot during the last times, that's true
And they keep rising in New York, in Los Angeles
Yeah, they keep rising for now, right?, right
Or are they holding up?
They keep rising, so i don't know if it's gonna get punctured at some point
Sure, each time is harder,
What?
Oh, each time is harder to rent, to live in an important city let's say big
yes, no everything is super expensive. The Bubble anyways refers to buying, but but well, obviously if it's more more expensive to buy the prices of the rents also increase, yes.
The rent also, is the same so to speak,
Sure,
It increases also is okay, is okay. And have you been here in the United States many years?
Me it's been four and a half years
Four years and, ah a lot
yes, a lot, a lot
Ah, look And is it good living here, or no, more or
yes, one gets used to it
but there's are many differences from Argentina.
yes, there are, obviously there are differences. I mean, to start your friends are not here, your family is not here things of that sort,
Sure
And, eh, and some things are hard to find.
Hard things of what?
but of finding I say, I mean food, or things that you are
Sure
used to eating over there, that here don't exist or well and the treatment of the people is different all those things right,
Sure and,d and people, people from here?  or from other counties, are there many, many people from the other side two who came here, who you met?
and above all in the University, in the University area, do you know many people from outside,
Many Latinos
there's everything, a bit of everything, but yes, like, it's easy to meet, it's easier than in other areas.  Meeting Latinos or Europeans or whatever,
There are many, no?  Those who work in the sciences are very few, no?  Americans who are natives from here
And it's forty percent more or less, and the rest is all from outside
Forty, ah, like more, more foreigners than
yes, yes, I think that there are more foreigners than
than natives.
than natives, yes,
And did you make many, ah, friends?  Your friendships, how are they going?
Fine, fine, I have friends from everywhere, in reality, like friends from Latin America, from Argentina, from Chile
Friends from Argentina who you met
from Brazil
in Argentina and they're here?
I met the majority here or in Argentina simple acquaintances, and I made friends here, simply by, well, I didn't know they well, I knew them more from sight or from the faculty
Ah, yes
or from
Ah yeah, yes, they're studying the same thing here and, let's say, studied the same, the same job,
Sure
scientific
Sure, sure, sure
ah
And then, well, other people from other places, I don't know, when we were of American people also Simply also for
you became friends  with American people,
because they worked in front, yes, Eh, people that worked here, worked near here
Sure
eh, or also Europeans
Sure,
Eh, well
And are there things to do?
No, Here in Philadelphia
yes,
yes, I think so is peaceful.
is it, is it fun?
Is peaceful
Peaceful Right?
yes, is peaceful.
There isn't, there isn't
But Baltimore is more peaceful,
Oh, Baltimore
even more quiet
Baltimore is very quiet, right?
Yes
Very quiet
Very quiet, we're just getting used to it there, yeah, i can't say much, but I'm under the impression that
And, but it's
it's a lot smaller
[a] little town compared to Philadelphia
yes, yes, yes
And there's not much of anything in Philadelphia, there's not much, it lacks, there's no, there's no party like in Buenos Aires, the crazy partying
No, you have to go, no, no, no, you need to go to the Old City side, to that area
I don't know Old City yet, i think, the only thing i saw is
It's near Delaware, the wide river, not the
Oh, and on what street is the river?
And, Front
Oh, sure, you have to go there first lets say
Sure
Oh, that, that's nice, isn't it?, oh, i have to go there some day
It's nice, it's nice, right?, i mean, it's filled with bars and restaurants
Nicer than the center. Yes,
No, more or less I mean you have, you have the rivers what happens is that the bars are not on the river, that's a design problem of this city
Instead of having made a nice riverside path
Ah, they are near the river, but not on the river.
They are like a block away Sure, sure, and the riverside path is like to walk, like a boulevard to walk but there's nothing else.
But is, is picturesque so to speak.
Is picturesque, Is a little, Like there's nothing, they could've made some little bars, bars, something nice to, to drink a coffee there, but no
I mean is just a path with
Exactly, is a path next to the river where you can see
Like the one here in the river that takes you to the museum?
how the boats go by.
of art
Is a little wider, is like a boulevard, is like the boulevard in Mar de Plata.
is is nicer than that one right?
yes, is a little better,
Because that that path kind of sucks there isn't a lot
No, but
That path goes to the museum and there is the park
yes, No, but it's good well eh. If you go to the museum there it gets nicer.
When you get to the museum.
Passing the museum.
Oh, yes, where the ducks are.
yes, the tracks full of ducks but
yes, I was there once, I went there the other day
y6es, oh, if you go to the east side you will reach a place in which there's another river, it's called the
Oh, you have to walk a lot.
And it's way nicer.
you have to continue, where the nautical houses are
yes, yes, if you take your bike, no, you have to pass them, it's far away from them yes, if you go by bike, it's about forty, forty five minutes away
forty minutes,
by bike, yes
by by bike
yes,
oh, they give you
A lot but, it's okay, it's fun and if you can, you should do it.
and, what's there?
ah, there's another river but this one is like, have you seen the South of Argentina? It's similar, isn't it?
yes,
I mean
Kind off
Much more precarious but it's good, right?, because there's, there's like a forest and the river crosses the middle of the forest
Sure, oh, yes
And the people, yes, people fly-fishing, it's good, it's nice, it's very different, because it's also in the middle of the city and it's like
kinda crazy that it's in the middle of the city
Yes
Because it looks like a forest, in fact there's no cellphone signal
But it's in the middle, let's say it's in the suburbs, right?, in the middle
No, no, it's still in the middle of the city
Oh, the city is still there, go on
Yes, yes, it's very crazy
Oh, look at that
yes, yes, that's a nice place
That's odd, the only place i went, that i met was, well, up until the museum and afterwords the center, the streets where to do shopping
Oh, you saw everything over there, yeah
Sure
Old City, right?, and all that you told me too
Yeah, right?, yeah, you have to go
Sure, all shopping, for now, all shopping
Sure
GAP is cheaper, GAP is very cheap, I'm buying some things in
You're in on the American consumer wave
Uh, yeah, more or less, i still have more left
Sure
Uh, i need, i need, i want to buy an iPod
yes, those are good
They're cheap
I have one
They're like to buy a pair and send them to Argentina, right?
And, i don't know, i don't know how much they're selling for, do they sell well in Argentina?, or are they expensive to?
The iPod or any MP3 player?
the iPod's i mean
Hello, this is Vanessa

it's cold right,
I get called, they tell me.
it's fine here
People call me Chari, but my name, they call me Chari. I can't, I can't understand you
Chari, so, have you been there, is it cold there?
yes, there's a lot of noise
Oh well I can barely hear you Victor, there's a lot of noise
it's so expensive
yes, well today's subject is housing, are houses expensive where you are from?
well, no, it's all right.
Yes, how much does a house or an apartment cost there? How much does a house or an apartment cost there?
you can buy them from seven, eight hundred, seven or eight hundred dollars.
How much? Oh, the rent
the rent
Oh, but if I wanted to buy one
I can't understand you honey, I can't understand you, I don't understand what you are saying.
To buy one?
You wouldn't want to buy there.
Hello, what if I want to buy one there? How much? mhm
How much? I don't know honey, I've never bought one
ah, okay
Really and how much is a rent over there
Well here in San Diego housing is very expensive, But it is cheaper renting than buying. yes Here to rent something lets say a room, like nine hundred dollars, a month.
wow My God
yes and to buy, like half a million. At least.
then you must have a good job, right.
yes a very good job, and here, the people buy houses, but I don´t know how they do it, there are not so good.
can you believe that they are selling something out of a base.
hmm, it is also possible, but here people get very creative in them see that they give loans to people, then they give a credit of fifty, or very crazy things like that, you only pay the interest.
hmm
But many, many people buy here, With five hundred thousand dollars can hardly buy a thing, it is true.
never
hmm, nothing, nothing, in a good area, hmm
nothing Oh my God in a good area, then in a poorer area, then how much would it cost.
Eh, there is not, nothing, good, there is nothing. in a poor area a room and a bathroom, nothing for less that three hundred fifty thousand.
My God
Ah but I am talking of an area with crime, horrible,forget it.
Drugs, crime and drugs
With all. and, aha So things of housing are very bad here. yes, then you are in
like for the, renters
yes
So, so, so, it was great for the clients.  for, for the client, and also for those who live in the area.  aha
yes for, for everything, but here I, I moved to San Diego in two thousand one, since I moved, the housing prices have more than doubled.
but you can pay this, it's true.  And they never bought anything for you.
yes we're with the Navy and so we're living from the Navy, I don't know if you can imagine.
a million dollars, so, how long will you wait to buy something for you?  How long will you want for at least an apartment or an apart- a,
how much would it be?
Well, an apartment for you.
yes, well, since I have a family with three kids, we need at least three rooms and this wouldn't be less than seven hundred thousand dollars and no, we won't be able to.
right
We won't be able to.
You've never been to Ponce, you've never been to Ponce.
so,
Ponce is really beautiful
No, so,
Yeah but you go to Taplado to Taplado beach the coast, it's really pretty, many artists, they go and say beside the sea, the tabloid says
Ah, I haven't been to Puerto Rico since I was little
Oh, and your family never went, to any place that you know.
yes yes yes, no no no, yes when I was little we went, but that was many years ago.
I, can I tell you something personal.
yes
I, I well, I am gay
ah
okay, my, my My life is that, my mom, when I, I was younger my mom never showed me the love I wanted her to showed me.
hmm
then I am frustrated because of that my mom never, at thir- at fourteen I was raped I was raped, two people raped me, two people,
Ah
people in who, I trusted, you know, I felt in love with one of them and we the other one he raped me Do you understand me?
hmm, yes it has caused you a lot of problems obviously.
I am, talking that at, at fourteen . I am talking that at fourteen years old, then
there is
because of destiny or something, the people who raped me, well. One of them is at jail for being a raper, I never knew that Juanito, the guy I was with,
was a raper
hmm
Do you understand me? I have been here for twelve years and as I am gay, I was afraid that somebody, would, would do something bad to me. Do you understand me?
I was afraid that someone could kill me from behind, Do you understand me?
yes, of course.
Then when I felt in love, I felt in love with him, well, he took advantage of it, as I never wanted to do something with him, I wanted, to do nothing with him, only kissing.
he was eighteen and I was fourteen
yes
Then with one, we were in some Patron Saint parties, and we left
oh
and What's wrong? Excuse me You Okay
mm
Then we were in the Patron Saint parties and then he wanted to go out with me, he invited me somewhere.
mm
Then how was I to know that it was a park, a park suddenly Chachi's friend, may he rest in peace also well, appeared behind me
um
and they hit me with a rock on the head. They beat me, yes and I tell you the truth, Can I speak straight with you?
yes
um um, while one, while one raped me another one was giving me hickeys, would kiss me and I was running, nobody would hear me, I mean, me running, nobody heard me
but when I ran they collided into me, I fell to the floor.
ah, no
then they, that was horrible really now I'm forty
ah, And how old are you now? ah
Pardon forty four - I take off four so that no one believes me
ah, so what a thing
But, if you see me, I look- you see me I look thirty eight, thirty six years old.
ah, what luck, at least,
thanks
And so, everything is going pretty well or
Not now, I'm homeless now, i'm homeless now, and, uh, now a friend of mine is letting me live in her house, she's giving me some time here in the house
And a year ago, my husband, with whom i was with for nine years, left me for a woman
Oh
Yeah, he left me for a woman, even though, she was a woman that doesn't even have teeth, a woman of over fifty years old, a drug addict woman
So it didn't last, it didn't last even two months and now he's in jail
Oh no
I was born, i was born on nineteen sixty one
Oh, that's horrible, you have lots of problems
On October seventeen, October seventeen of the sixty one
Oh, oh
So, according to, according to me, my mom never supported me, my mom was
Oh, well, yeah, well
Was always away from me, if i went out, she never said "god bless you", and that, to me, you understand, that makes me feel bad
Sure
Bad, i really think about that
yes
And i get sad because i never, she has never been a mother to me, you know what i mean, ad I'm telling you because i want to let it out
Yes, sure, sure, well, do you talk to her or don't you talk to her anymore?
i talk to her sometimes but
ah, that
my family, is not united as I would like
what a shame
as it would be united in family, understand that in Christmas we hug each other that in the birthdays would tell me, tell me happy birthday
mm
no my life is like that
yes that, that is very unfortunate, but that you are good now with your friend for now, at least you have someone there with you, right.
yes thank God
yes because is hard really, without the support of the family.
my sister's family doesn't want to talk, I told her to go visit me I was, I got out, yesterday I got out of a program of
I was a drug addict where a program of
ah
and then I called her so she would go see me, for Christmas and my sister didn't go see me
ah, well, the
in what sense
yes maybe she doesn't, doesn't understand and no maybe she doesn't have any trust yet understand? well, that maybe,
but I've never done anything bad to her.
no, well that maybe, maybe she feels so bad and thinks she doesn't want to, She doesn't want to suffer anymore, you understand maybe she doesn't want to suffer seeing you a certain way.
and that, that, because I know that with my brother is also like that, I suffer a lot. and sometimes I, you know, is hard seeing him.
really
well, so, I'm sorry for you maybe I don't know if you have faith in God, but. that has helped me a lot.
no, I have a great faith in God, I'm very religious
So,
I was raised in the Pentecostal church
yes
And I believe in God, I know there's a Big God.
there is
and I know that I believe in the holy spirit
yes
I believe that some day God will give me a sentimental prize But I've always believed in God, because he who doesn't believe in God, is not worth anything.
yes, yes, because there's no, no way of living without one having a, a, a,
mm
having this, yes believing in God, you have to have trust and believe in God and do and do all the, the good, that you can.
and
Hi
Hi, yes, who am i talking to?
It's Maria Ines from Philadelphia, who's this?
Oh, it's Jorge, from Los Angeles, how are you Maria Ines?
Fine, very well, you?
Well, everything's good, everything's good, we have to talk about housing here
About housing, what are you?
We're going to philosophize about
Oh, philosophize, lets see, are you an owner?
And you're Argentinian
Yeah, it shows, everybody... i can't hide it
I'm Argentinian too
You're also argentinian?, you're a master, i didn't notice that about you, have you been here for long or not?
Yes, eighteen years
Uh uh
And you, how long have you been here?
No, a year
Very well, very well, from where, Buenos Aires?
a year, no, I'm from Mar del Plata
Hey, Mar Del Plata, i lived in that city
Really,
unfortunately just for a year because it's one of the most beautiful cities in the world,
It really is,
Well, oh Mar del Plata is wonderful, well no, yes, I just lived there for a year and then we went back to live to Buenos Aires,
And where are you originally from?
I was born, no, born and raised in Buenos Aires
Oh, I see
In the West Nuz, Valentin, yes, yes
that's huge,
So, are you now living in the United States from Mar del Plata, did you come
yes,
very well, very well
yes, yes, yes, yes, no I moved to Mar del Planta until I came here, well someday I'll move  back to Mar del Plata
Oh, Mar del Plata is a wonderful city
It really is,
It's so beautiful,
It is, yes
I haven't been there for a long time so I can just imagine how beautiful it should be now
No, it is beautiful, really
Well so you are now in Philadelphia.
I'm in Philadelphia
Well, then you are renting or what
yes,
You have your own house
No, no I'm renting, the idea is
Very good
come to Philadelphia to make some money and return to Argentina and have my own house
Oh, that's the idea
That's the plan or part of a house at least.
Very good, so that's the idea, I think that you will be able to achieve it because eh, basically eh, in the comparison how it is
let's say the market here of the United States
mm
And the cost of living in Argentina, oh, oh, ye, yes, you will be able to achieve it
Is terrible, the cost of living in Argentina seems like I don't know, as if it was Switzerland, but they charge
Ah Is the cost of housing going up a lot in Argentina?
super expensive yes, yes, everything is increasing and Mar del Plata especially everything is increasing a lot
But sure because it's a tourist city
Sure
more del Plata
yes, And now is in fashion again because there was a time nobody went, I mean Mar del Plata and now like it got
How is that?, since there was a time where no one was there, that no one went there
yes, there was a time when, i don't know if you remember when it was one on one, one peso was one dollar
Yes
Well, in that time, people
Yes, i was here but i don't remember
sure, people went to Punta del Este, to Brasil, because it was very cheap
Exactly
And they didn't go to Mar del Plata, so it dropped a lot there, but it's like it's activated again, and the truth is it's all in, but well, we Mar Platences [those of us from Mar del Plata] are affected negatively
in the way that properties go up
Oh, but the, but Mar del Plata is an incredible city, it's gorgeous
And, where did you live in Mar del Plata?, in what neighborhood?
Well, i completely forgot... i forgot the address
Oh
Address and all that, bu i lived there and i went to elementary
Look at that
for like one or two years, oh, i enjoyed it a lot
Oh, when you were little
You were litt-, yes, you were little
Oh
But, uh, i enjoyed it a lot, it's an in- city
Yeah, Mar del Plata
incredible
It's nice, it's really nice
It's beautiful, and it's beautiful. I remember we always went with my dad, with my family to a restaurant
Los Angeles
That probably isn't there anymore
Do you remember the name?
It was "La Marmita"
"La Marmita", sounds very familiar
Sounds familiar, maybe it's still there
It sounds familiar, but i really don't know, i don't know
Well, it doesn't matter, well, so, we're gonna talk, speaking about housing, how
Oh, well speaking of housing
how much would it cost a, uh, in an area uh, how can i say, well in a good neighborhood, generally all neighborhoods are good in Mar del Plata, right?
Yeah, in a neighborhood, I'm telling you the price doesn't vary much from one neighborhood to another
No, no
No, it's another thing that amazes me quite somte, I'm still looking at it on the internet, it's not like I've gone there and spoken but
sure, sure, but then
But no, the price doesn't vary much
It doesn't vary
An apartment
You want to tell me yes, something not very luxurious, Let's say a, a bedroom only.
With a bedroom like that normal, in a normal neighborhood
yes,
And between twenty five thousand and thirty five dollars
Wow Well but is yours, completely yours
yes,
With thirty five thousand dollars you buy
Compared to the ones that come out here, it really is cheap
Here you don't buy, here maybe with that money you buy a bathroom that's all, the bathroom
Sure yes, yes, there with that money you fix the roof of a house see, here is incredible
Exactly, but with twenty five or thirty five thousand dollars in Buenos, in Mar del Plata you can buy a one bedroom apartment, in any part for example of the avenue colon,
And there is for twenty twenty few, I would tell you in the avenue colon for example
Oh, when you are talking of twenty five, thirty five, you are talking
Of nicer neighborhoods Of neighborhoods how can I put it Eh, with ocean view or with
ah,
yes or the center, or
in the, oh, okay, okay, Sure, well, well but it's worth it In, in comparison yes, how much it can cost if you go to buy a one bedroom apartment
There in Philadelphia where you are now.
uf, I don't know
An apartment in Philadelphia, it depends, because I was talking about, you know, now that I am doing this
yes
To a lot of people in Philadelphia
Oh, really?
And I have talked to a Paraguayan, I have talked to an Argenti- to one or two Argentineans
Oh, really?
In Philadelphia, and they say that basically it depends on what area of Philadelphia you live in
yes
Everything is expensive
yes
But how much will it cost, an apartment in Philadelphia may cost you, depending on where you buy it, it may cost you
Oh my god, I don't know, I have a
I don't know but more than a hundred and fifty thousand, that's for sure
Exactly, two hundred thousand, three hundred thousand dollars
yes, yes, I have ea friend who bought a house here. It is a house, a big house, it's nice and it is in a wonderful area but it costed her three hundred thousand dollars
Right, no way
yes, no, no
no way, no way, are you happy in Philadelphia?
yes, we are happy. I'm the one who is more homesick, I don't know, I don't know, I like Philadelphia, it's nice, it has interesting things
Sure, because most of your family is in Mar del Plata
Sure, eh
Oh in, oh in Argentina
yes in Argentina more than anything, in Mar del Plata well are my parents, my siblings and the rest are
Oh, sure, you miss it is the first year here
Eh, yes mm, yes
And, besides in Philadelphia the climate is so extreme, you said that it's been like a year that you are here
yes, yes, it's cold and hot
But basically, you have the extreme heat. And the extreme cold.
yes,
You have snow.
yes,
And a lot of snow in the east coast.
yes,
Here in the California area is not like that, is not like that
It's very nice Right,
In the California area, eh , eh Eh, in the West area of the United States, California Where I'm at you don't see snow, it doesn't snow
Sure
It could be that it's cold, but is a cold that, is a cold that basically doesn't kill anyone, you understand me
Sure,yes, yes, yes
And eh, And, and basically, this year it hasn't been very cold, on the contrary With these changes in the temperature it really hasn't been cold
Sure your winter is a very mild winter, right?
No, is very mild
Like a Buenos Aires winter let's say
And well what the Buenos Aires winter has is the humidity no, the Buenos Aires winters are much more intense that the ones in California
Ah, look
Because the cold you have in Buenos Aires, that you have in Buenos Aires is a humid cold
yes,yes
That generally, that I think is, basically, well the one from Mar del Plata is a little different But in Buenos Aires you have that cold that gets in your bones
yes, well Mar del Plata yes also, terrible
And Is like that also, is like that, is like that, not here, not here at most a, a, a, a jacket on top and nothing else, is not much.
Sure, no here no, here you have to buy thermal socks, thermal shirts, hats, gloves
yes, Philadelphia, the snow and have
Everywhere cold No
Perhaps you have to go out to shovel the snow from the door of your
And yes, yes you have to
house and
yes, me because like, well since is an apartment, the person who manages it does it
yes those, the building managers,
Sure, but if not the people that have a house have to go out, they sell the shovels in the supermarkets
ah, ah, ah, ah, okay
Oh, they also sell some things to get the ice from car's windshields, that's very funny
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, yes, yes, how did you end up in Philadelphia?, do you have friends, known acquaintances, etc
No, actually i got a job here
Oh, that's why, i understand now
And, sure
That's why, there's a positive reason
Sure, University Of Penn, you see, it's big
Exactly University of Pennsylvania, exactly, exactly
And, well, and
Well, very interesting, very interesting, very interesting, well, uh, what else can we say
And you, your home, you have to tell me
Oh, so you work at the University of Pennsylvania, where this study is
Where, yes
Exactly, i'm sorry, what were you asking me?
Yes, yes, yes, no, tell me, do you have a house of your own or do you rent?
No, perfect, i was thinking of talking about the subject; no, no, no, i don't have a house of my own, and i don't think i ever will in the United States
It's not, it's not, it's not my, my, my stile, no, I'm not interested, besides, if i had, let's say, like a million dollars or more
I would buy a house, but I'm really not interested
Yes, sure
I don't, i don't, I'm not interested, i rent, but, i basically rent, i don't know what we would say in Argentina, an apartm-. it's not, it's just an ambient
yes,
here in the United States, well, eh, here in Cali, in Los Angeles, they're called Bachelor's it's a room where you have, where you have the bathroom that's complete, of course, your kitchen
And everything complete, eh, I don't know how to say this,
like, a something like
Exactly, something for style
Ah, how nice
I don't know how, something we would say in Argentina, well in Argentina we would call it like a
yes, its like one big room
It's just one room, it's not so big you see, but for me it's enough
And for just one person, you live alone?
With it's private bathroom, yes, with it's private bathroom and private kitchen, complete and of course, close to everything, and yes, and the price that I'm paying
I'm paying three hundred and eighty three dollars a month.
Ah, that's very cheap
Yeah yeah you, it's basically what you're, what kind of place are you renting in Philadelphia?
We with, it's a two room apartment, it has a bedroom
Igor
yes good evening yes my name is Ever and I'm speaking from Pennsylvania
Ah, me too I'm in Pennsylvania.
Ah really, what part?
in Pittsburgh
In Pittsburgh, I'm in Philadelphia, we are like four hours away.
ah, yes driving, driving more or less yes
yes, yes
I don't know it but they've told me that there are a lot of people, also cold
yes, I think, well, I think that Pittsburgh is a lot colder, but but yes, here it is, is cold and how do you call it, yes it's a pretty big city.
yes, yes they've told me there are a lot of Latins, Hispanics there, all that.
And have you been in Pittsburgh a long time
well, yes more or less, I've been like almost five years here, And you?
Oh wow eh, no now I'm on my second year here.
Ah, you don't have much
But, previously I lived in Maryland
Ah, you moved to Philadelphia
Yes we moved up here.
Ah, well, that's good
A little cold here
Uhm, today's subject appears to be about renting or being an owner
yes, yes, housing, well, I, uh, I rent, sadly I haven't had the chance to be an owner yet, and how do you say it
eh, but yes, it's something I think that definitely brings you  benefits, eh
uhm, which country are you from, where are you from?
I'm from Guatemala
Ah, I'm from Venezuela
Venezuela, nice, nice. I, uhm, I've been renting for several years, one of the reasons why I haven't managed to buy a house is because I've been moving around a lot, I haven't found uh
A long term place
yes, a long term place, and it's necessary, because the buying process takes at least a year and then it's not worth having something unless
you'll stay in that place a couple years to be able to
yes
get something out of it
I agree
But definitively, I think it's a great benefit, first because when you rent all the money goes away, but when you, when you buy a house it's a kind of investment, and eventually
you get it back
yes, that's true. The only thing I see, since they ask pros and cons, well, it's always better to be an owner rather than, as you say, throw the money to the garbage
yes
Uhm, the pros and cons, well, it has to do with maintenance, no, because at least you're the owner and it's, well
but when you are the owner, you assume all the responsibility of the property. No, uhm, I thi- I think that's the only advantage of renting
It's that for example, maintenance, it's in charge of the, of the renter but of the owner, yes. Keeping the property maintained and paying the expenses
Is the only advantage that I see of renting, no This
yes
But, but I agree with you that is better to be an owner.
yes,
And I put this example, because or example when one lives in a building complex or something for example, the one who rents doesn't have to worry if something gets damaged
or to remove the snow, or mow the lawn, nor pay for those things. Oh, eh, the same, same administration of the properties is in charge of all that
In fact I think that many elderly, retired people. That are already alone that don't have enough for their expenses and their things at the end eh I've seen many that, that rent
They have their property and they rent it, That way because they can't even be mowing the lawn nor removing the snow anymore.
yes, yes
Then they decide to rent
yes you are quite right because how do you call it, and in reality, is perhaps one of the eh, perhaps is the con of buying and quite a lot the pro of buying, because at least in my case.
I have very little time left in reality and what is it called, I wouldn't like to spend it cleaning the snow, mowing the lawn, eh
Exactly
Or fixing things in the house, for example in my family there are many people that are, are homeowners and well usually the houses are not bought new, is more common
Exactly
is more common buying them used and what do you call it, always perhaps that the water heater breaks and that is, is a big expense,
it takes quite a lot of time to fix it. oh, a pipe breaks because of the cold, especially in these states,
And it's expensive to repair it.
And it's costly and what do you call it, no, I'm not sure how the law here in Pennsylvania is, but in Maryland eh, they implemented a law that when, when it snows.
If the person who is the owner of the house doesn't, doesn't clean eh, what is the sidewalk where the people walk.
Where you walk, yes, yes
But is there out of the house's land, but if the owner doesn't clean, doesn't clean that area and someone falls, they can sue them and they will probably win
yes here is the same, here is the same.
Same, that I didn't know, and how do you call it. I don't know, I always thought that law is somewhat strange, because if I see that it's not too good to walk by there well I would just go by another side
And ultimately, in, in that area the person is not an owner anymore, but rather that it belongs to, to, to the government. But,
Exactly
But is is something you have to be careful about because I know many friends that when it snows say, oh, I have to clean before, someone falls and tries to sue me.
mm yes one can get in a lot of trouble with that, even here, when you don't mow the lawn, here eh, they also fine you. when it's too high
really
the, the lawn they also fine you, they come and give you a tickets like a ticket and with, like a warning
that it should be cut and shouldn't be so high, even for that
yes I didn't know that, yes and in, in places where there are a lot of trees for the autumn well a lot of leaves fall and that's another job that you have to
Exactly eh, maintenance and all that, that you have to have time and all to do it, so
you have to take
That's why I think when I see the retirees they decide to rent because of that.
And perhaps, yes, where I  live I've seen a lot of older people and I've always asked myself what is the purpose of at that advanced age already to be renting
because, how do you call it, the prices are the same, no, if you buy a house that what an apartment is sometimes. But how do you call it, yes, but in reality when you analyze the situation well, those must be the reasons that they simply avoid
eh, so much extra work and, and, And they live peacefully and don't have to be worrying about repairs.
yes That's without counting any problem that there is, like, you were mentioning, like some bad pipes, a damaged plumbing here is very expensive to pay,
and then is another expense, no, apart from any other, if an animal gets into your house whatever. they have to be able to pay, bear those expenses and,
you claim and they have to answer,
yes, yes
That would be, lets say the advantages, and the disadvantages, I would say, it is not yours it is a money that you are not investing in something, in a property that you will have in the future
to give security to your children. well, and how good, I think that always in someway, to rent, against be an owner, it is always good to be an owner in someway, because at the end you are investing money month to month.
instead of, of not having it.
yes it is very true and how is it called, eh, specially, now, no, I am not aware of the market here, but in Maryland In the last
seven years, the housing raised a lot and has become impossible to find a favorable house, but for those who bought in in, appropriate dates, have, have made much money, because people who has bought.
who have bought houses seven years ago for one hundred and fifty thousand dollars the houses now cost three hundred and fifty, four hundred And those are not a very big houses and it is not necessarily
it is a very special place, but it has rise a lot and, and they sell and maybe buy something more modest and and get a big profit that can be used for
I don´t know, children´s study, personal savings, or investments and how is it called, yes, people who have their time because they are helped now.
yes well here in Pittsburgh. well there are many opportunities, the reality is, I have seen here, that people even when you do not believe it are investing in that
there are many houses like you say that are old. and that are not so bad, some are regular. but there is, there is an evident business here people that
that dedicate to invest in buying houses and then repair them no, yeah, I have seen many people that are dedicated to it, even when there is an auction.
Oh yes
Where there is a, low, low down payment and and, they make a business of that, and well I have friends that repair houses of investors
hmm
that, they put the money and buy houses, they have to be repaired and they buy them, at a good price And the sell them again here you can find a house, no
in that aspect, of course, there are of many prices
oh
there are different price houses and all. Yes there are houses, you can still find houses, regular ones, not at a good price, here too
And they are making money, well
yes, no, no, I knew that a while ago, in Maryland, the houses were really pricy, they'd call the HUD, the HUD were the ones that the government was reselling because of foreclosures and because people hadn't been able to pay them.
aha
and they were selling them at a really good price, maybe the value of a house was one hundred thousand and they were selling them in seventy thousand.
exactly
and and, how can I say this, they would even give them an extra loan to invest in repairing the house with a very low interest rate, yes, that's what you were talking about, that's what they used to do
the ones that worked on that, the contractors, they would buy a house and they would repair it and resell it and they would easily make fifty thousand dollars.
in about three or four months.
No, it's like, that's happening here too and it's okay, it's a good business because I know they are doing well
yes
It's like an investment, to buy these type of properties.

I don't unders- I don't understand.
What a miracle that they got the call fast, today
Ah, yes they always talk a lot, because in reality I'm never here.
I don't know, when I, when one, one, one, doesn't call, it's different women who answer,
In the, no, is an answering machine.
they are two, just two women
Eh?
How many, how many answer the phone there, one or two?
When a woman answers the phone in where?
How many people answer the phone there
Ah, what do I know, it depends.
When you are working, you are working, right?
No no no
that's not your job?
Ah this one yes.
That's your job.
Yes, well it depends who ans- ye, I don't know. Sometimes that you were more than others, you are near the phone, you answer.
Oh you work in your, in your own house? The job is in your own house?
Eh?
Ah yes.
I'm at work now
Well, yeah, uh, when, talking, repeating the couple thing, it was hard to break up to me, that that couple broke up, something that didn't, something that didn't
Yeah, i know, i know, i can imagine, i can imagine, but, what do i know, enjoy who you're with now
The truth is I'm with a guy, a guy there
Is he there with you now?
Yeah, a twenty eight year old one
But is he there, in your house now?
Yes
Oh, yeah?, and didn't, didn't you live with a Chilean friend?
Yes, he lives with a Chilean friend of mine
Is she there now?
But it's, yes, she's there
Oh
But, uh, he comes here to visit, he doesn't live in the house
That's fine, that's fine
He's eating there, i can hear the dish
But, do you eat at this hour?
The Chilean woman is eating
At this hour?
Yes
She's having dinner?
No, eating, eating
Oh
Yes, she's eating now
Hello
Hello? Good afternoon. My name is John, I'm calling from Vancouver, British Columbia Canada. What's your name?
Miriam, from Florida.
From Florida ah, nice to meet you.
yes, yes, yes. Ah, a little far
yes, where in Florida are you talking from?
Orlando.
Orlando, ah, yes like
Yes.
I lived, well, I lived a few months near Orlando by because it's like an hour
Oh. Yes.
is not so far
Mm. And what do you think of, of today's topic?
How to, eh, how to break up with the partner, right?
Mm. yes.
Well well is, well it depends is for example, I don't know, in how old you are uh but it depends on, on the age of the person for example if one
if one is like seventeen, eighteen years old, well is all natural to have a relationship for six months, a year and break up and, and keep on again with another person, and it should be like that
mm.
until one is like I, I say twenty eight, twenty nine, thirty years old
Wow.
this How old are you?
Twenty one.
Twenty one, huh.
Yeah. Well, I
And
MM, that whe-, that ah I, I think a little bit different with, that you, of yeah at fifteen, sixteen years this, the boys
they have a lot of differences that yeah, they broke up with the boyfriend, they start to cry but after a month, they forget about everything and have another boyfriend
Mhm.
but this also depends on the situation I for example, my parents meet when they were sixteen years old continuing up to now they're together, they've been together for about twenty three years together
so the- and they were young, or you know it depends on the situation, it depends on the relationship of the couple you know it's no easier nor harder depending on the age
in my opinion that's not, no it's true because you learn to love other people at different ages, there are men who don't mature until twenty eight years old, twenty nine years
and there are men that mature at sixteen years old depending on the situation that they are in like how their family's relationship was
yes, yes, but remember one thing, well always talking, well, the parents that meet, but that was a different world, right? it was other, other, another time, this, a time
Mhm. Mhm.
more this where it hadn't, eh, there wasn't a lot of opportunity like one has in the world of today. I say that, I say that's why
eh
yes, ah, today the world is more liberal
yes.
eh, the kids are much more liberal now, they like the fashion world, they like to wear this, trying new things but it's still the same, at sixteen, fifteen years old, in my opinion yes, they didn't know what they were doing
yes.
But i think that after nineteen, twenty years, they have some, not everyone, some of them already have the idea, uh, of what is that they want
I, in, in my opinion, I've been with my boyfriend for three years, and, well, it would be really hard to me if we got separated
Yes
but i also have friends that are twenty two, twenty three years old, that have never had boyfriends and that don't want to have boyfriends
Right
Because they don't like being in a relationship, i mean, they like to have friends, right?, so to speak
Right
but everyone, everyone is diff-, is different, and, and you don't, not everyone, twenty eight or less is immature, don't know what they want, it's easy to end the relationship and everyone
but after twenty years and older, it's very hard for them, it's not easy to categorize people by age or gender
depending, right?, every, every person is a different world
Yes, but the, well, i can only talk about my experience, i am, uh, thirty four years old
Uh huh
Uh, and i got married at twenty one
Wow
uh, i separated two years ago
Uh huh
in, and mi situa-, and [in] mi situation it was a mistake to get married at twenty one, we just, i got married because, uh, my girlfriend got pregnant, i have a daughter that's
twelve years old
Uh huh
Uh, the twenties were, thy were very hard for both of us because neither of us had the experience required
MHm
we were not mm, we were not mature enough
Aha
to achieve what we wanted to achieve and that is something that I see more and more, that the, the
what is the big rush to find a couple? If in
MHm
I think it is the fear, you think oh, if I loose this one, if I break off with this one, I won't find another one. I had that fear too
Mhm
When, when I broke off with my wife
MHm MHm
I thought I would never meet again someone I would like, and specially that she likes me too
but that is not true, there is always someone else, other, other chances come
yes
but when you are young, you think, you only think of
yes
the very moment, that's what I saw, it was a problem because if hadn't been for these
experiences, that you need to have in life, you need to have this maturity
yes, I understand that at twenty-one, I wouldn't marry even now, I am still too young although
Mhm
I know him for three years already, but anything can happen in one month, in one year, you never know
he conocido mucha gente que se caso muy joven y ahora su vida ha sido un fracaso.
she has three children by different men, so far it has not been able to overcome that she is very impulsive.
Mhm
we must take time to do things.
there is  no use to rush things to happen.
you must know whether they will be together for a long time.
I think when I turned 21 to 25 I will be a little more mature.
It's good to make a mature decision
yes
for example I´ve known my partner for 3 years
you never know the person to one hundred percent
yes
It is better now because when you are married everything is more difficult.
for example, I don´t want to have children now
yes, right?
We are
No need to have children after marriage
yes.
at least for four or five years.
yes
well, do-, do you live with, with your boyfriend or not?
yes
yes. And how long have you been living together?
Ah, we've been living together for two years.
Like to years? and
Hmm
ah, why, why were you in such a rush to, to, to live together
yes, it was, it was a rushed situation
Yeah
I was, I was moving to another state, and I met him in New York, and we were to, I was moving to, to Michigan
And then, I told him, well, no, we can't be together anymore because I love him but a long distance relationship is not going to work
yes
and uh, and he said, no, he wants to follow me to Michigan, he wants to be with me, this and that, and well, he convinced me.
And until now, since then, since, since then you've been together
Ah. The thing is, well, many people, I don't know, don't remember no only, well, they say, I'll get to know him in 4, 5 years
you will, with ti-, from now that you're 21 until you're 30, you're going to change a lot
yes, yes, no, you change, every year
your-, your desires are going to change, both will change, yes. I think it changes a lot depending on how you live, from, from being 20 to being 30 years old
hmm
you change, uhm, a lot, and well, yes, if a couple gets together when they're 20, ehm, the desires, the, the
the, the desires of, of each person changes too much between the age of twenty and thirty and it becomes harder eh, if one is already, already has for example
if already is, if already has a commitment, right?
Mm.
More if one has, the most important, I say that one that not have kids during that time
Mm. yes, and I, totally
and when is, when is, yes and that is what, continues with that, because
Mm.
with the controls and so much, with, with the pills and all, there's no excuse to know about that.
yes. One is very well informed
yes, and that is the thing that unfortunately within of eh, our community, sometimes excuses are made, right? that they don't educate themselves, but
there's, there's so much, information in Spanish
Mm.
eh, the same as in English that I, that is a, is, is dumb to say ah I didn't know about that there is so much, information about the control
Mm.
in, in, in every language, don't you think?
yes, eh, well ah, for example I'm Mexican, in Mexico they still don't have all that information in all the places, there are still places that the people live in their ranches that
their electricity is
yes, I am half well
a, a, a candle
aha, half Mexica- what part of Mexico do you come from?
Hello?
Hello?
Yeah
Yeah?, what's your name?
What?
What's your name?
My name is William
William, we're both here again
Let, let me be perfectly honest, i have spoken with four or five people, i don't know exactly who's this
Inge
Inge, just like yesterday
Yes, just like yesterday, how are you?
Here, uh, cooking again, because i always cook at this hour
Well, but aren't you married?
No, I'm not married and i don't have a girlfriend or anything
Oh
Or anything, any of that. I like to be a twenty eight year old man, good job, two apartments, i don't think i have the time to be married right now, no
I mean, you have to cook for yourself
No, and i love cooking
Oh, and, what are you making?
I am preparing a coated steak, with croutons
aha
and rise, no, beans today, because I think yesterday I didn't cook the beans too well. But I think today they are fine
The last time you were also preparing a coated steak
Yes, I love coated steaks. That's my favorite
And how do you do it?
Well I think I don't do it like most Cubans do it, who use one of those thin steaks. I buy a sirloin steak
And I but, eh, how you call it? a, it's like a cookie that is , eh, squashed. I put it on top, I coat it, I leave it to
I put onions on it, I put a little green peppers ans I cook it for at least half an hour.
Oh, in the oven?
No, definitely not in the oven. I place it
Oh
eh, I cook it in the frying pan
Oh OK
In the frying pan, the frying pan. And I, I had a bottle of wine today, because today I have to celebrate  that I made a sale
a twelve thousand dollars sell. So
What do you sell?
I think I ca-, eh?
What do you sell?
I sell fabrics
Ah, and and so much, so much money?
Eh, well, eh twelve thousand dollars that, with a commission. Oh yes A lot of money
Aha
Eh I sold a fabric of a, eh I don't know if you know much about the European designers eh, how can you say it, eh
Here in the United States they know Versace, eh Gucci
Aha
eh Chanel but there in Europe those people are nothing. In Europe what is known is Roberto Cavalli, Valentino, Emanuel Ungaro, Eh people a little bit higher right. I sold a fabric, I sold eh
many yards. I sold like eh one hundred twenty, one hundred thirty yards at basically a lot of money. I'm very happy today. So whatever you want to talk with me, talk about whatever you want, I don't care.
Well, the topic is if it's easy or hard breaking up with the partner
Well let me
You've had several partners right, of different types, of different ages, or no?
Eh, yes, I've had several. eh, let me ask you because if I'm not mistaken, you are married with kids.
Yes
So tell me, what do you think. If it's hard, if it's a thing, eh, not very easy breaking up with a partner. You start.
um Well. you know what William? I think we already talked about this same topic.
Then, let's talk about something else.
And I think I talked it with you. I think I talked it with you also.
Then let's talk about something else.
Yes
What do you like to cook?
Oh, I'm not a very good cook, because i'm vegetarian, so, i don't know how to cook meat, that's why i asked you
Yes
And my husband is a carnivore, so, poor thing, i think he suffers with me
Your husband is the american, i remember now
Yes, and he, he doesn't cook either, so he can't either
So, what do you do?, you, you get only McDonald's, you go to McDonald's, you go on the road, where do you go?
Teach me, no, no, i don't cook, but, it's i do chicken and turkey and, but not red meat, no, because it's too hard to cook to get it right
So, you cook him, uh, what, turkey and, and, how do you say, chicken, and that sort of stuff?
Chicken, yes, that sort of thing, yes
Can you imagine, the American eats that chicken, thrilled, how, how's everything over there my love?
Fine, a little cold, nothing else. I got a cold, i don't know where
Yeah?, what are you taking?
Nothing, just Vitamin C
Vitamin C?
Yes
Oh, uh, juice, orange juice
What juice?
Orange juice, that's what has most Vitamin C, i guess, right?
Yes, yes, i have gotten sick a lot this year, you know
Hey girl, what a coincidence, we have... like three times
And this hasn't happened with anyone what has happened so many times?
No, no, truly, no.  I've talked with many Chileans, I've talked with, eh, two Argentinians, I think one from Puerto Rico, a Mexican, I don't remember well because it was the first
Aha
But in reality, the only one I've talked to two or three times, either two or three times, you could say, eh
And I think that this is the third time, yes.  That we talk.
yes, it was, you've been the only one I've talked with three times.  And we've talked the same.  So, in reality you know, I don't think that we should talk about the same thing, because
maybe you have something different to tell me, I don't know.
No, truthfully, no.  And you?
I al- I live, how do you say, like Ricky Martin lives the crazy life.  I work a lot, to earn money, and when Friday, Saturday, and Sunday come
we go to the big parties around here.
Ah.  How nice.  Yes, well you're still young.
Well, you can't say very young.  I think that in two years, eh, I'll be in my thirties.
Aha
So I don't consider myself to be very young, but well, yes, I'm not married, I don't have to answer to anyone
And do you think, do you think in some moment?
What will I do.
you will get married with someone, or do you think you'll stay single?
And no, no, no.  I don't think I'll be single for a long time.  But, eh, I fell in love with a girl from South America.  Eh, she was Argentinian,
Eh, I fell in love with her, but things got complicated, she wanted to get married for the paper and I, you know, and it was something that was more or less she
was honest with me, but I had to get it myself, you know.
aha
I had to talk to her, and get it out of her, and she didn't want to tell me, that's why I didn't do it, but to a good girl
cares more about the interest than about love, so, you know
ah
there are problems. I have met many like her in my life, and, eh, I, believe or not, eh, I grew up in Miami. And if you
know Miami well, Miami is exactly like New York
Uh huh
You must have more street than life. So, I didn't fall into her trap, but never mind, women and men we must go on, and
what can I tell you? I don't want to be alone. I know that, eh, someday I will find a girl or a woman, or a lady, or whatever
you wanna call it, and, and I'll marry her, but I can't take it too hard, you know
uh uh
I know you know what I mean, because you are mature, you have a family, you have your husband, your children. And it's not easy nowadays to find a mature woman
Yes, I think so
We are, we are really bad, right?
Yes
Between men and women
Hm mm. But I think that sometimes men look for younger women, much younger than them I mean, mm. I knew a couple who
she was Russian
Aha
and the husband was thirty years older than her. Yes, I think that
Wow
Thirty years. What may have in common.
Wo
My parents are twenty years and I think that it is twenty years of separation, but lets say, twenty years of age difference.
Oh hopefully, hopefully they use a lot of Viagra yes
But, thirty years. Look that she is
tell her, tell her that I am going to send her three bottles of Viagra.
Look that she is twenty, and he is fifty.
Oh, my God. But well.
Yes, I say fine, I don´t know, sometimes men look for younger women because they are more beautiful, or more
For well, is that, is that, is that
But they can, they can, like, mold them, they are more, a little  manageable
it is that well, when you, when you have so much money like that, the women not all, but lets generalize for a second, when you have so much money like that you can do what you want, let say.
And there are many woman lend themselves for that.
Yes Uh uh
As there are many women that believe in love, in the feelings,
That is true That is true
But eh, in this country, when somebody offers you so much, is difficult to say no.
Uh Uh
At least, me, I try to avoid that. I I am a six feet tall man, I have green eyes, black hair eh, I am neither fat nor thin, you understand me, but
that isn't either throwing the money to women, because after all, what woman doesn't like going out to eat to some fancy restaurant?
and this and that, but not setting the trap, you know, of 'I have a lot of money' no, no, no, not at all
And she is interested in something necessary because you are, more or less, buying her
Sure
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Tell me. Oh, I thought you were talking to me, excuse me. Tell me
And do you live alone, or with someone?
I am visiting my cousin and my grandma who live here in Holland
Oh
Do you live in
We were in Holland not long ago. Well, some months ago, already
You came to Holland?
We took the children yes, we took the children to Disneyland
Oh, I don't live far, I live about fifteen minutes from there
Yes
Well, by now. And eh, in the next two, I've been two holidays here. I think in the next twenty or thirty days I'll move to Miami, because
Holland is too formal fro me, I think. I think that something is going on between Mickey Mouse and Pluto, anyway
Mickey Mouse has always his hand in Pluto's pocket, I don't know, I am a little confused with that, but anyway
Eh, my life is nice in Miami, because there is so much beach, so many people, so many Chilean girls, Argentinean, Bolivian, people from everywhere.Avery nice place
And what part of Miami do you live in?
In Cando, a city called Cando. It is not a very big city but it is a city, eh, I won't say exclusive, but
not downwards, not downwards
But that is near Miami, downtown Miami, isn't it?
Well, downtown Miami can be considered in many ways, but I am about ten or fifteen minutes from there
Oh, ok, not that far, then
A very nice place, really nice, already. Alright, and how are your, eh, I wonder if it is sons or daughters
I have one and one. A son and a daughter. Yes, the big one
One, one and one, how are your sons and daughters?
The big one is five, fine, fine
Everything fine?
and the small one is, he just turned four
And your husband, what's his name? Mm, I guess he has one of those gringo names, Kenny or Jenny
No, no, no, his name is Daniel
Wow, Daniel
Yes
And you, you call him in English, Daniel?
It depends, if I am talking to him in English, then I call him in English, and if I am talking to him in Spanish then I call him in Spanish
It's just that, that I have never heard you speaking in English, how do you pronounce the name?
Hello I'm Alfredo, I speak from New York
how are you? you're speaking with George also from New York
hello George how are you I think we spoke once us two but on another occasion, how is everything going?
yes fine fine thanks, there putting up with the cold a little sick but well the topic
yes and I believe that the topic also we've already touched on it look how things are
seriously
because if I remember well you eh I don't remember eh it could be it was another person that I'm getting confused but that you had been married a couple of times, something like that right?
yes, yes no yes I think that it was the same topic
the
well for me is easy
well but the truth is that there are not a lot, I mean is not so hard finding more topics I mean I think that
yes is hard
they should hire to do to do the topics
yes there aren't a lot of topics, I think that a lot of topics
this
there are lots of topics but well let's talk again of the same topic that matters
okay
like that we change opinion
okay, what have you thought, have you changed your mind perhaps ah when thinking about it?
no no the same and really for me it's been relatively easy
oh yes
there are some traumas obviously, but no, that's normal, no? Oh when you switch houses it's like everything else, no, the relationship hasn't been easy to me, I don't know
m, and no, it has not been dramatic
yes well I believe that the difference is that you are now used to someone or if you are still in love with someone
yes, yes, that's important, m
I believe that it makes a difference, it's not about getting used to a new house like any other change of lifestyle or whatever
and the pain goes beyond that, it's an emotional pain and well
yes mm
it hurts a lot no
yes yes it does but I think that I mean, in my opinion, I know that it's not the same for everyone
like suddenly, I don't know, I spoke about this and I think he was coincidentally from Canada, about this same subject
yes
a couple of times ago and they'd say that they were in the process, it was the third time and she told me that it was easier but she couldn't put up with it
so, the best thing was to end it, yes? She said that to me, I mean the process is going to end soon but it's not that easy, we are not prepared to
aha
and I don't know if some break ups someone goes like one day in the morning they decide they don't want to go on, it's just screwed
sure, hey, well and what can you tell me? Any of your friend like had a big shock oh because of a break up
which one, yes, which one has been more dramatic, the one that you've seen in real life?
yes, I know of a man, some of my friends but the one that was worse was that of a man, he was in the military
aha
and he was very bad tempered, the military style, those in our country who think that everybody is at their service, right?
so, but I had nothing to say, everything was apparently normal, you couldn't tell there was no feeling, but at the end the woman took the decision, and yes, the man started suffering since then
because, he recognizes now all he has lost
aha
so, I think it is dramatic in these cases, specially when one of the persons has been unhappy with the other
and finally takes the decision, right?
sure
so, maybe the other one never expected that reaction, right?, he always thought he ha the situation under control
so, he discovers he is actually affected, that's some case, do you know any?
well, mm, I think it is very interesting, but you made me think of another thing
yes
wait, let me see, wait it's gone now, let me remember, it was about
what? what?
I just don't remember now, but when you were talking I thought I'll say this, but now
oh, I see
now I don't remember what I wanted to say, something you made me think of
about breaking off, of some friend, the situation is that someone had the other dominated, but the other broke off, right?
oh, yes, now I remember, sometimes you think that you are the one who broke off, but often it's not that clear, because often somebody
when, when they want to break, some people to avoid doing it themselves
mhm
start to behave, start a behavior that is intolerable for the other
ah sure
I mean that will provoke, will provoke fight that will obviously end in that it ends
yes for
but sometimes, sometimes it starts like the opposite of what the other wouldn't think
mm yes like the situation, right
I have, I have seen that move many times so let's say someone wants to break up but what he does is sure start to not say where he's going or behave bad in some way so that eventually
yes
I mean that ends is another way of doing it
yes so the other person is the one who makes the decision and takes the blame, right
sure yes well that is exactly is
something like that right? yes yes yes that is also look that is perceived in some cases, mm or maybe they do it voluntarily, right
yes
and maybe in some cases one doesn't decide and suddenly starts to fall because the other says no no let's go see you later
yes is hard right is hard that I think that the, I don't think that mate the ten percent of the, of the
of the couples I mean some are let's end with this issue that doesn't work anymore
yes but in what percent?
I don't think that more than ten percent, perhaps the twenty percent I think that the majority put up with it, put up with it, resist
each ten or twenty percent that
and that are honest in saying no, it's over
ah, ah yeah
I don't know if you agree with me, I don't think that the percentage is very high, the majority of the people hold on, put up with, hope
oh I think a lot for the economic situation, for the kids or for excuses
aha
I think this, no, I think
so you, ah, so you think that a big part then, of the actual marriages are really not what they seem or in the end aha
yes I think this, I sincerely thing this, I've seen a lot that people hold on
yes but so that
and sincerely I've seen it
yes
so I think that it's difficult but I don't know, ten years what do I know, I don't know if I'm wrong, no, but I've seen many people, a lot of people
who play you, hmm
yes
like without interests, without ambitions, there are like hmm, yes, living life, that's it
hmm
I don't know, I don't know what your opinion is
well, I think that well, speaking on this topic that they gave us
hmm
eh I would say that, the issue of age, I think that we were also talking about this and our time ran out
yes, hmm
Uh, i say that, uh, it's a variable like too much... so you can't say that with age it could... they say that it gets harder or easier with age
And i think that we have to take time, one, sure, the age you have
yes
Two, the length of that relationship, because, for example, it could be very difficult
Um
for a fifty year old person that's been with someone since its twenties
Yes, yes
Uh, oh, for example, a sixty year old person who, i don't know, divorced twice and has a one year old relationship and that's the relationship it's ending
I'm telling you, those are very different cases, but, uh, i think age does influence in the way that when you mature there are like more matters, more things that have happened to you
you're also more emotionally scarred in life
Um
and usually, i think break-ups are easier with age, I'd say this, when we're saying that age is
is long, but the length of relationships is almost the same as age
Yes
That's when, that's when i think
Yes, i agree, lets say there's more experience, right?, hello?
An experience that
Hello?, we have that, with age there's more experience, right?, to face that situation, but i don't know, maybe from the point of view, i don't know, suddenly I'm just thinking about the woman
suddenly it's harder because of the age, i don't know if feeling lonely or in a completely different situation like.. i don't know
yes
unprotected but,
lets say that is the change of life, we were talking about change of life, so the difference is that if someone has not changed his life style or his way
yes, it is difficult
for so much time and after that it it, change drastically that shock is very strong
yes, I think there are the two of them, there are the two of them, the two parts, no
yes
a part for some that lets say have experience and all could be more easy, for others that really rested on their laurels it is going to be very difficult, I don´t know right
exactly, we have hit the mark eh
hmm, yes, hmm
if we have the same topic the next time we are going to be masters in beginning all the different parts that we could
yes of course
without notifying this encounter ah
yes
oh the
really I hope another topic for a change
listen eh well I was just going to see how many studies are left for me, How many are left for you?
I have not seen it the last week I was something sick, something busy and I think it was really  like four days and
without talking
yes no I have more, I think that
yes, yes yes
yeah, yes, i got, uh
and i really haven't even had the time to look out how many i
but you've seen that something came, if you haven't started the calls, i never start the calls
yes
But if you start five calls from five different phones, it seems
oh yes
and they pay you fifty more dollars
yes, there's a special bonus or something, i mean i, sometimes i call, very rarely, I'm not, uh, besides i'm very busy
and so it's hard for me, i was going out now
Matias.

No, it's, it's actually, i speak only Spanish
Oh, in the, in spanish, right?
Uh huh, in Spanish
Oh, look at that, that's good
Yeah, they give me a computer and i explain it to them; but i have notice that more often than not, they don't want any of the opportunities that they're offered, whether it's because the papers aren't there
They're not citizens, um, maybe, uh, they don't want to because they'd have to leave. They don't want to pay for all the benefits, but
Uh, the people, the, the employees
They need it very much, the employees, yes

But, the ones, i explain to them that for, uh, for any reason, there has been a lot of cases where they die because of an accident, and their family could
Sure, they're left with nothing
Yeah, nothing
Sure, and they understand afterwords, some understand and get it, lets say
So, uh, uh huh, uh huh
They listen to you
That's right, and i tell them that, well, yeah, they, not, it's for them, right?, it's useful to... but talk about it afterwords, yeah, so they will at least know the others

No, no. No, I, eh, I left work, it's just that I'm in the hotel, and, we are immediately, the rooms where my coworkers, my friends,
Ah, sure, you are in the hotel the whole time. Right?
they've called me, yes.
Since you travel so much, you are all in the hotel.
Aha, yes, I like to travel with them. Because, if not, the assignments that they send us where I'm alone, I don't like because, it really is cold and,
SUre.
um, at night, well, I get very scared because I'm the only one. And, many notice it, in the same hotel, that I'm alone, and that's what scares me a lot.
Sure. Sure, no, yes, sure. Okay, Okay,
But, this topic of the, the couples and the break up,
Ah, the topic.
my opinion is that yes.
And you, what are you? Are you married?
Because, I'm, I was married for two, for twenty years. But, not really married. Yes we were legally married, but, he had a drinking vice,
he liked women, and we were separated for a long, long time, for almost ten - fifteen years.
For fifteen years separated. Ah,
Separated, yes. Yeah then, um,
Ah, how bad.
yes, he, he was, was,
It was, yes.
and I was stubborn and I was saying, he's going to get well and he wouldn't but I had two children
Sure, he's going to stop drinking, he's going to
Aha. So I said,
he's going to
well, I said, well, he'll get better and he'd go and drink with his friends like he was a young man
Sure, and was he also cheating on you? Do you know.
Excuses me? Hello?
I was saying that if he had cheated on you
Oh yes, he was very, he had a lot of women, yes. So,
Oh, what were you thinking, what were you thinking, lets say.
yeah, and and I was like no, I don't want to have a relationship with a man, I'll stay single forever and I used to say that I was married so that they wouldn't
bother me I didn't want a man, oh, well I didn't want them near my daughters because I was so scared of them.
Oh, how many girls do you have?
Just two and they are now twenty five and twenty six years old, I'm forty four years old now.
Oh, two daughters, oh sure.
I married young, outside the,
How, how?
Oh, Oh, I'm
Oh, you are
paying attention because they are giving us the instructions for tomorrow. Because, they always change our time.
Ah.
And, tomorrow comes out that perhaps it wasn't the time we thought. They wake us up, sometimes, at five. We have to be over there.
Ah, and they are telling you, that now you have to go.
aha. Yeah. They want us to change the time, to see who would volunteer to go.
Okay, okay, there's no drama, there's no, no problem, there's no problem.
yes.
So, then, you passed,
Ah.
you separated, then.
But
Well, well, no, but not all men are,
yes, I separated.
are the same.
No is true, because, dad was very nice with mom.
There are some worse ones.
That is true. And, then, well, yes, then after my kids grew up, I said, well, we are getting divorces. And, I stayed,
That's it.
for seven years, I've been divorced.
Sure.
Then, um, now, no,
And now you are with no one. It's good.
I don't have, well, for the men. For me, I said, this time already passed.
Sure. And what do you think, that the separation is hard? that they threw in the topics.
In, I think that, depending if the person gets used to having a new relationship, then, yes, is easy. Because, one would get used to the person.
Yes that, if you are able, let's say, of those people that are always with someone you say? Something like that? That is,
Exactly.
Ah.
Because, um.
Easy like that,
I think so. Already having experience, because I've known a lot of people that have relationships, they end fast, they break up.
But they are always with someone.
And, they are fast and yes. They are always with someone. some people don't like to be alone.
Sure, but, they are always things that, don't last too long. Sometimes is that type of, of person. Right?
Mm. Correct, then, ah,
Because is a person that is a couple of months, at most a year. Then,
what I do regret, is that,
they go out with another one.
I regret that my daughter, one of my daughters, doesn't like, doesn't like Oh, really? we can go Friday Aha. Aha. Aha. Oh me too.
Is that the flight, already tomorrow our day is ending. And,
Ah, you are already returning, returning to Indiana.
I wish. yes. And they have us, um, well, we sell, from different areas My colleagues come from Texas, others come from,
Sure, I can imagine.
yes, they have, mm, we are sometimes thirty, sometimes, we are forty. But,
Sure, are they all Spanish speaking or no? No, ah, all of them.
yes, all this group is, aha
They are all Spanish speaking. The majority from, from Mexico. Right? With roots
yes, aha With, correct, aha.
Mexicans. I, I can imagine.
Mm, well, one-
Okay. What are you telling me, that your daughter, that doesn't, doesn't like what?
Well, yes, my daughter has a very bad, mm, idea of marriages because ah, well, saw me suffer so much with my marriage
Sure
And, then, she, well, she's scared to have a relationship with any guy, and, she likes many guys.
But a marriage, or girlfriend relationship, or everything?
Relationship of girl- all complete.
Oh everything? Ah, everything.
yes, completely. And, I feel guilty, because, the poor girl didn't see good opportunity. But, yes, her grandparents had a good relationship, they had a, um, good marriage,
Sure. yes.
and, the fact that they had a lot
Much
Yeah, oh, yes, that's true. We have, uh, our things because we buy food, like that, we made a... yeah, because some of us
What happened?
Uh huh, some of us, uh, had a car assigned to us, right?
Yes, they give you a car when you go, in general
A car, here
that's good
A friend told me, i have a friend that's from Spain
Yes
And, and, from work, and he tells me, the cars are the ones you take uh, when you go shopping?
Oh, the carts
That's it, the carts, but it's a car, a what?, a vehicle
A vehicle, sure
Uh huh
And sure, well, they call them, every, they call it different in every country
Yeah, i feel like that
Even if they're all of Hispanic language, they always, they're always named
Yes
Different
Good afternoon, I'm Joe.
Eh, good afternoon. My name is Blanca.
How are you, Blanca?
Fine, thanks. Wait a moment, please.
Yes, of course.
yes. Tell me. Hello?
I'm here, yes.
yes, ah, Sorry, Where are you calling from?
I am, eh, from Puerto Rico but I live in Colorado, And you?
Ah, I live, ah, in Phoenix
In Phoenix?
Mm.
And how are the temperatures over there today?
It's cool. It's cool.
The, the winters over there are not so bad. Right?
No, they are not so bad, no. Not as horrible as over there in the east.
And where are you from originally?
From Colombia.
From Colombia, ah, how nice.
Mm. yes.
Where can-, my favorite singer comes from, Shakira, well, yeah
Oh, Shakira, right, but I'm not from Barranquilla, no
You're not from Barranquilla, where are you from, Cali?
I'm from Medellín
Medellín, oh, that's good
Right, from Mede
Your land is beautiful, it's a shame there are so many problems there, right?
Yeah, like every country, i think
Of course, of course
Right now, the same problems happen in every country
Yeah, it's everywhere, it's true, including here
Uh huh, exactly
Well, what do you think about couples break-up?
Well, uh, uh, i do think there are times in life where it's easier to break a relationship than others
Yes, it's true
Yes, i think so
And, have you experienced that in the past?
Yes, yes
Yes
So, i think that when you're young, it's easier to break up
So,
When one has already gone through other relationships and there's more maturity, eh, one faces with more maturity and more sense a break up.
is
Although it also causes pain, because they are going to cause pain. But, but, the maturity and the experience suddenly help you a little.
yes, I think it helps you overcome because I went through that experience a few years ago, when it was, my divorce.
Mm.
and, well, we had a daughter, now she's going to be six year old, which is a great blessing,
Mm.
then, well is hard, it was hard for me, and I think that it was hard for my daughter to see her parents separating and,
well, and that she has to be going from one place to the other all the time. But, she had adapted quite well because the parental relationship
is, is quite good and that helps my daughter a lot.
yes, aha, yes, and, and the age, the maturity, I when I was young, I had a boyfriend for a long time, and we broke up, and for me it was
horrible. It was, better said, I wanted to die. And, after, I had a boyfriend, a long time also, I was the one who broke up the relationship, and for me, things became easier.
yes. Is true, eh,
I think that before, it was kind of hard because I was young. But now, eh mm, later it was easier because already, I already had experience, I was more mature, already,
I already knew what a relationship that didn't lead me to anything and that wasn't good for me was. Then, I it was either stay in a relationship that wasn't going to lead to anything
or, or end it.
Exactly.
Then, one already looks at things more objectively.
And that too, makes one be more careful, in my case, since I'm still single, well, if I were to look for someone, which I'm not looking at,
At the moment, right?
Uh huh
But, uh, yeah it would be much more discerning, careful
Right
On things like that, i wouldn't be impulsive, i wouldn't get carried away, ok, by beauty and stuff like that
Yes
But i would analyze other more mature aspects of a relationship
That's true, that's true
And, you have children, right?, a little boy next to you, yes
Yes, and, i have two, two
That's good, it's nice
I have two little children, uh, i have a
Yes, how old are they?
I have a girl of one and a half and a three years old boy
Oh, that's nice, that's cute
They're both little
Yes, and they, they get better as they grow up, because look, my little girl, i have so much fun with her now, compared to when she was little, although she has always been lovely
But i do so many things with her and she asks me so many questions, and she's so hungry for learning
Uh huh
It's a very nice thing, the experience is nice
yes, That's true, that's true.
And is your husband from Colombia also?
No, my husband is from Guatemala.
Oh, from Guatemala, and the
My husband is from Guatemala, yes.
You met him here in the United States?
I met him in Masa- is that we lived in Massachusetts, I met him in Massachusetts.
Oh. Look that I've received many calls from that, that part, of Massachusetts, and of Pennsylvania also,
yes.
people that live there, yes, Latins, from this program, the Fisher program. Ah, it seems like there's a lot of people in that area, especially Argentinians.
There are a lot of Argentinians in that area.
yes. I, I have received many calls from, from Argentinian people.
yes, And you talk to people of the opposite sex, have you talked, yes?
yes, yes.
yes, Because, up to now, this is my second, to say it like that, because I already finished one, I'm starting another.
yes, yes
Then, well, up to now I've only gotten to talk with ladies, and, well, and, the great, great majority, is funny, they are from Argentina.
Oh, really?
yes.
And, and, and this agency is a good agency, um, well, so, it is, the work with them is good?
Working with them?
Yes
Yes, and did you start the program recently?
Yeah, not long ago, just, yeah
Well, you see, I'm still waiting for them to pay me the first term, i ended it like two months ago
Yes
And, the thin is that they extended the calls from twenty five to thirty, but they made a mistake, they started calling me home again, well, they added even more
Yes
So i have like thirty five calls that i have completed, and i still have four more to complete them, that's what i think they haven't payed me but
Uh huh
I'm starting another now and with this one i believe they're four
Uh huh
Yeah, it seems like a long time, but there comes the time when it ends, you have twenty five, right?
Yes, yes, i have been there for a while too, but no, i haven't been able to finish
Well, it's a know university, Penn State and, and yes, they will pay you, you don't have to doubt that
Yes, yes, yes
But, uh, what i also like is the experience, that i can talk
The
with people from other countries too
exactly, the cultural exchange, right?, that's the best
Yeah, because they, they put an issue, for example, the theme for today, we already know what it is, but you don't have to be talking about it al the time.
The people who want to see it, like we interact, how, how do you say it? Interaction, this, yeah, interaction.
Yeah, the form of expression and of interaction of the, of the different, uh, regions
Exactly.
Mmmhmm.
Like how we communicate with each other and things like that, they study all of that. So, well, so that we talk, good.  Well, yeah. So, what is that?
After talking everything's okay?
Yeah, yeah. After one there, there are all these issues to talk about, but notice that I can take any issue.  For example, the issue of Colorado, where I love where I live.
I already have twenty-six years here. Twenty-six, yeah, twenty-six years here.
In Colorado.
It's a very beautiful place, I love it. But I say when
Does it snow there?
Oh, it snows a lot, but in the mountains, in the city it doesn't snow as much. The mountain that I've been to, a complete total, this winter up to now, of more than a hundred and twenty inches.
Oh, God.
Here in the city it hasn't snowed at all, a very small amount of snow has fallen.  But if you get cold, in December there was a cold spell that was something below zero.
Mmmhmm.
And that's a terrible cold. But,
No, tell me, I lived in Massachusetts for five years, and the cold
That's what I was going to say, that Massachusetts, because of the humidity and because of the cold, Colorado wins on that count.
Oh, no, oh, it's humid and it's cold as fuck. Last winter left me like terrorized because we stayed inside, closed up, my husband
with my babies.
yes.
We had just arrived from Colombia, because we were spending Christmas in Colombia.
yes.
And, there was a very strong snowfall, a storm. And we stayed locked up in the house, isolated, with the snow up to the top of the door, that we couldn't couldn't go out.
Ah, goodness. Don't tell me. yes, we've had,
No, not anymore.
ah, times like that here, that it snows and one can't go out anywhere, the planes can't take off from the airport. yes, it's bad. But, on the other hand, here we have one of the most beautiful summers that you can see.
because they are very sunny, very clear blue sky,
yes
and at night, because of Colorado's elevation, which Denver is like a mile of elevation, well the stars look very beautiful, I love them.
yes, yes
And, my daughter likes it, I tell here, you are a Colorado native, because she was born here.
Mm.
But, she has Puerto Rican and Mexican blood, because her mother is from Oaxaca.
Oh, yes.
Is the funniest thing, because she from one house to the other,
Mm.
changes the accents. She starts to try to talk like
According to the place she's at.
yes, yes. Try to talk, sometimes, eh, like puertorra, like me, and my accent is pretty well disappeared because I've been here for so long. Well, when he's with his mom
talks a lot of mexican, kind of strange.
yeah yes it's that, because you told that you were Puerto Rican. But, I felt the accent like it was, like Central American, almost Nicaraguan.
Oh, well, I don't know, eh, how it is these days, but yes I've been, here about twenty six years that I've been here, well, I'd think that I wouldn't been speaking so much like a Puerto Rican.
There in Puerto Rico, I know that I talk like a Mexican when, when I speak with my family and all that
yes.
because I have, but nothing, I, I, I think that I have a little bit of everything, because I have friends from everywhere. I Colombian, Mexican, Puerto Rican friends, from everywhere, Cubans
And I love it. But then, half of the time, the, more than half of the time, I'm speaking English also because I work in a place where they all, all speak English, and, and my
Eh, I don't talk about that, that I, I, how embarrassing
Why?
I don't speak English.
But, that shouldn't bother you, that comes as you learn it. the most important thing, Blanca, is that you have the desire. yes
well, I'm interested, and in fact I, I, babbling here, well,
that's the most important, that I lost the fear, and even though you say disparates in the beginning, but, little by little the fear gets broken, and after that, you're learning even more
because, look I was terrible speaking when I  arrived here to the United States, awful speaking English. And now, I'm pretty fluent, in the two, the written and oral language
And I speak, I speak it very well. But, I don't think it was easy at first.
And how is Colorado for finding work?
Well, it's good, it's good, but you know the laws, here, about immigrants, well, they are getting tougher everywhere. But, it's a place where there are a lot of immigrants working, t- all around here.
Because, here it's very, well, the pay it awful. It's that, it's that, around here, in the went, they pay very bad.
yes, here.
Because, I come from Boston and there, the salaries are pretty competitive.
yes, here, here they pay more than in Arizona, definitely.
Aye, we moved here, but I keep repeating, I want to go back to Massachussets.
You can go to Massachussets, you can try Colorado, Colorado is a nice place to live, there are good work opportunities for Latinos, do you have all your papers in order?
yes, yes, yes.   I'm a resident.  My husband has been a citizen for eight thousand years.
yes, that's good.
Hi?
Hi?, Hi Fede
How are you?
Hi
Who's this?
What, who's this?
What's your name?
How are you?
Fine
Fine
What's new?
I'm here dude
What a coincidence to find you here
You see, what a coincidence
What a coincidence
How are you, fine?
What's new?, where are you right now?
I'm here now, at home
Very well
Yes, i just finished having dinner
What, what did you have for dinner?
Uh, Martin, he left a roast he made the other day with
Oh, that lamb?
Lamb, yeah
A gross lamb
Yeah, right, i just finished, I've been eating that everyday until today, so
It wasn't tasty?
I'm in a thr-, yes, it was, it was good, it's "porotos", that lasts a couple days in the fridge
Um, yes, yes, yes
Uh, well, i don't know, how much does it last?
Oh, whatever you want
It, i mean, a week it's fine, nothing happens
But, what?, you cook-, do you heat it again every time you take a little?
I take a little and i heat it up
Sure, yeah you heat it up, you heat it again, so it can last a lot, yeah, if you, every time you boil it it lasts a week longer
Oh, oh
Uh, lets say you left it and three or four days have passed
But
And you're not sure, i mean, there's not much time, so you boil it again and that's it, but the problem is when some bacteria or something grows there
But yeah, i took, i put it in the freezer
yes
And got a little bit every time he had lunch or dinner
No, but it doesn't matter, no
Besides he
I mean, a week doesn't do anything
Martin, how much did he cook it? when was it that he cooked it?
Excuse me?
yes, Martin cooked it on the weekend, so
yes, it's OK
Eh
But I tell you, yes, let's say you want more and you want to store it for longer, you boil it again, you, you boil it five more minutes
and then it's like it's new. If something grew, you killed it by boiling it
Hmm, I killed it, Ok, OK
You killed it
Well, but I already ate it all, so
How's everything? The cat?
The cat is all right, she's ok, sleeping
That cat is really mean
No, she's calm
Very mean
I downloaded all those stuff from the PC but i still don't have internet. i swear I'm going crazy
Why isn't the internet on yet?
I don't know, because i don't know why they're taking so long, this looks like, uh, it's a field, uh, like, i don't know, since January 24
They're giving us internet at six in the afternoon
But to me, when i installed it here, they gave me a, a date and it was going well long before that
Yeah, i mean, i tried it uh, yesterday, today, but no, no, there's no thing to do. It'll be on around the twenty four but i really don't know
That's odd
Being without internet sucks, i swear, even more when you have nothing else to do, I'm telling you
Yes
If you were studying, yeah, that would be something different, but
And, are there any internet cafe's there?
I don't know, i didn't find any
some place where you can connect in?
Internet cafe, i don't think so, there aren't any
Library in your faculty, have you gone to the faculty?
Yes, yes, i went, the thing is that, well, i have to go all the way to there if i want to, it's ok, i mean
Um, oh, well, but you don't have to leave now do you?, when do you start class?
No, I'm just starting on the thirty, it seems
That's late, isn't it?
Late, yes, yes, yes, pretty late, i don't know why, uh, so
I'm cooking some pierogis.
Ah, really? Did you buy them or did you make them?
I bought them, I bought them.
You bought them, yes I, Martin would buy them eh, at the beginning it's been a long time that we don't buy them, but yes, at the beginning we would buy a lot of pierogis like that, just oil and onion nothing more.
yes, olive oil which is healthier.
Like that. Olive oil, well. How yummy.
yes, yes, that's what we are doing. If you want I'll give you some to taste through the phone.
Well, if not tomorrow, I'll be there tomorrow.
I'll send you a fax I'll send you a fax a fax of ravioli, Man, that, tomorrow, tomorrow you're coming?
The pierogi. yes, yes.
You're coming in the car or in the Chinese?
No, in the car.
You are driving the
yes, yes, yes.
Very good, ah because
yes, because the Chinese leaves you in the middle let's say of, of nothing
Mm.
and I don't know well from where to where it goes, but I'm not sure where it leaves from
l-
and here see, is not, is not like there, is that here inside the city the stop of the, the Chinese.
yes. And the greyhound?
It's like in the outskirts. And the Greyhound is also not so near, is closer, is like to behind, see the football stadium or, or the
yes
baseball, or any of those two is like behind that. And but, it comes out let's see, it comes out twenty to go and twenty to return, it's forty.
And with the car I don't know, with thirty I go and come. I think.
Eh, and well, is like that.
So I think I'm going in the car, for now, if, if, if I decide that no, tomorrow
Okay, no well, I don't know, I say, why drive alone well it's a downer.
yes, is kind of a downer.
Sure, it doesn't, it still is not that much.
No.
Besides that Juancito for one year that was here in Philadelphia would go three times a week to Baltimore because he was going, going to the university there.
Ah, really?
yes, Juancito studied there he did the -M-B-A in, in the university of Baltimore, Where? In
What is it called? University of, University of Baltimore?
the University of Maryland, I think
Ah. really? He would come driving up to here?
yes.
What desire
And yes eh, he would travel three times, three or four times per week
Look at that
Um, very funny, in a peugeotite, Juan's peugeotite, you didn't met him
Why didn't he do, why didn't he do the MBA?
Uh
uh, closer to Philly?
No, he did a, uh, he did a year there, and he got transferred after that, transferred to
Oh, sure, but i don't, i don't, i don't understand why he didn't do that from the beginning
Oh, because he didn't know, and besides, Maryland was very good and
Sure
Um, i don't know
It's ok, it's OK
Well, the thing is that it was good too, but i don't know why he decided like that
Yes, sometimes when you don't know universities well
Yes, besides, well, he signed up from Argentina, i don't know how he did that
Sure, sure, sure, yeah, you don't have a clue, you go where you think it's best
Yes, yes, yes, but well,
Well, and is everything OK with you?
Everything's fine, everything's fine, yeah
Work?
Oh, is there any novelties around Baltimore?
No, walking a little bit, no, everything calm, the truth is I don't have, I don't have a lot, just these days, like I finished doing everything I need to do
Very good.
so, for now, so, since I'm half
With this, did something happen with the truck?
no, no because you know that the cars parked there, two blocks
Sorry?
it keeps being parked in the same place.
With the same crash?
yes.
Look at that.
It doesn't have the ticket you see, the ticket that the police left it doesn't have more
yes.
so I imagine that someone has taken it but no, they don't move it or anything, I don't know.  I went to look for the report and everything
eh, and called those who needed to come, and all the options, and everything, but no, it came back the same money that if we had to return it
so, nothing more happened.
That's good, to eat.  yes.  And well, so everything's good.
Uh, you have to eat, what are you doing now?
No, no, no, I called because yes, it takes him fifteen minutes to come here.
That's good.
No, the little onion is already getting black, so it's time to put it.  The pierogis on the, the casserole.
In the pot
In the pot
Dude, and are you not going to see Juan this weekend?
No, i don't think so
And, uh, oh
No, the weather's crappy. It, we're only telling Martin yes to mess with him
Did you told him yes?, i haven't asked him yet
Yes, yes, well, tell him, tell him you spoke to me and that we're going
Why are you mean to Martin?
Tell him, "oh, I'm sotty, i can't...", tell him, "oh, it's a shame i won't see him because they leave, they leave on Friday  morning and"
Tell him that, and i won't see him
Why are you so mean?
Oh, I'm like that, don't complain
Oh, that's sweet, i want to
Really good, yesterday was, yesterday was
I miss the
exceptionally good, huh
Yeah?, the usual?
Exceptionally good, the usual, even more, i said "let's not order", so, oh, at Japollo, because Sole is there
And, and there was no agreement, we all ordered at Japollo's, i mean, we ordered at Japollo's
It's just it's good at Japollo
Even without Sole being there
Very well, very well, it's OK
I saod, well, i don't know, it's something that Sole eats, but no, it seems everyone liked Japollo's
It's very tasty
Yeah, but yesterday
I liked it very much
I went there and it was delicious
Oh, did you ask for it?, i think you didn't ask for that anymore
Delicious, the squid?, yeah
That's what, uh, at the hot peppers
No, not the ones from hot pepper, no, not the ones from hot pepper because there were less people there
Yes, but
They're very good
And... but they have those really spicy things
Very noble, at least it's equally noble
it cleanses you, it cleanses your whole
yeah, that, you know what?, if you have any sin, it removes it
Is that true?, that if you eat something spicy, like if you have something
Frightened
I won't ask you, oh this thing that I'm asking is so stupid but I don't know
yes.
If you eat something spicy or hot, does it clean your system from some types of, I don't know how to explain it
No.
No, it has nothing to do with it.
No, what do I know, I don't.
And why does people
yes but, no.
Oh.
I don't know, which question.
It's all right.
I have no idea, lets see, do you move there
How is Caro?
Oh, she's saying hi to you Caro
Oh well, send her one.
yes, she says, she says it's a shame that we can't see each other, how are we
That's silly.
go skying
When are you leaving, then, but you still have to, you have to, what's the name, use your new skates?
yes, what do I know, you see? I don't know, I don't know, we'll see how much
Do you own skying clothes?
four minutes, five minutes. Sure. Four minutes. I give orders from here, from my phone. Well, it's always a good thing
Don't you have a timer in your kitchen?
yes yes, we did, I gave her orders so that she would
Oh.
It's very important for me to give the orders, otherwise, nobody would do it.
yes.
and that's a shame.
It gets out of control.
It's sad, as they say it.
So, you like to give orders.
No, I don't like to, it's not like I like to give orders but if I don't do it
How?
here, here, they would all do as they wish, it'll be a mess, a real mess.
How is your sister?
You really have to control her because she
Why? She's nice.
she misbehaves, she misbehaves.
She does? And well
She misbehaves, a lot, she does things that she shouldn't do.
What are you gonna do about it?, nice people sometimes behave badly
I, in the ass so it will behave
It likes it there
There, well, uh, how much time do we have left?, no, just finish
I don't know, no, i'm, but, speak, speak, you almost don't talk, baby, you ask me all the questions
And, what, what do you want me to talk about?
What do i know?, send me something, haven't you got anything new to tell?
Well, I'm on the lab today, sure, that Sónica finally finished it's... yes, Grant
Oh
And, and just as she finished her grant, she submitted it, and came to the lab to mess with me
Oh, to ask, to ask results?
To interru-. yes, to interrupt, uh, it's something, of our nothing to do [time]
Um
everyday, so, nothing, but well
And what did you tell her?, did you
we have to freeze to death for some particular reason, uh, oh
Could you justify that you didn't do anything or how was it?
Hello, good evening
Hello, good evening, my name is Veronica
Hello, how are you, my name is Ever
How are you Ever
And where are you calling from Veronica
Well, the couples, where are you from Ever?
Eh, I am from Guatemala but I am calling from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Ah, I am from Argentina, I am calling from Washington DC
Ah so we are nearby yes
fairly close, we're close, we're close, what can you tell me about couple break-ups, have you had to break up a lot.
Eh, no really, no eh but I believe that if one of the topics that they said was that if you changed your age and I definitely think that while eh
when the person is older well I believe it is easier depending on the relationship, no?
It seems to you that it is easier, I understand that it is harder yes, yes, I believe that the more you mature to be able to think about some things or to be able to
become independent no?  but what do I know thinking about longtime couples that don't function and stay together, I think this is sometimes the story of a family if there are children and other things
it affects you negatively to be able to take a decision to break up a relationship
Well, but when you are talking about already having children, it's not just a couple now we are talking about a marriage
and that is much more distinct well than what I thought the topic was, well I imagined that it was perhaps a boyfriend girlfriend thing or something like that
than a prior relationship let's say or less formal
yes, yes, well if in a marriage well I believe that there are a lot more things to analyze and it is definitely more difficult to break it up, it's not a matter to just say it and well
mhm, she left me know and at some other point well I will meet someone more appropriate for my lifestyle
for your project hmm so, and well What are you doing in Pennsylvania? the breaking of couples is not a topic that, but I am going to make a question to you do you think is more common here
in the United States than in Guatemala also about couples
eh yes it seems to me that it is a lot like because here is like you wait first for people do not get married so soon
secondly they have a lot of relationships when they begin to have a partner when the person is going to get married then
I thin that a breaking there are many breaking in couples of a life, I think that the average age of breaking here
is between twenty eight years old
yes I know but you know that for example in the university campus where I work there are some American girls who are twenty four, twenty three years old
and they are worried about getting marries or finding a partner to get married a thing that caught my attention
yes
yes like I don´t know I don´t I don´t understand because the age is very young I am older no they are very young and you have a thousand of things to think about or make a
and it is like they are not interested in crossing the twenty five years old with a definition I even have a workmate that
that well lets say she is fine in her relationship but almost three years she is twenty five almost three years as a girlfriend and as the boy doesn´t want to get married
she thought to, she is thinking of ending the relationship and find someone who wants a marriage
well eh the truth is that it sounds very
no it catches my attention because if you tell me Argentina I can tell you that if
eh it happened
but here I have an image well but it is that what happens to me not sometimes I have a more liberal image and I live more conservative behaviors
yes for the the truth is not the experience I have had in my case regularly I have seen more liberal people but how is it called definitively is going to be everything right?
eh but eh when it comes about your friend I think she has the reason because I think if she has been with a boy for three years and is twenty five years old and there are not plans to
a marriage
just formalize then eh well yes I think that in your case perhaps I would do the same
are you in a couple?
yes I'm married
you're married, has it been many years?
it's been five years
it's been five years, do you have kids?
yes I have one who's two years old
and is hard thinking in breaking up well sure is that, is hard right thinking of breaking up  and there being kids in the middle
oh yes quite hard because not only not only you think of yourself but also think of them right? you're thinking in
in the style of life they would have in the in how hard it would be for them because they are used since babies right? of being with the father and the mother and suddenly
eh they are not together eh then besides that they are separated eh the lifestyle as far as the economic also becomes harder for
sure
for the kid right? and then I think that there are many factors that should be taken into account
mm yes that's true
are you married?
that's true although I see many of my students eh undergraduate of the university working on some family issue and also
I tell you at least eighty percent are from parents that are not together no, that are separated
yes
and then like in reality that really grabs my attention right seeing twenty four, twenty five year old with this of yes yes I want to get married
and then the other face right a seventeen, eighteen year old that lives with one of the parents
yes and haven't you noticed which of them are affected, I have heard that they struggle with it more when they are kids and not babies
when the kids have around ten years or more and the parents get divorced
mhm
when they are three or four years the parents get divorced I think
when they are teenagers
yes I believe that when they are teenagers they struggle a lot because they can't move on, but, when they are babies, they accept it
yes, it's like when they have a style and then a different family structure, lets say, so they don't miss it, they don't miss that image of their old family
or they don't long for that old family, I think
yes
oh, I don't know, the memory of it, what do I know!
sure, so, I hope, my advice would be to do it quickly, right?
sure, well I too have, for example, two of my mates, no, I'm thirty five years old and the parents got divorced when they were already adults
but my friend of all time, she's from Puerto Rico and she's separating and she's like this should have happened long ago.
and they value the efforts of their parents to have kept the family and home structure, sure
and probably later on, that the reason why they stayed together or at least, I think it's quite common, they stay together because they are waiting for the kids to
to reach a certain age in which they will go to university or about to leave the family home and
so, they decide to divorce then when it won't really affect them
sure
I don't know if your friend is in that case but
I think so, yes, yes, yes, they are all adults and well, it's like it'll still have some impact, I mean, it still
lots of questions and above all, my friend married and her partner changed her a lot
sure, sure
so, she is married, she still doesn't have children but, she kind of questioned her own relationship, the way it affected her, I believe that it does affect the experience that you are having and what you were saying
that the hardest thing has to do with the role-models right, the parents at that time
yes yes
I don't know
hey, and what university, in which  university do you work or study?
I'm in the University of Maryland
oh yes, I graduated there!
you graduated here?
yes, in two thousand and three
in which department?
oh I was in biochemistry and in
aha
oh cellular biology
oh look, one of my friends works there, well, I believe that she enrolled in two thousand and three, I forgot
so, but, oh, so you are from this area
yes yes, I was raised in Maryland I came here when I was seven years old and I grew up in Maryland and
and where did you live?
oh, it was close to the university, I used to live in Highs Bill
Oh, where i am, well, I'm in Graduate Hills, what you said, this complex next to the university
Oh, yes, i know where it is, it's the university garden
Oh, the other one that's in university boulevard
Oh, i know which one it is
it's just at the exit of the university, the other is closer
yes, yes, yes
more to the east side, and, what are you doing in Pennsylvania now?
i study medicine, I'm in third year of medicine school
Because once here, medicine is a masters, right¡
yes, it's am major, you have to do a, uh, a master, and sometimes they get one and they finish, and they get to go to med school
sure, sure, yeah, that's different, i don't know how it is in Guatemala, because in Argentina it's three, straight with eighteen years, the medicine career
Yeah, it's the same in Guatemala, what it's seven straight years, here, right?, and
And, is college public in Guatemala?
There are both, there are public and private ones
right, and is the public school prestigious?
Uh, for medicine, i believe that the public has, uh, a better prestige than the private ones, but
the, the same happens in Argentina
But the problem with the public one is that when there are what they call "huelgas", like strikes
Uh, yes, yes, yes
Uh, they lock down the university indefinitely
like, like, in the beginning
Sure, sure,
and then that happens a lot, the people that, how do I tell you, think they are better than the rest and don't take care of their clients
already, they don't receive the people like before.
yes,
they have the luxury sometimes of picking their clientele
yes you have to know how to be humble, in a word
exactly I mean like they say, go back to basics yes, if a situation if a system, made you succeed right in your business
well then that system must be used, well at least once a year, that means, go back to the basics, at least once a year.
And say well, my business is like faltering, well, I'm going to do what
aha
what I did at the beginning that gave me good results, I mean, there's nothing to lose. But, no, they don't want to because they feel, ah, how can I tell you.
humiliated
yes, yes there are people that have like too much ego.
mm exactly, because look, for example there's a, there's a person well this, that, got me for master of ceremony in the inauguration of a branch of his business
aha
then since I know the history of this person since his start I know that he started his business with five hundred dollars in the pocket
hello Vanesa's speaking from San Diego
Hello Leticia's speaking from Philadelphia
ah how are you?
hello
is cold over there, right?
yes very cold very very cold the truth is that today, is one of the coldest days this winter, well of autumn but
ah it's already snowing?
yes yes it already snowed last week
ah I lived near Philadelphia a long time ago in New Town Square very nice
ah really
yes I liked it a lot
ah yes the truth is that's is nice, is nice but they say that San Diego is very nice too
mm is beautiful and here is let's say for now at night in the sixties degrees and in the day it's wonderful and it's always
ah what envy how nice I really want to go to San Diego the truth is that it must be really nice, they say it has one of the most privileged climates
ah is incredible and especially the closer one lives to the beach, the cooler it is already when on is closer to the mountain
it's hotter but where I am is always wonderful
ah how nice
and so I would like to stay here, let's see if I can
why what do you do there in San Diego?
eh my husband is in the navy and in
In the, uh, in the navy, uh
Yeah, so when the contract ends we will probably have to move
Yeah, oh, that's a shame, i mean for the same reason you were here too
No, it's not that, i was here already when i was in college, before i finished college i was a nanny taking care of some children
Oh, oh, that's right, where are you from originally?, oh, from Puerto Rico
from Puerto Rico, are you from Spain or Argentina?
What's that?
and where are you from, Spain or Argentina?
From Argentina, the Argentinian accent is very different from the Spanish one
Well, maybe you know more about that than me, but i knew it had to be one of those
yeah, very different incidentally, but yeah, no, from Argentina
you don't have
Oh, yes, i was, i mean, i still hadn't taken the risk but Puerto Rico was one of the options
well, talking about technology, the computer is something i can barely live without, i do most of my work through the computer with virtual companies, that are people with which
i have never been in person, and i do all and they
Yeah, i mean, it's part of how you earn money, lets say, using the computer
Exactly
sure, but yeah, me too, partially, but aside from being a work tool, it's completely, i mean, i am completely dependent on it for my everyday life, right?
Oh yeah?
More than just for work, i mean, particularly since the internet, right?
yes
that is anything that I need to look for if I want to make a trip if I want to look for information on anything eh I go directly to the internet I mean no no
It doesn't occur to me to look somewhere other than the internet
no is true I basically do it too all my shopping for example Christmas shopping and all that I do it on the internet
and well that is that's like part of life already beyond what is work I get the impression
in the computer already passed from being just a work tool to being something well I communicate with my family through the computer
ah well yes true all the e-mail and all that
yes we even see each other through the video camera, we talk on the phone through the computer I mean is is like
ah wow
the most important element of the house for me
incredible yes I know
is incredible yes
and we, our computer got damaged and it's like one is all disoriented, you don't know what to do
yes yes the same happened to us we were some time without internet and we were super lost eh yes when you are far from your house you notice it even more right? because
eh the media is something that keeps you communicated with many people and well
yes I like it but it's also a shame because also at work in my full time job not the others I do in the computer also
we are so dependent of the computer that when we don't have computers practically we can't do the work because one already doesn't have the resources to do the things in
paper or in another way and it's a problem for the productivity also
yes yes I understand you yes that's also happened to me that is something that I mean the system is down, we all go home more or less
yes and
eh eh is incredible
yes and also it embarrasses me a lot because I have three kids
ah
fifteen and sixteen years old then they for example they have access to the internet in school sometimes, I get scared
sure, sure I do understand that when one has kids it must be different I don't have kids, I don't know but there's also a lot of information that sometimes is also dangerous right?
I mean is not only controlling what things they see also right? because there's everything on the internet
yes I don't know if you know what my space is
the what?
my space that is my space on the internet which is where one puts one's pictures and things you like to do
ah yes in the -messenger in the -hotmail is
no is a it's called I think that block a block of those that one goes and puts one's pictures anything you want then one later invites a
ah
to join this like let's say a pyramid but by the internet and one communicates like that
ah no I didn't know I really don't know what that site is
myspace dot com so then there a lot of teenagers
ah
pornographic pictures the girls are in clothes provocative poses then they put in what city they live what school they go to and me thinking
ah
anyone can be provoked by that and then it brings problems
yes no I don't understand yes yes yes that's true and it's also an issue with one's personal information yes the credit cards
all those things right? that sometimes one buys so many things by the internet and all and don't know up to what extent a person can take that information
that they use it in a bad way right? I mean there's a lot of fraud I figure through the internet also
oh yes of course
is something that you have to be careful but
but that with credit cards you have to be careful in the stores because they have stolen my identity and it's been people that when I go with my card in a
store then they get my number and start to make purchases and things
ah ah
but with the internet with that up to now I haven't had any problems thank God
no yes I mean me neither but the truth is that many people advise me to be careful that instead of putting the credit card to put there
pardon that instead of putting the debit one to put the credit one which is more controllable
that's true that's true
those things but for now I also haven't had any problems so
yes but
have you been living in the United States a long time?
since eighty five but I've returned to Puerto Rico for a few years in the nineties and yes since eighty five and you?
no me it's been seven months
ah don't tell me that directly from Argentina
ah what?
you came directly from Argentina
yes yes yes directly it's been seven months that we've been here because my husband is working in the university well now I'm also working but we came because he had found something and
and well so just arrived
ah, is it that he's a professor?
he's doing a post doc I mean he did a
ah
PhD in Argentina and here he came to do the post doc at the University of Pennsylvania
woo, in what, what topic?
so he's on the side of reproduction
ah
in teh so it's interesting he is, he is works with spermatozoids
oh how interesting
they always laugh that's why I laugh before when I say it
ah that's good well, are you thinking of staying or will you try?
and we'll see because our visa is for three years only so that is a bit it limits us but well we don't don't know all the same, we're just arriving
and and we don't know very well how everything works here either, no?
yes
but we'll see when we're closer to the three years maybe there we'll have to make a decision about about what we do
yes
but well now we're thinking it well what do I know the truth is that it's good it's a nice experience
if you like it compared with Argentina or is not the same, obviously
eh no it's very different but there are things that I like more and things that no that I miss a lot I mean the food I miss a lot
I can imagine
the food, i think that's one of the things i miss the most, but well, there are things that work better here, and well, there are more possibilities
That's true
People is different here too, i mean, the American is very different to the latino, right?
yes
And well, that, but well, you have to get used to it, get used to it, that you have to love them as they are, right?
Yes, yes, they're not so open and warm and as good people like we say in Puerto Rico, as the Latinos are
Sure, yes, yes, you can tell the difference a lot, and the truth is that's a shock,but, well, we're having a good time and it's a... i mean
I think it's a country where you can make a lot of progress, much more than on Latin American countries, right?
Oh, definitively
so, well, that's what brings you to live here
yes
that's it
definitively, and, is it easy with the english, are you having trouble or is everything fine?
And the english, i mean, i knew english, but coming here and listening to people is very different than the English i have studied my whole life, it's not
it's something different, i still have a hard time understanding some people, the pronunciation is the hardest for me, i mean i understand most of it, but there are some things that i can't understand yet
yes, yes, yes, a lot
i don't know, in Puerto Rico they usually have a very good English level, right, all the Puerto Ricans i know speak very good english
They teach it like that, they teach it plenty, like we are more or less from the United States, well, you grow up with the culture and watching television shows in English and
sure, sure, that is a big influence
Ingrid from Philadelphia, ah hi, how are you?
Aurelio from Washington DC very good Ingrid, how have you been, everything good?
yes everything very good
ah how nice I'm glad look and, which is the most important electrical device for you?
ah I think that it's the cellular, yes yes the cellular
the cellular right listen nowadays the cellular has become like I don't know like an indispensable thing
is an article of necessity
is an article of necessity but it's a staple, it's incredible right ten years ago almost nobody had cellulars, now everybody has a cellular
yes had none, there was none, there were no cellulars and they didn't need it
exactly
I mean how much time went by without needing it and now that we have them is like, as if we've had it all our life
exactly true, you're right, yes
yes yes eh um
what type, what type of cellular do you have?
eh, the telephone itself?
aha
ah listen I have a samsom with camera the one that opens up, yes and You?
ah those that open up, ah that well I have a samson also but is that one that has the computer included one of those that's called
pocket computer pocket pc
ah okay yes I've seen those, I like those
mm yes I have it because I really need it for work, I need a phone that I mean I need something where I can go on the Internet
also you understand me for work matters and that
sure ah yes
yes and to have the phone agenda, to also have the calendar you know that type of thing that nowadays are essential so
sure yes and that's another thing my my second electronic device would be the computer
ah of course
and then I imagine that with one of these phones like both things are included
exactly
and then it becomes much more indispensable
yes, exactly the computer is indispensable also, can you imagine nowadays to be or live without a computer
yes no like I couldn't, and I lived over there in Maryland
no sure aha
and then eh now I'm here in Philadelphia but then here I have my DSL, and my laptop when I go to Maryland is like, like after a day I already need to come back home because
because I don't have DSL and sometimes where I go is like like they only have dial up
ah imagine that
and then is so slow I mean is already like how the television was before, that one needs the
exactly true
that computer with the internet access
the fast access to the internet, by the way where in Maryland? because I live in Maryland
eh I lived in Silver Spring
ah imagine that you're very close to here I no
where?
I lived, I live towards mm towards the South towards Acopeach near Fort Washington
aha OK, OK
yes yes that is downwards that is downwards, you
and, how did you find out about this study?
about this study I found out through precissely speaking through the Internet
ah yes
eh I was looking for, I always look for things like that on the Internet
ahh
I found a site called Craig list
ah yes
and there I found and well I got in to see and I said listen theis sounds like interesting because I with I have eh two professions, I I have been a Spanish teacher
ah
graduated in Spanish literature
mm that's interesting
you are and that this study I I I liked it I say well let's get into it and see if to see what happens
ah what
and look until now everything very good I receive calls or I make calls and I speak with all sorts of people mhm
that's interesting, I by chance eh well I have to to make these calls all the same but what do you call it I am am in charge of this program in the University of Pennsylvania
ah really?
but then for reasons to check always that everything is running here in the platform, then I have to do my, also part then
ah you also have to do your, exactly your calls
eh and also at the same time eh I check where it's working eh eh the ads and and all that but but
ah
and I find it very interesting because I sometimes hear the conversations
aha
and and are very very interesting, I mean the people there are people that even become friends
ah imagine that
because like sometimes one gets sometimes the same person several times
aha
and then is like they already know each other and
ah
then after they even exchange phone numbers and
sure
I mean it makes eh
a connection so
exactly yes
yes you know that I- I was able to receive calls for a week because I was out of the country
ah
i was, uh, yeah, i had to go o Italy, and now that
Oh, that's good, for travel or for?
No, on work, because I'm an Opera singer, and so i had to go there to
Oh, really, oh, that's good
Yeah, i had to go there to give some concerts and that
Oh, that's intere-
anyway, talking about electrical devices you need
Uh huh
Well, the phone i brought there, i have Verizon, the company
Oh yeah
And that doesn't work internationally, do you know what i mean
It doesn't?
No, not the phone, this phone, how can i say it, the system from here doesn't work in Europe
Oh, but the Spring one does
I think Spring does and T-Mobile, i think it works and
Yeah, Spring's does work
Yes, but Verizon's doesn't, so, look, i was there
desperate
Well, yeah, a little desperate, because i needed to go on the internet, but this phone, i just bought it new like a week ago or two
Yes, right
on... or rather I bought it three days before leaving for Europe
yes
and then the computer, the side of the computer of the telephone
mhm
connects to the Internet also not only through the the telephone line but also
aha ah it has, it has wireless
exactly it has that wi-five
ah OK
so see I got connected over there in the hotels that have free service
yes
of of wi-five and look it was perfect
ah that's good
look and I was impressed talking of interfacto that like that one needs look at me
yes
this really was a marvel, a good investment
yes ah that's that's good
yes yes yes a good investment
that's good and what ah, so you teach Spanish over there in Maryland?
I used to, not anymore, I don't teach anymore eh I
eh no now you are only dedicated to opera
no I work in yes I have always been a singing teacher and I have always been a singer
ah
but you know sometimes you need more money those things and then
sure yes
you know you have to look for that what one needs well
exactly
at the end well I teach in a music school in Washington eh we have one very near Silver Spring by the way a site
mhm
in ahh in Strawthmore I don't know if you remember wher Strawthmore is.
estrat-yes there in Rockvill near White Flint
that's it, that's it yes it's called Vincle of Music
ah OK
there I teach singing lessons and all those kinds of things, everything good thank God I'm doing well there
ah that's good how interesting
yes yes eh and what else I don't know what else I can tell you
where are you from?
originally form Venezuela but I've been living in this country eleven years I have just turned in August
ah OK eleven, I have been ten, ten years living here, I'm from Guatemala
ah ah from Guatemala listen and eh mm
yes
oh, are you in charge of that research or are you directing it, how is it?
no, oh, I mean, we have lots of languages
aha
oh, oh, so, oh, what we do is that the linguistics department, we do some research in different languages and I'm in charge of Spanish, the Fisher Spanish
oh
I colle-, I collect information, I mean, practically about all of that, I mean, the study has already being designed so I take care of
finding people and supervising it so that everything goes on well, I have to transcribe the conversations
oh wow, it's a lot of work
yes, it's a lot but I like it, I'm happy, I like it
oh, that's nice, you are so happy Ingrid
really interesting
that's wonderful, that's good
so, you know, if you need anything you can find me in the Internet, in the website of the
yes yes mhm, well I did go to the website, several times
mhm
just to be sure that everything was legit
yes, yes, yes
and it worked fine because since my account was activated I don't know if you were the one that did it but that problem works
oh oh yes yes, the system, we always have some little problems but like I said, we are always checking if the platform is working fine
sure, m
and we always need more more people and
you will need?
you know, if you know here people who want to participate
you know I know a friend who, eh, we're, we're practically like siblings but she, she doesn't live here, she lives in New Hampshire, before I lived in New Hampshire
in some part of the United States and Canada
yes look, I called a person in Canada the other day
yes yes
I'll tell her to go to the website to enroll in the study
yes okay
she has, she has her degree in Spanish

ah yes listen
and there's also for people that speak Chinese and Japanese and all those languages that
Aha, Carolina, from Los Angeles.
Hello, how is it going? I'm Mariano, from Philadelphia.
Hello, Mariano.  How are you? Mm.
I think I've talked with you.
yes, sure you have. We talked a while back. How have you been?
Ah, How are things?
very good, very good. And you? How are you, your post graduate?
No, fine, very cold here.
No, I can imagine. yes here is cold, and it's a tolerable cold. What will it leave? You, over there, must be
Look, by here, is
Well,
fourteen degrees below zero.
Ah, it can't be. Ah, no, no, no. I would die.
So imagine
No, no. Don't even say it, because I, there is true that I would've died frozen. I swear. Not me, I'm of warm weather, and, and, and
is a, well, if you could see me, I'm with a really exaggerated hat, and, and, and
No, yes, yes,
and is nothing. I mean, I'm talking about a completely normal temperature. Sure, a little bit low, but
But,
normal for the season.
but normal.
Oh, don't even say it, look, what are you now going to do, now that those dates are coming?
No, no, yes, the truth is that it had been in around minus four degrees and four degrees.
Oh, oh my God.
it was like that for some time but it's now colder, it's minus fourteen degrees, I was in my bike as I do everyday because I live close to it, five miles, sort of, from
Well, aha. Okay, okay
college and I take my bike, so, that, well
Oh.
I was in pain, my legs were hurting because of the cold weather.
Sure, sure.
It's too much, we are not used to that.
No,
So, I'm going to have to take the bus tomorrow because
To go to
it seems to me, right?
so that you keep yourself warm, well, it is cold in Argentina, isn't it?
In Argentina, it depends on the place.
Okay.
Argentina is pretty big, it's a big country,
That's correct.
For example, in the south, you have colds like these, or more
Ok, like over there in the Patagonia, right
In the part of, the Patagonia, lets say. Uh, in Buenos Aires, which is in the middle, it's warm
Ok, OK
It was, in the winter, it doesn't, it doesn't go below zero degrees, almost never
OK
And, in the north, it's hot, i mean, it's similar to Brazil in some
Oh, ok, OK
I, i mean that, we can choose
Exactly, but never something like this, right?, minus fourteen
No, no, no, at least not in Buenos Aires, on the south, yeah
Sure, sure, sure, but
In, in Usuaia, places like that
Oh, my god, but, and, and, well, you're gonna have to equip yourself, right?, like find some good sweaters, some
Yes, no, we, we have bought ourselves... well, we didn't have any clothes
Some things for, sure, sure, it isn't
It was, i don't know, the cold weather clothes in Argentina, wasn't good
Exactly, exactly, look, and what... what plans do you have for the holidays now?
Well, I'm actually going to California
Is it true?
really.l I'm moving to San Francisco.
Oh, that's good.
Lets say, not San Francisco, I'm going to San Francisco to visit but I'm going to Davis, it's there
that's good.
it's kind of close.
Oh, to the university?
Sure, two of my friends work there, so, we are, we are going there,
Oh, that's nice.
So, we are going to go visit. Where should I go?
Look, if you go there, to San Francisco, well, no, I believe that you are going to be in a pretty good location. Really, San Francisco is so beautiful, you can visit all of it, you can visit, the, the the,
the Fisher, what's the name? The, like the, the, where the fisherman work
Oh, the port, yes.
The, the, oh, the pier. What's the name? The port, like a port, that's right. It's well, the same, isn't it?
Oh, yes, like a port.
There are lots of theaters and I like the theaters, they are very bohemians and the people is bohemian too you know, they are artists. They also have the Alcatraz prison, the the Alcatraz prison, right?
Oh, it's pretty famous.
Oh no, there are lots of nice and interesting things to see. I think that basically, it's like a theater world, I believe that it's going to be, well, I don't know, I believe that if you like it, I think we once talked about the
fact that you like the independent theater, independent movies.
Exactly, yes yes.
Mhm, correct. So,
Yes
Well, yes, i think it's going to be very interesting, because you'll be there, how long?, a week?
Uh, yes, from, between, between Christmas and New Year, lets say, so, the whole week
Perfect, excellent
They have told me that Carmel, Monterey, it's very nice around there, right?
Carlmel, yeah, that's the most gorgeous, of course it is. Carmel, no, you're gonna love that, it really looks like, well
Oh
i was there for a summer, it's really different. I don't know how it is in the winter, but it's very beautiful, but it's like a ghost town, something like that.
Very curious. Monterey, Monterey is very nice. But, there's no better thing there in Monterey, i think, than Carmel
Sure
Yes, Monterey is like three, two streets, that's it
Sure, sure, sure
Uh, well, right?, or maybe i just visited a little. I can't lie either, but i visited very little. But, very nice, very nice because it has like a Spanish style
Uh, you know, everything from the colonial era, very, very, very nice
Sure
Uh, you're gonna love it
I'm gonna love it, rigt?
Yes, yes, uh, Carmel
And again, I'll have to go through Los Angeles
Oh, no, you have to come around here some day, so you can visit around here. Here it's, well, there are many, did you know there's a lot of live here too?, night life, and the theaters too, the
Sure. Yes, what didn't attract me so much of Los Angeles, as it happens with others when they are such big cities,
museums. Sure.
and, I like them, there, a little smaller, and I like nature a lot. Then,
Sure. Ah, no, sure. But you will love it, then. Here there are many nice places, what happens is that, sure, precisely because of how big it is, they are a little far, Right?
Sure.
But, there are some very beautiful places really. And, and especially, like places like that, eh, mm, like, Universal Studios, City Walk Cafe.
No, I'm dying for that. yes, yes, yes.
Aha, those types of places, right. Very, very pleasant. What a shame that, well, that, that, because I'm leaving tomorrow to Venezuela.
Ah, how nice.
if not, I would tell you, pass by here, well, I'll give you a small tour, but no, I'm leaving tomorrow, God willing. yes, I'm going to spend Christmas over there. Ah, I can't wait, yes, yes, yes.
how nice, you return with the whole family, Right?
I'm crazy, now I'm like crazy. Well, doing last minute shopping
I can imagine.
yes, yes.
You are alone, Right? Here, Or, or you have family?
No, I'm. yes, I'm here with my husband.
Ah, good.
But, he, now, he's now in Venezuela. He left first, now I'm leaving. Then, well, we are in that, in that process. Well, you know that we want to go back.
You don't say.
yes, we want to go back. Then, now we are doing all like seeing the, the possibility of, of, of already settling down there, so.
Sure.
yes.
And do you have chances, like that, to work?
Well, we're trying, precisely. That is what we're doing, that's why he left first.
Sure. yes, because to go back to our countries is hard.
Because, sometimes, I mean, And are you thinking of staying?
No. I intend to go back.
Ah. Sure.
In principle, I intend to go back. Eh, as long as I can have a job, in life
Sure. Sure. Sure.
more or less decent, No?
But, don't you believe, one thing, look, and I will tell you something, sometimes, sure, well, it's an experience that each one has, and, and I think that it's good to live it
E- sometimes the, the e- that economic responsibility, certainly you can find here. But, the, that emotional, that
yes.
sentimental, that you will not find here.
No, that,
And, if you are that kind of person, look, i- it will affect you.
that's true. That's true.
It will affect you very much.
yes.
It will affect you, i
They're very different, they're
They're very different, very different. And that's something i can't stand, i can't... it bothers me
yeah, it's the same to me
that they're so indifferent, yes, yes, that indifference, they saw you like they saw you today, they don't say hi, i don't understand how they can't say hi to a person they just saw, that
yes, yes, bt sure, right, and besides, i, i can tell that i was, uh, it's my eight or ninth month here in the United States and
almost all of my friends are foreigners
Sure
i mean, right?, and not, not necessarily, i mean, most of them are Latinos or Spaniards
right
or mexicans, or italians, or even french, or, or venezuelan, or Colombians
Right, right, oh yes?, oh, that's good
But, but, yeah, pleny, the truth is
Uh huh
Very varied, but, even so, uh, uh, uh, German guys, or, but not, not the americans, it's like they're stuck
emotionally, i say, there's something with them, because
Yes, yes
They have some, some, it's, i can't believe, understand that i get invited to a house from six to eight p.m., i mean
Oh, exactly
What?, that doesn't exist in Argentina
That, except in Venezuela, what's that?
But of course
Why would you limit yourself that way?, my god, let the thing flow, if, if you want to leave early, you leave, and if you want to stay because the thing is cool, you stay
But, logically, and no one is kicking anyone out
Exactly, look, i go to sleep, i lie down at seven thirty five, what's that?
Sure
That's a very strange thing, look, they see you, they're with you every day, they don't say hi, uh, no, it's a thing that, sometimes i feel sorry for them, because i say, wow
Poor guys, they really have it all, and they don't, they don't know how to enjoy it, everything is buying, buying, buying, and, and i don't know, uh, oh no, it's something that, really, i swear, look, i prefer to have less
Exact, exact
Have less and be happy
But totally, i completely agree
Yes, yes, of
I completely agree, and to, and, and, and it happens that, things are worthless here, right?, i mean, a gift has no, it 's priceless here because, i mean, it's priceless because
Uh huh
Everything's so easy that they, i watched the birthday of a
yes
niece of us that lives in Pittsburgh
OK
And so many gifts and so many things, and everything's so easy, they don't value it. I remember when
Exactly
when I was little, give, that they give me a gift was exciting.
Sure. You waited the whole year for that.
But here, not here, is like everything is so easy.
No, here yes, because, look here, is rather, the law of punishment, instead of the prize, for, for having done something good. I mean, here is that, aha, I'm going to take away the Nintendo, I'm going to take away, this, this, because is that they have everything.
yes, everything.
Then, How are they, how are they going to reward you? I mean, what they have to do is punish you, because, eh, the prize doesn't exist.
Sure.
I mean, you have to be a very well placed parent. and, and not have been born here, to start by there. Because, if you were born here, well, you have another culture, you are in the culture of consumption.
And, you are permanently, buying, buying, buying, buying. I mean,
Sure.
there's not a balance between things. Right? And I'm going to tell you, really, really, very pleasant, everything, suddenly here you have a lot of options, you have a lot of possibilities
but we are searching where we feel happy.
yes.
Where you in the morning, well, suddenly you have nothing to eat, and, no, man, look, God prepares. I don't know? Let's see what comes out of there.
Sure.
Or, or today you have a little, and you enjoy it, your neighbor comes, look, man, that here you have this, take this here, eat this little bit of this. I mean,
But, yes.
Oh, well, oh at least, that is now, what we feel that will make us feel completely happy.
And, that the people look in your eyes and you feel that sincere look, right,
Exactly.
They don't look at you with mean eyes.
Oh, yes. Or, or, if one bumps into you he says "I'm sorry"
yes, yes.

oh, I  oh, yes
aha aha
oh, well I had understood that basically one has to talk about the topic that they are given
no, ah, ah, According to what several people have told me whom I've spoken to that is not necessary but is to have something to talk about
oh,
where you have
Well
aha
Okay,
yes
oh right
but we can talk, we can talk about the technical things also
Which is the most important technical device for you in your life?
Well I don't know if you consider a car Because a car has a lot of technology
yes, well
and
It's very
And that for me is
it's very important
yes, aha
It's, In what place in Texas are you?
In the area of and Dallas
Oh Sure, sure, sure, sure
yes, daughter
So, sure, eh, eh The car is well for every area, but there are areas eh, areas in the that public transportation is better than others
We, well
But generally public transportation Is not good in any place
almost, here in the United States I don't know No, that, that
how is it in in Texas?
Ah, well we have the buses and eh, in train that goes from eh, from Dallas But just arriving there one has to have
Transportation for for where you want to go alrady, here
Eh,
And they, they
Exactly
if it's long distance it takes a long time, ah, ah Around the city
OK
but like in New York Like I think it would be better ah, go by ah, the bus Oh the, ah, the train
yes
Or the subway which they call Ah,
Well Talking of, of technical devices that are important that nobody can live without is the car is very important
yes, ah
the car is terribly important to transport us everywhere, What about speaking of other devices, Is there something eh, some technical device that you
use a lot in your house, for example, eh, what, what is the computer for you?
Well for
Is important
Is important at work, in the house I don't use it much, just for email and something like that but At work I do use it a lot
Ah, but there are some people that spend all their time on the computer and and I don't know, there are see, there are situations that that it is bad and others that it is good.
Like everything can be, like, aha
Exactly, exactly
in
Exactly, sure, I mean
the phone is very important also
what?
The phone
Oh
is very important
The phone is
yes,
is terribly important the phone is
yes
very, very, very, very important
yes
the interesting thing is that sure, for you the computer Eh, is not very important apparently, you don't use it for many things like other people, for example to
to pay your eh, your, your bills. There are people that use the computer to buy, to shop
yes
there are people that use it a lot, a lot for a lot of things Today I was talking with someone who says that, that the computer is, I was talking with this man
in another place and he said that his wife told him you have to choose, or the computer or me? I couldn't believe it because he says that
the computer, he's basically the whole day on the computer he
yes
works, this man does commerce
aha
and then he does his sales
yes
through the computer
aha
when he has to eh, eh Order merchandise he does it through the computer when he has to pay his bills he does it through the computer in other words that the computer
But they are all different, isn't it
I know that many people uses it to chat, in chat rooms
Exactly
and and there's lost of people that play games ah, that they can join with other people from any part of the world and, and
That's incredible
yes that's what
Ouch, ouch
ah, well my youngest son he Met his wife through the computer and that, yes,
Check that out! check that out, it's incredible
yes, mm
You are saying so yourself
yes
You youngest son met his wife through the computer
yes, ah, talking
look, incredible
aha, talking through a chat room and I have oh, look, he she I don't know how to say it in Spanish the step son
Ah, his step yeah step son
He
yes, yes, yes, I understand
my brother's he also also met his girlfriend that, and they will get married in March
It means that sometimes something good can come from the chat rooms
yes, well, sometimes, but, there are time that many situations don't, eh
Of course, you have to be careful as with everything else
yes, yes
But look, it's very interesting what you say about two members of your family
yes
meeting their partner, eh, talking with him, him, through the computer. Very interesting Of course that's the mo, first step
yes
And then people have to go out and get to know each other, of course, talk to each other. But it's very interesting, incredible how
yes
eh, eh, computers, eh, nowadays are being used for almost everything, for many things
there's almost, almost no area where you can't do anything with
Exactly, exactly
yes
Exactly. Do you use the computer a lot in your job, Yolanda?
ah, yes, because I'm an assistant ah, and I, I do a lot of research
Oh, I get it, sure, sure, then for research there's nothing better than the computer, it's incredible, incredible
yes, yes yes, a lot of information
It's incredible, sometimes I start thinking, like today I was talking to this man, how our lives have changed since we have computers
Like when we didn't have, no
In a big way, in a big way
A lot of things
yes
we nowadays do with the computers and
yes
sometimes I tell myself, how can it be that our lives have changed so much! We used to do a lot of things, the same things or even more things
aha
when we didn't have them and now we are oh. We are kind of getting addicted to computers.
yes, a lot, yes, yes, a lot, like I said, I know people that leaves work, they get home and they turn on the computer and use it until they go to sleep.
They do this everyday.
Oh, well that's a bit much
And that's a big problem, I think, oh, because they are not living a real life, they are living
No, exactly. No, no,
yes
You are so right about that. The computer is replacing people, other communication means that are also important, isn't it?
yes
Because
yes
yes, well, yes, it is a fast communication mean and and useful, you know, oh. It's a bit, oh
lonely, isn't it.
yes, I see, it was for me, aha
There's people, there's people but the world is totally apart
mhm
I'm not, you know, I don't agree with the electronic games
yes yes, there are a lot of them, no, no, I don't think it's right, mhm
No, I don't like them
yes
I don't really like them at all, I've watched them and I don't like them, I don't like them
oh, the kids spend, if you let them, they spend the whole day in the computer
yes
in the computer
James from New York
Oh
James from New York
yes, I'm from New York
Who's this?
José
Oh, José, how are you?
What's your name?
James
What?
James, my name is James
James, oh, OK
What's up Jose?, how are you?
fine, thank you
What part of New York do you live in?
Queens
Oh, Queens, very good
You live in New York
Uh, yes, i live in New York, almost at the last part of New York, uh, i think on the border with the Bronx
Ok, ok, OK
The last stop, the, lats stop, yes
West Chester, over there, OK
Well, what do you think of the subject?
Oh, technological devices, the e-mail is the device i most frequently use
Right, the computer
And that i also think it's important, because i work at a school and i study too
Oh
So, the device, the, the e-mail system, uh, helps me get mail from work, and also things like the professor that we also have classes of
Where the professor sends emails to us and we have to get into the university's system and
Right
To search for information inside that system
The device, the technological device you use the most is the computer, so to speak, that makes, makes your life easier
To me, yeah, exactly, it also makes communication between friends easier
Oh
Uh, that live very far apart, and i can chat with them
Yeah
uh, via a system like instant messenger
Right
Where i can communicate with them, i don't have to make a long distance call, i can talk to friends
Yes, yes, over the phone, from the phone to the internet, right
well, I use my phone to use my phone to connect to the internet
aha
that also if, if it wasn't for the phone it would be something else but eh that already they have eh eh wireless they have systems that if you already need eh
eh, yes a port you don't need a port it already has it
aha
you can already be in a place that has free internet
mm
and or if not in the same road already,
aha mm
it makes our life easier, as far as the technology right now it has advanced so much, for example the directions, I'm always in the car, the whole day in the car, the phone for me is a big advantage
mm mm
eh the faxes
mm, mm
the email like you say eh also that device of, I don't know how you can say it in Spanish but is the communication that is with
by the internet and the satellite receives, it receives your location and it guides you to the place where you want to go
ah ah yes, yes, yes like, like, what is that called? is like mapquest but is, is a program that you can with your, your
yes, it has a device
through the cellular or
aha
through a -PDA
aha, PVA then
oh, you can connect it and they will give you information on where you want to go
aha, exactly, there are some now that you place in the car and
mhm
through a satellite it guides you to where you want to go
mhm mhm, are you a taxi driver?
so, it tells you where to go, no, no, I'm not
oh
I work in the streets taking merchandise to several places
mhm okay
yeah so, a lot of times I've had to travel far and that makes it so much easier, it helps me get to places without having to look for the addresses and that's the most
mhm
and yes, technology makes our life easier.
mhm
technological artifacts are advanced
mhm mhm
no, we depend on them too
also
we depend on them every day more and the day in which we have no power, no Internet, no
I mhm mhm
we are not going to How do you say it? to tribulation, no we are going to be, really, really bad.
mm, mm, the only thing missing is that they turn us, that they turn us into robots
mm for example the day of the blackout here in New York, that there was no electricity, there was no phone, there was nothing.
mm mm
the elevators weren't working, almost all the technological devices operate with electricity, and there was nothing then the
mm
the um the the
it got complicated
it got complicated, the matter got complicated there
mm mm
mm ah even the bridge that that well I didn't hear of any deaths but that everybody
no but we are so dependent of it that we forget how and how much we use
ah
we depend - depend on the technology
yes, and that and exactly then we have no other way out because
mm
like you say the internet as far as the classes and all that
mm,mm
there's no other there's no other unless you meet with the teacher and he can give you information
mm well that ah, up to now on the part of the computer you can take classes on the internet and you don't have to go to class
aha, also
you don't have, no there's a little of an advantage and a little of disadvantage also of the advantages of, of the internet is that
also everything is getting so modernized
yes
that we are also losing a little bit of contact which is essential and necessary
aha, exactly
to to be more effective also
yes
you notice that you call a credit card to talk with a person to help you with a problem that you have with that credit card
the most unpleasant and the most annoying is having a computer talk to you
and, and wait also
when you need a direct help and, and
a person
a direct person and a person who in reality understands the situation and that you can manage with that person to help you and to correct that problem.
because a computer when I press one and two and three will not solve the problem, sometimes it directs me to the person
that knows the most about that case, but well many many times eh sometimes is, is very confusing and
yes I understand because I've gone through that - through there
and the only thing it does is that it makes you madder and
mm
and you don't get to resolve the problem I went through that recently
There, yeah, uh, when, what you're saying is that you get mad when the, technology only does... like makes the world smaller with it
after, after instantly communicating a person that's distant, you can get pictures from that person at once, in your camera, in your
uh, in your phone, on the computer, uh, you can get information about, i don't know, inventory of merchandise,  i sell through the internet up to Japan
uh, i have sent merchandise to Brazil
wow
that's only take a picture to the merchandise, measure it, have the contact and the person sends you the money through the internet too
Uh huh
And then i go to FedEx express on the internet, to sign... the website
Uh huh
I pick the tracking, a tracking number and send it to her, knowing that track number will get to the box she's going to get
Uh huh
And if this box doesn't arrive the day it was supposed to get there, i take this number and search for it on the computer and it tells you exactly where it is
Uh huh
standing, the package, you know, so, the world gets smaller, the technology
uh huh
makes our life easier and the moment when
uh huh
that the thin doesn't work like we expect, we get mad because really
uh
depend, we become very dependent on it
hmm
but it is something that sincerely, there is not, you cannot escape, you cannot escape because
hmm well  and because of that am, by, from television and radio the internet we are also well informed sometimes of things
yes, yes, yes
eh sometimes very, very informed but it is good to know eh what is happening, it can be a
the world
a catastrophe, a natural one I know that this time eh, foreseeing in advance for one to take, to take precautions.
aha
by the technology, television, radio, whatever it is something positive too
yes, yes, yes, so I cannot have a bad opinion of technology it is something that if we had it it would affect the sixth sense for example
eh, it is said that cell phones are harmful that the radioactivity, the radiation you have to take care of your body
hmm
it is something that is  inevitable, it cannot, like, how can you avoid it if you must have it in your pocket. Do you understand me?
hmm
oh it is in the pocket of your pant or in the pocket of you shirt or in the jacket but it will always be with you, then, how could you avoid it.
hmm
and I see as an example
hmm
really, the easy pass right now too
hmm yes technology
technology before was the line to wait and to
and pay everything in cash
the toll in cash, exactly
throw the - have change
aha, the bother of having change, exactly
to be able to throw- mm, mm
before the, they did it faster, to have change to throw in a basket
mm
a, a bucket, a, I don't know how you say bucket
mm, mm
then you would put the change there and the machine would read it and it
mm and you had to, hello
and you had to have the exact change
yes exactly
not now, the monthly easy pass
mm
collects the money that you have used and it refills it again
is aha
and and that already, that, How can you escape it? if it really makes our life easier, you can't, you can't
yes is a little also if you look at it right how the technology is it has two sides right like two sides of the coin and the other side of that is that
the technology has changed like the metrocard or the system of getting on the, in, in
aha
on the buses in the public trains eh then now you lose the worker, the job
aha, yes, yes, yes
because by having the computer accessible how they've done here in, in, in New Yo-
no
Tamara
yes, Tamara what's going on? My name is Eliana, How are you, good?
Good, you?
Fine, everything fine. Well, the day's topic is marriage. What do you think of interracial marriage?
I agree with the interracial marriages, you?
Eh, yes, yes, the truth is that for me, the topic of race on one hand I know that is hard, eh mm
because, of the cultures, more than anything, right? Because of the things that can come up between the two people, but I don't think that is bad that there are interracial marriages
Look, me, my mom always told me that, eh, is quite hard for one be getting along well with a partner - a person that is not eh
of your same eh mm, social background so to speak, right?
Sure, I honestly still don't know, because I'm not married, but well, many, for example, I also know on the part of my parents
that, eh, they separated, let's say we are Jewish, us, and my parents separated and they remarried Jewish people and they always say that they feel like
eh, in family. right? in that way, but to me
well I'm, I'm married and I'm Jewish but my husband is not Jewish, so I'm, more or less, we get along quite well and we respect each other
Sure, but are you both Hispanics?
Eh, we both are, yes, we are both Argentinians and we met in another country, but
Both?
we get along quite well, in our great
Sure, well but Sure, that's why, then, the religion is another topic to talk about, but the topic of the race for me is super important, if you are Hispanic
Well, that's what I like about here, eh, the United States, in Europe there are many countries that one sees that there are, are interracial couples, and the truth is that I think that's good, I don't know how they get along, because I don't know
ah, no, today, I have one that is black eh, black color and the, her husband is Irish, and they get along fabulously.
Sure, yes, that's why, you'd have to see, for example, i, I'm single here in the United States, i always feel, yes, closer to people
uh, Latin people, right?, with whom i can speak spanish, maybe because my English is not good, so everytime, if they want to introduce me to someone that speaks spanish, i feel i can
can reach better, i can talk more, uh, about other subjects, about deeper subjects, and have a better
uh
relationship in the future, i really don't understand how two people with different languages can get along fine, with different culture
Yes
during their lifetimes, i don't, i don't imagine myself at, at that, at that point
Well, but, uh, it's not, it's not always, it can be, lets say, by being interracial it can be the same culture, right?, i imagine that two people that were born
in the United States, one of color and the other not, but were raised, both in the same country, or even in the same city
Sure, that's true, that's true, that's it, you have to differentiate culture, religion and race
And, and for the kids, yes, and for the kids, the children of that couple, i think they'll be pretty tolerant, which is good
for, lets say for the world, right?
Sure, yes, that's true
Because
Yes, that's true
Uh huh
To me, yeah, that, you're right, that's, that's good
Yes, but for example you
And more than anything if we're talking about a person of color, or a white one, that's really good, right?, that's gonna happen and
Yes, but what do you think of that, would you fall in love with a person of color?
yes, I think so, but I think I could fall in love with a colored person as long as he is from my own culture, eh, with who I can share even the same language, that's what I was
yes
I see it limits me,
And the people you go with, do you think you will ever find someone like that
oriental or, eh, colored, let's say
The thing is that in my country they are, I am Argentinean also, but in Argentina or in, what you call it? eh there are bot many Asians
who speak a perfect Spanish and have a Hispanic culture, that's the thing
Mhm, yes
yes, maybe, yes, mhm, it could be, probably
Mhm
and also another aspect is that, I don't know, I don't like Asians in a physical sense, for instance, but I may like one sometime
yes
so I won't say, no, no way, no way, on the contrary, I like and respect a lot the couples who are of i-, the interracial couples, let's say
yes. No, I also find them quite, I mean, I like them, I like them quite a lot that couple, but  I don't know either how they met or which are their
eh, the circumstances how, how they meet each other, because for instance, I think that the orientals are quite reserved, but yet, at least here in Brooklyn where I live, you can see many couples
of oriental women and American men, mm, I just can't figure where they met, right?
No, but here, eh, mm, in the United States there is mo-, everything is so cosmopolitan
yes
and, right? Let's say
yes, no, it's not where they met, but if they are open to such relations, you know what I mean?
Sure, yes, is true, in that sense is true yes, is good. And you think that for example
yes.
in that case, let's say, the marriages have do you think that an interracial marriage has more or less divorces?
Look, the truth is that at this stage of life where everyone gets divorces, I don't think that, an interracial marriage gets more divorced than others
eh of the same race I don't think so
Sure.
On the contrary, I think that in that case they will be
Sure
more interesting and yes, perhaps they have more arguments because eh of, I mean, of political things or that happens in reality and that one agrees and the other doesn't but
but I don't think that influences more than anything in the divorce.
Sure, and you that, that got married with a person that speaking right? of religion now
yes
that is not Jewish, did you have problems in your family?
yes. And, yes, honestly yes, there are, are
Ah, really?
And yes, yes, at the beginning, they didn't like him at all but well since I never went out with a person of, the same religion as me eh so to speak, is not that I changed
from a Jewish boyfriend to a non-Jewish boyfriend, I never had a Jewish boyfriend eh, so that, let's say, they were already used to that, only this time it was serious and
and well, and I got married but yes, he, he also was a little complicated when
Sure.
eh, when we got married, how the ceremony was going to be and that
Ah, and how did they do it?
And no, at last we got married without, by civil, that is a non religious marriage eh, and I think that in the future the problem could be the children but
but by religion, my children must be Jews, so, because women are the ones who give the but I don´t know, with, with people of color is different, because well, genes are those that pass , there is not
Of course, but if for example your son decides to be catholic and go to church
It is going to, the truth it is going to bother me, but I think I could not tell him not to do it
Of course.
but if, he learns something about the church it is going to be, hmm, eh, I don´t know, from the, from the friends
The school,from his friends
yes because we don´t, we never celebrate Catholic things in fact we celebrate more Jews things that Catholic ones
Of course, you see it.
but well I don´t know, I think that with people, color people and interracial marriages the issue is different, because the, the children don´t have to choose one or another religion
it is than, they born with a color or slanted eyes but they accept the way it comes, the hands, it is not a matter of choosing
Of course, you should distinguish between what is different, lets say you are from the same, for example that you two were born in the same city
yes.
and move in the same place and that you two are from different race, it looks to me not so terrible like eh, a person coming from
Africa and
Hmm.
right? and have a whole African culture and
yes, that is what, I thought that, so my mother told me, she told me because so, you can meet with people and say well it is, is from the same, from my religion but
eh, but maybe we don´t have a thing in common, right? you grew up eh, in a big city the other one in the middle of the jungle, there are not many things to see
let's say if, if today I, I would go to the jungle, to work there, perhaps
Sure.
it would be much nicer finding a person that lives there and that, to know his experiences of the place there, perhaps also, I will fall in love with that person, but not
eh is like living in a city one, I don't know if, if you can find and, and have many things in common with
with those people, right?
Sure, sure, sure.
But well, if they are in the same city, is, is already different.
Sure, I think the same, what happens is that in the place where of Argentina there aren't that many racial problems that I know of, they are rather more economic, then
yes, yes.
When, right? when one talks that if there's a problem or not on racial level, eh, I can't find the problem
Sure.
But I never saw them, saw a racial problem, yes perhaps a problem of religion or social economic.
yes, and have you traveled a lot around the world?
yes, yes, I traveled let's say, by Central America
Mm.
South America, and I was also in Thailand, in Asia let's say
And in Central America, eh also? Because in Central American there are also people of color.
No, well, in Central America that I was in Costa Rica, I did feel there were racial problems
Ah, really? The people of color don't mix so to speak with the, the white ones?
yes, No, because the same the color ones are more than anything in the Caribbean and the rest are in the Pacific.
Oh.
And you can see it in the map and see that the routes in the Caribbean are, they are destroyed if they don't get fixed and the Pacific zones are amazing.
Mm put they can get you straight to, lets say, or they work for tourism.
and they were yes no, what happened is that there used to be a port where all the slaves would arrive to
Aha.
so, they stayed there and and since they were slaves, that's what, that's what I learned about Costa Rica.
Mhm.
Oh but those are black people but they are kind of angry with the world, isn't it? they are angry at the white people.
yes.
so, when the whites think that the others, I don't know, and the blacks are angry at the whites, that's when the racial problems begin,  I think.
yes.
For example, I was in a taxi in Costa Ric and I asked the driver how the Caribbean was since I hadn't been there yet and he told me, oh there are lots of blacks over there.
And what color was he?
and and he was, Hispanic
Sure.
he wasn't white, he was Hispanic.
Mhm.
and well I was surprised because I had never in my whole life heard something so negative towards black people
and you listen to it in the television, all of that, but since there are almost no blacks in Argentina.
Sure.
To me, to me, it surprised me a lot, no, that it was like
Aha, good afternoon, is Carolina, from Los Angeles
Ah, good afternoon. My name is Blanca, from Arizona
Oh, Blanca, How are you?
Fine.
Ah, I'm glad.
Here,
What a topic, aha, this topic. Hot topic, certainly. Right?
ah, yes. yes
Are you married with some person of, of another natio-?
Of another nationality, not of another race.
Exactly, exactly, is, is what I, I also disagree with that term, that sounds like, like a horse, like a dog. That of race, well, especially. Right? I no, no, no,
Okay, is that, in my point of view, there's only one race which is the human being, there are several types of, of
exactly.
several types or forms of that race. But, no, there aren't many races, there's only one, the human race.
Exactly, exactly, I always, every time they say, no, but what race are you? And I, no, I'm not a dog nor a horse. I mean,
Yes.
is What nationality are you, from what part, from what other? because that of a white race, black race, that bothers me tremendously, and especially here.
Here I feel that there's like a problem, problem of colors,
It has always existed, I also think. Not only of colors, but of, of nationalities.
that, yes, yes, yes, correct, correct. Where are you from?
I'm from Colombia.
Aha, I was almost, almost, it seems to me
And you from Venezuela Right?
yes, exactly. the same.
Ah, no, that accent, I don't know. It doesn't change.
yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, look that, precisely, always when we talk about the topic, I know, I say, look, my family, on my dad's side are black.
no? I hadn't noticed
Hm.
that my family was black until I arrived here. When I started hearing that mess that is black, that African American, that I don't know what, then I would say, well, I'm African Venezuelan then, because,
my mom is white, white, white, and my father is dark skinned, well, but my grandmother is black.
yes.
Then, I would say, But what is this? I mean, I swear that I started to think about that now being here. In the little time that I've been here. And I say, wow, really,
sincerely, I had never detailed that. What's more, I always had, had more of a tendency towards my dad's family,
Hm
and I have cousins of all colors. Because, my uncles that are black, have gotten married to white women, and vice versa also,
Okay.
I mean that is not that a racial problem exist in Venezuela, so to speak, our problem is of classes, there.
yes, is like, is like in Colombia.
If you are rich, exactly.
Is exactly the same story. In Colombia, in Colombia it doesn't exist, eh, that issue of race is also not so  marked. Rather is more by groups, or by social classes. Right?
Right, right. That if you're rich, I mean if you're doing all right, or you're poor, well, definitely.
Yea.
So, e- people are more, we, look, I've got Asian friends, I have Italian friends, or children of Italians, better said, children of Arabs, and for me, they're Venezuelan. I don't see them as foreigners, not at all, on the contrary. And you talk with them,
and s- and the, above all the parents who weren't born in Venezuela, but they've been living there for more than fifty years. They feel more Venezuelan than even I do.
I'm telling you, they really love Venezuela, they speak very well of Venezue- it's more, and you all to, because
To Venezuela.
casually, I've got a friend who's Colombian, and she's Korean,
yea.
Can you imagine? She's Asian,
Colombian and Korean.
uh huh, so, you see her
Well, my children are according to the accounts, in keeping with the subject, they're Guatemalan and Colombian. With, with, with American customs, because they were born here. So, there there's
Ah.
three nationalities mixed together. But, they're not different from everyone else.
Ah, ah, ah. Right, right.
That's, that's absurd, well, the one,
Right, and de- and it really depends on you as a mother, or your husband, I mean, to instill that in them from children. Because, here, I'll tell you, it's a challenge to raise children.
ah, yea. Mm.
E- it's pretty tough, really, pretty tough, and above all because, because of the, how people here live their lives. It's something really different from our lives, no-
we can have problems of another kind, economic problems, all of a sudden,
Socials.
socials, that this, but, but this one, this so serious social problem that I see here, the indifference, the, the low How do I explain it to you? the low respect, for example from kids to adults. So, it is like,
Yeah.
listen, I, I remember that when we were young, see, no, mister, look, excuse me, so, say good night, greet, say bye,
Oh, no. My husband´s daughter is like that, and she is going to be twenty.
here
Oh, I can tell you, what a way, what a way to raise that girl, I don´t want to raise my kids like that
Of course.
It is, they don´t have any obligation with, their elders, is a total disrespect. No, is not like when you went out by car, you came home,
and if an old lady, the grandmother or the aunt were standing, you gave them the sit.
imagine that.
I think it is not a matter of, for example,those who have children grow them this or that way, is not a matter of race, is a matter of
like each couple do
Exactly.
their, their own raise, their own upbringing
Exactly. Exactly, because that does not have, is more, I, I, I have always make him that question, and I have American friends, and I ask them, they tell me, look, it is really part of our culture, it is not that we all are like that, like everything, right?
Hmm.
but, the majority, is like an indifference, like,
Yeah.
eh, so selfish so, but it is a so big, that, that, that practically they isolate themselves, is like
yes, totally.
yes they live in their own world, and I say, my God, what, what a big thing, really not, see, we think of coming back, God let us to do it soon, I think in one or two years, I do not want to spend more time.
Because, honestly, it is eh, I don´t know, I, okay, I adapt very all, I am a person
When Chavez leave from there, that is another issue.
What?
That when Chavez leave there, that is another issue.
Ah, see that not, see that not, I am totally in favor of him. yes, totally, totally, the truth is that what happens is that the image given to him is very
strong, it is an image
No, the one that he shows, the one that he shows
the one that he, the one that he shows, well, what happens is that, do you know what they do? is that they focus in him only that part. Then, how, then, the image that, they project on him is, is , is not the most appropriated. Then, all, we always fall into that topic, it is an unavoidable topic. Right?
Hmm. yes.
But, I am totally in favor, I am, so, a hundred percent agree with his policies, his strategy, and precisely, one of the things we want to do is to incorporate to that, because
we believe in that project, and
Aha.
and the true, I say, damn, I have only six years here,
yes.
and I am going to say, I lived all the process, and I have lived, an I have years over me, and, and I live the part of the, democracy of the parties, hmm
so, the politicians of the moment. And sincerely, it was too much. It is a very particular situation, sincerely. No, it does not looks like any other. It is a situation very, very particular
yes.
And when that man arrived, we thought, my God, at last someone who can stop so much, so much insolence, so much corruption, it was so much. But, so much. Then, precisely, so much people tel, us. But are you crazy, right now? Well, it is that many people doesn´t know. Right?
And they have an image of him, the one that he projects in the media that is evident, they are against him, so,
Sure
it's really complicated and difficult, also, I know one couple from Bogota
Mhm.
that well, it's a really nice couple and I really love them and when I was at their home a man from Bogota came to visit them and oh, he was their friend and he told me,
What's your opinion about that crazy President of yours? And oh my God, and I, what, oh, I was like, excuse me sir but
Aha.
he's not crazy to me, and he was like, I'm sorry, I didn't want to say that, it's just that, the man apologized to me but I told him, I would never talk that way about President Uribe but
I see.
sure, I know that everyone thinks he's crazy but, that's the image that they've projected of him
But, and and he has showed it too, because, that's what he, what he
he shows, he is real, he doesn't hide it
Sure, sure, sure. But the thing is that
he doesn't, he's like that, he's open and careless when he speaks and says things
exactly, exactly, he has no, he's not a demagog he doesn't, he's not a diplomat, he's not
Aha.
like that, and that angers people, it angers them because they are not used to that, so, the journalists try to hurt him but he answers, no? In the beginning I would say oh God, but
I didn't understand him either but then I started to realize the truth and I visit Venezuela often, by the way, I'm leaving tonight
Oh, that's great.
yes, and,
I would give anything to go visit Colombia right now.
ah, yes, I can imagine, really.
A year ago I spent a wonderful Christmas over there.
Ah, how exciting.
And I came back two months ago, so I can't go back now.
Ah, how nice, sure, sure.
It's too high up.
Cla-
And, money only goes so far.
Sure, sure, is true.
Look, okay, we started talking about interracial problems, and we're already on political problems. Ah? no, no,no.
Like good, like good Latin talkers
Well, one starts, and beats around the bush, until you get to the point.
yes, yes, is true
One goes up, and goes up, and goes up, and beats around the bush constantly.
yes, is true, yes is true. Well, my husband is Venezuelan, and with all and all, the same, sometimes we have our, that well, but we try to, you know, to find a better way, sometimes,
well, we get upset, I don't know? for anything. And, well, we try to find, right? the solution. right? Sometimes I tell you that,
You told me you lived in North Carolina?
no, I'm in Los Angeles.
Ah, in Los Angeles
In Los Angeles. You're in Arizona. Right?
yes. How is going, to, to, returning to revive the issue, how has it gone with all that over with the part
ok-
sire, that, that Los Angeles and Arizona are the same, they are cities where there are a lot of Hispanics, but I don't know how it's gone with that part.
yes.
eh, of, of, of, the racial aspect
Well, look here, precisely, that drives a lot around here. I think that it's a question of, social regression, eh, social, that there is, in the United States, in general
But, here, even though Los Angeles is a city that really, that has a lot of difference
Hi, I'm Olga, who are you?
Uh, my name is Blanca
Blanca, where are you from Blanca?
From Arizona
Arizona, well, I'm in Texas
Oh, very well, good
Hey, what do you think, what do you think about today's subject?, do you find it interesting?
I find it very interesting, it's just that, uh, that term is, to me, like it was picked from a long time ago, right?, because i think there aren't, uh
uh, they don't exist, it's, it's just one gender, the human gender
That's right
Um, there are several groups of that human gender, but, but the race is really, it's like, it's like someone else said, it sounds like, where's the cattle, where are the little animals?
Yes, i agree with you. That's right, are you married?
Although, yeah, I'm married and precisely
yes
With, with a person from another country
Right
I'm Colombian and my husband is Guatemalan
OK
But, but, we're latinos, and both of us are, uh, human beings
Right, right
Not the color, nor the style of, of your, your eyes, of your physical features, makes you look like another race. You are a human being.
eh, with, with different characteristics. I think.
That's it. yes, yes, yes you're right, I totally agree with you. Well for example.
um
Says that yes, that it's harder to live with another, with one race than another.
yes
Well like, well like you were saying, is that it also depends on, on the couple, because it also depends on both people. how much or how badly they want it.
want the marriage.
Exactly, I was reading a book last night.
right
About raising the kids.
mm
And is that the problem of raising the kids, is not made by society in itself. there are many factors that influence it, but basically the essence is in the couple
In how much they want to give their kids a good life.
sure
yes, like they say they belong to another race, the husband and the wife, well if they want to get ahead in life with their, family, with their home they will get ahead.
sure
Independently of what exist or not.
yes, yes, because the, the education, definitely, like our grandmothers used to say, the education is bred.
Exactly, yes.
Right.  So- So education starts at home in fact,
aha
yes it's, it's a really solid education.  yes, it's pretty strong.  Well, the exterior didn't affect them much, these kids, because their education was very,
very solid.  So, the fact that there are so many kids, on drugs and these things well, maybe it's due to negligence on the part of the parents,
or maybe they're teaching at home wasn't very solid, then.
Very solid, yes.
aha, exactly.
This is true, I think the same.
yes
Definitely.
yes
I think the same thing.
yes, including if you want, a, a good marriage, if you want to raise it well, you as an intelligent person, well you know how, right.
hmm
I, I think that, that, in the, in the couple.  Well, there must always be an agreement.  There must, like, I think that the relationship of a couple.
Is, is shows through its agreements.  The, the problems start when one of the two breaks the agreement.
yes
You know?
yes
So that's where, where the problems start, eh, in the couple and obviously start, start to involve the kids no, imagine.  with a couple with problems, imagine the poor kids, all traumatized.
Yes, there, it's true, that's where all the problems start, and, and many times the ones who pay the, the duck are the kids
Right
Any way, uh, no, it's not ingenuity, because i know many couples that have separated, and have had problems
Uh huh
but they have had very nice homes
Uh huh, yes, that's why, that's why I'm telling you, because
Uh
They used their intelligence in the right way, Do i make myself clear?
Exactly, yes
Because, because it's not so much that we're smart, i mean, but lets see how, it's, how we're using our intelligence
That, yeah, no, it's not so much that we're smart, or that we're white, black, blue or purple
Exactly
IT's the way we, we get a grasp on things, the way in which we  approach or life, at home, our family, our children
That's it, right
It's the, um, it's the love that each of us bring and the effort we put into
yes, yes
everything, everything
Yeah, sure, uh, well, uh, first of all, there's, love, right?, that feeling so, well, so incredible, it moves mountains
Uh huh
Right, and on the other hand, well, the responsibility, i mean, being responsible, and, well, give every thing it's name [place]
Right
Because, well, because many times human beings, for, to do things easier for ourselves, like we kinda disguise situations a little bit
Right
So, no, we're not quite seeing, uh, a hundred percent the point we should
Right
And well, that's also a problem, a terrible problem, because we're not, we're not giving it, paying the necessary interest to certain situations
Yes
That's right
That's true
That you think, yes, I'm sorry, what do you think it's the most important thing to get along?
Uh, trust, definitely, and dialogue
Yes
If there's no trust and dialogue, there's nothing. And with someone with whom you don't talk, you don't know, what are its thoughts, it's wishes and needs
What they think about one situation or the other
True
I don't know, that's what i think
You see, yeah, your... is very accurate, to, lets say, your way of thinking, and i totally agree with you, yeah, it's true, because one things leads to another
To another, yes
Well, because yeah, i, i can be talking a lot with my partner, but, if my partner doesn't trust me, or listens to me, i can assure it's not listening because
well, since it doesn't trust me, well, it's obviously not believing what I'm saying
mm.
So then, the, anyway, ah, from the other side it's the same, I mean, if the husband is, or the couple, let's say, is, trying to give a, to get to know something.
Well, good or not, well, not anymore, not hearing, because well, I don't have confidence, in how I'm going to, how I'm going to take his words seriously.
So then it's true, if it's true, one, one thing leads to another, the, the, let's say the
yes, that's true.
confidence brings dialogue.
mm.
and obviously the dialogue, well, the dialogue generates confidence. So then it's, it's well, it is very interesting, and also, well you need to see how, they say things, you see, because at times
At times we make many errors in meaning in that, at times we don't say things in an adequate format because many times it doesn't matter as much what you say but how you say it.
uh-huh
And so then, there are also, well, many
yes
many undoings, many complications after, then well
yes
It's not easy, since then, it's not easy this, to live with, with someone truly well, I say, obviously well, one not, one doesn't expect, as human beings well, we don't expect to be
eternally happy, of course, because there will be difficult situations and there are going to be problems, but also, the, eh, we need to use our intelligence to resolve these problems in some way,
successfully.
yes, that's true, there is, there is
That's what I believe.
You need to have a little bit of skill and intelligence and of, of malice, as we say in my country, native malice. When one does things and says them and the way in which they say them.
Because it is true, the way you face a matter, the way you answer, you express, even your gestures mean a lot
O yes, absolutely, absolutely, body language has a lot to do. For instance, if you tell a,  if a kid
tells his mother, or, if the mother shows a martyr face, then the son tells her, mom are you sad?
And she says, nodding, no son I am not sad. Her mouth says she is not sad, but her expression, her body language,
is showing that, yes exactly
Says she is
Indicates absolutely the opposite. And all those, ah, contradictory situations are what often traumatizes the children, it confuses them, because
Because they say, well, what's going on? Beacsue obviously the kid feels that his mother is sad, then why does she say she isn't sad when she is
So, there is where confusions start in a child's mind, and that's why there are so many problems with kids
yes
That's it
That is a part of the reality. Anyway, eh, we are out of the subject again. Right now, right now I was talking to another woman, I may be going out of the subject again
yes
the subject, we started talking about politics
Oh
Oh my goodness
Well, not, you see, there is no one hundred percent need to talk about the specified subject. But, well, it is interesting anyway
eh, to stick to it, to stick to it slightly. Because they are daily life subjects, aren't they?
yes, yes, they are subjects that help, they help anyway, they help quite a lot
Yes, because they are subjects that are always current, they never, they never get out of date because, well, for inatance couples will always need
And you see, we, I think you are from Mexico, right?
yes, I'm from Mexico.
Oh, we are from different countries.
yes
And we use, we use different words but, we are on the same line.
That's right, that's what I was saying, no no, there's no difference in the way we wanting and doing things
We all want to have a successful marriage but we here have
Hello?
Hello, yes. who's speaking?
yes. Manuel's speaking from Orlando, Florida, who's speaking?
Okay, I'm Olga, I'm in Texas.
Ah, how is it going Olga?
How are you?
Fine, thanks.
How nice.
Well, so look, eh, we already heard the topic of the day, so eh
yes,
if you want then start telling me what you think
yes, well, that well, I think I think that in reality no no, there's not reason to think that the interracial exist, right? or something like that.
I, I would say that, that
yes.
the different races if, if they get together, well I think that there's no problem because the basic thing is the love, so
is precisely, what will unite them. And that's how the, yes
So
each one is from a different race, well, so then as adults as responsible people as intelligent people well they will already work on their
on, on their partner to achieve the, the proper success. Don't you think?
Correct, well look I agree with you
Hmm.
and it seems to be that if a partner of a different race, well, eh, the two eh, match, and love each other and match and will
create a home and some kids together well this racial factor isn't so decisive, what counts are the values that they want to pass on.
Exact-
And, in fact, for example we, the Hispanics, in its majority, I myself, for example we're interracial, I have, eh, well a white component from the
Europeans, the Spanish component, indigenous from the natives too
yes.
from the blacks who came from that part of the world.
yes.
You know that we too, the Latinos, are interracial.
It's like this.
So I don't see, eh, this factor, this race factor, any problem, always and when they put their part and are consistent in what they're doing, that seems to me, really, a problem
that yeah, it's not racial, but it's cultural, for example, it's the religious factor, this can be a problem
Aha.
and, if they both practice different religions.
Yes.  Hmmm, yes.  so I, I well I also agree with you, I see more problems in this situation with the religions
than in the racial situation, yes
Correct.
yes, it's like this.  And besides, imagine, it's not, it's not as you imagine, and you imagine the kids get close to, eh
this religion
is this much, is not this much you imagine, and you imagine
I would say that there is like that you generate a, how would I say it? a ah
Well, contradictions, no, and
confusion, a confusion yes, is a contradiction and confusion with the kids
yes, yes.
that the kids get really confused because no, no
Of
they don't know
yes.
they don't know what to do.
Exactly, and although is not the topic of the day well that, we can't talk too much at length about that of religion but
Mm.
I've known of cases, I think that you too, of families that
Sure, yes.
that have been torn apart and almost destroyed because they start to practice different religions.
Ah, yes, like that yes, yes, the other day that it was precisely the topic was precisely that, the religion they were asking me that
Ah, I didn't get to that day
no, they were asking if religion ah, that if religions unite or separate, I would say it separates
many times, when it should but not, not always.
for well yes, well look that, that ah I, normally religions tear apart families because look, in one same family, sometimes each one
they have a different religion, I've met families like that.
That's right and then, going back to today's subject, it seems to me that about that, the races always, couples fail
because of external influences, whether her's or his' families.
Mhm.
or, or, the background, for, some kind of intrigue from people that surround them and not because of themselves.
Mm.
that
yes, yes, that's it.
lots of times people from the outside is the one that creates conflicts.
Mhm.
because if the couple got married is because of something, they are were in love, nobody was forcing them, so, sometimes, it's because of other people,
Mm.
other people from outside the couple, that start causing trouble.
yes, well, that's why I'm telling you, the couple should be smart enough and responsible enough as to succeed because, well, yes
as you say, there are lots of factors that are going to influence the case. So, that's where, there's
It's the
they have to be smart
Now, they were saying that the children, well, we do agree on it I don't think, I don't think it's because, if one, lets say that the couple, the couple is
he is black and she's white, it has happened before, one son is white and the other one is black.
Mhm.
so, these were conflicts.  If seems that if they two kids are given the same love, if you provide them the same attention and the, the same
eh, eh, if you give them the same necessities because you will, ah, have conflicts, first it's really nice that they learn to see that
they're the same, despite the, the different color.
Sure.  So, hmm.  Yes, well, I agree with you, because well, there's no reason to see them differently, if they're both kids
And while you treat them the same, they will see
so no
that they're equal, now if you try to treat them differently, there you will have a problem
Sure.  Well yes, yes, yes.
but, but I don't think well if they were conceived in the same marriage, well, why would you treat them differently?
Sure.
This is, eh
Unfortunately this gives a lot, eh, yes, from this, where, that the parents treat differently
that yes, I knew a case of a couple, but
and
the- the same thing happened, he and, the woman, she
Hmm.
was dark skinned and he, the husband was white
Hmm.
one of the kids came out dark, looking like her family, and the others white
yes.  yes.
so she, the treated her the same, and the dad really loved the little dark one too, but his family
Hmm.
loved, didn't love the little dark one as much, they loved the others more
Ah.
like, the grandmother, the aunts, and all that.  So it's, it has to do with what we said, the family is of one of the two starts to sow problems.
yes, man, what a shame, because yes, yes I also saw many, many situations like that and well the poor kids, what fault do they have?
Not at all.
Ah, ma-
Not at all, this, eh, no, eh
Ah, yes.
What else did they indicate in the introduction?  They talked about the couple, about the kids
And after, i- it was nothing more than, that that yes the ki-, that if there are interracial kids and that
ah, well, ah, the other was if you, well one
and that yes
would be disposed, would consider marrying with someone from another race, well in my case yes, I don't have problems with this
Ah, yes.  Well me neither, we- in fact in fact yes, like I told you, if you agree and feel attraction for this other person
well there's no reason to not move forward and try to well, to have something good together, no?  So
Right, yes, because every relationship founded in values doesn't have to bring pleasure, well because
it's like this.
if it were only this factor of couples breaking up then, how, how many of the same race don't get divorced?  But the would have to, to do it, so
Exactly.
yes is because the race factor is only about yes or no, I think.
That's how it is.
There are many, many interracial couples that, that look more solid than others of the same race.
yes, that's true, yes is true.
yes, that is true
yes, then well eh imagine, well like you say if, if the ones of the, the same race divorce then one would have to think why, right?
Exactly.
if, if they are from the same race
Eh, that yes, not always is of the same race, the same social condition, the same religion
but yes.
everything very similar, very coincident, however they can't stand each other and, and as we see now, couples that in six, six months are already getting divorced, or in, or in a year.
yes, yes, yes, that's how it is.
Incredible.
Goodness. And where were you born?
I'm from Colombia.
From Colombia, okay.
And where are you from?
From Mexico, from Chihuahua
From Mexi- And, and you've been a long time, here?
yes, I've been living in the United States for more than thirty years.
AH, no, well it's a lifetime
Ah, yes, it is.  Aha, so, ah, what is the, what's the name that you told me?
Manuel.
Sorry?  Your name, what is it?
Eh, yes, yes, yes, Manuel.
Manuel, Manuel, okay.  yes, well, eh, a little while ago I talked with a Colombian, exactly, and we totally agreed also on a lot of things, so
there we realized, well, you're Mexican, I'm Colombian, and nevertheless we agree on, on many things.  I think so.
And although, although it seemed to me that maybe Latinos, for the same that they said
Hmm.
we aren't all given to fixing on this issue of race, it's not so determinant because we're all mixed.
Well yes.
But, and unfortunately Latin America count more on the social status, you know, it's more the social condition, the social level that you belong to, this counts more sometimes.
yes.  Oh, yes.
But, the race, well, I don't see it as so det- obviously yes there are cases, but not so, it's more that there are prejudices in, in the races
a bit purer, let's say, the, it's unfortunate, well because it's not the idea
yes.  Hmm.  It's like that.
it's not the idea to see this.  And in Texas do you see a lot?
Well yes.
a lot of international couples or not?
Uh, yes, a lot, you see lots of couples, and they look happy, i mean, they don't look different to, i mean, you don't see a couple,
for example, lets say, an Asian person, with an american, for example, an asian man with an American woman
yes
it looks just like a Mexican man and a mexican woman, i mean
Yeah, exactly
right, i can't see a difference, absolutely
No, and look, sometimes geniuses are, for example, look at that famous golf player, Tiger Woods
Oh, yes
son of a, of a Chinese with a, yes, from a chinese with a black, a black woman, and look
Right
he's a genius at that sport. And there are many cases like that
Uh huh
And, and
Yes, it's that, i mean, fortunately, well, human beings have lots of virtues, even though we also have many defects
sure
But, well, that's the, the human being's ability, i mean, yeah like, as a human, well, we're always exposed to making mistakes, but well
but if we're smart we can correct those mistakes
Right, because what must count most for us is
And, right
the mental thing, intelligen-, you have to act with intelligence
Uh huh, exactly
That's what matters first
Yes, sure, yeah, well, yes
Wel-, yes, well
It's
Let's finish, uh, until they give us the ti, ti [beep]
Right, yes
Well, here, uh, I'm living in Florida now, but let's say, you do see interracial marriages, but mostly in the big cities, i lived in New York too
And it's very common there
Right
Here it's a relatively more... city
Um
small, the truth is i haven't seen too many interracial couples
Uh huh
I have seen, well, the, the, the, the, uh, Anglo against the hisp-
Hello, hello.
Hello. Yes. Who are you? I'm Olga.
I'm Alicia, how is it going.
Alicia. Very good, thank you very much. Where are you, Alicia?
I'm in Atlanta, Georgia. And you?
In Atlanta. I live in Texas.
Texas? Ah, how nice. Where in Texas?
In Keller, Texas
Where? Keller?
Keller, Texas. Is very near Fort Worth.
Ah, Keller, Texas.
Pardon?
Keller, Texas. Ah, is that I was trying to place it.
Yes.
Eh my. I was trying to place it because my my
Pardon? Oh, oh, okay. Yes yes yes. Well
my boyfriend
what happens is that eh is like Fort Worth but the area is called
Ah, okay
like I told you. But it really is. Even the zip code is of Fort Worth.
oh ready. everything is fine.
yes, how is the weather like over there?
there is no snow or anything like it.
yes
it is cold, there is wind, and it rains.
Mhm
so how is the weather in texas?
For god´s sake what do you think about today's topic?
It is fun I could be considered to be part of an interracial relationship because my boyfriend is white
In a way I am. But if one wants to Consider purely blacks and whites Between interracional Have done good too. So That We Also find this well say.
because Atlanta is a diverse city. There are many blacks, there are plenty of Asians, there are many Jews, Hispanics ect.
there is much diversity as it is inevitable to happen.
yeah that is truth. I agree with you , the same happens in Dallas in the Forth Worth Area.
Mhm
It is not too big and you can see it.
OK
You see a lot of couples Asians and Americans, Americans and Blacks
Of course.
you see  many  Arabic couples.
yes and many more.
Arabs with with Latin women.
Ah yes really?
Mm. Then well I also really don't see any problem with those unions. Because it's assumed that
Is true.
if a couple gets together, it doesn't matter what race they are. Well, it's assumed that that what unites them is the love, right?
Is true. Yes, is true. And and more than the love also a certain
Yes.
what is it called? ah a a coexistence with the other person. In other words getting along well so to speak, to agree with the same life values also.
Exactly. Sure, aha.
And in that sense
Yes.
sure one can say any race a good Christian, or or be a lunatic or or whatever, I mean.
Exactly.
Then
Yes, exactly, yes. I mean, to be a bad person. You don't have to be of a particular race. The same
Is true
to be a good person well neither. I mean is that there's
Is true.
of everything in all the races. There's
Yes, is true.
good people, there are bad people so then I really don't consider that is is a
problem.
a problematic situation.
Like bad. No, yes, is true. I mean the most complicated thing I think is the marriage with different cultures, more than race, different ethnicity. For example
That is more more complex.
or the religion for example, even money, also.
Also, that also
That one is poor and the other has a lot of money, is also complicated, so to speak.
Well, yes yes. Because the, how can I tell you? society is very, how can I tell you? very cruel.
Ah, sure.
the high society is very cruel right? Like it doesn't
They get him.
don't let just anyone in. Do I explain myself?
Ah, yes. Is also true.
So then that really is hard.
Yes, is true, On top of that the one used to the money is going to be more selfish so to speak and perhaps the other who has not had much money, will perhaps be
um will have bad education regarding the finances. I mean, perhaps would spend too much, for example, I don't know. Then there's a difference in values
complicated.
Yes, that's how it is, aha. Yes, also.
The selfishness.
You know also where I see a real problem?
Ah?
In in is in the academic difference.
Ah, that's true. That's very
Yes, uh, that's a terrible thing, especially when the person with more ah let's say that with more academic ability is the woman. Uh, is a real problem because
Mm. Ah.
the man feels terribly
Sure. Inferior.
rejected and inferior and well
Is true.
there is where. Mm.
I have a sister in Chile, for example that she has been with her boyfriend, let's say three years already, And she went back to the university this year
Hm. Mm.
and since she returned to the university they've had mere problems. He has gotten really unpleasant with her. He tells her unpleasant things because he feels insecure because she's now going to get a
a university title and he doesn't have one. I mean, he's also intelligent and makes good money and all but simply doesn't have a university title. But now that she's getting one
he is being like mean with her. Is like really strange the thing.
Yes, exactly. There there they are very difficult problems to solve because is a made situation. I mean
sure.
Is a situation that well, who's going to take her title away? Well nobody, right?
But of course, exactly.
what´s good is that people learned well.
there are many problems with lack of education, many people have no education.
of course a good education.
but you have to study real life?
of course, that is truth too.
life is a constant learning is a school.
one can be in the same house for forty years and it would be a different person for the nation
a person may or may not leave his room
yes
in forty years you learn things.
yes, it depends on what everyone likes, right? specially in this country. Here everybody can study.
there are economic problems here too,  but not too much as in Latin America.
yes
for instance there is no point of comparison with Europe
here in the united states  we have to overcome
Mhm
loans, scholarships and things like that because they simply have to pay 30 thousand dollars a year
yes
then
education is expensive but there are opportunities to acquire a grant.
oh that´s right the scholarships
Exactly, it is difficult because only those who persevere are successful
the worst is that there is people who do not have the necessary information
of course
they don´t even know where to start
it is good to have associations help, for example here in Atlanta is a Latin American asiciacion
they make all kinds of services, where they help speak English and help you find work
I guess in Texas there are also many of these associations
Mh, yes, there are many ways of help.there is information
there are many ways of information and many people cannot get to it
Mh. Yes, that´s right
it is because they do not have a guide or something to tell people where to get help
of course, people do not even know about these places
Exactly
Mh
YEs, Exactly. hay ignorancia por desconocer que existen estas cosas
of course, there is also some people who care about these places. There is people in the University that doesn´t care about learning they just want to finish the career and work.
they go to school and spend all the money because they are lazy and have no right to be in college
yes because they are occupying the position of other people who would be much better
yes that is the true
that is needed. Yes.
And that, that really is a shame.
Yes, because it's a drain of a drain of, yes. Pardon me?
Ah, they should ask whether you went to university.
Oh, well. Look I I did go but in Mexico.
Ah, good.
To the univers- Yes, I mean but even though what happens is that since I lived many years in El Paso, Texas.
Yeah.
So, El Paso is on the border with with Chihuahua.
Sure.
So I practically I, well I lived in both cities, no? En in both countries.
Sure, it's true.
Yes, then, I was going to university in Mexico but I also had to go school in in El Paso, so
Mhm.
as I tell you because
sure.
Well yes, because I really wanted to learn so well
That's true.
as the saying goes, where there's a will there's a way.
And and what did you study, let's say?
Ah well, I studied eh a business degree.
Ah, yeah, for business, okay
Yes, eh and in fact I had I had my own business in in in Chihuahua.
Oh, how good.
But unfortunately with the nine eleven events
Yes.
That affected us a lot, it looks like not but affected there too.
Yes, it is true, yes. Everything changed, a lot.
Eh Yes, then I had to close the business and I could do something else
Hmm. Of course.
Once I closed the business well I didn´t like to be there anymore and then I came here and I am very happy here in
And you don´t is education in Mexico  even better than in American universities?
in Forth Worth. What happens is than in Mexico it is more demanding.
That is what I found because me too. I had a year at the university in Chile and I have had three years at the university here and
Yes.
They demand  a lot, a lot more in Chile. And is like
Yes, and. Aha. And what happens is that simply simply the the the way of treating students is totally different.
And the way that students treat the teacher
Ah, that too.
here is very different completely.
Yes I know. There's that vibe of let's all be friends and that issue A a little
Mm. For example here in the United States the teacher cannot even speak loud to the student.
Hello.
yes, hello, good evening, How are you?
How is it going? Is Marcela
Marcela, How are you? My name is George, from New York.
Fine. Ah, I'm here in North Carolina.
Ah, okay.
And, is very interesting what they want, of what they want us to talk about because my husband is black and I'm white.
Ah, Really? You are an expert on the subject.
And, we have two kids.
yes.
yes, and we've been together thirty years, so, No, I don't see any problem.
Ah, well. So, it has worked, right?
I don't see any problem.
No
that's me, I don't know, maybe is because we are both. Right? We are both artists, I don't know, I don't see any problem.
yes.
I think that
Mm.
if one thinks that maybe there's a problem, then, one starts to look at everything through those lenses. Or, this happened, and it must be because
because I'm white and he is black. Or, this happened, it must be, understand? And then, you start looking,
yes.
the return.  Besides, this,
yes.
like, ah, so well, we've been living in North Carolina for seventeen  years, but before this, we lived in Los Angeles, in Hollywood.  And there,
yes.  Hmm.
we said there wasn't any prejudice, but yes, there's prejudice.
yes.
We didn't realize, you know?  We, we didn't have the experience of prejudice.
yes.  yes, suddenly, suddenly there are things, at the, the level of nationality, no?  Not only on the level of color.  No?
yes, this is true.
Because, it's true that I've read about many cases, eh, I'll tell you directly, eh, for example, Americans with Arabs, Americans with Chinese, and really, well, it's not so much the color but the, the difference in culture.  Hmm.
yes, I think that you're right, I think that the difference in culture, perhaps, brings more problems
yes.
than this, than color.
simply color.
yes, eh, my husband and I, we're both from the middle class,
yes.  Hmm.
so, we're both from, this,
What nationality is your husband?
Sorry?
Where, where is your husband from?
From Los Angeles
Was he born here?
Yes, yes, born here
But, and, uh, i mean, born, raised
Everything, everything, everything, everything
Oh, well, yeah, maybe that's why, isn't it?, and, are you, you're Chilean, right?
On the other hand, uh, i know, i know about people, i know about people... you have to dry them, I'm sorry, i'm setting the table, we're eating late
Sure, no problem
No, i know about people that has gotten married, whatever, with Arab people,
yes
And has had a lot of trouble
Yeah, i really
Because the culture is so different
Yes, the culture mostly, on the woman's side, well, the submission, that sort of stuff. For example, i had a case now, with a daughter
Uh huh
She's, she has a boyfriend, a, a thug that's, right?, he's not completely arab, well, but you can tell the differences. And i tell her, "keep those things in mind", right?
Uh huh
Because, the way they dress, the way they speak, uh, raise the children, all those things, those differences leave a mark, they live a mark for life, so
to have trouble, uh huh, and, and
yes. But, you know that they more you tell him that, that that will not work, the more he will hold on to her.
Ah, no, no,no. No, no, I don't say it in that way.
Ah, we-
I simply, I talk about it. yes, no, I really don't, I don't get involved in that matter, because, well, I have several marriages, to get myself into my, into my relationships. No?
Aha.
yes, no, really I don't, I don't intervene in that. That's her liberty. yes I don't the topic, hmm,
No, it's that, unfortunately, we're humans. You see? And, the more people are against it, the more we want it.
ah, no, no. No, and0 ah, no, sure, no, that is, no, that I, I know that very well. But, I, no, I have spoken to her, no, i haven't told her, no, don't do that no.
Mhm.
No, it's, it's her own decision. No? But, it's well because, well, maybe they don't know. No?
yes.
They don't know the, the situation. Mhm.
yes, no, it's that, sometimes, eh, also that, there are certain people that because of their culture, they have a lot of pressure from their family, or to be yes v-
if you look at Oriental cultures, the Japanese, specially, that they don't mix with anyone,
yes, they mix very little, no?
so, there was a Japanese person, of Japanese parents, born here,
Mhm.
and, she wants to marry with Westerner of any race.
yes. Mhm.
The Jap-eh, eh, that family, it will be very difficult to open up.
yes.
So, O- o- o- o-
Sure.
Um, so, this is the, this is the, the the the
yes, I think, in any case, that interracial marriages, or- there has to be a very good understanding on both parts, and, and both, talking clearly, well,
so, how the relationship will be managed, no?  if it's a marriages, what will be the parameters of the marriage.  Right?
the same as the people, hmm.
If they will be ruled by one law or another.
and the problem would also be if you have two people who are religious but who are from two different religions.
yes, this is really difficult, I think, to manage.
You know?  If you have people who aren't religious, or only one is religious and the other doesn't care,
Hmm.
so, this isn't a problem.  But, if you have two religious people,
yes.
so, and they are from different religions, ah, forget it.
yes, if they're from opposite poles, but I think that it's very difficult to carry on one of these relationships.
Hmm.  yes.
But, color, the truth, I don't see a big problem.  Today. . . it's true that you see many couples of different color.  Right?  Like you say.
yes, yes.
And, in all ways
yes, I don't think this is it. I think that is, um,
is not a myth.
it has to do with class, class, that's another difference, that also makes a lot of difference.
yes,the education, I think that is very important.
If you have two people of two totally different classes.
mm.
If you have someone of upper class, and someone of a class
Mm.
lower, there's
Mm.
there's a total conflict.
yes.
Because, I don't care what country one is, nor how open minded one is,
Mm.
we, unconsciously, are governed by the sense of class.
yes,
Understand? We are all trying to, maybe we don't have much money, but we are trying to dress, trying to appear
Mm.
like we have it.
Mm.
Do you understand me?
Uh huh
So, that's what i know, that it's important to society
Yes
Yes, and so there's, uh, the conflict, when you have
But you, let's see, i have a question for you, well, you have a real case
Uh huh
Lets say there wasn't, there were no religious matter in any of both sides
No, because
so, well, so rooted
no, because i, i was raised as a catholic, but I'm not a religious person that goes to church and all that
it's different, yeah, oh, OK
And he was raised as a protestant, but he's also not a [...] person
And, the children, how are you raising the children?
Well, it turns out that through our lives, we stumbled against Hindi philosophies
Um, yeah
And so, we followed those philosophies, even though we don't have a church or a place to go, or any of that, you see?
Um, yes
But we follow those, uh, philosophies and we pass them on to our children, we didn't raise them
Oh, ok, um
the, it just so happens that both kids are baptized
Yes
But, for
legal matters, uh
we did it for a question of tradition
yeah
And we did it for, uh, the benefit and happiness of our family
Um, yeah, yes
Do you understand?, but no
Yeah, but there was no disagreement or anything like that
No, no, now, if he would suddenly start telling me that he has to go to, he wants to go to, to the, to the church or something, then, i don't know
yes
i don't know, I'm not gonna stop him. But if he starts bringing certain jewish-christian philosophies to our house, about which i don't
i don't adhere to, do you understand?
yes
then, i don't know what would happen, but
Um, yeah, uh um
That's something i don't, i don't, i don't think that
Yeah
that is going to happen, you see?, none of us are suddenly going to
I mean, definitely, you opted for a third religion and the whole world is okay with that, and what about the?
yes, no? We are bohemians, I mean, that's our religion, we are bohemians.
oh I see, but how about food, the way you dress, the way you relate to other people, I mean, did you have lots of things in common at the beginning?
or were there lots of differences?
No, oh, you know what? What do I know, I mean, I'm from Argentina and and and, the Argentinian culture is very European.
Yes yes mhm.
Do you understand? So, there's no difference I don't know about other countries because I have never been to any other Latin American countries.
Mm, I see, yes.
but I realized that, when I first got here to the United States I was nine years old and we arrived to New York.
yes.
And they'd say as they do in Buenos Aires.
Mhm.
Why did we come here? Do you understand? This,
mm
so, oh, what do I  know? I think I've learned how to cook different dishes because his grandma raised him and she'd cook certain dishes, certain dishes
Mm
so, that he liked. So, I got worried and I started cooking because my dad likes to cook so I got worried and I tried to learn
Sure.
how to make those dishes.
Mm, I see, yes, of course.
But, mm, and I do it to, to give him a little taste of home. You understand me?
Sure, sure, yes.
Mm, but is not a, a big, a big change. I mean, he eats everything I cook him.
Mm. yes. There's no problem
yes. No,no
Ah, no, well I congratulate you both. Is interesting, right, is interesting. right? well, it gives you the chance to talk. Because, I've seen many couple
but really I've never talked with a couple about this topic. Right?
yes.
couples that, are couples that are different. Mm.
But, also, maybe, it has to do with the fact that we are both artists, we are both middle class.
yes,
you know? Perhaps, if we were working people, um, eh, people that, see? that worked in factories, that, that
Mm.
eh, perhaps there would be, I don't know? more difference. I don't know. But, we have um, the same education levels.
yes,
Then, we have many things in common.
yes, I think that, I think that in this the education is very important. I think that, more than the class and all that, well, the
the class goes hand in hand with the education, almost always. Right?
yes.
But, I think that the education is very important. It hurts me a lot seeing people that are racist, that, for example, I know someone who has a grandchild who is black. right? And, the man
Mm. yes,
doesn't accept for the girl to get near him. The guy is ignorant. Aha, how is it possible person for the color
yes.
doesn't let his granddaughter caress him and kiss him and fuss over him? No.
Mm.
It disgusts him, right? And, great lack, that is great
how are you what's up, and you fine, yes, yes, I live in New York
yes hello, how are you, my name's Maria, what's your name?  I didn't hear very well, hey, what's up, how are you, where are you from?
hey and where are you from, I live in New York, I'm from Panama.
hey I also live in New York but Mexican, yes, how long have you been here?  How long have you spent here?
oh, yes, what's up, how do you say, oh, I've been here for about fifteen, eighteen, sixteen years yeah
ah that's a lot, it's sorry, I'm in New York in
how do you like the topic?  and you what time, what time do you have?
two years but I lived in Boston before and so I've been about seven years in the United States in total, not so long
ahhh yes, I'm you're dad then
listen and what do you think about the topic
well I think it's a good topic, it's a really delicate topic but yes, when they told me marriage I said, well, it's an easy question
aha
because really marriage is something that's indicated by God and really all us human beings should look for the way to not only get together as a couple but really
to get to this commitment, I don't know how to say, to get to an extreme of compromise, ah, a couple you understand because lately what's happening is that a couple breaks up
and suddenly you don't lie him and you leave him and look for another, you know, and when there's marriage it's different, it's more serious, an issue
sure, sure, a compromise, no
like more biblical an issue more, you understand as a compromise, exactly, and ahh I think that when the first marriage between Adam and Eve because God blessed them I think that what happens when they get married, what a marriage does is
that the priest, the minister gives the benediction before all the witnesses and takes the couple and from there forward
hmm, interracial
you know and from there forward they're a couple well with interracial marriage, I tell you it's becoming a more delicate topic in the sen- wait a moment, in the sense that, that
there are races different from ours, for instance maybe not Hispanic and white or Hispanic and black, but Hispanic and
Arabic, you know, and it's not only the, the
aha, but maybe it is, I mean, the difficulty is more in the culture difference rather than in the race difference
aha, yes, that's why when they say different race it means also different culture, because actually if, for instance, a Mexican marries an Argentinean it's different, it's the same
right? it's the same race but different cultures, and that's where the shock is, you know, for instance if you tell me about
yes
and Arab with a Christian, then there is some, ahh, Arab with Hispanic that is a shock not only because of
yes
culture and race, but also because of the religion, the Arab is Muslim and the Hispanic is Catholic, Christian, so when sons come there is a conflict
when the Arab wants the sons to be Muslims and go to the Mosque
Of course
and Hispanic wants the sons to go to a Catholic church and be baptised as Catholics, then we enter a, a plane
different, because if you have experienced that of a relation with another race
different one, a very delicate situation, you know what I mean
have you had any relation with somebody of another race? I said, have you had any relation with somebody of another race?
what you say? yes, I had once a relation with a Jewish girl, so
aha
eh, there was this question about, ah, you know, not really, not really the race and habits are the same, but the
those people, yes, of course
but wait a minute, please, excuse, one second, but then, didn't you say you had a relation with a person
yes, no problem
of another race
yes, I had  a relation with a girl, and she was Jewish, and I
and, yes, it was different
yes, it was different, we had different habits also, let me tell you, not only that, actually I had two relations with
aha
but look, I had a relation with a girl who was a girl but her relation as far as religion is the same, the same catholic religion
and her habits were different, her culture was different, but there was not really a big big
aha aha
difference, the big difference is religion in my opinion, religion makes a very big difference
aha
you know, you get used to culture and so, one day, imagine you  married a, a, I don't know
one day you eat the food of his country and the other the food of your country, ehh, you learn the language
ehh, you can learn a lot of things, but, converting to his religion or him converting to yours,
aha
that's the problem, I think that in this sense, religion makes a, makes a, like I told you, makes a big
it is bridge hard to cross, because it is a question, a tie you don't want to break, that is the question, you just don't want to
I have never had a relation with somebody of another religion but I guess it must be very difficult
yes, yes, aha, for instance
because, yes, the believes are absolutely different
for example, to save your Saturday for that person, if you are free and you want to do and undo, if you want to do
aha
lots of things during the Saturday, do you understand, this person, she doesn't save the Saturday so they go out on Sundays but Sundays to you are to attend church and to here, it's not, so
yes, yes, yes.
I'm telling you, each activity in life can lead you to, you can stand it, really, the food, traditions
yes
but when it's something interracial or religious, I think that it's a huge problem, the same
the same racist, oh, the same, you know, the same subject about race that, I've seen a white person married to Hispanics and they get along fine because they share the same religion.
yes, yes
my same beliefs but I'm telling you, when they have a different religion, then it becomes much more stronger than religion itself, that
yes, m, yes
that the race, I've no experience with other races, have you had any experiences with other races? Have you had any experience with a different race than your own?
I'm sorry, no I haven't, I'm sorry, no, my relationships have always been with
yes, you haven't had any relationship with a different race, aha
with Catholic people, I'm white and white people, but I believe that's because I was raised around white or brunette people but for some reason
I don't know, I've always been attracted to white people so, I realized it when I had to talk to someone
it's true, oh yes, I
about I mean, about this same subject aha, I then realized that I've always dated white people, I don't know, I mean, I do have friends from other races, other countries and other races and all of that but I've only dated white people, aha
there are, there are, so if you saw me, I'm brunette so
my brother is a brunette, my mom is a brunette but I've always dated white people
yes, well, how old are you?
I am twenty-five, I'm still young
oh, you are young already, maybe you will change your
yes, I'm open to anything, the only thing I feel like could stop me would be, like you say, someone like
yes, actually
going with a Muslim who is very stuck in his religion I think it has to be very difficult, right? the same with a Jewish who is very Jewish, I don't know if I could
yes,eh, it is also related to
Good evening
Hi, my name is Ramón, from Los Angeles
Ramon, my name is Carlos, from Houston, Texas
From what?
yes, Texas
Oh, Houston, oh, very well. I have spoken with you, right?, or
Yes, i think so
Yes
And, what's today's subject?
Well, well, oh, the subject is marriage, yes
Yes, that's it
Oh
What do you think?
Well, I'm not, uh, married now, and, uh, uh, but i have lots of, uh, like eight and three years relationships, etc
But, uh, I've never been married
Where are you originally from?
Uh, los Angeles
Los Angeles?, uh, uh, your
Yes
Uh, your Hispanic nationality, from what country?
From from Mexico.
Mexico?
yes.
And, eh is, your relationships more with Hispanic people or people or ah or?
There's a eh a eh mix it depends what stage in my life. Ah, there isn't any particularly.
Okay and What do you think then of interracial marriage?
Well I think is ah yes ah I think is that ah here in this area in Los Angeles is that like fifty percent of the people that live here
weren't born here.
Really?
yes. And and there's a, there's interracial marriages and that um but there's social pressure that is not um eh is not like something good.
on behalf of the people here and like in
Well yes?
generally in the United States Uh. But perhaps when I um like was seventeen years old ah, is different, is very is not  uh
like uh is not something bad in relation to when I was seventeen years old, socially different.
How old are you now?
ah, fifty eight years old.
Okay Then, ah well for me. I think there's no for me, I don't  think is a big deal
Uh uh.
is that maybe it doesn't matter, we are already, at a point where society accepts that, probably accepts
Mm.
in a large extent the interracial marriage. Oh, of course it all depends of what place one is in eh there are some ah some places some
towns where well is more affected than others. That if one has a relationship eh that is well of Hispanic well
Mm.
I don't think that difference is that much.
yes, do you think there's a lot of uh
that if one person
There are a lot of marriages in Houston oh I lived in San Antonio once.
in other words is living in Houston, I mean the great majority of the population here is Hispanic
yes.
And, well is
So there are many interracial marriages between the blacks and the Asians, with the Hispanics?
eh well I mean mostly, mostly whites. But I don't know I don't know how much it is with blacks or Asians with the Hispanics.
yes.
Eh, obviously I mean blacks and Asians are a minority here in Houston in comparison to whites and eh
yes.
Hispanics
Mm.
Then, that it wouldn't be, is not that easy eh finding a relationship as far as that. But. Now if it's independently of that, whether is white and Hispanic, white
black white, Asian
Mm.
or any other combination here I have never seen that it is something bad
Oh.
Have you seen someone who has
Well it is eh
That has
yes it is interesting because here there are there are pressures, social limitations here in Los Angeles and a person with an interracial marriage um, maybe um
But eh it is more, it depends of the social situation, for example in my work when I work with a union eh, the union is like
the members are like a thirty five percent Hispanics . And, probably, forty percent are blacks and thirty or twenty are whites and the rest are Asians.
okay?
And in this situation, Um. When there are meetings there are problems, there is tension uh but there are but the marriages uh interracial for example in union there are
there is a like an attitude to free but there are people that do not have the attitude to free for the interracial marriages.
yes. well, according too, that it also depends a lot in so to me well
Hmm
I don´t. I do not find I do find that, The Hispanic have found themselves in a point of not being so much different in the fact that if a person wants to
eh, marry a person who is
Uh uh.
for example, there are there are other races for example that
Are you, are you married now?
No. I am single.
Oh
Oh, well then. To me, I mean, I've always been attracted to people, oh to white people.
Mm.
in a way that for me, ever since I was little I always was attracted to white people, oh, so
And then, I mean, there was never a problem with my family for that.
yes.
Oh, again, I mean, in Puerto Rico oh there are all types of races. Oh, in Puerto Rico, all the Puerto Ricans.  Puerto Ricans can have a
well, we have whites, Hispanics, black people.
Yes, but oh Puerto Rico and like, oh, there are all types of races and we have people that have oh, like a, oh
it's similar to Europe, since the
Exactly.
white skin is more in favor than the ones whose roots are from Africa.
I mean, we have all types not one is bigger than the other, so if you are attracted to whites, well, it has to be a difference too between
whites, whites Puerto Ricans and
yes.
so, Americans as is.
Mm.
It's just an idea I don't think that, oh, that's a huge difference for the worse, I mean, now that we are so Americanized.
No.
Oh., I now see that I find that other Latin American countries, oh
yes.
yes they have that discrimination to certain point.
yes.
the fact that someone that you cannot go out with that person because she is Anglophone. Is like it is not accepted.
yes.
Eh, even so I think that it is more uh more difficult for people from Asian origin.
Uh uh.
And it makes to certain point eh for blacks um. I don´t know how true is it.
Yes, Well, And do you think there is a racial problem in the society? Do you think there is prejudice for different groups?
Do you think there is a racial problem in the United States?
No. I don´t think so. It has changed a lot. In, I only
Hmm.
I moved here to Houston about five and a half year.
yes. And how old are you?
Eh and in this past. And in the time, pardon me?
How old are you?
twenty eight.
twenty eight.
And eh I have been here for five years, almost six years and the time I have been here never, I have never have problems in relationship with race so
but again so in in Houston the, I think that now, we are in the fifty one percent or something like that
That that there are more Hispanics.
yes.
in Houston compared to any other race.
Hmm. Aha.
Even the whites. So it is not difficult to find the fact that there is not so much discrimination. Um against Hispanic.
Hmm.
And, well so as I told you.
So Do you think that society in Houston in Houston area is uh there is not so much racism?
Uh. there is a little
Hmm.
But I don´t think that it is, no. When you come, To, to relationships. So
Oh.
in in everyday, you can go out.
Hmm.
and I have found a person. eh, white. Is going out with, is holding hands with an Hispanic or a black person and it is not a problem at all, so it is not.
Uh uh.
something like. here it is going to be seen. as something bad
yes, Hmm. Well here in Los Angeles, the neighborhoods are segregated here and most of the Hispanic live in the west of Los Angeles and the blacks on the south of central Los Angeles
uh, there are there are neighborhoods that are, ah, there is integration ah, but there are parts of Los Angeles that are ah, without a question segregated.
Well, is like here so Uh, many uh there are here many neighborhoods that
Yes?
most are Hispanic, most are blacks, most are Asians.
Yes.
But one like that so independently of the race segregation
Uh uh.
no the fact that a person could be in an intimate relationship with a person from another race
¡Hi!
¡Hi!, Aurelio here, from Washington DC
Hi, Mayra, ni-, uh, nice to meet you, I'm here in Philadelphia
Oh, what's up?, what' your name?
Close, Mayra
Mayra, great, nice to meet you.
Yeah, likewise
Hey, today's subject is a, uh, very profound subject, so, you  needs more than twelve minutes to discuss it
uh huh, yeah, about, yeah, the
Go figure
Right?, we're gonna run out of time right away
Yes
Yes
and, what do you think, what do you think about religion?
Oh, the truth is that
Hey, Mayra, Mayra, i can barely hear you, ¡Hello!
OK
Now
Ok, so, uh, but i have never liked too much what religions do, because otherwise, i think that it
gives good things, it gives moral, hope, whatever you want, but, yeah, i don't know, it marginalizes a lot of other people, for example, it excludes many others
Sure
people, and I don't understand why it has to be like that. And, I mean I think that the problem of religion has existed for many years and will probably continue
existing for a very long time.
Sure, unfortunately that will never end
Then yes, And I don't know And for example the Buddhist one is the one I like the most. Because it doesn't exclude any other, I mean it just
explains in terms of the Buddhist religion, how the others also are not good people, if that's what it's about. And is like that, like, well
Sure.
yes is very different to the Catholic one for example. That also if you are gay you are completely out, no, of the church
Sure, yes. They are very, how, how could we say it, like very Well yes, racist well because they exclude certain groups and those type of things
yes, they discriminate a lot.
yes, they discriminate, exactly. They are discriminatory. yes, unfortunately.
Uh
I tell you something, I've never believed in any of those in any religion. I consider myself totally without any type of of
eh of religiousness I think that the religions is always like they bring out the best and the worst in the individuals; each person
yes.
uh Eh and, well unfortunately the worst, is the worst of the, of the human being. The discrimination, the racism, murder,
Uh.
persecution that's a horrible thing. Just in the name of God and the worst thing of all is that in all those religions
none says that you should persecute another person. Because because that person is of another religion or of another way of thinking or another skin color. You understand me?
yes, they feel.
it is what is happening between Muslim and Jews. That is horrible How?
where are you from?
I was born in Venezuela
okay
where are you from?
I am from Mexico
You are from Mexico Okay.
Uhm, do the majority of people are catholic there?
the majority of people are Christians.
okay
the majority, are like that I imagine in Mexico is the same thing.
yes
I was raised catholic. My parents raised me to be catholic. I was baptized and everything butI don´t like  nothing of that sort of things
I think that religion is a thing is a fact of life, that people should have as an adult. understand?
really?
I think teaching a child religion is practically brainwashing him.
Uhm
It is simply nothing more to see what they have done throughout history, to see that it is simply brainwashing.
yes, of course.
Yes. that's one of the worst things that religion brings human models, the best thing is art, you understand this study and all literature.
it has inspired. But, I mean, it is like it is very difficult to get the middle point, you know what I mean? something where
people accept each other, you know what I mean? tolerance is difficult
yes, that's right. That's true, it is very extremist
It is hard
If they could
That's why right now all this that is happening with terrorism, they take the name of God
uhm
to commit murderers, you know what I mean? in the name of God, and that is terrible. Understand? if you name
eh, God, Allah as they call him. It is not said in the Islam or the Koran that they have to go kill other people
people, in the name of God, to sacrifice people, understand?
yes
it is a terrible thing. You know
But precisely
You know, how? Hello! Hello! Hello, hello, hello! Hello! Hello!
The communication cut off. Mary, I hardly hear you, actually I don't hear you at all. We will talk later, Bye
Hello?
Hello, Hello, how are you?, how are you?
Fine, who am i talking to?
You're talking to Vicente, in New York
New York, I'm Paulina
Yes, and you?
And i live in Athens, Georgia
In Athens, Georgia, right, originally, where are you from originally?
From Chile
From Chile, oh, i have a person, I'm originally from Panama
And, and you?, oh yes
From Panamaand i have a person that lives at mi house, here where i live, that is from Chile, i live in a building, uh, in a leasing building
What's that?
Uh, i, I'm saying i live in a building, in a big house of apartments, of apartments
Right, and you don't know any Chileans do you?
No, there's one, there's one that lives here, he's from Chile, a lady that's from Chile, i don't remember her name but I've spoken to her a lot of times
Oh
she, she, she's from Chile
right
but, i think that, uh, she's a little bit crazy
oh yes
yes yes, they are calling me from Chile and stuff, well like, like most of the Hispanics are always talking about something, that's something that I don't really understand of the Hispanics that come here to the United Stat4es, they speak as if they had already traveled
to a paradise, if they had arrived to paradise, the others do it too
Nostalgic yes
the blacks that come from the Caribbean do it too, they talk as if they had come to the United States' paradise.
yes oh yes
do you understand? and I most of the people that do that are quite poor, They want to, want to, they want to tell other people that they live here as kings, you know?
and and the most reasonable thing to do, for the educated ones, it's to not, not talk, don't say those things.
oh yes
No, it is different, yes because
How long have you been here in the United States?
I've lived here for over forty years, over forty years
How old were you? How old were you, do you remember?
I was about ten years old, twelve years old.
No, so you don't miss your country.
But it's like, no, I don't, I like my country but I know how the people talks
yes but ten, ten years, you don't really know what it's like
No, a few days, two three years, I don't know much but I cousins that are here,
what a country is
and when I was a child, right, when I was a child, three years, four, five seven years old I'd send him to Panama, to a Latin country, he likes it because they can run all over the place and they have a good, you know
Every thing, but when they reach the teenager age right the age of fifteen and thirteen and you make a request, they begin to complain of everything, this country is poor does not have this, does not have this and complain when they come back here instead of.
that that country does not have nothing, there, there there is not this, there is not, there is not hot water. The bathroom is not pretty and this, this, this they complain of all, see it
ah, yes
because, they see different Do you understand me?
Well it depends where you send them.
They ah, yes, yes
it depends from where you send them
yes, yes, yes, but when they come back to other country, they hmm much more poor that the United States, that is a reality. That is a reality, but we do not see it when we are
well
older, that pretending that all
Or, or, or you move like in my case to study. because you can pay an study here.
aha
And after that you stay here because you marry an American. no, not because you are in a bad situation in you own country.
Oh, not only, not only No,not only, but there are, there are more, more educated and the most refined you are the most you appreciate the United States.
The least refined you are, the least you know the difference between you country and , the United States the richest country in the world, see it
And nobody loose it, when I come back to panama, I come back to Panama and go to the Hospital to visit sick people.
waiting for their medication, sometimes waiting for medication sometimes given to them by the United States for free. That is a thing, I would not like to be in that situation, if I were in Panama, I don´t
I would not want to go to a hospital, I would come back to the United States immediately. because, because what they have there, what I see, the machines and all the life support
and all that stuff, it does not exist in countries in the
No, of course that not, but it does not means that those countries do not have its beauties
In the hospitals. Although it is somehow beautiful, but beauty is not enough, beauty is not, and when I say beauty I mean the region
you see, but I must pay attention, on how to live and live thebe st I acn, you know what I mean? that's why, that's why when
Well, every person has his own priorities
yes, yes, no, it's different, that's true. And the truth is that a lot of people don't want to face it, I have gone back to Panama, eh, I have gone to
I see the palms, but all those thing that people in general, specially the poor ones, they are fed with politics. And the rich people, the rich, the rich people, come to the United States, the rich ones come to the United States
No, no, I don't agree, because if you, if you are alright in your own country, first of all you just don't leave
No,no, the most rich and powerful come to the United States from everywhere
You don't leave the country
It is an international thing, rich people and powerful people. That's international, while poor people don't know a thing, they say such stupid things that sometimes you can't help laughing
well, they, well, they miss their culture
Or the, 'guineo', 'guineos' and bananas in Ecuador, The banasa and the plantains and all that, it's the same all over Central America
But that's life, you see, we shouldn't be talking about this, we should be talking about marriage, and, and religion, right?
yes
We are supposed to talk about religion
You are not religious, are you?
oh, I am religious, in, in, Christ, I am, I am religious, yes, I am very religious, I am
No, yes, yes, 'in my own way', I've heard that quite a lot, yes
no, no, but the lifestyle, the lifestyle, if you live
oh yes
if you live in a religious way, that, that's quite different from living, from going to church every Sunday, and acting, and acting bad afterwards, you know what I mean?
That is very different, my way of living, I live a way,
Ah yes, And how is your way of living?
logical and, and smart, look, I, I
Laughing at the people.
no, no, look, that, look, my grandfather, see, I the name of my grandfather and grandmother. My grandmother would go to church all the time see, and my grandfather never ever I have seen that he would go to church my grandfather never.
What church did they go to.
And if, and if God comes, God comes here right now right, who do you think that God will get to take to heaven before anyone else, my grandfather?
Because that man never says anything bad of any person he gives to eat to any other person he lives a life is a life that, that you, is a life, How do you say it? a correct life I don't know how you say the word in Spanish
But in English is the word one that lives right Is much more religious that a person that talks about it.
No, I don't agree it depends on the religion.
understand? There are, are people that talk about it but don't live it.
yes, yes
You understand me living living means that if I'm here see
No, there's of everything, there's of everything,
And you are a Muslim, you are a priest or whatever you are because I live right I respect you as a person and I say right things and
That makes me more powerful than one that only talks about their religion and talks it and practices bad things and say bad things about another person
No, no yes I agree, but a person that also listens to the rest also. that has religion or not.
like that, yes, yes I hear like that yes I also see it, because the thing is that here in New York right
aha
In New York, everybody in New York is something nice about New York, when I leave my house. I see from Peru, Ecuador, from all parts, see
And if I want to eat food from any other country, from Brazil, I want to eat meat the Argentinean way, I have it near, Ecuador, from wherever
and the thing is that when you can live with all the people, and get along, that's the most important, as well as religion
here in New York there are all kind of religions. And when you are, a person, right?
just, a just person, you say just?
just, just, whatever. Just, just, and not only just but a person who respects everybody, right? and goes, good morning how are you I don't mind what is your religion
right, just, that's the word
I won't say that's bad, it is good, living this way. That to me, is more religious
Than talking, I know of people who go to the church, and when they are in the church they start talking bad, and want to do bad things, and they go to the church every Sunday, you know what I mean?
Other people don't go to church but they live, uf, they live so honourably and so, and you can see it right now, a lot of parents and
how you call it? the people, the people of
the priests
The priests, who preach that living honourably is much more important than just the religion. There was one, that's all I know, one gringo in California
Shula, shula whate- Sholo
one, what?
Shuler, Shuler, that's the name, Shuler, he appears every Sunday on the TV, right? and that man never talks about God, no, no, he doesn't talk about God much, you know what I mean?
But he talks about living honourably. Inspiration, you know what I mean
Well, that's what it's all about, religion, excuse me
To me, to me
Let me speak a little bit also, I think that religion
yes aha
that teach to live correctly, it is a religion worth to follow, a religion that is based in preach and not practice, as you are saying, then it is worthless,but I do not agree that you should not be religious at all,
aha No, exactly, no, you don´t have to be religious because eh, for for
I am not telling that religion will help you if you live the principles taught by it.
yes,
if you don´t live it, it is worthless.
Well the it is a different kind of a religion, it is like when I remember once I was watching a movie and a man, a man was doing things
that he, he was acting like a priest or something like that, he was a priest but he was not. And then one of the priests a so priest a very priest and well and your religion, acts like a christian person.
or a person from a religion do you understand me.
hmm
they are telling people that he is corrupted, you don´t act like a person with a religion or a person of eh, eh, spiritual no then he is telling to me I don´t care what is your religion, but you are not acting like a moral person.
understand it
hmm
And he was correct, he was not a priest, he was acting like a priest to. steal and stuff like that, but the priest who were very intelligent told him that
I do not care which one is your religion, but you are not acting like a person of, spirit and a person that, lives correctly and you are talking and I don´t care which religion is your religion.
But I say that the way you act and stuff and I have always look that do you understand me. the religion as they said, they said in the question the assigned to us
that if religion separates, separates us or help us, I don´t know, that was what they told
yes something like that
Something like that, that if it separates, because many people has died because of religion
yes
many people, have killed for religion, I don´t know if you remember, when I went to school in Panama And I was talking when the conquers , the conquers come to
yes in the name of religion the people do atrocities
yes they were killing many people because they would ask you if you believed in God and the Indians believed in God a lot but, they called him a different name
and the, the Indians were more religious than the conquistadors. but the conquistadors, would kill them because if they didn't say it they wanted, the God of the Christian.
the Catholic, but the Indian didn't know that type of religion But they thought that a God existed and all that, but they had a name in, in the
language of theirs, you understand me, and the conquistadors
yes, I, I think that religion is good when one lives the principles it teaches.
exactly.
of how people see you, but I find that if there wasn't any religion at all, eh, it wouldn't be too good either, because the people wouldn't be afraid of anything and wouldn't be governed by any good principle, so.
Good morning. Hello, I'm Marco
yes hello I'm Mariza from Philadelphia
Hello I'm also in Philadelphia
well it's very very cold,
ah, yes, I mean, we are definitely in the same city,
ah, yes well, today's topic of religion
religion
and it asked it it was, I think that it was eh, that if it united or separated the people something like that
yes, eh, basically, eh, openly, and you, eh, practice?
well I'm from my family, I'm Spanish and in my family they are all Catholics and, although I, they baptized me and did the communion and got married by the church
but really I don't go to, I don't go to church nor do I practice, let's say that is eh I believe but I don't practice it, let's say
okay, and is there basically, is there any reason in particular why you don't, or simply, or eh, what's called life, there's no time?
well ah, first there's no time, because I have a little girl and then besides is that mm, I don't know, before I would go more often but there comes a moment in which everything is the same and I think that one to
that the belief that one carries inside and I like let's say, to do let's say that I don't know, that going to church is like for older people, for people that
that are more used- that are more traditional and
have time,
is, let's say is, a, is optional for me, I don't think that God is going to punish me because I don't go to church, I don't know I
is not necessary like to learn there, what it's about and that
okay
um
no is that is, eh, tends to always be the same, always
yes, I, eh, I grew up in, in Paraguay
aha
and, there also Catholic eh, I always got baptized there's - I was born in the United States, I got baptized here and over there I had my first communion
aha
it was something that I remember that the, the confession of the first communion eh was with a fantastic priest eh like that a- friend and I remember that what I had like that  simply confessed that
mm the truth is that I didn't believe so much and, the way in which he told me that is
mm
perfectly normal, there's no hurry, there's nobody who will tell you, nobody can correctly tell you you're wrong or that it's a mistake or
because is, is like that it is that it will come, it will come to you, if you are going to believe, you will believe so, is as simple as that,
to me it seems fantastic the systems the way he put it
mm
eh, I now live with, she's not yet my wife, we are, eh we are engaged
mm
eh, we live together and, eh, she has a five year old kid from a, from a previous marriage the famous marriage of someone who got pregnant, the family so Catholic
aha
then the obligation of getting married
yes like the same thing happened to my mom, yes
exactly, and mine too, eh, that now they
aha
they are not together anymore
and mine neither,yes, ah
eh, exactly, right? and, but they, my parents stayed together for, until, until, yes exactly
yes, for the kids, sure, yes, yes, yes
and, for obligation, and
aha
basically I'm now living, I'm according to the church this would be something terrible on all aspects, of her divorce, that she's living with me in a
in a house and we are not married and the baby also, we had tried we are moral people we are- that's one thing that to me seemed, eh
the church, I remember that, I saw myself in a religion that a friend in, in Paraguay was of the Bajai and the Bajai basically believes that the new, the nine religions - the nine
major religions of the world are in reality the same God
mm
because, eh, seeing correctly, if you see any religion, what do they teach? you have to be respectful, you have to respect life, you have to that the, the other people, you have to be good with yourself, not kill, not steal
mm
no, the rules are basically the same except sure, the appearance of God of each one has a different appearance depending of how, how one looks
and, that I think, I also think an, an interesting way of seeing things, eh we tried a couple of we saw that the, the church
yes, especially the Catholic church, the eh way that they treat the problems of the homosexuals, for example
aha
eh, we have a, regrettably a few months ago an uncle of my girlfriend died, eh he was homosexual but he was, he was always very religious, very religious
Roman Catholic also sure, which basically meant that he self condemned
mm
he was a homosexual and he hadn0t, he hadn't, he tried, we tried to do exercise and this and that
he tried to find a way to stop being homosexual, but, he just couldn't do it and it seems terrible to me, for some people and now for example, to listen to the church say things like
for example, to say, for example, the idea of, that no sex, no, no, one shouldn't have sex before getting married
aha
that never, never in past centuries did that happened in reality
exactly
it is not respected, so, everybody is, technically
living in sin, no?
we are sinners
aha, yes, yes, mhm
everyday, so, how is it that you can respect yourself? How can you respect the others? is it like
oh, we are all sinners, we are all going to hell,
yes, all of us, exactly, yes
the, I'd like to, I also remember when I used to go to church and to, did the
isn't the power to forgive others, something from God? Is it forgiveness something that we all should also be trying to achieve?
we should be able to forgive our enemies
mm
oh, but if one is a homosexual, lets say, or homosexual, or if his marriage didn't work, and nos, it seems to me, it seems to me
I believe that religion is something, it was necessary back in the day when there was the need of uniting people, it was very important then because there were lots of problems in the world
and it worked perfectly, of course, Catholics, Roman Catholics decided to go to war to try to eliminate other religions because, suddenly, each God
that, every God is different, eh omnipotent, eh but, no one recognize neither of them then, basically the Catholic,  for example, believe that, perhaps means that Catholics believe that
eh, how many how many in the world, most of this planet is condemned because they grew up in families who are not Roman Catholics in that case they are not baptized
then all the creatures that died in them in the tsunami perhaps all of them went to the limbo or to hell because they were not baptized?
eh, it looks to me something, it looks to me a, it looks to me something barbarian eh, something, something of, something of the barbarians, eh
hmm
to think that way
it is that religion should be something lets say of, of each person, something spiritual for each one, not to put a, some rules and tell you to do this or you cannot do this and that, and it is present between in, in
a part of life so important because, today, I know very few, very few people
yes
really nobody is perfect and no one has, broken a commandment or do not, live a perfect life to to, to go to heaven lets say, then
not only of, it is not that, it is not only that, that have not eh, eh committed a sin, but every day
exactly,
eh, it is eh, it is not a
it is impossible
it is not even,is not even, well I am not so, saint, no, no that, eh I am directly the, the devil in,  in person practically for
the kind of things I do that are things that all do, it looks to me as an example, this war against, the Middle East
hmm
a thing against Muslims I have known people, I knew people when I was young, eh, Muslims, eh, they are people, like any other people
hmm
eh, they believe in a God that now to me it looks like, a ridiculous god that to me it looks like our God, I say our because I am from a Catholic family
our God is also something ridiculous each one is, it looks like a fairy tale , of creatures
hmm
and if you see the way people act every day it is obvious to me that all truly believe that it is not more than a fairy tale
aha, yes
because it is, no one follows those rules, no one no one feels bad for not going on that day no one, except of course, the sister of my, of my girlfriend, eh
she is a, eh, eh, born, born, again I think I don´t know how to say it
ah, yes, yes, yes
eh, and then she is a fanatic
ah, aha
eh, before of, of, of drinking water from a water fountain she makes the cross sign and, and prays, really, literally
hmm,
things like that and she goes to the train station and the bus station to hand out papers, telling please save your soul
oh
etc, etc, that kind that, another thing, have you ever seen a Muslim trying to convince all to be Muslim? or maybe a, have you seen a Buddhist?
ah going everywhere with, with eh
exactly
eh with, with a big belly, with, without a T-shirt sitting on something orange trying to , to, convince people to convert to, Buddhism?
yes, no
no, only Catholics right, no, not even Catholics, Christians
yes, the Christians, because the Jehovah witness do the same too, they also go to
only the Christians exactly,
and, that's already imposing the religion, is not even that a person feels a believer or has for example, my daughter, well I,
exactly
am Catholic and, and, but I'm letting her let's say grow up and that she
at the same time I, at no time, nor intention at all of insulting in any way your beliefs eh I, absolutely believe, I believed, at one time I believed, and I believe that
Hello I'm Fernanda
hello Fernanda, Alvaro's speaking, how are you?
hello how are you?
everything good and you? I'm calling from Austin, Texas
good, where are you calling from? oh wow, we were in Houston not too long ago
ah yes where are you calling me from
aha, very good from Washington
oh from Washington
yes far
and why were you in Houston, for vacations?
eh yes my cousin lives there so we went to visit but very good, and where are you from?
aha, I'm from Uruguay
okay, and from Colombia
and where are you from, from Colombia
yes and in Uruguay let's say the people I know that for example in Mexico there are many religions, they are very religious
ah not so much, not so much eh ah the official religion in Uruguay is the Catholic one but like the people are in a way quite ah open
aha
I mean yes rather like the older people the people that are older are like more conservative but the youth are like more open and like are not very good into being religious and that
religion yes, in Colombia, in Colombia the truth is that there where I know they are quite religious I think that not so much as in Mexico but yes
the same that there also the Catholic one is the mos eh the most let's say that everybody is Catholic
sure
but let's say we, I for instance am not very much catholic but most of the people go to mass every Sunday
aha, ye, these traditions have
and here in the United States maybe you loose this a little bit, don't you? because here it is no that common, right? there it is
let's say, every family for instance go to mass together, things like this, you know what I mean?
sure, ure, sure
here, very few times you have the whole family together and you have to look for a church that is not only catholic, but I've heard there are a lot
that if the father is from whatever is better, so you have to search
aha
and it is moire difficult, right? and further, after September eleventh I think that there has been a great change against the Muslims, right?
yes,but it is also because for what I have observed, here there is  a lot of religious fanaticism, but it is a somehow passive fanaticism
that may be not like the Muslim one, eh, the extremist Muslims who demonstrate and burn flags and so, but
and are there many, there where you live?
where? no no no, but I man that here there are a lot of religious fanatics among the people that call themselves Christians
yes aha
because they are actually evangelist, protestants, and so on, but have a very closed mind, and intolerant I would say
yes yes yes I think so I think so and here if you are, let's say, catholic, then that's all you can believe, right? you can't accept anything else
nothing
except that
and the rest is useless
exactly and they go against that
yeah
but I and the other religions the truth is that I don't know much but I think that here in the United States it's more for uniting I think that it it distances us a lot more
that it that there is sorry distance
it distances it distances you more to be of another religion, to have a distinctly different religion that to have one of the same, right?
yeah, yes yes I doubt it that yes
or rather you see the Muslims lets say the truth, or rather that they are fanatics you never see them let's say well talking with people who are Catholics, things like that, right?
yeah
and, it's like a lot more extreme than anything else.
yes it's true yes this here I see that there are people that eh they've gotten to the point of saying that Muslims like they are the opposites of Christians
and they would kill them in that way just seems ridiculous to me
yes and the same we say with the Jews around here for example in New York that it's pretty clear
yeah
there's a lot of Jews, the majority of people are Jews and you begin to see like an attitude that's against the whole world, you know what I mean? or rather it's not
I don't know how they associate you if you are part of a certain religion like if you personally are of a specific faith, if you know what I mean
they are like against everyone else who is not Jewish
yeah for example here, yes I know exactly what I have heard for example here in New York is that you know if you're Jewish it's very difficult to get into you now
they are it, to do business in New York because everyone's Jewish, you know what I mean
yeah it's as if they're the dominate ones
it's incredible that something like religion
yes it is like a little mafia to call it somehow
more or less and I think that Christians the less ones, at least here, right? but it you look at the Muslims it is exactly the same, you know, like
and I don't know if it is the religion or the fact that they come from the same country, and they talk the same language, right? but they are what you say, like mafias that get together and
it is almost impossible to get in
because I think that religion sometimes, in some ways, is a way of manipulating people, creating certain fears, and in many religions imposing certain dogmas
for people to attack them and not do certain things, so they manipulate them this way
and here, let's say, because many students come, let's say, from Latin families, or Arabic for instance, which are united families
and come here to study, let's say, and they are on they own, and I think that yes, people take advantage of religion to, you saw all that of nine eleven, didn't you? it was a lot of people
students, for instance, who were not even fanatics, but they took them and changed them little by little, right? and you get trapped in religion, when I arrived here
I started studying in the university and I remember that people came to me, in the beginning, and told me about some party with free food and things like this, you know what I mean?
that's the typical
and you, in Colombia for instance, you never see that
sure
they were all christian, right? and it was like obliging you to join because it was better than the other, you know what I mean? like
I think because you are never so exposed in your own country, sometimes you don't know how to handle it
it was like a kind of imposition, like, eh
yes, yes, I mean, it is not like they say, I mean, it is like they start putting it in you, you know, through the eyes, telling you it's better because
I don't know, for many reasons, and they keep calling you, it was incredible, I mean, it is really a cult rather than a, you know what I mean?
and they call you
yes, it is like those sellers that try to sell you a product and always have a different argument
exactly and I don't know if they, it's just that I don't know, it seems to me like if they give them money just to see how many people, it's amazing, I used to say, how can they waste so much time calling people
and saying you have to do this, it's amazing, I couldn't believe that and then, suddenly you are in a country that is so open
and you never expect it to be so tough about those things, no?
yes, this country is very open and well some people believe what they want to believe but there are certain groups or certain communities that are
quite closed, closed and there's no way to make them change their minds
yes, lets say, in the University for example, I remember about the Jews and Palestine.
aha
they would put up posters, it was terrible, do you understand? of the Jews that had died, no?
yes
and I mean, I think that if you want to see that you can go in the Internet and find the most horrible pictures, do you understand?
yes
but they'd put them right outside, I don't know, to me that was something that was wrong, do you understand? To see a dead child, things like that
it was shocking
I was shocked, yes, yes, yes, I think that in the end they are trying to make people aware so that they join them
sure, because they would show oh their point of view but the other side must be facing similar things
exactly
but they weren't showing them.
but yes, the religion, you know, I've never, oh, my family has never been too religious so I think that now that they are here in the United States, they won't change, do you understand
sure
because I feel like there's no middle stance, either you are into that or not, you can see the churches here, lets say in Colombia, people
you go to any church, I mean you go to the one that is closer to your house
yes
and you see the same people in the church, here people make friends in the church, you know, and it is
and
that church, and everybody goes to that church, I mean it's very intense, like they are trying to hold people in
but here, you know, church is more a circus than another thing, because first of all a lot of people go there just to make their
I mean not for spiritual reasons or some kind of religious ritual, they go there more to talk and meet people
and all the churches I have gone to here that are the evangelic kind, they are all rock and roll churches
yes, they are like rock and roll
because they all have an orchestra with keyboards, battery, guitars and they sing, and a chorus, a great show actually
it is not like, for instance, when you go to a Catholic church, there a mass is a religious ritual, here I mean in these churches
yes
eh, protestant, it is a circus or a music show, whatever you want to call it
yes, you know what I mean?, I knew a woman who worked with me and she started going to a church, right?
and besides, I think that churches do it on purpose because they also help a lot, because she told me that they had helped her, and they gave her
money for a living, but of course, on return, she has no option but to go back to that church
sure, sure
and the same people called her, and they met on the weekends, I mean, just like I told you. In Colombia a church is a place where you go to, you pray
you ask for whatever you want, and you leave, you know what I mean?
to your house
you go home and that is all you can go with your relatives here they tied you to the church and if you go to other church, horrible if you understand me so is like you are
betraying
it is like changing from one bank to another
more or least yes yes incredible, then incredible because of that. I am not interested do you understand me to go to church or anything eh so
and nobody likes anyone to impose nor believes neither things of that style
exactly and and see so like when the movie the passion of Christ
aha
so many so the Jews did not wanted to see it and fought with people I told myself so do you understand me like if
hello
Hello.
yes Who is it?
Ah, Jose
well I'm Olga, How are you, Where are you Jose?
In Nebraska.
In Nebraska, well I'm in Texas
In what part?
in Forth Worth
Oh.
well at this moment I'm in Kansas, I'm visiting but in reality I live in Forth Worth
I lived there in Sherman.
oh really
yes.
ah was that a long time ago
Ah, four years ago
then and what happened why did you return somewhere else?
Um, problems with my ex.
mm, goodness
The farther the better.
Yes that's true. Is like that
Already when nothing, when nothing can, not even the strength
well no don't they say that by force not even the shoes go in
Not even the shoes go in.
like that is good
What do you think of religion?
yes well that topic we have already touched on it before. Have you gotten it already?
No.
no well I have already gotten it in reality I think that, that the religions divide, is a religion even in one single family
Aha.
sometimes there are different members of that family with different religions
Well, yes, like mine,
ah really
No, well, I, well I'm Catholic. I grew up with the Catholic belief, and my wife, she is, she's American, and she, for them is anything, they go to one, and go to another,
I think, they don't even know what they want.
mm
They don't even know How can I tell you? I don't know they don't even know what, not even what religion they are.
they don't identify with any
They don't identify with any. And, well, I believed
yes
I was raised a Catholic, but here, where I am, I'm the only Mexican, the only Hispanic person living in this small town, so, well, we don't have any in Spanish and
I rarely attend church now.
yes well, that's true that they are divided, there's this very special religion called Jehovah Witnesses
Aha
and I feel that oh, that religion it definitely brings families apart since it's so radical, I know that they are very strict
I was attending some of them, I went to that church in some occasions  because I like the sermons, so
Aha.
they are all really good speakers.
Aha.
So I attended some and besides that I really like the, I really like what the speaker said and besides that, they give good advice and all that.
Aha.
advice, advice for your daily life.
Aha
but, little by little, they kind of suck you in,  in a way, how to say it? In a very oh
they suck you in completely in a way in which you, you only work for your church, I mean, you leave everything else, even
Aha, yes.
sometimes people, well they don't agree with some things, right? So, to me, that creates a division between them because for example, if I become of that religion, well
my children, well, they'd turn their backs on me.
Are you Catholic?
well, I was raised as one as you just said.
Well, me too
Yes I grew up thinking or believing I am Catholic but actually I hardly go to church or anything, I am not excessively devote
I have, I have noticed, I don't know maybe I am wrong, but the Catholic here where I live right now,
mhm
mm, since I am not married to my girlfriend,
mhm yes
mm, I don't know, I notice like the father, like he, leaves us out. He leaves us out because, well, because we are not married, because it is a sin to them, right?
ok, but how, how does he know?
Well, we told him, because we baptized the girl
oh ok, mmm
We have a girl, and
mhm
well, I wanted to go to, I just forgot I was not married
mhm
I didn't forget, it's just that there was a different father before
mhm
and he was so kind, such a good person
mhm
But man, they brought a different one here
mhm
and, mm, no, this no, they don't want me to receive communion or anything
goodness gracios um
And I said, no, well, I don't know,
well there it is, there it is another
I don't know what to do.
sepparation is somthing like racism, it's similar to racism
Aha.
right then
And, the, the other priest that was, he was very, a very nice person, very kind. He understood that my wife was from another religion.
mhm
He understood us in everything. But, this one doesn't, this one yes, it's like, like like discrimination, because no,
mhm
the other one was very kind, the other one said, I understand that no, he says, I understand that, if my wife wanted to be catholic, he says, I agree in helping you
in anything.
mhm
And, the other new one, no, he says, no. It's a sin, he said, it's a sin what you're doing, and that shouldn't be. He didn't even want to baptize our daughter.
goodness gracious
Because, she wasn't catholic.
mhm
So, I said, well, so what future, What can one expect from the Catholic Church?
well besides like it is not for nothing, the catholic church is very discredited you see with so many things that that, have been published of the priests
The priests, aha
yes then so many abuses, so many degrading situations that is that confuses you at least I, I am very confused because I say how is possible that priests
believers right believers with so much faith in God do that kind of things
Well, other thing that I have. Right?
hmm
Maybe I am wrong too, well, I think that they should let priests to marry, they are beings
hmm
normal, like you.
and if I, look that I agree with you like the the how are they called in others religions they do not say priests, the, the
Pastor, or something like that.
ah the pastors, like the pastors who get married, and most of the, I think that in all the rest of the churches
Aha. Aha.
they can get married, but not in the Catholic.
And, I think that, well, also, no, I don´t be to sound rude, but, as you also have needs, I think. Do you understand me?
of course, yes of course, yes, yes yes well those are needs of the, of the human being then How could a person live without those things? How can I tell you? in an nice
way or consciously consciously I think that consciously no one  can
Aha
can live without that kind of situations, is like if you deny totally to go to the bathroom, to urinate for example
Aha.
well no, he can't, it's a physiological necessity
And here I've seen, I've, I work in construction, we've worked in several churches,
hmm
and I've seen the difference of the parents, because, from the other religions, they really like the priest, the kids go with him, to, to the church,
hmm
and in exchange, working with Catholics, I see the priest there alone all the time.
hmm
He leaves, leave the church sad, talks with someone for a little while,
hmm
and yeah, with the same he returns to putting and well, as if, as if he we-, well, he's alone.
well yes in reality yes
In reality he's alone.  And,
hmm
in the other churches I've seen that they're so happy, you see then, then, the happiness that the priest brings, because, well, he has family, he has,
sure
family with him.
hmm, yes it's true like, when your necessities are satisfied then, this, it's a situation that really
Aha.
that should be reconsidered, but, and and once he argued a lot about this, and he didn't come to any agreement, who knows that
Where are you from?
I'm from Chihuahua, from Mexico
From Chihuahua. Well, I'm from Durango.
oh really, from what part of Durango
From there where the air returns, from Nuevo Ideal.
Nuevo Ideal
Aha.
Nuevo Ideal, mm
Nuevo Ideal.
well I know that there I know for example Villocamopo that the snow, that
No, is, I think that is very remote there.
eh ah yes mm then mm
Well, I'm, I'm from there, but I was raised in Monterrey I came here when I was seventeen. But, often, not often, I go there like every ten years.
ah
I mean I already don't have people there.
ah well then
In Durango, since little we went to Monterrey.
mm
To study, but no.
Ah goodness God you didn't see
I went five years ago.
Uh huh
And, i asked him/her about that, because one day, i was in a fair
uh huh
And i looked at a boy, right?, pretty "square", like we say [square as in a lot of muscles]
yes
with his t-shirt pulled up, showing his biceps and all
right
and i said, what's with that Mr?, and that boy, he seemed familiar too, right?
Uh huh
And, uh, the next day, there was a mass at the ranch
Uh huh
And then, my fathers, they're old-fashioned catholics
Uh huh
"There's mass, come on, you have to go"
Uh huh
Well, just not to get into an argument with them, i never looked at them anymore, i said "ok, let's go", this priest is the beggar that was there
Oh
And, i was like why?
Uh huh
Well, if he was walking well, very muscly
mm
and it surprised me, right, I said, You know what, mom? I'm not, I'm not going to mass, I have things to do, and then they called me that I had to pick up a cousin.
mm mm
I said, I'll go, I'll go, then, then. But no, I was surprised. I said this was the priest that was at the fair last night. What does a priest have to be doing in the fair, and then dressed like that?
mm how
And no, no.
showing off as we say
Aha, like looking to see who what he could get.
ah that the song, no, no well is that like that no, well I I was also born in Durango eh but, but, since very little we went to
Oh, yes?
to Chihuahua to Juarez City
Chihuahua.
and then I already, I already lived in the two countries, I lived in El Paso and
Oh.
in Juarez, then so
Aha.
that's how our life was made.
That.
that's how it is goodness God, well, yes that, that topic of the religions is a very, very controversial topic, because there are so many, and many and many religions, and,
and there's another word for that, What do they call it? um, they are ah, instead of religion, there's another word, sects. There's a bunch of sects that
Aha.
Hello.
Hello.
Who is it?
How are you? Adrian's speaking from Toronto. Ontario, Canada.
I'm Olga.
How are you?
I live in but at this moment I'm in Kansas
In Kansas?
in Kansas, look only
In, in, in what state is Kansas? Where?
Olate Kansas
Okay.
Mm.
Ah, Kansas is the name of the state.
Ah. really? yes, yes.
And and where are you from? Where were you born?
I was born in Durango, Mexico.
And have you lived here long?
Oh, Well, yes, eh, I've been living here more than thirty years, by here in the border of
Ah.
El Paso and Chihuahua
You've lived here for awhile.
oh, yes, a long time, and they have three
Where were you born?
yes.
In Buenos Aires, in Argentina.
Ah, okay.  And you have the, you have the little speaking.
Eh?
You have the very special little speaking from the
The, the little speaking the, the accent?
accent, yes, in Chihuahua we say the, the little speaking so it's
I've never heard anyone say it like this, the little speaking.  But it sounds nice.
yes, it it sounds funny, no?
And, and
yes, well, eh, what, what do you think about, about the topic of today?
About religion?  I don't like them.
You don't like the, the topics or religions?
No, the religions, because they divide people and
Oh. yes.
there are wars because of religion and all this.
Mm.
I don't find it bad that the people eh, believe in what they want
Mm.
but for me religion is a structure of power and is the, the churches and the, the pastors and the popes and or, or whatever they are called the, the Muslim version of that
the Jewish version of that, the version of whatever of that
Mm.
the the religions as a structure eh mm I honestly don't like, any although although none really have a bad message or
eh mm that I already know well there's no religion that says, well you have to go harm people, or something
something along those lines, but
Mm.
And what do you think of the religions?
Well, eh, look, I also, I agree with you, I feel that the, the religion divides because I was already telling Jose, to a guy
whom I spoke with for a while yesterday, from Nebraska. I was telling him that I was in, in a family in the, the same members of the family
are, as far as brothers and, and all, and, and parents sometimes the parents are of one religion and, and each kid has their own religion
then there like I see, well a separation, because no, nobody has the same beliefs none of them, then because I, I eh know families like that
that don't get along because of that? that they have They have problems because they have different religions?
yes, well they have problems because they are different beliefs, I mean, oh and, and even different practices, yes, different ways of practicing the, the religion then
A-
well really yes, there is, is a tremendous conflict I would say that if that if all the religions if we were all of the same religion I think that
that we would be more united because obviously we would be talking the same language, right? Then, this
yes.
and yes, I think, that, that the religions would unite if we were all from the same
yes, no, I don't know, eh, this is why, if religions didn't exist, if each one believed what they wanted without bothering each other, no?
Eh, yes, what happens, what happens is that sometimes, yes, hmm, I say, they don't leave you in peace, or sometimes, they bother you, no?  the
those of other religions, this is the uncomfortable situation, well that everyone wants you to believe in what they believe, so
well this is a little difficult.
Well, we- but the religions that try to convert everyone to their side, but, but it's what I told you that, I don't think belief in itself is bad.
for people to believe in something
Hmm.
but being fanatic like this, religion tries to convert everyone to their religion and
Yeah, this too
this seems really bad to me
yes yes well, that is precisely where the conflicts are, because no- no one wa- no one wants to leave the other in peace, because
according to the religion they follow, that everyone is practicing now, well according to them it's the truth.
And the best
Exactly.  Because, and, and well, eh, we're really divided for this reason.  What do you think about homosexuality?
No, that it's good.  Everyone leads their life as they want, eh, while not bothering others, eh, for me no, it's not different from religion
eh, the, eh, it doesn't bother that other people can believe what they want
Hmm.
because the, ah, and eh, since I'm not homosexual, I wouldn't like someone to come to say to me, that, that it's good and that it's bad, or
Mm.
what is correct and what is incorrect.
mm.
whether with religion or whether with the sexuality.
mm.
That, that is something that I learned, after living a while here in Canada, that
Ah.
having the freedom or having the power of saying whatever one wants implies to eh hold in many things also or put up with things that you don't like too much but
you have to, have to put up with it only because is the, the price you have to pay for the freedom or, or whatever
or something like that.
yes, is true, is true that, what you think sometimes you have to pay a very high price. That is
Yes, that is one of the characteristics of the Canadians, eh
Mm.
of, of being very respectful of the, the traditions of, of anyone
Mm.
eh, whatever it might imply, eh mm Eh , have you ever seen, how the uniform of the Canadian mounted police is?
Mm.
That are red and with riding boots and a brown hat?
Mm.
Have you ever seen it in a movie or something?
yes.
Can you hear me?
yes, I've, I've seen them, but like you say, in movies
Hmm, well, imagine that, imagine that this was
oh, where is it
like twenty years back, there was a Sikh, do you know what the Sikhs are?  They use the turban on their head
Oh, yes, yes, yes.  Hmm.
Well, there was a Sikh, eh, who went and joined the, the mounted police because it was his dream to me a mounted police
Aha.
And well, he approved the course and everything, and when it came time to graduate he wanted to keep using his turban
Oh, hmm.
You know?
yes, aha.
And e-
yes, yes well
so if he used the turban, he couldn't use the hat
Well yes, exactly.
so, what?  he, it was a whole topic here in, in, in Canada with people saying if it was good or bad to modify the mounted police uniform
eh, it's sure, so sacred and only, only because, only for respect, you know?  The religion, the customs, of a person
yes, well it's
and
sometimes I don't know
and at the end at the end, they let him at the end they let him and, and, and and if he has to use the uniform, he has a, a brown color turban
like the same color as the hat..
Goodness.
The, eh, and that, that is something that, eh, is eh, is a small story, right? but the, is the price that you have to pay
yes
so that nobody comes and forces you to put on a hat
Exactly.
if you don't want to or
yes, that's how it is.
No, I don't imagine something like that in the United States or
Mm.
in, in in Argentina or in some other countries that I know a little
Aha.
Eh, I don't know how it is in Mexico exactly, but from what they've told me, something like that would be impossible or
Well, yes, in in Mexico is very is very hard, eh, how can I tell you? wanting to be yourself, is
Because is a difference or, as little as it may be, a small thing, right
Mm. No, they don't accept it, realize that if, and if you insist in, in using that, that the majority of society didn't approve
realize that they relegate you, they ostracize you Then that, that is very well, is very, is, is a lot of cruelty there, but, well that's how it is.
yes and where you live are there a lot Mexicans or all of them are american?
In the area where I live there are only a few like two or three
Latin people
Mm
But I have only lived here for a little, When I was living in Arlington there were many Mexicans and Colombians living there
and Venezuelans
Mm
there is black people as well, but when I lived in Arlington I didn´t see many black people
Dallas is full as well.
we as Latins do not have an open mind
about Latins
and things are different? right?
it is just that we are more quite and keep things to ourselves
our ancestors were like that, so then this in our culture
we do not have an open mind
we like to keep our privacy
Mm
So that this is how one believes it but do not exercise that right
the freedom of speech and things like that
yes, so what do you think about Homosexuals?
Look, I, I, I'm not in favor of but, well I'm also not against. I respect them the same as people, as human beings, as
as citizens eh, I don't criticize them, because I think that they eh, are like are their
Hello,
yes, good evening, this is , who is it?
This is Manuel from, I am talking from Orlando, Florida. Where are you?
Manuel, hello, I am in Wilmington, Delaware, where are you from Manuel?
I am from Colombia
I see, I am a neighbor of you, Panama
and you? Oh, my pleasure
Pleased to meet you, what do you think about religion, Manuel?
Oh, well, I'll give you my opinion, I think that, like they said in the introduction, unfortunately the religions have become way of dividing
Rather than joining people
Unfortunately, right?. Well, I think, Manuel
Unfortunately, rigth.
that in that sense, eh, the factions who have used religions with that purpose are a minority, the fanatics
yes
No, because not everybody is a fanatic, and those who are normal in quotation marks mind their own businesses and don't mess with the other people
but then there are these mads who become destructive or who push you to the religion, who want you to live their way like it or not
And that is out of place, right?
aha, you are pointing something very important, because actually we should be precise, it's not the religion that is bad, because as far as I know
Right
they are all good in the sense that they talk about peace, love, integration, that's alright. It's the leaders that are bad
This are those who, right, don't complete all these precepts and more seem like zisana, they seem like a division, they seem like hate
exactly, that their religion is the only, the best
And the start to compare themselves with others, to say that this is bad, that this won't take them to
Exactly.  And I'm not, I, like, same as you, I was raised Catholic
heaven
But now as an adult who has judgment and can choose, what fits with me best, and I've become a spiritual person, I've been reading metaphysics like for five, seven years
Right
ah, and it makes a lot o sense to me.  That it's the most important for me to think that organized religion and, forgive me the term, the
The, the word that I'm going to sue is a chuleria
yes
Because they tell you that God, if you don't do what they say, father God will get angry and the only way that father God will forgive you is if you come to my church and give me money
yes, they're always talking about God the punisher who
Exactly, and this doesn't exist, this isn't right
the implacable, exactly, and it's sadder because we can see now how many families, how many towns, how many nations, ah, disintegrated by religion, religious movements
Through history, my love
Always yes, through history because you want to preach over the other
Not that for, for how many people, how many people have died in the name of religion
In the name of God, exactly, how many people assassinated, in a series, in the name of God
This is totally wrong, this is totally out of order and wrong.  But we get back again to fanaticism, the Confused or ambitious leadership
This is, and, and
what do you think about religion and homosexuality
Well I think that this is out of context, instead, because
Sure it is, church does care about what you do,
yes, well, yes, exactly, but if God, if God is good, then all his creatures, the God's children
He doesn't care
They are God's children too and so I think that in this specific case, they are people that hadn't decided to be like that, most of them
Or they have impulses or natural things
Exactly, genetics or human physiology, human physiology, they don't have control over that.
So, them, them
And so, they don't chose it freely.
so, it's something that they are not hurting anybody with it and obviously if it's someone very
they change, it's none of our business.
Well, they could be indecent and well that's another thing, but if it were by choice, then it would be different but they can't chose.
Between two consenting adults, who has the right to get involved, they are not hurting anyone.
Exactly, so yes, why don't they try to do some research among their followers and for example, if they prohibit the entrance to the
thieves, white collar thieves, there are so many of them, people that
They don't because they would loose money, they would loose money
The hypocrites, so, this takes us to another issue, most of the so-called spiritual leaders, they are in it for the business
Sure they are,
It's just business
Of course yes, in the name of God
in the name of God
To me that is, that is a sin, a sin bigger than killing fifty persons. Swindle in the name of God, what bigger sin can there be?
It's true, and, and, to the extreme, as I read the other day, of a movement somewhere, where the lady, the leader, had
To start she obliged the parishioners to purify with a kit of products, soaps and things, that only she sells
Can you believe it?
And they could only bath with those products fro the rest of their life
No, no, no
That was the initial business, and there is more
Look, I was getting hair dressed in the house of a black girl near my house, and she told me that her sister goes to a church in Pennsylvania
right?
And th-, a small congregation, without a name
aha
And the minister told them one Sunday that all the parishioners had to give him one thousand dollars, because he and his wife wanted to go on vacations
mmm my God
Just figure, I would have stand up, given him a couple of slaps and leave right then
And I guess that the, I guess that more than a stupid did it
Oh, I'm sure, I have no doubt about it
Give him the one thousand dollars
I would have dared, I would have stood up, slap his face in front of everybody and would have gone to my house. Can you imagine that, Manuel?
No but is people, is, that's what they call alienation, is Alienated people, and look that perhaps you have lived that experience because many of us have lived it, if you tried to remove their blindfold
They get mad
Ah, no they get hysterical
And they say that you are sent by the devil To change their faith
Ah, yes yes, to each their own, right,
yes but is the, is very sad when they do that with people let's say of scarce resources, still
The elderly The elderly that are alone
oh, the, or in this country immigrants, people that are working hard and the
mm For example I'm, I'm sure that you see in Telemundo, for example here
they get
Here locally, telemundo, I don't know if it's Univision or Telemundo Every Sunday there's a commercial of a church, of a Brazilian man
That every Sunday that says that is free, no, then they have the blessed rosary,
Eh, the famous church
The water from Jerusalem That I don't know what crap
Universal prayer Those are absolute scammers, imagine that they there, from what I've read, they hire actors and actresses so that, eh they impress the parishioners with their famous miracles
They are actors
This is incredible
And the guy, their leader, the one who founded that movement five years ago who is a millionaire today he became a millionaire with that and laundering
Of course
money from drug trafficking
I don't believe you
They found him in Brazil and I don't know where it is right now.
Well kid, they're in Philadelphia so you can find out
In Philadelphia?
In Philadelphia this kid, every Sunday brings a new chicherito.  But they say it's free, no, you just go, but once you pass through that door
They'll get something from you, this is sure
I think that they say that they pass the basket three, four, five times, in one rhythm, five times
No, I believe you, no, I'm more than, it's been more than twenty years since I've set foot in a church.
So
Simply because I don't tolerate hypocrisy, and I don't know and I will get hysterical
And this is, well, since the Catholic church is massive, well, the priest can't really be in your life, because this is another strategy of these small movements
they know the lives of each one of the participants, because they are small nuclei, you know when they gather, what are the costs, the incomes
Incredible
And in this way they control life with the excess of money that they give them
Incredible, with such a face
To the point where my brother met in New York, because I also lived in New York for a while.  Two brothers from Central America, who found the check from
I don't believe you
The weekly pay of the pastor, and he returned what he
The entire check
What he wanted, what he thought he should spend in a week
Oh, not my
They get to that point
Look I, look it makes me feel sorry to hear these things but there are people that seeks it
Like this
What it is founded
And he is, he was one who happened what I told you now, he tried to open the eyes of one of those guys, he knew them at work
He tried to talk to him and The guy got angry, and told him that too, that he was an envoy of the devil oh, please
Well there is, thanks and bye and he disconnected
How?
I would tell him thanks, I am an envoy of hell, thank you very much, bye and get disconnected And keep you row, you row your boat as you think.
What is your opinion about this last outrage of the Catholic church, they say they are not going to permit ah, investigation of priests
To be sure they have not had homosexual relationships in the last three years
But you know what everybody say, well you know that To fire them all
No and what are they going to do with those they have inside
Because of that No, that is too much hypocrisy, like you, too much hypocrisy, I don´t know where they want to get with all that.
It is already the top, Manuel, it is the top No, but what I don´t, what I don´t understand is why people, because like you and me
We can understand that one plus one is not equal to chair Or it is that people don´t want to know, for example my mother´s cousins
There is one that goes to church Every Sunday and she firmly believes in this and she guides Your are going to, and she is not an uneducated woman, she is not ignorant, she is not
Dumb or whatever You are going to tell me that she does not see the differences So that is what they call "blind faith"
NO, because of that is that I say, they, that, that in other words it is alienation, alienated people are like that, they cannot reason, because they are dependent of their leader
In this case spiritual
aha
And everything they are going to do is consulted with the leader, see At a point That it is unfortunately, an old classmate from the university, in Colombia
Well he is there When I went there, a couple of years ago, I saw that he was in a movement x, I don´t know which one And he is a professional and I don´t know how he fell in that, and then
I was interested in some kind, some kind of business,some,  I was interested in some kind of business
Some weakness in some place
Hello, hi, good evening
Hi, good evening, who are you?
My name is Niki, and you?
Oh, my name is Olga
Hi Olga, how are you?
Fine, where are you at?
I'm calling from Florida, and you?
I, well, i live in Texas but I'm in Kansas City right now
Oh, well, i know it's cold there
Oh, it's terrible, terrible
Sadly
Yeah, that's it
Well, yeah, we're talking about religion tonight, what do you think?
Yeah, well, i think that, in fact, religions do divide
Yes
If we all were from exactly the same religion, we'd probably be more united, but since everyone has its own beliefs, that's a way to divide, and what do you
Yes, i agree, that's a tough question because i do believe that if we all were from the same religion, we would have less, well, less wars, but at the same time
I'm in favor of defending people's religions, and this is precisely why i really believe in my heart that every person has a right to their beliefs, but at the same time
i cannot deny that every war we have, the terrorists, unfortunately
That's true, well, it's precisely a part of, because we don't speak the same language, like they say, right?
Yes yes.
Then Well the situation is the reality, although many times one doesn't want to accept reality but
Yes.
well is what we are seeing very clearly. Is impossible to deny what is so obvious right?
Yes, it's been a topic for the ages. For the ages.
That's it. Yes, well is a topic that in reality
Because of that
is always current right? It never goes out of fashion so.
Yes.
There will always be people who are in favor and always there will be people that are in the the the unfortunate thing is that
Yes.
some in some religions eh they are so hung up on converting the rest.
Yes.
Then there like well um they are violating well the rights of the other person right? I think
Yes.
Because no no no, who are they to assure that their religion is is the real one and in that of
Yes, I agree.
Yes, to try to change the mind of other people then there I think that it's an abuse to the intimacy of, of the other people.
Yes, I don't like how they think that such religion is the only path. That always yes is not fair. But imagine a world of only one religion, one belief.
Yes there would be a lot of peace and all but at the same time perhaps it would be better more patience I mean more tolerance. They could tolerate more as far as the differences.
Yes, yes, that's true. Well, and what do you think about homosexuality?
There are, well, my parents are completely against it but I think that we are all God's children and of the divine holly spirit
and they are too. Even if I don't understand it, as I'm happily married, at the same time I think they have a right, I think, I think, like any couple
I mean, man and women, holding hands, kissing just like nothing matters, we are used to that but when we see two men doing it, we are not used to that but
at the same time, I think that they have a right to get close to, have healthcare right, insurance, just like they would if they were married, no?
That's why I think it's hard because my family is against it and they think, my family is Christian and
they think that's not part of God's plan, but I, I do think we are all His children, what about you?
Well, I have the same opinion. I feel that they have their reasons to live as they do, right? OH, I think they are people
Yes.
respectable, as long as they respect the others, yes, they are good workers,
Yes.
productive people, respectful, good citizens, so I don't see why they wouldn't
Yes.
why we shouldn't let them be, I mean. They have rights too, no?
Yes, I agree. Yes, oh, what you just said is the key, I mean, respect, I think there are also lots of beautiful things that the
homosexuals have. Lots of them are artists or painters, actors or singers, designers lots of them and well, we've benefited from that.
Sure, most of them are very talented.
Yes.
In fact, oh, we've known this for centuries and centuries, now
Yes.
it is like the society is embarrassed about that.
Yes.
Imagine that, Julio Cesar was homosexual.
Yes. Yes.
Also Charles the fifth. Then well many many many many important people were homosexual. Pilate, then
Yes, yes.
then well the truth is that these things have been always be seen but lately it is like like ah ah like there has been an explanation in that sense
Yes, it is it has been a great controversy in relationship with I know many Christian Churches now have that topic and Catholic church is against it but there are many
homosexual that are good Catholics - I think they have their believes  and I am not to Who am I to judge them?
Exactly, yes yes. Well we came again to the same. It is - yes. As I tell you, if if they respect the individual rights of the rest well
Yes.
they also deserve to be respected.
Yes.
as as human beings because as you say well in fact we are all children of God.
Yes.
I suppose that well God loves us all equal, then there is not a reason for all earthly people right?
Yes.
to love more certain group of human beings. That cannot be.
Yes, I feel so sorry because always you hear of cases. I have seen in television maybe a male friend a female friend maybe an homosexual couple the husband gets sick, a couple who have been together for
decades and one of them gets sick and the doctor don´t let the other one to come in until he is too sick and that makes me feel so bad.
Yes, it is
Not to be left, I think they don´t have the same rights and the situation is very sad.
It is like that, but in this moment it is like well, in the United States they are more open in this aspect. There is a little bit more respect to
Yes.
to those couples but but it is not the authentic respect that they should give to those
people right? Then it continues to be to be
Yes.
different. They are marginalized even when when it is said that that we all are free, that we have the right to express ourselves freely, that we can do whatever we want.
That that is only a word to say but the reality is They don´t have the sane right.
Yes, that is true.
Because well see it, for example Ah What is Diego Rivera´s wife name?
Ah yes yes Frida, of course.
then well a very talented woman and
Yes.
and very strong, she was a a
Yes.
very very strong really well eh we can learn a lot a lot of her strength.
Yes yes.
She was homosexual too and well
Yes.
That's what I'm telling you, right?, not really, they don't stop being persons because they are homosexual
That's true, she was strong, she's, she's my favorite painter. That woman suffered and in that time
Oh, it's true
being homosexual was even more difficult, i think it's even harder in Latin America than here
yes
But in that time it was hard anywhere
Yes, yes, that's it. It was something similar to those who had a different religion than
Yes
or lets say catholic
yes
There's always been wars about religion, always
It's true
Because even over there with the muslims, wars about
Sure
they don't agree with this, they don't agree with that
Yeah, since the inquisition, i mean, I'm always fascinated, i mean, a lot of last names in Latin America, even mine, uh, are names that originated... or thousands of years ago were Jewish names
and because of the inquisition, they left, they fled, i mean, the queen, right?, how does the story go?, queen Isabel voted and i mean, she forced many Jewish and Muslims to convert
Or else... you know the story
Yes, yes, yes, like forced
Yes
People is unhappy because
Yes
you could get to find happiness when you're free, make your own decisions in every aspect
Yes
Every aspect of our lives, so if anyone comes and we, well, like it doesn't fit with the whole purpose of the human being
Yeah, i think that many times the danger of someone being religious is when they're a religious leader and a political one too
Uh huh
Someone that has the power of both, there's always great danger there
Oh, yes, yes, yes, because many people make a bad use of their power
Yes
So, it's a terrible problem, and besides, many wars start like that, right?
Yeah, unfortunately
Uh huh, that's right, well, yeah man
Yes, uh huh, and, what country are you from?
I'm from Mexico
Oh, i met Mexico, well, several times now, but my brother got married to a Mexican in Mexico City in Mexico, and i loved it
Right, yeah, Mexico is beautiful
Yeah and they're
Yeah, and where are you from?, oh
I'm dominican, but since he got married, we all feel like we have a Mexican family, because every time he goes to
Yes, good evening, this is Patricia, who am i talking to?
Good evening, my name is Leticia
Hi Leticia, where are you, where are you from, what country are you from?
Uh, uh, lets see if you can guess
Are you argentininan?
yes
And, where, uh, where do you live right now?
In Philadelphia
Oh, look, you're close, I'm from Panama and i live in Wilmington, Delaware,
Oh, yes, Delaware is very near here
Yes, tell me Leticia, what do you think about religion
Well, they were giving options there and, yeah, i think it unites or separates, i think it mostly separates
I think that's something, for example, there are many religious people, but that are personal practitioners, right? , so there's this crazy fanatics
yes
who are the ones that, uh, make everyone's life bitter
Yes
Oh, but if everyone minded its own business, minding your own, quiet
yes
i don't, well, there's also, there also exists, uh, politics inside religions that want to impose, because everything that's money-related, Leticia, let's be honest, right?
Yeah, logically, religion moves a lot of money
All is money and then because of that is that they want, they want to superimpose on people and tell them well my  religion is better than others, so you must come here, of course in quotes, with your money
yes
right?Eh, I was commenting earlier to a guy whom I was talking with about Colombia,I was dyeing my hair dark brown, here in Wilmington.
Um, um
And this, we were talking about religion, no, and he, I don´t know, and he comes and tells me that his sister goes to a, denomination, to a, eh, church, no, without a denomination
tells that the pastor stood on a Sunday, see, hear this, for, are you sitting, right?
yes.
The Pastor tell the congregation that all of them must give a thousand dollars because he and his wife wanted to go on vacations.
No.
Can you believe that Leticia?
No,no, no, no, no, I don´t, so, shamelessly.
Is that I would have stood up, I would have stood up, shamelessly, I would have stood up, and would have gone, in, in front of everybody I would have gone home, by bold
yes, yes.
what is your opinion, about homosexuality, in, eh, and the church attitude?
I think it is part of the old fashioned the church is in everything, so, the church I don´t know in a lot of things, not only in homosexuality
Abortion, abortion
yes, abortion, the use of condoms, the, eh well, The Christian church also should let the priests to get married, for example, to me
I think the same, how could you give me, how could you give me
Eh
eh, instruction eh, about problems I have in my marriage, if you have never been married?
Sure.
if you have no idea of what it is to live a marriage?
Logical.
No matter how much you study
yes.
Because theory is one thing and the reality is another.
yes, yes, yes, logical. No that's why, I think that church is, has stayed in the past
exactly, and I don't see what the purpose is
And No, and throughout history ,
Because what they are doing is, what they are doing is driving away the
Sure, sure, is what they are achieving, yes, yes.
For example that foolishness that the church has come out with, I, same as you was raised Catholic
Um, um.
But now that I'm an adult, I've been reading a lot of metaphysics, I consider myself spiritual
Uh, uh
And I've been reading a lot of metaphysics these last five or seven years
yes.
and I've gotten that for me, eh, is very logical
Um, um.
no, and it doesn't have that stupidity that they want to put in your head, the organized religion
yes.
Um, and simple, I simply do my thing quietly I don't bother  anyone, I don't let anyone bother me, but it's, is a logical thing
yes, yes, yes. Is that I think that precisely what fails of religion is at a level, eh, no the
the leadership, I believe that it's the leadership
I don't think the personal belief, because each one can have their own belief and that's respectable, and the, and the people can have their need to have
Exactly.
a spiritual life, and that's respectable, what it's deformed is the organization, eh, and is the, sure, is all this structure that's behind of
the leadership
of the religion, from people that don't even care about the religion
that everything is related to money
and yes, what they less care about is that
For me this has already become a For me this has already become a vulgar business.
yes.
Forgive me but for me this is like a form of prostitution.
yes, yes, yes. No, is, and, and well, they are going to lose people, I mean, is
Then they hound the weaker ones
Sure.
The elderly, the sick ones for example I was talking, I'm sure because we see the same channel, you know Sundays on Tel-, I don't know if it's Telemundo or Univision
that this Brazilian guy comes out that if you go to the church, is on Broad Street, that they give you holy water from Jerusalem
Um.
that give you well, the blessed palm, the golden fleece, I don't know what's free, but you have a lot of security that once you go through those doors
yes.
they're going to take a lot of money from you and so this Colombian kid was telling me, casually, there's a Colom- eh, there's a Brazilian, and I don't know if it's
that it was the same thing, and what he were doing was money laundering
Um.
and he fled to Brazil because the police was behind him, the law, this is why I say that well, tell them that he's in Philadelphia.
Sure.  Sure.
Have you seen these commercials?
No, the truth is I don't watch much television.
You have to, you have to put it, you have to put it on one Sunday
yes.
I don't know if it's Telemundo or Univision, but every Sunday the kid is there, it's the blessed palm, it's the water of Jerusalem that the rosary of, pirtin-piritan, that everything's free, it just comes
Um. how embarrassing, how embarrassing
Embarrassing.
It's totally embarrassing, yes the truth, in your country there are, eh, they're very religions or like, the majority
All Cath-, ah, the great majority, I would say ninety percent are Catholics.
Um, um, sure.
Now, these Catholics who don't go to church these Catholics who go to church every Sunday but just, ah, in the same church they're talking about fulanito and menganito, and looking at what the other wore.
Sure.
Sinning in the same church, no?
Um, um
Judging others, what is this, please, let's stop being hypocrites here
yes, yes, yes, yes, no, no, is the the
Do you go to church? You don't sound to me like you go to church
No, I in fact am not Catholic either, I mean, eh, I wasn't raised under the Catholic religion, I wasn't raised under any religion,
Um. I see, they let you follow your own path, to choose when you were an adult.
They let me, sure, yes yes, yes, yes, basically, and, and I continue by the path of not choosing a religion
I found out when I was already an adult I found some old papers in my mom's house, my grandmother's will
Um, um
that my grandmother had left the Catholic church seventeen thousand dollars in her will, to help a seminarian.
Ah.
I almost had an attack.
My God.
That I'm already about to knock on their doors to tell them, Give me my money.
No, no, no, how they deceive the people.
Is something incre-, no, but what I don't understand, Leticia, for example I have some aunts, some cousins of my mom, my mom is already seventy eight years old.
Um, um
One in particular, a very good lady with, a heart of gold. She goes every Sunday to church, and she goes to do her novena, and says, and the mother's days, and I don't know what
and this is not a stupid woman, she's educated, she was a teacher
yes.
what I don't underst- and it's been like this all her life, what I don't understand is how she can't discern
between what she sees and the, and what's reality
I think that there's people who use it for themselves, like a spiritual escape, like, sometimes you have to release, eh, anxieties, frustration, and
yes, to me, but when I want, yes, but when I was to release something inside me, inside of my spiritualism I talk with God directly
Sure.
And I tell him my problems and, and my anxieties, and, and what I want for me, for my kids
yes.
I don't have, I don't need an intermediary.  I don't need a translator
Sure. yes, besides, they give them the title intermediaries, but
yes, yes, yes, yes, so if you don't
Let's say, that they're intermediaries
If you don't come to my church, my church is better than the others, and if you don't come to my, uh, for, because, father God everything that you do, he gets mad
Sure.
And if you don't come to my church, and give me money, father God won't forgive you, which is all a
No, it's No, no, yes the truth that, and well, but exactly, eh, what religion has done all through history, was to hold back civilizations, to not let them advance
How many people dur- eh, throughout history have dies in the name of God
And yes.
By mistake.
By mistake, logically.
The crusades, well, they're crusades, my God.
yes, yes, yes, that´s why I believe that there is always people trying to take down other people.
to keep them subjugated and dependent of others.
We are being used by a group of people.
that is a shame, Of course.
that is good but they take the word of God as if they really had it.
No, they have an schedule
yes
then the only ones left are are us.
yes
that to me is inconceivable and unacceptable, Leticia
yes, yes.
Its been about 20 years since the last time  I went to church. The new opinion of the Catholic Church is all avre the the news.
now they are going to start inspecting those who want to be priests and they will find out if they have had homosexual activity in the last three years.
No, I didn´t know that right?
And all those who are already in there that will they do with them I just wonder?
Of couse,like child abusers, and
well, that´s where I stopped going to church 20 years ago,  when all of this came out and the attitude which they assumed was not good.
of course.
hey, Rome
yes
Right?, that they tried to put it in, uh, hide it under the carpet and, to me, you can do whatever you want, but don't touc-, i don't have children, sweetie, because i didn't want to
Yes
but don't touch the children
Yeah, logical
But i don't have children, it doesn't mean... do you have children?
No no
well, just because you and i don't have children, it doesn't mean children aren't also our responsibility
No, of course, they're helpless, i mean, they're, they're unprotected
Exactly, it's innocence in the flesh
Sure
So, for a beast, a sick person
Sure
To come, and then the church backs them up, and on top you want me to give you money?, are you insane?
Yes, yes, yes, and many times they also take advantage of the lack of education right?
Exactly, of the weak, of people's weaknesses
Yes, because we see that
Hi
Hi, what?
Hi, it's Lourdes
Hi Lourdes, I'm Arturo, nice to meet you
How are you?, Nice to meet you
Where are you calling from?
From New York
Oh, ok, you're very close
Yes, yes, yes, and you?
I'm in Philadelphia
Oh, near, yes
Yes, uh, do you have a son?
Yes, and i was trying to
Uh, well, well, well, Hello?, no
Hello?
speak
Oh, good, look, it was
Lourdes
that, I'm carrying the boy and i pressed the wrong button and i
yeah
I put you on hold I am sorry.
Oh, it does not matter.
Well look, I think that eh, if we all were of the same religion
Aha
we always would have an excuse to fight one against the others
I totally agree.
so I won´t say that religion is necessarily
Absolutely.
the reason of
No. Yes, no, it is, it is the excuse, so lets say, so the religion if, if it is something very evident and specially when you have like a
lets say, so, very drastic meetings, like, lets say, the extremist Muslims right now, in western regions, so
Hmm, hmm.
eh, it is very noticeable, do you understand me, the difference a Muslim is very easy to be recognized and, and as it could be hate in a situation like the actual one no
Of course.
but undoubtedly if don´t, if we were all of the same religion it would continue existing so much difference, because at the end religion also is what, the, what makes
it is the community that practice it, if you understand me, so the
Of course, of course.
the feature is, is who, who is following it, the, the religion, at the end we are based in the same principle
Of course.
all, that there is an omnipresent being who made all
Sure, sure.
and even then you see all the difference there is essentially, I mean
Sure, sure. And, and the other is that even, for example, the Christian right-wing group that
Mm.
that put a bomb in a clinic, for example where they provide abortions
Aha.
I mean, they are as dangerous as the
The extremists.
Muslims extremists, what happens is that the
Yes, sure.
that since we are more used to them, we don't realize who they are and and they don't wear different clothes and don't
Yes. Mm, yes, yes they are, not so notorious.
yes, you know, they have Exactly, exactly, and Oh as far as, they ask as far as the topic of sexuality
Aha.
and the homosexuality, I think that eh eh, is one of the things that that concerned me a lot that they base the hate
towards the homosexual people in, for example, in
The, the motive is religious, right?
things that the bible say. Exactly, is something that, that scares a lot.
Yes, me, the other day, I was in, in the subway here in Philadelphia
Mm.
and there was a pretty crazy man there that came, i think, from  evangelists
Uh huh
from, from the evangelist church
Uh huh
And, uh, he was a, i mean he was black, i mean, without racial connotation, right?, just
sure
well, a black person, but he was albino, he was a black albino
Uh huh, right
And this man was screaming like crazy inside the metro about the bible and religion
Uh huh
And, and, and he said
Uh huh
"watch consumerism, how it has distorted all our images about love", and he said "love is what will save your life, love each other"
and suddenly he turns around and says "homosexuality is wrong, it's wrong, watch it however you want, justify it however you want, but it's wrong"
Uh huh
And then i, then i felt like turning around and saying "wait, i don't understand you
didn't you just say love each other?
are you preaching that everyone should love each other and now you're saying that they can't love each other because it's wrong?, that's not, i mean, what's wrong with their love?, i mean
Sure
If they found love in another being from the same gender, so what?
Sure.  Exactly.
What happens is that also, I think that, for this, if I justify homosexuality, we say that I defend it
Aha.
But then it also bothers me too to see that there's also so much debauchery, you know?
Sure.
And this, this bothers me, because
But there's heterosexual debauchery too.
Exactly, exactly, it's a little the same but it's
You know
in the same way that heterosexual debauchery isn't accepted, I say
Ah.
if I have a girlfriend, I'm not going to go out in the street, and, be really graphic, you know?  In my physical relation
Sure, sure, sure, sure.
in the same way I hope that homosexuals behave a bit more socially, I don't know, like, like they understand, no?  that
Sure.
that, like, they're happy because they finally have the possibility to, to communicate it more openly, but, rightly, that they're not so
That, that they respect.
Yes, that they respect a bit, but I think that this will also be something that with time right now, every time it's a bit more smooth because
Sure.
because everyone's starting to understand, like, for example a place with cities where there's more homosexuality, where it's accepted, you see that they're more discrete and calm because
Sure, because they don't have to be
no, yeah, aha.
fighting for to, to find a place in society, no?
Exactly, yeah
and so, when you don't have to fight, well you live your life, almost normal like
Calm.
like, like everyone else, no?
Yes, that's what I've noticed.  But but yes and well this, what more can you say?
I think that that he, yes, we will understand that religions are all different paths to get to the same, the baby's putting his hand in his mouth, wait, sorry.
Take our your hand.  Eh.  That there are, that they're are paths to get to, to the human beings to
The same end.
to the same end, no?
Yes.
eh, like, like whatever they call it, no?
Yes.
God, or Allah, or a supreme power, or
Or simply death
or, or yes, exactly, exactly, or
because, because there are people who really don't believe in anything, they only believe in death and so, and so it's
They don't even believe in electric lights
yes, well, yes, who knows?
Like my mom would say.
Ah, yes?
Yes, my mom says, ah, those people don't even believe the electric light because since the, the electricity is not something that you can see, right?
How amusing. Sure. no, It just appears by a
exactly, and there already
Ah.
so, eh
But she would tell me if
if you think about it, is more the things in common that the religions have if you think about all the things they have in common
is more the things they have in common than the differences.
Yes, absolutely, mm
because they all have a code of values they all have a series of deities and of or of saints or of people eh, who they admire
Mm.
they all have a, a series of eh eh, life rules, exa-
They all have the illusion of life after death or, or the
Exactly, or, or of , or of
or the eternal life.
or an code of, of ethics, you understand me
Sure, a civil code, right? of how to behave.
one, there will be differences in the, in what the codes what the specific regulations say but in general, the fact is that, the, the religions are more similar than different
it's something that it's not always, I mean, it's not always mentioned.
Yes.
I mean, they highlight the differences.
Mhm.
instead of the things that religions have in common.
Yes, yes.
So, it seems to me that up to a certain point, it's something that people that run, that run some religious groups feel that they need to keep the power.
Mhm.
and well, it's a way for them to control that power and a way to control
That's it. Sure. The religion.
of, look, how different we are instead of
Oh, sure.
I mean, how similar we are.
Yes, the, oh, what they criticized a lot of the, the, the government of Bush, no? That he kept control through terror, through fear of terrorism.
Mhm. Sure. Sure.
and, and, that has, you can see it throughout history, in lots of different times, I mean, it's been the same.
Sure.
the only way in which Hitler was able to get so many followers, for him to do whatever he wanted was to put fear in the, of him
I mean, the Jews, they are corrupting our people, they were afraid of a foreign enemy, the Jews.
Exactly, exactly.
it's the only way in which he was able to convince everyone to do something so brutal
Sure.
no, nobody would have listen had they been told, what are you talking about?
Sure, that's crazy.
I mean, why am I going to kill them or expel them from my country? I mean
Sure, sure.
any other, but not with terror, with that factor, no? Of making them look like enemies and then everyone backed him
Exactly, look, that's one of the things that, in my opinion, I rather talk about spirituality and not about religion
Yes, no, lets call it intuition, no?
because to talk about, exactly, if we talk about spirituality, I mean, I'm I'm Catholic
Yes.
but I don't have a problem on attending an Episcopal, Presbyterian or a Charismatic Evangelic service
Aha.
or, or, to a temple, to Buddha, I mean, I
Yes, no?
because it seems to me that, oh, like, it seems to me that we have lots of things in common, oh, and spirituality is something that unites all of us
Yes, exactly, you find harmony.
well, no, I'm not afraid of it, I have no problem with, with sharing with people of different religions.
Sure. Yes, no? I agree with you.
And, and i think that by creating institutions and creating, uh, those people, you know, they're human, they're not
Yes
necessarily like god came
No, sure, no, no,
And left them flat, but god left some ideas in the world
Yes
And every group of people decided they were going to
uh, they started interpreting them as he, as they understood them and they started to make the rules they wanted
Oh, exactly
Yes, and to, and in the end, i mean, the, the bible that, that's used now in catholicism, as the word of god and all that
it's nothing more than a compilation of one of the, i mean, the, i believe it's the, Pope Pius, i don't remember, uh, but after the fall of the
Constantine, the gate and
Uh huh, uh huh
everything, and the whole Moors invasion and all that, uh, they started finding that there was too much paganism, let's
Sure, sure
say, the romans, right?, and so they said "we have to, we have to defend it somehow", so they fixed many of the practices and many of the
the, lets say, the gospels and all that, and they started fixing them so they would say exactly what they wanted, do you know what i mean?
Sure, sure, and, also, also, the omission of books
And, and you have to understand, uh huh, give things
And add, exactly
and that's what happens, so that's why, just like you, I prefer not to get too involved with the institution, and, let's say, being
absolutely Catholic Apostolic and Roman, right?
Sure
it doesn't, it doesn't interest me
And the rites too, because rites are a way of giving continuity to the institutions and so on
Yes
and it was not God who one day said, ok, these will the rites this is the agenda you will follow every time you honor me
Sure
No
Yes, and you know, I am starting to get annoyed about a thing, for instance eh I come from Mexico, Mexico City, there I lived
Aha, and my husband has a Mexican father
Oh, is he? So
Yes
Well, so, there in Mexico I faced that the society is very, mm, very Catholic
Yes, yes
Hi, I'm Alfredo and i'm calling from New York
How are you Alfredo?, you're talking to George from New York too, what's up?
Hi, very good, very good
Well, that's the subject of the day, religion, what o you think?
Yeah, uh, well, I'm with the opinion that religion causes more division than union, it's more divided, and that's it
most of the people die in, uh, uh, wars
Uh huh
caused by religion, by differences, even if they're small
Yes
they have beliefs, uh, and I'm not a believer
Um
Uh, uh, uh, in a being that wants us to pray to him uh
yes
so i, i think there may be, yeah, if there was a God i don't think he's interested in whether i, Alfredo, uh, go and recognize him, no
Um
i mean, i thin it's like a pretty humane feeling and it would be a weakness
Uh huh
A being so vain that wants people to revere to him, right?, well, I'm not a believer and i feel that religion is
Yes
harms a lot and that's not my position
Uh huh, yes, yes, i think that all of the world's religions have the same idea, right?, they have only one god, with different names, they practically believe the same
but they call things differently, in a different way, right?
Yeah, but for example there are also
and
they exclude people, for example
um
the Jewish religion, that's more a race than a religion, i mean, you're a jewish
Yes, uh huh
if your mother is jewish, if not, you're not
Yes, uh huh
Uh, other religions, for example Christianity, are you christian?
Uh huh
Uh, Christianity, if you don't believe in God, you're going to be judged by god himself, right?
Yes, uh huh
So i find it hard to believe that a God will think "Alfredo, who doesn't believe in me, but has been very kind"
his generous life, he never lies, he's honest, uh, he's gonna be damned when other
um
that kills someone but shortly thereafter changes his life and asks God for forgiveness
Yes
uh, is going to be forgiven and he will
hmm
to accept Jesus Christ, that's what the religion says, that if you accept Jesus Christ as your savior you're forgiven
yes
so it's difficult for me to believe in this, you know, and I think it's better
yes
since I believe that religion was created by man to also, to yes, to control
hmm to dominate, hmm
also to, how it's much more comfortable to think that there's this story, to think that we don't know, for example, where we come from
yes
now what happens is that I would love to be able to believe and I would love to have this
yes
eh, this curiosity satisfied, no?
hmm
satisfy this curiosity but if you tell me that God created us I have problem so, well, and who created God?  So I can't resolve the problem it keeps being
unexplained this part, so well, ah, there you are
yes I'm not
but the large part of wars are for religious reasons, do you agree with this, yes?
yes yes hmm, yes, no here they thank God every time that they win a war and at a war
yes yes
that's no more than killing people, invading other countries and not seeing how the criminals until they confess and give themselves to God ask ask that they pay well for their crimes
it's something curious, right?
Yes, yes, but it's unbelievable
that the greatest criminal is very devoted and they, right?, they pray to god so they'll do fine, right?
Yes, it's funny
Yes, i, i
well, and for example, what do you think about the christian coalition with the right, the political right of the United States'
Um, yeah, right, that's, that's something that
what do you think about that marriage
Um, that's something i came to find not long ago reading and yeah, analyzing things completely, you find that here
it's called The Christian Coalition in English
Um, yeah, right
Right
Yes, where it's said that every
So they support each other and it has a lot to do on the abortion subject
yes
since they're anti-abortion
Um
Uh, so they got together with the republicans, but the republicans also have both values
yes
they don't have values of having, for example, social programs
mm
but rather cut social programs education, health, things that are, things very against the Christian values
uh basically Bush yes
the real Christian values then
and practically Bush was re-elected by the most religious states
yes, precisely by this coalition there is between the right
it was basically because of that
that Bush is from the right
mm
ah and and the Christianity
mm
God knows and I think that for me that is very eh strange because the Christian values are not
mm
for example they are in
mm, yes, mm
I mean they support the death penalty that's not a Christian value, only God should make that type of decision, a man should not kill
mm, yes
then the truth is that for me religion is very false and eh
yes definitely
and I respect that the people believe whatever they want but when I see that they control them and see that wars are formed and see that there's
mm, manipulation
that that say in the middle of an AIDS global epidemic
yes
the pope is saying not to use condoms that really bothers me
mm yes
that's why I'm almost anti religious
and I I I well I'm atheist
I'm atheist also
yes that is my clash with God that goes
yes
yes I really don't believe in any religion I think that the religions are I don't know part of the manipulation of the state right is the way of managing the masses, mm
yes exactly
of attending mass of brainwashing
yes
and and do any act any crime in the name of religion, isn't it true?
yes sure listen then you think that the homosexuals will go to hell
yes yes I don't think so I don't think so and that is a double, is a double now is a double standard no because I think that
yes
many of the big or not the big but the senior executives and politicians of many countries nowadays are homosexuals
yes
then but so they have to be able to keep there to be able to keep votes well be covered right?
aha
yes yes yes have you noticed that? that there's a lot a lot of high officials are homosexuals, mm
mm
but well openly they don't recognize it right? because well it goes against the religious principles that they supposedly defend right?
yes
then so yes I think now I think the solution is not a single religion neither right? or what do you think?
yes sure and and that's one of the points that they also told us to make but eh eh but let's answer the question one single religion
in the whole world, do you think there would be less conflict?
no I don't think so no I don't believe that is like if there was a single government at a world level
right?
mm, it would be the same situation, mm?
yes okay
yes I was reading last time I was reading a book that talks about the different religion of how well especially when one knows people of other religions
well to not disrespect them even if you don't agree with what they practice or what they preach right?
yes
and that book analyzed that really all the religions have the same basis the same foundations but however they kill each other for that right?
eh the differences are small but when-, but
they are really very small, is more the fanaticism what leads to create great differences that really what the religion of each one is based on
and you think that automatically look for example eh the conservatives have been associated
Uh huh
With conservative religious, i mean, the conservatives
Yes
religious and the, and the politicians, right?
sure, uh huh
in the same way
but
uh, do you think the same thing will happen on the liberal side?, for example, you are a liberal person
Um
yeah, would you consider yourself a liberal?
yes
yes or no?
Yes, but that they would unite with who or what?
I mean, i want to see if the rest of the stereotype is valid with you, being active, being liberal about other stuff, for example
Yes
that you're open to homosexuality, uh, you think you can abort a, uh, do you thing that aborting a baby, a fetus, is murder?
it depends, it depends of the way it's done and the time
yes
the next day pill is now up for discussion, right?, where many analyze, they say it's an abortion, many say that it's not an abortion
Scientifically, it seems it's not an abortion, because the ovule hasn't, hasn't been fertilized, right?
yes
but the people close up and send this type of things well in one way or another scientifically they try to explain and give them a satisfactory explanation for
for for the ones that believe that is an abortion is a crime right? mm
sure me I'm obviously
but I respect, I really respect the position of every of every person really homosexuals not homosexuals I really respect the position of every person
eh what happens is that there's a type of homosexuals for example the type that is very effeminate that is very that is more woman than a woman
I say that's not a homosexual that's a degenerate, mm?
yes aha
mm but I think that homosexuals yes because really there are people that are born and since he was born has felt of the different sex right?
yes
and is a very respectful person and it's a person that that is not well openly showing that he's a homosexual and that is this and another that is dressing in an exaggerated way and kind of these things
okay are you talking about when they march or in general?
the case of the homosexuals, what?
when they march on the street?
no not when they march, no in general look for example we are talking of beauty at least I'm Colombian I don't know from where ah one sees for example the hairstylists or yes
they are very effeminate, I mean they are beyond effeminate are more
yes
are more effeminate than a woman, mm?
Good evening, Patricia speaking.  With whom am I speaking?
You're speaking with James, Patricia, New York
James, good evening, I'm in Wilmington, Delaware.  What country are you from?
I'm from Panama.  And you?
Me too.
Don't tell me
yes
don't tell me
Tell me, do you think that religion is used to divide or to unite?
it depends, it depends Patricia, it depends because, um, I think, for example yes, if, if you're Jewish and I'm Christian and we get married, we will have to unify, there will always be the separation
but if we get married and I'm Jewish and you're Catholic and we get married
so yes
I imagine that as adult and intelligent people
aha
before getting married, this topic must be resolved
resolved, yes, but, at the beginning for example, I went out with Jewish people and the topic never came up, until, until after the relationship had already advanced
aha
so, I'm seen cases, for example with people who haven't ever brought this up, and when the kids come a separation forms
there's a lele, lele
yes, I go, or he brought him to the mosque, or he brought them to the temple, or he brought him to the church, you know, and I've always seen this in interracial marriages
more than anything, then the religion unites us when we are of the same belief, but when we are not of the same belief like it separates us, like it separates us a little
I think that the organized religion is good to unite, right, but then within each let's say organization, within each organized denomination then there are these fanatics that exist
aha
who are the ones who cause the social discrepancies
aha
right, whether is destructively like we see with the extremist Muslims
yes aha
eh like we see with the born again Christians, according to them, that they want, they want to stick their religion down your throat, whether you like it or not
aha
I'm also, I think that the religious leadership of all the denominations are the ones that are wrong because they have their own agenda which is based, first of all, mainly on the money
um aha
eh, God, doesn't like, according to them God doesn't like anything you do
yeah
and if you don't come to my church and give me money, God will not forgive you
yes
well that's totally wrong
yes like you say
me just like you was raised Catholic already as an adult I stopped going to church in the eighties when I saw the attitude that the Vatican assumed with these priests that were molesting the children
aha
and for me that type of conduct is totally unacceptable, because despite the fact that I never had kids intentionally I don't want the say that kids, my neighbor's kid, are not my responsibility also
exactly
the security, the child is not also my responsibility
um
then when I saw that attitude, I said, well until here I came with these people um. I am spiritual, I am not religious, I do not go to any church
I talk to God in the privacy of my home
aha
I tell him my problems, anxieties, my wishes, I want this and if it is the best for me, if it is what you want, you are going to give it to me, I do not have a doubt of that
aha
but then that people well they want you but I think this is more a brainwash that they give you at church and then, go and convert more people so they could bring more money
aha
What is you opinion about the Vatican´s attitude, eh with relation to homosexuality?
well I really disagree with that yes
that is a dumb thing
yes they take, if they want to follow the, the Catholic bible, Catholic bible has some verses that forbid all that homosexual activity
then where, where, where are we going? because there are verses there
no but you know the last thing they have said
tell me
eh, everyone who wants to be a priest is going to go through a psychological test to see if he has had homosexual activity
to me that is a, that is the most absurd thing that I have heard in my whole life, I don´t know what are they going to do with the ones they have inside
yes exactly, because they are not going to show anything in the test, the test is not going to show anything
Of course, of course not
And the, the, what it's going to do is take the catholic church to a depra-, no, not to a dishonor, to a, a
they're no only going to have frustrated homosexuals in the closet
Right
but they're also gonna have a little bit of hypocritical liers
exactly and
So, what's the purpose here?
The, the, i think religion is, religion is something that separates men, honestly, yeah, it separates men
you think?
and, like if i had a different opinion than yours it could separate us regarding something
not necessarily, i think that's the individuals mentality and, um
i think that the belief
the degree is not necessary, the education degree is not necessary, although it does help a little bit, even though i only have a high school degree, a high school diploma, but I'm a person that has read a lot about
yes
i have tried to, to take advantage of every opportunity that god has sent to me
right
right?, and i don't consider myself a dork despite that
yes
uh, but if you and me, if i see that our religious beliefs, and i don't bring the subject, if i want your friendship
Uh huh
So, i know it's a subject i must not bring up, like politics
yes, exactly, but there will always be, uh, there will always be, there will always be a matter that lightens this up
right?
I mean, lets, lets say you don't eat pork because of your religion
right
And i sit at the table and suddenly we go to a restaurant, and i order that, so you'll get offended, do you understand?
but the, the belief, yeah, the belif
No, i don't think it's like that, uh, James
Yes, the, the
that fr example if you invite me to your house and you know that i don't eat that, them because you're the host and you want to invite me to your house, you would make an effort not to serve me pork
Um, right, the belief itself, the belief of, for example i have Jewish friends, i have Muslim friends and i respect them in a way, i have gone to
me too
to places with these people and, uh, i eat what they eat, even though i don't like it
Exactly, but thank god i come from a poor house, i eat whatever they put in front of me
Right, so, but there are people, i mean, rel-, for example the belief of not only one god, but a trinity god, make us, uh, gets us closer
but religion, by submitting us to a certain
but that's organized religion, you see, they have their own agenda
Yes, that's it
And it's mostly to get our money
Uh, so, we, an organization that practically wants to submit us to a pace they can't even
Subjugate, the word is subjugate
Yeah, that not even they can, they can
they can't live up to the standards they imposed themselves
Exactly
that they impose to the population themselves
so the belief unites us, but religion separates us
it separates us, exactly, i completely agree
That's what i think
do you think that if there was [only] one religion, would that be the best?
If there was [only] one, no, i don't think so
Me neither
But that, if, but the, the individual, like you say, you don't have your religion but you're spiritual, i, i think I'm on the same plane, i believe i'm spiritual, i believe in god the father, the son and the holy spirit
I believe that Christ died on the cross for mankind
exactly
i believe that, i believe that you [can speak] to him or the father without, without having
i don't need no translator, i don't need no intermediaries
That's it, exactly
And like told you before, specially not one that charges me
and i read my bible, and if i have to go to the church, i go to the church, if i have to go to another church, i go to another church
but the belief in me is towards, it's god, it's, it's
exactly
and and I don't have anything against other religions, however, if they start attacking the other religions, then I do get away from that
I leave,
you understand, well, so I say, one has its beliefs but religion separates people
I'm look, this is the first time that I've ever heard this and I completely agree with you.
Panamanian, you are a Panamanian, I believe I had to discuss that same subject with someone else when I first started with this, oh yes, yes, yes, he was a guy from Canada and he, he didn't agree with that
I believe that we had to discuss this subject but when I started to talk about homosexuals in Church
aha
oh no, he was the one that touched on that homosexuality subject
and he went ballistic
yes, he told me, I told him, you are Catholic, let me tell you something, bring your Catholic bible over here and tell me, find one versicle that is clearly against homosexuality and he told me, that the homosexuals
or the people that sleep with other men are not going to heaven so
and he told me that lesbians
no, no, lesbians
that's, I've never read anything like that in the bible, that book was written by other men
oh yes, the bible was written by men but it was inspired by the Holly Spirit and I'm going to tell you why I think this way
that's right, so, for example, I quite sure that there were lesbians back then
and if you think about those times
so, why didn't they talk about it, in that sense
oh well, I believe, I believe that there must have been but it doesn't mentions lesbian but it does say that people that have
homosexuality and that's it
that, aha, yes, that has changed the natural use of women, that has changed the natural use of their organs
I see that it's not for gener, but for eh, eh for
yeah globalization, generalizing
that you have that, that eh there is no, I don't know what the word is, that you have that inclination
yes
they don't speak of men, or women, but about the inclination
exactly, so, not only, I don't know if you ever read Somos, eh, Somorra, Dmoda and Gomorra
yeah aha, Sodom and Gomorra
Hello
Hi, my name
uh, my name is Gloria, from here, California
Oh, nice to meet you Gloria, i live in Toronto
Right
Yeah, and, well, religion, what do you think about religion?
Well, to me, my personal opinion, i have gone to a lot of churches and sometimes there's a lot of racism, a lot of discrimination, right?
racism, in churches, uh, i never knew
Right, i, yeah, i have attended one here where i live, and they're always looking if you're well dressed, how are you dressed, if you have a car or not, so
sometimes it's only good for, to alienate you from the knowledge of the
Right, that's when religion is fake, right
Believing in you, right
What church do you go to?
i have gone to like, what's commonly named christians, evangelical a lot, right?
Right, right
But not all of them are the same, because
No, no
i have gone to others too, where the love shows, well, just going into the door, the person welcoming you is very different, right?
It's true, it's true, yeah, like you said, i go to a church that's called Jesus of Nazareth, it's international
Uh huh
sometimes people rather humble and too preppy
yes that is truth
some people do not know of humility, some people are very friendly, their hearts are noble and good.
mhm yes
I've also had people who have differences
There are religions where you cannot say your opinion as the Catholic and evangelical.
I have not visited any other church, only the Catholic and Christian
okay
I can not say that all are equal, because if I had the support of some of them
okay
when we feel bad, we always look for someone with more knowledge
okay, yes it feels good to go to church
mhm
the churches have their own opinions about themselves and always confuse people.
confuse it with that, mhm
I think one has to personally read the Bible
yes
some people say that it is dificult, but
the scriptures say it because they will find eternal life
yes it is truth
So, more than anything the bible is our guide.
It's true, it's true because
Because religions let's say that oneself, the same man, let's say, has put a division in the religions, but God is only one, no.
And to me- it doesn't seem that, sometimes there are religions like the witnesses, the Christians, sometimes they give one to the other, they say that they believe better than the other group.
hmm, hmm, hmm
it doesn't seem this way to me because when God comes he won't come to religion but to people, right.
hmm,
to the hearts of the people because I think that people in all the groups that there are who have a love and obedience and a fear of Jes- of God, right.
hmm hmm
So it's that on the final day and I don't think that it will be a religion but it will be in the hearts of the people.
It's a part, I don't know, but maybe I need to study the scriptures more, or read the bible more fully because sometimes when you go to a church and they preach something, sometimes you get scared, I've been one who has listened to something, and my God, and you see that night and I, so.
So it's good to read to not get confused.
aha, aha,
because I've heard many predictions that say that wolves were come dressed in sheep's clothing.
It's true, and they will say that this is who I am and not to trust them, and
Right, aha, aha
and this is why we as Christians, have the responsibility to read the bible.
We have to prepare ourselves.
yeah, we have to prepare ourselves by reading the bible so they don't come and trick us, to know which he is
yes
you know what's true, what's attached to the word of God.
hmm
yeah eh, And do you think that they use religion to marginalize?
eh, no no, not religion itself, but those who go sometimes to the church
ah the people.  To marginalize groups like
eh, eh, I've seen many case, I'm not, let's say, a millionaire person but I'm not on the street either, thank God he has always protected me.
aha
but they always say, how much do you have?  These people.  And since there's always, in a church in a religion, like a house of prayer, there are always people, always weeds there as they say.
oh yeah yes
true they're not doing things like they are in reality.  So I say, to go to see what bad faces or to go and do less of whatever, I say, better to stay at home and no one will look down on me.
Ah in my mind I ask God to protect me, to go with me, and
yeah
everyone says that you have to, right, clean your own house.
yeah but I really don't pay attention to these people who talk badly.
hmm
because they can't be a stumbling block for you.  Don't let them, you keep,
yes so
searching, keep looking for the truth.
hmm
Ignore them, say hi to them to be nice, ignore them, better to pray for them that they don't keep giving a bad example to the non believers, the non believers can think, oh, this is what Christians are like, like you, why should I go to the religion, better to stay at home, but
mhm m hm, maybe it is wrong, right?, not facing the situation and asking God for
of course, because even if you ask for the person or try to teach them, rigth?
mhm
but anyway, do you think that the Bible condemns homosexuality in religion? It is true, the Bible condemns homosexuality
That's why God made both men and women
yes, that's right
When He cre- when Adam and Eve where in Paradise, it was a man and a woman, it was not two men or two women
come on
But, you see, here they have already approved, eh, here in California that homosexuals can already marry, so,
oh, here in Toronto it was the first city, after Europe, Toronto has been the first city to approve
aha, so, I think that we are already living the last times, right? the last days
yes, it is terrible
when even the sons rape their mothers, eh, hit their fathers and so on, we are already living the end of times
the situation has truly become
yes, yes there is discrimination, right?
yes
about homosexuality, yes a big discrimination, we are nobody to judge but it is not normal to the eyes of God
yes, almost all religions condemn it, right? I think that Muslims, I had had the chance to talk with them, condemn it, there is no religion in the world that approves
mhm
and I have seen that in the Catholic church there are
And there are priests, that there's a priest who is homosexual.
priests, aha, homosexuals, yes imagine, how they pervert the
yes I mean that, for example no,
the word of God, aha, is terrible right. yes, so, the world is collapsing, the religion,
uh, we are seeing things, never seen before,
Yes so, the religion is a medium of, of discrimination I think that yes and I think that the false religion will make mistakes, remember that the religion,
we is you know for all the human beings.
mm
is governed, is ruled by the human beings, and the human beings are so imperfect that
mm yes there's nobody who's perfect.
and, and that, and that yes there is a religion in which the discrimination is very open and that then is wrong. because is not like that because remember that Jesus came for the sick ones.
mm
And then that religion is false one has to study, scrutinize, and withdraw move aside and search, but now since there are so many is quite confusing, here in Toronto there are a bunch of churches one doesn't know where to go already
Everywhere is the same, there's a lot perhaps a lot let's say from the part who has more humility to the one who doesn't have,eh, I don't know that honestly I say that the place they are using, the place that they are using, they should leave it to someone who really needs to search for God
yes, yes, is true
But mm I can't give my opinion about the rest of the religions because the truth I haven't, attending anything, the one I did attend once, was that of the Mormons.
oh
then I did see that they celebrate Halloween night they find a celebration for everything, satanic things, for me is not normal, being
oh The Catholics also celebrate Halloween
but what good is it then being in church, perhaps they mistreat the woman, they go to inappropriate places.
yeah
well then we are fooling are ourselves
yeah it's that eh, in the catholic religion remember that when they forced it on us eh, it was because they forced it upon us, the colonizers forced it upon them it was one of the first religions that arrived
mhm
eh, the pastors, the priests, the parishes were those who could read the Bible, the people couldn't read. And that's how the Catholics got used to going to mass to listen and continue mass, and Sunday yes it's that we feel remorseful so we go again
mhm yeah mhm the only day that they go is Sunday
and then Protestantism was born
it's the only day that they go to Church that they need a Chuch it's on Sunday
the Catholics, yes, yes, and after they continue with their lives, there's very few that really enter into a full religious life so then they don't know what, they haven't come to understand that for example that the saints don't exist
they shouldn't
no well they have to worship images, if everything is devlish, it's all like surrender and pledging to the enemy, right
eh, to pray to the sure, and that, and that Halloween is Satanic. yeah, yeah that's true, there's even those that
mhm
Hello
Good evening, this is Patricia, who am i talking to?
Patricia
Viviana, what country are you from and where do you live?
Oh, I'm from Mexico and i'm in Baltimore
I'm from Panama and I'm living very near you, in Wilmington, Delaware
oh, near, near, i just moved from Philadelphia
Oh yeah?
So i was even closer
Tell me Viviana, what do you think about religion, do you think it's good to unite or for creating discrepancies?
Uh, to cause discrepancies
You think
Yes
Look, i just talked to someone who made a lot of sense up to a certain point. That the belief in god is good for uniting, but that organized religion is the one who causes discrepancies
Yes, that's exactly what i think, i mean, i was raised catholic
Me too
But yeah, well, we're Latin
Uh huh
But long ago i decided to move away from, uh, to move away from organized religion
me too, sinche the eighties, i consider myself a person, I'm spiritual, i'm not religious
Right, me too, and i mean, i believe in God and everything, but
Exactly
I don't have to go tell him my secrets
Exactly, i don't need, i don't need a translator, i don't need an intermediary
Right
I do my things at home, quietly, respecting others
Uh huh, yes
I talk to dad-god and i tell him of my anxieties, my problems, what i want him to give me, and i leave it in his hands
Yes, that's, that's exactly what i mean, i have a son, i have a young boy and i pray him an "our father", but to take him to the church, no, i don't want that
Exactly
Yeah, right?
No, NO, he as an adult can form his own
Yes
his own opinions, and what do you think about homosexuality and the Christian church?
Oh, well, look, about homosexuality, i think that, i mean, if we're all equal before god's eyes, what does it matter?
of course we are, of course
I mean, my, i don't understand what's the problem
Me neither
in, in, in what, what, how does it affect people
If there are, if there are two adults that love each other
mhm
they respect each other, right? whatever they do in the privacy of their room, if they both agree, whose business is that? My goodness
mhm and
I think that, that organized religion is just money
yes, right, yes
it's just about money
For instance, the Catholics, the tithe in Catholic religion you must pay ten percent of all your earnings
Can you believe it? let me tell you something that will make you fall backwards, I was hairdressing a black girl here in Wilmington
mhm
And we were talking about religion, spirituality and so on, she was like you and me
mhgm
She was telling me that her sister goes to a church with no name in Pennsylvania, and one Sunday the father told the people that
they all had to give one thousand dollars because he and his wife wanted to go on vacations
ha, and what did the sister say? Or the cousin or whatever
she was dumbfounded
oh, but what happened?
what a rogue
and did the people, did the people give him the money or just quitted?
I don't know, it seems like the event, the collect had not taken place yet
oh
But you imagine this audacity Viviana
Well yes it's a horrible audacity for each person, well, where they want to go.  And for how long besides but to me it's ridiculous, no, I don't
what you saw in Philadelphia, you know you have, you see the Spanish channels, Telemundo and univision
ah y es
And you know that on Sundays there's a Brazilian talking about a church, about services in a church on Broad Street
yes, yes, yes
And every Sunday, they give the rosary of the thousand shrines, yes, no it's the rosary, it's the golden palm,
yes
or the water of Jerusalem, that's all free.
aha
But so eh, you and I know that once you walk through that door they will take your money.
hmm
so last night I was talking with a Colombian boy who lives in Florida.  And I was talking about this, and he was telling me that he knew
of an individual who they threw, who was fleeing Brazil because the law was running after him because he was in these activities.
ha
What he was doing was money laundering, imagine.  I come and I say, well, I think that this kid in Philadelphia
Is the, is the one I'm thinking of, it could be the same
It could be the same.
ah, what a small world
Look, I say to people because I'm open like this, don't
Uh huh
Yeah, some people want to die in front of me or want to kill me, but i tell them that no one is going to screw me in the name of god
Well, no
To me, that's a more serious sin that if you killed fifty people
Uh huh, uh huh, no, i, if they ask me for money i laugh very hard and i don't give them anything
Exactly, no, i, i get out of there running
Uh huh, me too, besides
I don't, i don't even give them time to laugh, i run out of there
Yes, and besides it's an offense
What do you think about...? please
And the, the, the worse is, and the sad thing is that Hispanic or Latin American people, whatever you want to call them, aren't very educated
Uh huh
they give them money
Uh huh, uh huh
And that pisses me off a lot, because they're
it makes me hysterical
Because they're taking advantage
They're taking advantage of people's weaknesses
But, but, also most of the people that do give that money, well, you can't reason with them because they believe in their heart
that they're doing the right thing
And I respect them
mm
But don't come asking me for money.
ah, listen and the Jehovah witnesses that come knocking on your house
I don't even want to know.
ah
I don't want, I imagine, here they don't come thank God eh, in this neighborhood but I in Florida
mm
When we lived in Florida they call every weekends, after one kills oneself
ah and then they don't want to leave
from Monday to Friday, that you want to sleep a little on the weekends to come knocking on the door Saturdays at seven.
mm mm
in the morning then I would put Friday night, a sign outside my door, that said I'm Catholic, look what a hypocrite
so they wouldn't come to bother me
And they didn't bother you
imagine that my husband is Danish, no, and he was telling me that once they came to do this once when he was in his country.
mm
And I know that he got to a point that he got so mad to the point that one day they knocked on his door and he took of all the clothes and opened the door naked.
ah
And that they left running and never again knocked on the door.
Uh, it's hell there, the devil is there, i don't know, oh, so funny, so then i tell them "i'm not interested", and i close the door, my
husband, oh no, my husband
where's he from?
he's American
Right
but he's very cynical, uh, he stands there and whatever they say to him
oh God, oh God, he gives, he gives back
yes, and there's, i have seen people that, i don't know how he does that, they really stay silent and don't know what to say to him
And i laugh, and at the same time i say "i wish i was like that", uh, being able to get my own answers, very
the, the schools
my very cleaver answers and very, uh, very logical with what they tell me
I don't have time for people like that honey, and, for example, do you think religion serves to unite or to separate?
Oh, well, no, i think it separates
me too, i think, i think it's
it separates people too much
the, the organized religion, who has it's agenda
Uh huh
and the agenda is "we have to fill the chests no matter what"
Uh huh, yes
"oh, these idiots will sustain us no matter what, one way or the other"
mm Patricia, remember the last inquisition
remember the crusades my love
aha, like all the people who killed
all the people who died in the name of religion simply because of the leadership
yes for hmm
For human greed, because at the end of the day we're all human.
Well yes, I don't understand because, like, if they want to pray to their God, do it in their house, like
sure, sure, and don't try to impose
I don't understand if people who are always, who want you to talk with God, who want you
For example
hmm
I won't subject myself to anyone because I simply won't give them this authorization.
hmm
What do you think, for example, about the different religions, if you think that, that there's a difference, eh, in this saying and that, this thing that we're presenting these days
About Muslims
Not only Muslims, for example the Jehovah's witnesses, the, eh, I attribute this to fanatics in each individual denomination.
uh-huh, the, they're the
You're going to find crazy people everywhere
exactly, and there are people who are really fragile or really weak, they can be controlled really easily
they, exactly, they can subjugate
So, there's always people that
and those are the ones that get brainwashed
Uh huh, uh huh, and they don't let them
Because that, to me, it's a vulgar brainwash
Oh, if i told you, my mom, my mom just went through cancer
Oh
And, uh, and she was dying on us in the hospital, and i said, the doctor said "if you don't give her a blood transfusion, she'll die"
Right, uh huh
And the, my mom's witness is a Jehovah's witness
Uh huh
And well, he did everything he could to stop my mom from getting the blood transfusion
Oh, i can't believe you
Even though, even though the doctor clearly said "if we don't give her the blood transfusion, she'll die"
She dies
he said, "no, everything is in god's hands", uh
And since the husband has the legal power
Right?, we immediately, very smart, very Mexican of us
Um ,that
we all went and, all of the five children flew to, to where my mom was
That
eh, immediately we threw him out
well done
no, if you would've bee seen, no but, I mean I can't believe all the drama that happened just because
because he felt like it
aha, and that he's a Jehovah witness and since he's a Jehovah witness, let your mom die because is in God's hands
no, I can't accept that
ah ah my God, no I just, just hear Jehovah witness and get
God forgive me but perhaps I would've killed him to get him out
no you should've seen poor him I even felt bad the last thing, I talked to security, they took him out of the hospital, well
you have to do what you have to do, with people like that you have to go to extremes.
mm, mm
so you do what you have to do, and your mom
Good evening, good evening it's Patricia. With whom am I speaking?
Silvia good evening Hi Patrcia, Silvia
Silvia, good evening. What country are you from and where do you live?
I live in the United States, in Indiana.
And what country are you from?
Eh I'm from the United States.
And your family. What are your family roots in Latin America?
oh, I'm Mexican, but my grandparents are from, from Michoacan
Are you, are you a Mexican?
yes
I was born in Panama and I live in Wilmington, Delaware
oh, that's nice
You are, Are you called Rosa?
No, Silvia
Silvia, forgive me
oh, no that's OK
Silvia. What do you think about, do you think about religion, does it unite or divide?
For me, I say that it simply divides there are differences and opinions. Even though there are a lot of religions that have made the effort to unite us
and to have general opinions anyway, continuing onward, to me racism or the divide between the opinions especially when it comes to be your turn, to speak about
for example if someone believes that yes Jesus Christ was actually a person to, that he walked on the Earth, that God made him, there are quite a few religions, well then if that was all for religions then we would all be in agreement right,
I think that the basic foundation of religion, is to believe in God.
um uh
eh, it unites us, but that the religion organized by the leadership, of the organized religion that of course have their own agenda that's the one that divides us.
um exactly, you've said it well
that each church, say that they are the best. And that God that all you do is bad.
uh uh
Especially the Catholics.
Especially.
And that if, and that if you don't come to my church and give me money, God will not forgive you, well we all know that's nonsense.
exactly
no,
Yes because, the government gives money and I realized it.
What they want is money, mamma.
Is true because what I've seen, my job, I work selling insurance, right
aha
and for us to sell insurance, the old person or the one that has little money then one has to go to church to see if well, so that big groups meet and have
there is where, they, they the organized religion seek out the weak ones.
um exactly, because they are looking for someone,
someone who has some weakness, whether it's age, disease, lack of education.
um uh um uh
So those are the ones they go after
Exactly, i agree
Minorities
Specially when you have a financial need, well, you go to church and they feed you, they can
I'm not, I'm not religious, like you, as a Latin american, i was raised catholic
Uh huh, yes
But now as an adult, i left the catholic church in the eighties when these things about the priests molesting children came up
Right
I saw the attitude that the Vatican assumed, and i said "this is as far as i go with you", and that was over twenty years ago
Uh huh
It's been twenty years since I've set foot in a church
Yes, my mom came from Laredo, Texas, she came in a winter because there was a lot of work, so she created a family on the fifties, but the first place where she landed, i believe it was the catholic church, right?
oh, holy...
And she heard over the heater, we call it the "calentón" [heater], that
right
uh, the heat was provided by
the heate-
it's a heater that provides the steam, well, the heating
Uh huh
in that building that was a church
um
you could hear the screams
the heating
yes and there you could hear all the kids moaning, crying, screaming
I don't believe you
and my mom would notice and she would complain to the priest and would tell him
and nobody paid attention to her.
Yes, what is saying, what was happening said. Don't worry my child, that those kids
were already into the thing
he, was
Imagine
he would say no, don't believe it my child those kids need, they are naughty, they need discipline, don't worry. She went, investigated and saw that they were molesting them
I don't believe you
And she left at the time the religion But she attached herself to another one, but really she
There are people that have that need of being guided, when I left the organized religion
um uh
Well I went through a long time, that I was well, searching, searching my emptiness. And since five, seven years ago I've been reading a lot of metaphysics, which is logical.
um uh Oh, yes, yes
Is logical, this is logical.
It fascinates me, the same
God loves us all, no matter what you do, we all go to heaven, because there's no other place, I'm convinced that hell is here on earth, here is where you pay for everything, that's called Karma.
That is true, here we suffer a lot.
Ah, here is where you pay.
um uh
And you see it daily, my dear, you see it, I witness it
is true because what I've seen.
What do you think of the religion, especially the Christians? That the attitude they have assumed with the homosexuals?
uh uh I think
What do you think?
I think that really, I think. That is a difference to, in the being itself, I mean, that in one's own body, is different, I mean that they can't
that the people, that that's a physiological difference.
Correct, then they can't, change their situation, they can't control it.
control
They already have that
There are some people that opt for this life.
that, yes
And I've known people like that, that have been abused.
um uh
Emotionally, psychologically, physically by the opposite sex. And in search of love. They have found a person of their same gender,
um uh
that they have offered this and have changed, right.
um correct
And I, I think that what is done in the privacy of a bedroom. If for example is a couple of the same gender where there's love.
Where there's respect.
uh uh
What they do in the privacy of their bedroom, where there's mutual consent between two adults
um
what does religion have to do with that. They are meddlers.
Correct. Because they are people who don't bother anyone, rather
That they don't hurt anyone.
correct and to me. Oh, they are knocking on my hotel, I work in insurance
aha
Who is it? Hi, Asia I'll be right over, I'm on the phone I'll come up Okay, Thank you uh, is that I'm at work and they have me here,
ah, I'm not even dressed, I have on my nightgown. One moment.
you are going to go up with the nightgown girl Knock on the door with the nightgown and say that you are a Jehovah witness
Yes aha and will leave right
Imagine that I'm - I'm married to a European.
That's wonderful
And he was telling me.
Thank you Asia
He was telling me that, eh you know how
look - Don't look at my hairy legs. I'm so excited look they are bringing me a refrigerator here
Ah how nice.
That we, ah because we I haven't had
See mama, see mama that is love
ah yes,
individual, that you don't need religion.
wow, yes because eh, eh, that is, the idea that. How many people do you think that in reality? have to get together with one I say for one
in reality have a good relationship with Thank you so much Asia, Bye, ah, we've stayed, well. For me if you have a good relationship with God one goes in private to ask, ask whatever one wants Right?
Sure, and eh, no, like I was telling someone previously,
And uh
I do it in the privacy of my home.
Exactly.
I don't have to announce it to anyone.
um uh then no
I don't need an interpreter or a mediator. I tell God my anxieties, my problems, my desires. And I leave it in his hands, that's I'm convinced that if is,
uh
for me, he will give it to me.
How many times have we seen people that comment as far as their time in need that is life or death are asking God to help them?
That they only remember God when they need something.
And it happens to them, what surprises me a lot, is that each time that in television appears a person telling that in a moment of need I asked to
well, they say it was a death person
I think those are actors, the ones from television.
There are some, many yes, but one person, for example recently there has been on television, a person who lived in California, by the beach, very close to the beach
it rained a lot and a mountain felt over the house, the lady asked
Yes
To God for help, then in the mind of his girlfriend that was living in city about twenty minutes outside
aha
He had a thinking, he worried a lot about his girlfriend. Then he came despite what was happening. Even the police forbidden  him, to cross the street and he tried to reach there.
And the man went.
He went and saw exactly, the lady was calling him and she went out.
baby that is illumination.
um uh
see it. That was not her moment, I think that, that, death is like, like a lottery, is like a bingo, when your number appears, it does not matter what you are doing, you can be having a bowl of soup
um It is your turn. That is.
And if, your number appears, then you go.
Um uh yes because don´t have, it is waiting, you don´t know when will be your turn but, I have always think, what a thing, when you
you hurry, old age. but it is what well, when we need one, because I was raised in a very strict religion.
to,
Catholic?
It makes me laugh when I talk about the Jehovah's Witnesses, believe me, Oh how rigid! none of the holidays could we
oh no
be invited, it was a cruel life, specially for a young person
Oh no
Then we were many, we were seven in the family, and there were quite a lot of bad moments because they were very cruel with us, but then, if you
good evening, this is Patricia, Who am I talking to?
hello this is Yolanda. Patricia.
where are you from and where do you live?
I am from Texas, I live in Texas.
Is it a Mexican Family?
Well, since many generations we are from here and you?
I was born in Panama and I live in Wilmington, Delaware, In the East Cost.
Oh, okay. Wilmington yeah, is it cold over there today?
horribly
yes, we
what do you think of religion serves to unite or divide?
well, it serves for both, but divides people who does not believe the same.
oh, right now we have the situation of Muslims and Christians.
the Muslims
Mhm
the foundation of all religion is to believe in God.
okay.Mhm
It is what unites us, what divides us.
okay
what divides us is the organized religion
Correct, yes.
what we, what divides us is the individual leadership
yes.
and the fanatics, inside each denomination.
Hmm.  yes, aha.
These are the things that cause problems, those who want to put eh, eh, their religion in you
yes.
as a place.
Aha, yes.
and so, the leadership of organized religion, I think that each one has its agenda,
Hmm.
that fundamentally is to fill their pockets, this has become a business.
Ah.  Aha.  yes, well, I think that religion is like the- the politicians, ah,
Ah, exactly, you're completely right.
hmm.  Hmm, yes.  You said
The only difference is that they use the name of God.
yes.  You said really well that, ah, what unites us is, is the people, the belief in God.  And this is what un- unites people.
It unites everyone, exactly.  But, it's the, the the the difference, what divides us is
Hmm.  Hmm.
the individual leadership
yes.
of those who are in organized religion.  I, as a Hispanic,
Hmm.
I was raised Catholic, and I stopped going to church in the eighties,
Aha.  Aha.
when I started to hear that the priests were molesting kids, and I saw the
yes.
the attitude that the Vatican took and I said, well, Icame here with you,
Aha.
who wanted to pretend that this doesn't exist, and everything that they wanted to sweep under the rug.
yes.  yes.
And I said, I've come here with you.  Now I'm going to turn around, I was, and I spend many years, during which I was looking for my place,
Aha, yes.
no?  And so, and I read metaphysics, for about five or seven years now,
Aha.
and it's logical.
Aha.
It's logical, girl.  and so, well, I've found mine where I pray to God directly.  I don't need an intermediary or a translator, and much less someone who will charge me to talk to God.
Hmm.  Aha, yes.
I tell God my problems, my anxieties, my wishes, and I leave it in his hands.  Because, I'm convinced that if it is good for me, he will give it to me.
Mm. Aha.
I don't have the slightest doubt about that.
yes. Aha.
What do you think of, of the attitude of, of the Christians with the homosex- ah, eh, regarding homosexuality?
Well, ah, as a Christian person, I think that we believe that the bible is the true word of God. And, what God says,
I believe it was written by man.
ah, pardon?
I think that it was written by the man, I don't read the bible.
Eh, yes, And, but I say that. But, like me, that I'm Christian, that, that is my, ah, belief.
Your foundation, exactly.
Aha. Eh, I think that it was written by man but inspired by
By God.
the Holy spirit of God.
AHa.
Then, eh, they are God's words.
Mm.
And, and, we, as humans, want to tell the creator how we are going to serve him, or how we are going to believe him. But, such a big God, who made
Correct-
all the universe, How?
the universe.
Uhu. Well, or the university-ah, yes, yes. How are we going to call him, how are we going to adore him, or how are we going to believe him? Eh, and that,
ah, according to, he made the rules for the world to have order.
Mhm.
And, when we apart from them, ah, the rules he made,
Mhm.
then we should have, we let it open for them to come, eh, as a christian, I, as a christian, I I believe that there is a God and a Satan.
Mhm. I think that jell is here in the earth, because here we pay everything.
And, yes, but, just think that even we believe or not, the truth is that there is a God and there is hell. And we die,
we are eternal creations. Ah
Eternal.
aha, yes, eternal
Aha
And, when we die, no, the situation does not stop. We
Look that, look that metaphysics, for example, I think about the homosexuality,
Mhm
if they are 2 same gender persons, that love each other,
Mhm
that respect each other, that lead their private and personal and public lives with honor,
Mhm
which is the p- in what-what is the church role? if they are in he privacy of their bedroom,
Is the only thing.
and there's two, there's two adults,
Mm.
that, that consent what is happening,
Mm.
if they conduct their life honorably, with love,
Mm.
with the truth,
Mm.
Who is who to tell them that they are wrong?
Well, again, we want to direct how, ah, we should live. But, ah, is what you have. If one doesn't believe in, true absolutes, one can live however one wants, and for him, it's good.
And, and, and, in the natural, in the natural, How are two people going to be, ah, of the same, ah, how?
Of the same gender.
aha, gender, how are they going to procreate No, is impossible.
But, at the end of the day,
And, that,
what matters, the only thing that matters, is love. That's the only reality there is.
Mm.
Really? And I'm not referring to, to physical love, the love, no.
Mm.
Eh, the tangible love, I'm referring to what you feel inside towards yourself and humanity. That's the only , and how you behave
Mm. Mm. I
under those rules.
Aha.
Then, if that's the only thing that counts, and if you fulfill all those, those requirements,
Mm.
what you do in your private life, if you are not hurting anyone,
Well,
Who is the church to condemn you
But is not
when they, when they themselves are doing the same or worse
Mm. That's the, the How can I say it? ah, what many people say. But, is not the church, no again, is the word
Is the leadership.
of, is God's word. Is the bible that says how we should behave, or how we should live.
Look that the metaphysics teaches us, number one, that God loves us so much, that he's love is endless, that is why he gave us the power to choose.
Mm.
Right? And, then, eh, that, that God forgives us everything.
yes, mm, yes, yes, if, if, if one repents.
He, he doesn't. That's why I tell you, if there are two people of the same gender, that lead their life with honor,
Mm.
with respect, they love their neighbors, they do everything right. There are people who are born this way, and who have no control, because , physiologically, were born this way
Aha
And it has been proofed by scientist studies that the homosexuals who are born homosexual is because they have a failure in the hypothalamus. It is a
eh, hypothalamus, it is a gland
MHm
So, there are people who are born, eh, heterosexuals, but that for their experiences with the opposite sex
Mhm
Whether they have been physically abused, mentally, physically, there has been someone in their lives that has shown them true love, and then they turn to the other side
Well, what do you?
It's all about love, basically
Aha. Well, mm, mmm, you say that love forgives everything, right? then
yes, because He loves us so much
but, but, what does He forgive? what you think is wrong or what he thinks is wrong?
Oh, I don't think that to the eyes of God, mm,if you are sorry because your own conscience, God gave us an internal mechanism
Mhm
to, to tell us when we are acting wrong
Well, yes. In my mind I think that
So, that is called conscience
yes. But, my conscience, some people don't have a conscience and kills, and abuse kids. But, in their conscience, that is not wrong
Then, they have no mercy. Because, to them
This is a, yeah, a sickness.  This is a sickness.
but, but, but, you see?  This person, thinks in their conscience, that it's, it's good to do it.
That it's normal.  Aha.
But, well, again, who, who will forgive, what we said is bad, or that God says that it doesn't agree with his law?
I think, that in these, eh, special circumstances,
But, how will it be special for on person, and another person doesn't, there isn't
yeah, this, this is a degeneration
special?  This is why,
No, I refer to these people, eh, eh, serial criminals who kill fifty people, or who molest kids,
Hmm.  Hmm.
this is a psychological, or physiological sickness.  No?  There's a- a defect in the mind.
But, but, sorry?  But, how, it's the, you're saying that, ah, homosexual, eh, is also something psychological, or something, ah, me, medic-, that has a medi- ah, how do you say, medical?
Aha.
And,
A- a medical situation,
so, they can have, say the same reason, well, it's not my fault, I was born this way, I'm this way, God made me this way.
I'm convinced that God forgives them.
Hmm.  yes.  Well, so, this is why I say, when you base the, ah, your belief on different things,
yes, good evenint. This id Patricia speaking, Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with?
Patricia. This is Manuel. I'm in Orlando, Florida. Where are you?
Hi, Manuel, You're Colombian. We spoke last night.
Ah, what a coincidence.
Ah, I don't think so. I don't know. There's no. I have spoken to some people a couple of times.
For me it's the first time that I repeat with any participant.
Oh yes?
yes.
And what do you think about music?
Well, well. For me its fundamental. I, well the music
yes for me too.
I have it. I like authentic sounds very much. I mean I have a small collection of folk music.
uh uh.
I also like international music, modern, classical music. in my car I always have
Dancing music.
tropical of course. In my car there's always music and I have.
yes, I'm a bit behind in that sense, see.
yes.
yes. Im a bit behind with Latin music.
But then you don't listen to. Ah but you do listen to other types of music?
yes. of course.
Uh uh.
Eh. I like Jazz
Uh uh.
Um. I'm, I'm. this raggaeton has me enthralled.
Uh uh. It's a very catchy sound.
Do you listen to reggaeton?
What? If I listen to?
Do you listen to reggaeton?
Well, I have not bought it until now I have not eh but yes of course I've listened to it once in a while when I play the radio.
uh uh.
Eh. There's one that seems very loaded, there's one that I think it's loaded that even
It's very happy music.
But there's another one that's very nice for example the music that this guy Daddy Yankee is coming up with, I think it's good. Those sounds are very catchy and the words don't hurt anyone.
uy uh. Ah, exactly.
it's good.
Ah, I listen to everything. I like to dance. I say, as long as it can dance to it.
Sure.
I listen to it. Um. There's a type of Jazz For example, that it's like very much like Danilo Perez, it's very esoteric, it's like a bidibido
Uh uh.
I don't like that Um. What else, what else?
Eh. Classical music. I also like it a lot.
Uh. Classical music when I'm driving.
is very relaxing.
For example,long, long. I hear eh, country music
I also like rock. I like classical rock also.
Um. Rock but the old one.
Like the Spanish one I also like.
Eh. You know what I was reading the other day? That it's been scientifically discovered that in small children, for example, the elementary schools during their education well
in elementary schools if they expose them to the music, whether singing or learning to play some instrument that they do better in their grades
Really.
scholastically.
Look how interesting. There are some nice vibrations.
it doesn't seem real, right? I would've never made that connection.
yes, I have heard of it. I even also saw eh documentaries that it seems that the plants are also very receptive.
Ah really.
Eh, to those sounds. But, that if seems of the soft sound, right? And, and also certain animals. In the farms or poultry farms. When they are chicks well.
It seems they put music and it relaxes them because that little animal is very nervous by nature.
uh uh uh uh.
I mean, look, is therapeutic.
And for example, when a baby is in the belly
uh-huh.
they give the mom headphones and she takes them and they put on different kinds of music, I've heard that the baby in gestation also reacts
entirely to music, of course, and they put on classical music, soft music.
yes, exactly.
that they react favorably, the power of music seems incredible.  For me music is like an international language.
yes, it's true.
Everyone understands music.  Everyone, the majority of people like to listen to music.  And even if they don't have anything in common
eh, socially it's always the music that unites us, no?
yes, well.  Right, eh, it's universal.  Like you said it's universal.
Hmm.
I, personally, I'm very very eclectic.  I'm open to listening to any kind of music.  If there's something that I suddenly don't like, well I respect what I don't
listen to.  The only thing that I
No, and at least, at least try to find something in it.  To appreciate it
know is to appreciate.
If, if I learn something, I learn that I like this kind of music
this kind
to open my horizons more
exactly.  The only thing I don't like is when it's too loud.  When I don't like it.
when we were young, when we were young, do you remember when our parents told us that we were going to be deaf?
yes, Even if, well, even if I tell you that we never expected a lot from this.
I did.
I, I'm at, the same volume, a high volume but not exaggerated
And, for example, when I'm in the car, I sing with the radio.  You don't sing with the radio?
yes.  yes.  Sure.  A few melodies that I know.
And have you realized, for example, when you're at a red light singing you look to the side and someone's watching you
And and people watch.  yes.
and it seems to them like we're crazy
Suddenly, or suddenly, if there's a traffic jam and they're surprised and they say, why is he singing if this is unbearable?  But they do the same thing, no?
What's happening to this crazy guy?  I definitely think that music is the universal language.  We all understand each other through music, in one way or another.
And it's a way, and it's a way
yes, it's correct.
it doesn't only unify but also pacify.
yes, this is very true.
You see?  That there isn't, the other day, three years ago, I went to Panama on a visit and I rented a radio, I rented a car
and from, from the house to the airport, when we went to leave it I heard a reggaeton song that I was hearing here.  And I thought it was the most
stupid song in the world and the only thing it told you was, was reggaeton.  And the only thing that it told you
Repeated. It repeated the same chorus a thousand times?
no, it's, look how stupid, the only thing it was saying was, chacaron, chacaron.
This, a thousand times.
Talking about, eh, it was stupid that you had to be a total Mormon in order to appreciate this. Now they were playing it. And I, without thinking, started dancing in the kitchen
I was to my..
I started dancing to the sound of the 'chacaron'
Ahead. There is something there, that afterwards in a theme they can put it to that association. Eh, eh, call it manipulation or
there's something that I don't like either, hello?
uh uh
it is that many people see music and associate music to idols of mud. I don't think so. Music is not Britney Spears. Music is not Madonna
right
That's another thing, and young people associate those
And then, in that association, they want to imitate
Of course
the singers, and turn them into mud idols, like you said
And manipulate them.
right, right, I, remember the vice president's wife, Al Gore's, she joined a
Oh, yes
a program against violent music, with violent lyrics, that she said affected the children
Uh uh
in a negative way, gangster rap for instance
Mm
street gangster, right? And she said that these violent lyrics affected the young people and pushed them to suicide, and to commit acts of violence
Or, will see those of the enemy and may kill each other
but, you know what Manuel, I think that all this is related with the home. I don't think that a song, OK I accept that young people are highly sensitive
right? easily influenced, but if you give them a solid base I don't think that a song can make a boy kill himself
Or hit
or go kill someone else, right, or attack him
yes, but unfortunately this a heal of our time. A lot of young people are growing up without character enough
No. And the family unity we knew, the one we grew up with doesn't exist any more
Oh yes
the extended family already, in some extreme cases mom and dad are in jail and it is the grandmother who takes care of them
yes, the grandmother
who doesn't have the time
yes. Or is very busy doing
or is too old
or both of them are very busy earning money, that's another problem
right, right. The base, the typical family unit doesn't exist any more, and I think that's why kids nowadays
identify more with music, and use it as the example for their behaviour
That's right
it's a pity, isn't it? Because
From that subject, from that subject there are important derivations, interesting ones
No, and they scare me
yes. I think that these topics that they touch on this program, in this study are very interesting. The should expand the time.
because really yes.
To half an hour
imagine that today and afternoon we were watching my mom and I I don't know a program called chattering
Ah, yes.
which is pure nuisance
Uh uh
And then they had a Latin rapper that was singing a song that said lift you skirt up to your back imagine that, right?
That I stayed like speechless.
And the worst is that the girls the girls delighted with that, the young girls delighted with that.
And then there are kids that go and follow Ah? no, I didn't sing. I had never heard that song but that is
No no no no. I say the girls.
Ah, no and the eh
With that type of message they are happy when they are
and the guys too
When there they are underestimating the woman, they put her as an object.
they think that this the wonder of the world like to give them three slaps and tell them straighten up, right?
No, they think those are compliments.
this is a song and it already ended.
Ah, it already ended.
what this is a lifestyle, I think that they believe that this an acceptable acceptable lifestyle if somebody were to tell me to hike up my skirt all the way up to my back I swear I would smack them so hard
No, today it's any woman that should do it.
exactly. exactly. And what I wonder is that why, for example when they write these lyrics would it be good, obviously it's just for the market, right?
That's apparently what kids like today? Can you believe that?
yes, and
We're getting old, Manuel.
And the worst is that from a young age, from childhood they are listening to that, dancing to it, little kids.
Exactly. You see it on television. It's incredible. There's another show from Mexico called something, but it's a show where they put you
little kids in dancing competitions and they give them prize and what do I know? And you see these little kids, three and four years old
dancing as if they were
Tamara.
Hello
Hello.
Hello I'm Marco, and you?
Tamara, nice to meet you.  Where are you from?
Hello Tamara, how are you?  I'm in Philadelphia.
Where?
In Philadelphia.
Ah, that's good.  But from wh- from what country?
Ah, eh, I grew up in Paraguay.
In Paraguay.  Ah I'm from Argentina.
yes Ah yes
And I'm in Boston
How are you?  Neighbor.
What type of music do you like?
um.  I have one of these typical questions that you can say, any kind as long as it's good, but eh, rock in general, um
more older rock, I don't really like the new music let's say
yes
There's little new music that I like, and normally what's popular isn't what I like the most.
And now that you live in the United States, does it seem more difficult to find new music that you like, like, in Paraguay were you more exposed to music that you liked?
No, you know that really there in in Paraguay, I didn't like the music, the local music.
Hm mm
There were a couple of small groups that, I was friends with the members.
yes
and, the music was brilliant because, I think that it must be very different when you know the people who are playing
Sure
But besides that, when I came here, eh, I think that, in general, the music was almost the same, eh
And did you come here a long time ago?
eh, yes, it's been almost ten years already.
Ah, okay.
I've been here
And do you like the music in English better or in Spanish?
Always, I always liked in, in Spanish. I'm, I
Hm mm
I'm I was born in the United States, and went to Paraguay when I was eight years old, eight years old
Wow
Eh, tell me that I was there until I was twenty.
Aha
And then, and then I came here. And then now I've been here ten years. Eh, then my formative years, so to speak, was
In Paraguay
in, in Paraguay.
Sure
But, I always spoke fluent English. When I went to Paraguay I went to the American school inclusive,
Hm mm
then
And what are you doing in Paraguay, in Philadelphia?
it wasn't very different. What?
What are you doing in Philadelphia?
The music?
No. what are you doing in Philadelphia.
Ah, eh, I'm eh, studying, eh network security, eh
Aha
basically, computer things, computer things. It was always my passion.
Ah. Also.
And, with, and that one thing of music, I now, I always listen with, in -mp3
And, you download music from the Internet?
yes, I just download music from the Internet, and I put it in my phone, and with my telephone, and the, I hear it from the phone.
Aha Aha
That's what I use the most to listen I haven't used any more compact discs, the -CDs in a really long time.
yes, and cassette it goes without saying.
Cassettes, I have a few but I have a kid who's five and I think that one day I can show, I can show that there was a time when we used this.  Magnetic tape, and- everything.
yes
When re- eh yes, I don't know, if you don't remember but in the twentieth century we used magnetic tape.  We made our
Hmm
our proxy, pro, our proxy, eh, our own, eh
Recordings.
like, like music recordings
yes
our, our system of pirating music but, on a very low level.
Sure
That was really slow, it was making a cassette like being, eh, a pirate
yes
cool, eh
No, I still save all my cassettes.  The majority.
Ah, yes?
yes, they're more than one hundred and twenty.
Yeah, that, that's a lot of cassettes.
Yes, you know what happened to me, because I moved from Argentina to another country, and from another country here.  So, I took it with me everywhere.
yes, ah, and you don't only use CDs?
yes, yes.  Eh, I use, I bought, I bought several CDS, but I never bought many, because, like, in comparison with cassettes, because they're always really expensive in Argentina
yes, yes yes
And, since it came out, I mean all that of the recording of -CDs on computer, eh I stopped buying. I mean, if someone bought a disc,
eh, they would record it for me.
Mm yes exactly.
Eh, instead of buying There are, there are very few groups that nowadays I buy their compact they don't even come out good.
I was hearing about groups of
Eh,
ah, as you've seen with this of the eh with the problem of the pirated music.
yes
Eh, that sure, coming from a point of view of business, obviously is a , is a problem.
yes
Eh, is, is something illegal
yes
but is something that and, like they all do it practically.
yes, sure.
that it doesn't seem, doesn't seem like something bad. And it's hard to try to teach the younger people that that's stealing. They, they already, already think
yes
they already think that is eh normal and is the way that it has to be done. Eh
yes
seeing the peo- It was that before when we did it it was more eh, recording from a eh knowing that it's illegal, then we don't do it very open- we didn't do it so openly.
yes,
Eh, when the, when we gave a, an album of a, of a person who, we gave them the disc or something, but on a mp3, but pretty
almost under the table.
yes
Ao, for, for what could happen.  But now, today, many of the, the creatures, I sure, I call them creatures, not are older, but
ah, they do this and for them it's really normal, it's very rare for them to buy music.
And, and does your son like rock music?
yes, yes
Or, does he like other things more?
he lik- he doesn't li- the thing he has, even if he's five.  So his tastes are basically what we give him to listen to.
Sure
But, eh
So they put on Led Zeppelin since the the cradle.
Aye, how funny that you said that, So, ah, this is particularly, our favorite group.
yes, I also like
Well yes.  We went to see Robert Plant live a while ago.
Wow.  He was in Philadelphia?
yes, yes, he was here in Philadelphia.
How nice.  I went to see in Buenos Aires, when Robert Plant when he played with the Mittens once.
yes ah this is nice, and we, even
In
every still praying that they will come back to meet, er, plant with Dave and
With Jimmy
and with, and to see if there's a, what's it called, eh
The, John, Johns eh
Jappa John, Jappa John, Double John, this
yes, Well, at one time they said that the kid, of, eh, was a drummer too, that, and, they said, that he was going to play in his father's place.
Uy
But this was about fifteen years ago, because the guy played in Argentina too.
And every now and then, there are rumors that they will have  reunion.
yes
reunion tour of the group and we're always
And-
They're tempting us.
And do you have a lot of recitals there in Philadelphia?
Sorry?
Are there many rock concerts in Philadelphia?
yes, a lot, eh, here we go, we go often to, and to us this really seems
That's good.
that the music groups, eh, with this, pirating, pirated music and this, We think that the people who play music, even if they're artists, who make
they know how to do what they do,
yes
they should earn well they should earn a lot, but not to the point of being ridiculous, like look, Michael Jackson.
Sure
Eh, eh, that a person that does a good song is brilliant. That makes money for that, that makes money for that, that makes money for the recordings and all,
but that for a good song that, he makes forty five million dollars
yes
Um, eh it seems a little exaggerated already.
Sure
Eh, and, and but, one thing in genera- I did like were concerts, the majority of the music that I like the most
yes
is live music.
Sure
Recorded, live.
yes
Eh, because is that I think they should earn their money doing, eh, concerts.
yes
yes, yes every time we go to a concert we are paying what, forty, fifty, eighty dollars.
yes
For a ticket.
Sure, sure.
yes, and they have places where thirty, forty thousand people enter.
Sure
Is good, is good money. They can make
Sure, but there he who wins the status, the representative. Is not the band either. I mean the band has a cachet to who they pay at first, when they hire them to work,
That's that's another thing. I um, I I always preferred, and still prefer the groups where there's a singer, a drummer, guitarist, bass player, eh,
yes
eh, keyboarder, that basically that there are those groups I mean of people eh, that the group is basically the name of a person,
that a person that sings that doesn't write all the music they do, no
Sure
never plays any instrument,
Hm mm
no, eh, that seems to me very created eh,
Is a product.
is a created sensation, a product that would eh be, of the public companies basically
Sure
And I think, look, I prefer that I would like to see that they make more than,  because the musicians that are musicians
are musicians from the soul.
yes,
And they like the music. It wouldn't be terrible for them to go play once in a while, or couple of years, in a small tour
of let's say, of a -x number of cities, where eh, is money that they can definitely , of which they can live well
yes.
Him and his family, that I think that they should make a lot of money, because eh, because I like it like that
yes, sure.
but, but I don't think that it shouldn't be one, one song, and from that, one song will live for, with millions and millions of dollars for
eh, for always
yes
That, eh, I think that is ah, music, while I really ah, just started, started recently to buy music.
yes
Eh, the music that I was buying, buying online, eh, the, because
Do you buy on the internet more than, more than going to a record store?
yes yes yes, eh, I buy on the Internet, because you can buy one song eh, you can buy as many times a, there are few groups very few that you can count, I think with, that you can count on one hand
groups that make, that make albums which you can hear from the first to the last.
yes
The majority of the groups now, especially, have a, a sensational song, and the rest kins of for someone

oh, but you have some group, some singer in particular, something that you like in particular
Well, I like jazz a lot
oh,
And I have some jazz favorites But I like, like I tell you I like, is that I like to listen to music so much And there are so many artists and varieties of, of music that
Is hard to have a favorite, at least, for me I think
Sure, no, and is the same with me, for me Well I listen, I can listen to all type of music, I like everything

yes
I love the music, how do you get the music? how do you buy it? do you download them? how do you do it?
oh, wow, by everything ah, well before it was buying records and all -CD and all, but on the radio And well now also on the TV, one having cable you have the music stations
Sure With Direct TV obviously yes,
yes, aha and Internet I also look ah, there are many ways and well you see, I also heard a program that was of the University of here ah, of Texas

And they had ah, European style music
European
And yes, and they had many eh, different like Like you would say Middle East I don't how do you say it in Spanish
yeah

yes
yes, yes they're listening to me I hope that they don't sue me
yes Don't say anything else because they're recording
but is like that, I mean now there's the advantage that you hear a new song on the radio, you come the next day and you have it downloaded in your computer
yes, yes, is, is very true yes aha and well ah You go to places where, do you like to go to concerts and something like that?
I tell you that before, before eh, I spent much of my youth also in Ecuador
aha
And well, any concert there would be, was a concert I would go to
aha
eh, I love it Well, in that, there in Ecuador, because obviously since it's South American there were very little very little artist would go
aha
But anyways I would go to all, to all the concerts, I can tell you Spanish, rock in Spanish, hip hop in Spanish

ah, They didn't sell a lot, at that time it wasn't the reggaeton rather there was a lot of reggae
yes, aha
In Spanish also I can tell you, I like music a lot, I hear a lot of Argentinian music
oh, yes, yes that one is very nice too
there are many good Argentinian singers, there's from Spain, from Europe I especially like old Spanish rock music a lot

yes, yes
There, for concert well I would go to all of them, now that I have my obligations My kids, my wife, well the time is a little limited, right

aha yes, well, before ah, I had another job and worked at night
mm
And they always would let us use the earphones
okay
And I always had the radio well, the whole night I spent it listening to the radio and, or music or something like that but now just when, I work like thirty miles from my job
mm
And just when I'm in the car because at work there are times that on the internet I do put some local stations or something but I'm always so busy that
But I do like to have music around always playing or, or listening to music
oh, very interesting
yes, ah, I fall asleep, I put the timer and I fall asleep many times with the music ah, and wake up, well all the time I don't wake up with the music because there are times
that it calms me and I fall asleep but I always like to have music around
wow, for example what did you listen to today, what type of music do you listen to nowadays?
Well like I tell you jazz, plus I like jazz a lot and also ah, not too much classical but ah, each time in when classical music I like to hear oh, ah
What do they call it pop music
okay
Contemporary music I like to hear, more American I don't know much ah, of, since I've always lived in an English speaking community
mm
My music and all is in English but I like to listen to Spanish music is that I don't many of the artists
that's the problem.
and many times the radio stations here Well play this country music - polka all mixed and And I like it but not all the time

Yeah, the flutes, the "zampoñas", those are called zampoñas, they're called flutes, right
High zampoñas, ok, yeah, i like that music a lot
Oh yes
i do [like] that, because i have heard groups from Peru that have that style and yeah, i like it [very much], it's very [...] music, it soothes you, uh huh

I imagine it must be cold there in Boston

i found about it through it
Oh, look, i didn't know it's on Craiglist
Yes, i believe i found about it on Craiglist
Oh, that's good, well, it's really good, right?
Yes, yes, yes
And so i don't know, we have to keep talking about music or?

ah, well that's good, I thought that we had to talk on the topic that they told you
no, no, no, about whatever we want

yes ah that's good
so
you'll stay there
yes I'm staying here
that's good that's good, Texas, let's see, where is Texas, in Texas this, no
Sorry?
An Argentinian basketball player
ah yes in San Antonio, he's in San Antonio
ah, that's good, yes
eh, eh, in the Sports of San Antonio
ah wow, no idea.  Is Texas good, do you like it?
uh before I lived in Florida and I miss the climate
sure
and here you have the winter and everything but it's nice, picturesque, you have, you have some hills, a lake, it's pretty nice here
ah ah okay how nice how nice, if there was, I would like to know more of the United States since I'm here right
and there you have a lot of friends
yes, yes I've made a bunch of friends, what happens is that my sister lived here then when I came she introduced me to her friends
sure
and I live with an Argentinian friend, so luckily we made a good group of people, of friends
well that's quite good
yes, but always more than anything Latins, right
sure, sure like you don't know many gringos
no, not too many gringos in any case Europeans but gringos, no, so many
there are Europeans there
yes a bunch already
ah look
yes a bunch is very, this city is very cosmopolitan, since I then came to study
sure it must be like, like Miami, Miami is very cosmopolitan but
there's a bunch
especially of Latins I mean there's from all parts of Latin America
sure, sure, not as many, not as many Latins as in Miami
aha
let's say in Miami you speak, you speak, you can speak the whole time in Spanish
yes I sometimes had jobs that I wanted to practice English and they only spoke to me in Spanish.
sure
so
sure for that
there already, there already more English, English
there is everything, sure, here everything you handle almost everything in English the whole time, which it was very hard for me
look yes, is English hard for you?
yes is hard, I don't like it too much so
it was hard for me at the beginning but now I'm one more gringo, I mean I understand everything and I speak anything with anyone
and how long ago, did you start like that?
ha-
ah to speak well, since when? like in a year in two
um like after two years yes like at first is hard two years to, to speak well, well and after those two years I was living a year and a half in Florida and after
I came here to Texas and married an American
ah
and well like that eh that was my number one English teacher because she only spoke English.
sure is that is that the topic seems
yes, yes, if you're among Latins like it's hard because sometimes I kind of lose the English a little when I start to talk Spanish.
sure that is true, they told me that the issue if you want to learn English is to get an American boyfriend
yes or just get with gringos and try not to get with Hispanics
and but the truth, I'd rather be with Hispanics and not learn the language eh
well but since it's what you need and sometimes confront, even if it comes out bad, the words, and until the end since you're getting better,
yes it's good, it's true, I'll do this.  And what's your name?
in the beginning, Alvaro
ah Alvaro, that's good
and what was your name, sorry?
Iliana
Iliana
yes
you know at the beginning I spoke English but I didn't understand what they were saying to me and since I recently started to understand more and more
sure, sure, sure I realize this, that the, understanding every time more that counts a lot, at the beginning you think that it's nothing and after you're forming words
yes, yes they open your ears
sure it's so, this is so incredible, so well
and you, how old are you Iliana?
I'm thirty one
ah wow, that's good, I'm thirty seven
you, how old?  thirty seven
yes
you went to thirty two
at thirty two I came here, certainly
sure, ah wow, and you don't want to go back, would you go back?
yes I would, if I had enough money to live there, but if I go right now I'll be flat broke there
right, that's the point, and are you still with your wife?
sure, no, not the one here, no, neither the first one I had a son with there in Uruguay
oh, so, and where is your son, in Uruguay?
yes he is in Uruguay, I send him money every month
sure, oh, but do you see him? do you keep touch with him?
I saw hin in July, I went to Uruguay
oh, good
but once in a while, it's like once a year because it is very expensive going there, and this year for the Holidays it's not easy, everything is so expensive
sure, sure, it's not convenient either
sure
it's more convenient in low season, I can get it for half the price
aha, aha
the passage, what do you take, the Chile?
yes ,the last times I've gone on land Chile, yes
sure, it's fine, these Chileans did it well
yes, it has good prices
yes, yes, it's true, and
Good evening I'm Joe.
Hello, good evening my name is Blanca
How are you Blanca?
Fine Thanks
Where are you calling from?
Ah from Phoenix
From Phoenix, I call from Colorado.
oh, very good
Well, I practically like all types of music, as long as is not, that of, Heavy Metal as they call it, and also of that one that is of
of the, what is it called, the one that is of, of Punk or something like that.
like what?
That the one they use those, ah I forgot the name already let me think while you say something.
uh ah well, no I like all types of music, depends also on my mood. well is obvious the type of music I listen to.
eh, I like a lot, I, I like a lot, the dance music, and the salsa, I'm very tropical to pick my music.
how nice, and what music do you listen to there that is tropical.
Ah well, in my country, I'm from Colombia, the tropical music is to dance.
yes.
ah, then is like, like dance music, but, I don't like dance music, I don't like the technocumbia, nor the Mexican music, um, um, let's see, the Mexican I do like.
The romantic, the mariachi one, yes that, but, but that one
The northern.
The northern is texmex music, I don't like that
Me neither, and the one that I was trying to tell you a while back is that rap music, the rap music. I hate that one.
ah the new one, the one that they are coming out with now new
Because that one, well that one, the reggaeton also.
the reggaeton
I think that the lyric, is very, stimulates bad things, for example the reggaeton like, it demeans the women. Like sexual objects.
yes
And, sometimes they use very vulgar language, I don't like it. the music in itself, if it wasn't with that type of lyric. It wouldn't be that bad, but the lyric kills it.
yes I think, I think that for example I love the bachata but just as the bachata, many other type of music, for me, the reggaeton seems
oh, yes
that we are staying without resources, I like it for a party and the kids have fun, and while one sees them and that but I think that the great composers are staying without resources and
the great singers already don't know where to make it, because they are all making it with the reggaeton.
Exactly.
I find it sad. I love the bachata, but I think that I think, Where are you from?
I'm from Puerto Rico.
Well, I think that the Dominicans, not all, the ones that sing bachata in their majority they are non composers of music. Because they take a
The romantic music, the ballenatos, the, the music, the merengue all of it and make it into a bachata, if you look, there aren't, um, they are very few the bachatas that are
original lyrics, written in bachata.
Is true.
but all copied from, any other rhythm.
yes, the bachata is a music that I love.
I love it.  I love it with everything and that is copy, but I find it very sad,
I like the merengue, I like the salsa, I like Colombian cumbia, I like Colombian music a lot.
Okay
I'm crazy about the music of Shakira and Juanez
And of Carlos Vives.
I love Carlos Vives, also, I have records of them CDs I love them
Yes aha, yes
There's a lot of talent there
I, I love music, I'm a musicologist full time, I love it, I love the tangos, I love romantic music, I love old music, the ballads and that.
Me too
But everything in its time, and meaning, according to my mood, at the moment. If we are among friends, talking and having some drinks, like that conversing.
Maybe some ballads, some romantic music something like that more soft. But for a party, well There whatever goes. Though I have my taste, and I prefer a certain type of music in my dances
Exactly yes, I agree
The music imposes in my house when we dance the music that I like imposes, if another person brings music, we put that music also, is obvious.
that is a taste for everyone.
Sure.
But for me personally, that type of Mexican music, and, and that other, I find it so awful.
I imagine that in Phoenix they have a lot of that too, right
Oh my God here I live breakfast, lunch and dinner is that music.
Yes
everyday, everyday, that's a pity.
yes, we do have three Hispanic radio stations, one has Northern music, the other one plays a mix of rhythms  from different Latin American countries but, mostly Mexican music.
and the other one, well they play too much Reaggetton and things like that, I hardly listen to it.
the, Mexican music is very very nice, the, the mariachis, rancheras, romantic music, they have a lot of
I really like Luis Miguel's music, I love it.
aha, they have very good pop music singers and all of that, Alejandro Fernandez
yes
All of that. It really is a pity that it's not that popular here, it has so much, so much Northern music
Mexico is so big, because I know, I mean, my ex-wife she was from Oaxaca, Mexico and that state is in the last part of Mexico, down there near the South, near Chiapas and the culture is so different
um
that the culture from the State of Chihuahua, the North.
hum
The music is completely different, even their dialects are pretty different
I see
And, food, meals are different too.
everything is different, aha
yes, but I just like all of it, I play the piano and when, when I was younger I was part of some bands and things like that.
yes
And I used to play lots of different music, salsa, merengue, things like that, ballads, I loved to play ballads in the piano.
aha
For these days I have not had much opportunity because I have just a keyboard now and it is not the same than a piano like the one I had, I had a baby grand
piano, and the music that those pianos play, it is fabulous. now I am in a smaller place. Because of that I also teach that to my daughter.
um uh
Well my little daughter is only five but I teach her music.
yes
She loves the piano, she loves to sing, she has a fabulous voice for a such a little girl. She spends time singing to her grandmother "La negrita cucurumbe" ( the little black girl cucurumbe), and the grandmother delighted with her.
Well yes, Do you have sons?
yes I have two children, I have two children, I have two babies.
what a blessing, how good, how good.
I have two children and they love to dance too, since they were very young.
yes
Any thing for them is dancing, and do you know what is so particular That sometimes the tongue is the punishment, it is a say, the tongue is a punishment.
I don´t like northern music my son. he hears it and begins to dance, he loves it. And I, what a plain taste my son has.
punishment, punishment for not liking the northern.
yeah
No, but, I don´t know look that northern music, not all, not all is terrible, but there is one that is horrible, because it is like if it was, the regueton about the lyrics, because it has obscenities  and they are very, well
eh,
It is the same, the same sound: "chinguis, quringuichingui,quringuichingui, quiringuicha", it is the same
yes, exactly, yes yes I like it the variety in the rhythm, that is what tires you, like when the rap appeared here in the United States at the beginning when there were
Hammer, Hammer and all those people, Bobbie Brown
yes
I like it at first and I loved, because it had a nice rhythm, like rap, but different
I see
Now, it's all the same, all the same, so, it's violence, that if kills, if murders, if it's that
yes, look the reggaeton is the same, bum ta bum, bum ta bum
yes, it's the same, the same lyrics, or different lyrics but same rhythm, the same sounds, I don't know how there are people liking to listen the same all day
And they don't get bored, because, when I'm in work, you use the computer all the time, and we are allowed to listen the radio and after doing all our work nice, I mean, the computer radio
So, I play the music, a Latin station, with all kind of variety, in the internet, I love it
Hu
Because it has variety, you know, it's Latin, but, they have variety from all countries, from Venezuela, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Mexico, all those places
yes
Because all those countries, they contributed to Latin music, there are many
yes, here, there was a station that played a lot of music, a variety, but now, there is only romantic music and anywhere you want
you listen only those northern rhythms
Oh
Everywhere
There was an station here, I think that it was called Romantic Radio, and well, it seems that people got tired, and it left, I think that came from California, so, all the time it was
ballad and ballad and you were slept and at the time was nice, but after that it got bored
hum
So there's better variety, there's a more lively rhythm.
a, good
But yes, here the majority of Latinos here in Colorado are from Mexican descent.
yes
So well, sure, the influence, it also really influences the radio, what you hear.
uh-huh well it's true.  It's true, it's pretty influential.
And how long have you been there in Phoenix?
Well since May, only about six months.
Is this the first time that you've been to the United States?
I lived in Massachusetts, I lived in Massachusetts
Oh in Massachusetts, it's cold there.
yes, my husband lived, my husband lived there for twenty years, and only for five years.  And in the company where he worked, they laid him off
Oh, what a shame.
And so we decided to move because we were tired of the snow.
The cold, yes here
And we came to the other extreme, while it's great here, here it's great in
yes but it's really hot in the summer, this is true.
only, in, only in summer, but in the other seasons it's really great.
yes
It's a really nice climate.
I imagine that it must be very nice now in the winter
Yes
Because here in Colorado it's really cold
It's a one-sweater weather
Here in Colorado it's really cold right now
Oh, yes
But during winter, i mean, a very cold winter is starting, but usually it doesn't get this cold in December. Last week it was like ten degrees below zero last week
Uh, oh no
So, with the wind it was like twenty one below zero
No, last year we had, I'm sorry this year, in February, a snowing in Boston were we were trapped in the house and we couldn't get out
wow
Oh, we don't want more of this
No, and here, the moisture is pretty high here in Colorado
Uh
The humidity is not so high and it doesn't feel as bad as if you lived in Chicago, in New York or there in Massachusetts
In Massachussetts, yes
Yeah, no, but i like it here, it's just that I've been in Colorado for too long
Yeah, I'm liking it here very much, but i do worry that i see it's a, a city, a very insecure state
How?
There is a lot of insecurity, maybe because it's a border state and there are so
Regarding what?
Hello?
Hello? How are you?
Whom am I speaking with?
Ah, you're speaking with, eh, Vicente.
Vicente. hello Vicente. My name is Liliana. Where are you from?
I'm from, originally, from Panama.
From Panama? And where do you live?
yes And where are you from-, and, and where are you from?
I'm Mexican and I live in Baltimore.
In Baltimore.
Uh um, in Maryland. Where do you live?
I live in New York, in the ci-, New York city.
Ah, very near. Very near.
And in the, in the middle of New York.
Uh um, ah, in the
I live like two miles from Ground Zero.
Ah, really, in the very center?
Ah?
In the very center?
yes, in the middle of the center, yes.
Oh, and what do you do, and what do you do there?
In Manhattan.  Ah?
What do you do there?
I'm an accountant.
Accountant?  Hey, but the rent is really expensive there, no?
yes.  The rent, huge.  You pay, you, what I pay for a small room, for two or three rooms, right?
Uh-huh.
In many parts of the United States and in the world too you can have a house.
yes.  So-
I was talking with a person from, I think he was from Mexico, a Mexican who was an American Mexican, or something like that.
Uh-huh.
And no, he was paying much less for a house with three
yes.
And what, than what I was paying here.  But I think, I'm goig to move from here really soon, eh.
How long have you been living there?
About twenty years.  Twenty give years that I've been living in a city.
In the, aye.
yes, but blah, the thin is, you get used to many things sometimes, you know?
yes.
In the city everything's close, right?
Uh-huh, you can walk on either side and
On a-, exactly.
Uh-huh.
And eh, I was reading a book that was saying that, that people in California get fat because eh, because all the things that come
yes.  Uh-huh, if you don't want a car and if you don't have
everything in the car to go to this, to go to look for this, to go by car.
yes.
While people in the city are skinnier, because everything is close so we walk.
yes.  Aha.
And we walk a lot, I mean we walk a lot, a lot in the city.
Eh, and so you don't have a car?
No, no, because a car will cost me like
Oh, you don't need it.
eh, what I pay, what I would pay to park the car
yes, that's also
it's like three hundred a month, at least
yes.
Three hundred a month, at least, to park the car.
Aye, no.  Okay, also, God.
Aha, so that's what I think, eh.
And, eh, and, eh.
This is, you pay it, this is what you pay for a car, if you can buy a car, right?
yes, aha.  And part if you wont use it, what for?
No, and the thing is that when you have a car, no, no only this has one, for a bigger one than this.  And when you go out, with what you
you park the car in the garage, right?  This is your regular.
Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
But when you go to visit someone else and you go in the street and there are so many rules, it costs you a lot to park and the and
and you park and there are certain streets where you can't park.
Uh-huh.
OK?  And if you have you car there, forget it, the police will take it from you.
Oh, yes.
In New York they take your car in a second.  And only you get out of the car and you go into a shop or a bodega, as the Puerto Ricans say,
Uh-huh.
And you come back and your car is gone.
Uh-huh.
It will cost you, it will cost like two hundred, two hundred fifty, three hundred dollars
Aye, no, plus the three hundred a month and the insurance, ah no, too much.
yes, it's, it's too much, it's too much, I don't recommend it for anyone, it's
A taxi's better.
But tell me, something in, New York, right?  I remember before with a mine that started something like this, and the majority of people that you saw were Puerto Rican, Do- Dominicans.
For well, well, Puerto Rico belongs to the United States, you see?
yes, yes, yes, yes.
I'm like a United States citizen.
yes, yes, yes.
And, and the Dominicans come here too.  Now?  There were Chicanos, Ecuadorians, Peruvians, from all over the world.
Guatemala.
Guatemala, in, in this I can tell you that if you go anywhere I kno-, I call them Incas from Peru.  You, the things in the street anywhere
Uh-huh.  yes.
And many are also illegal, but
Uh-huh.
In the city you can hide.
yes.
And you can hold back a lot, you can find a lot of little jobs here and there, you know?
yes.  Aha
And the, and they have a lot of problems and also, they don't have a lot of time to be chasing you, you know?
yes.
and you can do little jobs here and there, in the city.  But if you were out of the city, then they will come and look for you like that, illegal, you know?
But, but it's a thing that, I think that here from Guatemala, from anywhere, and there's a class, and to me there's not much class of, of
of Latinos here, you know?  Europeans too, from, from
yes, and the Argentinians, yes.
from Spain, and from Argentina
Uh-huh.
yes, there are Cubans, or, Cu-, eh, Mexicans in Miami, the Cubans dominate there.
Uh-huh.
Until the
You know, eh, I've only been to New York once.
Yeah.
And this, the Spanish part, hey, you heard all kinds of
S-, Spanish.
you hear all kinds of, eh, of the language, yes.
yes, yes, S- S- Spanish and other languages too, and between Spanish also because and, you, and I don't know, in Mexico there are bananas, right?
Uh-huh.

It ripens, but ripe is, a state of, or a fruit, right?  That a fruit is ripe, right?
yes.  Aha, yes.
It's ready to eat.  But it's a banana, no, the name is banana.
You, what do you call them.  And you, what do you call them?

Eh, no, no, not too little. A, eh, a big boy, he's twenty years old-, twenty one years old
Ah, ah, well he's a man already.
He goes to school and all that, eh.
yes.
But, but, the thing here, and, uh, look, of what, what, what, what we should be talking about.
Is the music, but how boring.
Ah, but the music is good. Well, but, they are boring, because look I was, I was talking about this with a Spaniard lady, right?
Uh um.
And, and we were talking about how, rap, rap, they're rap music things, right?
yes.
And, the influence in rap and all, in the whole world right now. In all the music. I was, I was the
Spanish that I, that I was in Chinatown here in New York, right? In New China
Uh um
And was listening and I said
Ah.
Oh, that's rap. -O-K. I didn't understand the language, the way they were saying it, I knew that it was rap, and a Chinese told me yes, that piece of crap rap, in all languages, in all, all, in China now.
yes. Uh um
And the, the Spanish lady told me that in Spain, you go to all the clubs and the uh, bars and all that and all you hear is the Reggaeton.
yes, in Mexico also.
Reggaeton, yes, because here there's a lot of Mexicans who work with the Chinese with the fruits, see?
Uh um, uh um.
And, you, you, walk by the side of a radio
yes. It annoys me, do you like it?
Ah?
I don't like it, do you like it?
I don't, I don't, no us the, I call myself us the old people, right? We don't like it we got used to hearing people, people singers
right.
yes, and with a good voice and all that.
Eh. Luis Miguel or Julio Iglesias, Vicente Fernandez.
yes, yes, yes. yes. But that rap, Oh, noise, eh.
Aye no, not to me
But, I'm telling you because I've talked with a lot of people from all over the world and they tell me, they tell me that in Spain it's all Reggaeton and I say, what?
How strange, right?
yes, that's the music of E- it's the music of, the, because when I was with Chinese person and he told me that
that Korea and everything is- everywhere you go with
No, I don't, I don't imagine rap in Chinese
Huh?
I don't imagine what it's like to listen to rap in Chinese.
yes, through I, I know that through the way that I listened to music because, I, immediately recognized the way that the were s- saying, right?
Aha.
That this was rap, but in a different
And in Panama?  And there isn't rap in Panama?
No, how reggaeton sounds in Panama.
Ah, it's the sa- it's, in Panama it's the same as in Mexico, reggaeton.
yes, reggaeton, it's the, the original in Panama, yes, eh, if you go to look for reggaeton, when they say reggaeton in Panama
Ah, OK
Because many Panamanians have the, Latino, and there's Latino music too but many in Panama, English and uh, Caribbean things
Uh-huh.
These have a lot of influence in Panama
Uh-huh.
Do you understand me? Because Panama is small, three million people
Wow. How small, yes.
But Three million. Yes, But it's very developed, yes, you don't find one thing that's not in Panama and there are people from all over the world, see?
Then it's no the third world?
There are people from all parts of the world. yes.
But, Panama is not third world?
Ah?
It's not third world? It's not a third world country?
No, no, no, no, Well, there's, the thing is that there's eh, nowadays, I don't know, I don't know, I haven't gone much because no It is developed, but also is in the middle, eh.
Oh, yes.
Understand? Because it's a small country, look, once, we had one hundred twenty banks
Wow.
From all parts of the world, yes. yes. a small country with three million is going to have one hundred twenty international banks and all that. But that's how it is, because over there there's a lot, a lot of money passes through there.
Well yes, true. There will be a lot of industry and all. Aha.
Because of the commerce of the canal, yes. Because of the commerce of the canal, and also the Colombians brought all the, the drug related money. In Panama it's said
Ah, yes,yes, Aha. In, ah, they have to hide it somewhere.
Well, that, that's called money laundry
Well yes, aha, but in some place
Money, money laundry is a way of converting ah, illegal money right? illegal.
Uh um, ah, illegal money. Uh um, uh um.
And, no, if you go to a bank right now, ten thousand, ten thousand dollars, right?
Uh-huh.
The bank reports it to the government.
In Mexico it's ca- they say that the people give a name
Give, what?
Give a name.
Give a name, yes.
Sure, a drug dealer comes and tell me this, I'll give you one hundred thousand dollars if you give me your name.
Oh.
So I give him my name and they can open a store or whatever and put an account in my name, but it's their money, and they give me
Aha, yeah.  But this is them.  yes.  But here no, they can't do it, because you ten million pesos
Uh-huh.
Yes if it's a store there's no problem, right?
Uh-huh.
But the government watches people who deposit a lot of cash. Because, let's suppose that you are, that they're watching you, and you earn like
twenty thousand a year, you see?
Uh-huh.
Then, then you deposit one hundred thousand dollars.  Where did those one hundred thousand dollars come from?
Well, yes, they will ask you and then they will start with the taxes.
And, eh, and where did you get the one hundred thousand dollars?
Uh um. Uh um.
You are doing something, something that is not legal, you are doing something that are not reporting to the government to pay taxes.
yes. yes. Look yes.
Sometimes like that too, understand?
Uh um. Listen, and you, are, are an accountant and are, are you certified?

Uh um.
And I was able to study and all that, well I was a long time teaching. But now I find that my English is worse than my Spanish now.
Your English is worse than Spanish?
Better than Spanish.
Why do you say that?
I'm losing the Spanish. And not only me, -O-K? Look, let me tell you something. My, I, -O-K Eh, you hear Jennifer Lopez, right?

Selena. Uhm.

Uhm.
Hello
Hello, how are you?
And fine and you, who are you?
Eh, my, my name's James, and I live in New York, and you?
Ok, my name's Olga.  I live in Texas.
Texas
But right now I'm visiting Kansas
In Kansas.  Wow
Kansas City aha.
We're far.
Ah, where from?  From, from New York?
Yes
Well not, not so far.
Not much, have, have you visited New York recently?
Yes well no, about two years ago I visited New York.
Hmm.  I, I think that we're far.  I've never been to Kansas.
Oh no
Oh yes, yes, yes. I passed when, when I came from my town, yes.
Oh, they're small counties, but it's pretty here.
Eh, Yes, do you like it more than Texas?
Oh no, I like Texas more
Oh, what is it with Texas that everybody likes it so much?
Oh, well, it may be because I have been so many years living there, and I, eh, know it better, the city, the peopl,e everything. Maybe that
Oh
But, figure, I've lived for more than thirty years in the state of Texas
Wow, are you staying long here?
Eh, no, Hardly two days. I'll stay until the twenty-nine, and then from here, afterwards, the twenty-nine I'll go
El Paso, Texas
Oh
and then back to Fortward, were I live
I see
That's it, and what do you think about the subjcet for today?
Music, I like music
Yes
I lo-, I love music. Music amazes me
Hm mm
I don't have a, mm, specific preference for, for a kind of music. Eh, I listen to any kind of music, eh, I enjoy more soft music, I like classical music because you have to
it has a message. Music that relaxes me
Mhm mm
Eh, and sometimes, I play, I don't know, a Reggae-ton, something like that, that are more, more
Like noisy
hyper, more noisy, hyper. But I don't have a, eh, specific preference. I can't tell, oh I like salsa, or ballads, or
Reggae-ton, I, I like them all, but I prefer music that
Hm
has a message, that brings peace, that brings, a , a message, like a good message for your soul
Hm, mm, well, yes, good description. I actually agree with you, because more or less
and
what happens to me, I have no preferences, but I do like much more classical music. Because if listen to, for instance,
country music, or polkas and so, well it does bore me listening to that music
Aha
The music that never bores me, precisely, is classical music, that's why I think that classical music is what I like the most
They ask us wheter
Yes
it plays an important role in our life. In my life it does, because, like you said, classical music is important to me because
it brings me peace and quietness, it relaxes me.
Aha
So, when, for instance, when I am crushed or, sorry, when I am sad or so, I play music. And it helps a lot because
it pushes me to meditation, sorry, meditate about life. That maybe in that moment I know for a minute
let's say, of sadness, but I think of the other people, and say there must be people feeling worse than I do. So, yes, music helps me
Yes
much to, to reconsider, and and I'm not so bad, because there are much worse people than me.
Yes, it makes life more pleasant.
It does.
It makes life much more temporary.
Yes
There are moments when, in reality, you get sad about some topics
Yes
and, it can be that touching on these topics that have a, have links to similar situations that you're really living,
Hmmm
and since it touches you a little bit, but in reality, I like it, I tell you, I like music that carries a message.  Something that
this, if it's something lively, that carries a message, if not, it's only a racket, to say it like this, and the noise with
combined with people who are happy.
Hmm
But this really doesn't have a message
Hmm
a message, or something personal, something that the artist, ah, writer, the composer, the exhibitor of the song.
Hmmm
This, wants to bring it to the public.  And this only, if I want an important role in my life, sure, because, I tell you, without, without it,
eh, there are situations where live makes, makes you sad, and, what I know, you feel alone.
Hmmm
And music makes you happy.  And I think that it has something to do with the real creation of us, because eh, if we sit and we look at the Biblical level,
Hmmmm
the truth, like in, times before, for example, they say that David danced.  Or the praises that they gave to God.
Hmm
And if we go much much further back than this it says that Lucifer was the, was the angel who was in charge of music.
Of the praise for, for, for God.
Yes
So yes we're created in His image and likeness of God, it means that the Lord likes it, Go- God likes music, no, the, the, the
we have a link to, to them, then.  We're part of his creation, so we have, it brings me to think that, well, God liked music
he enjoyed music too, he lived music and I think that for this, for us that they say, you hear all kinds of music and
and, and it means that music is a universal language
It is
And so, eh, yes, it plays an important role in our lives.  I al- I work in the car
Hmmm
almost eight hours a day, ten dollars an hour, every day.
Hmmm
And, the first thing I do is put music on, and I tell you, I put music on, any kind of music,
Ah
that has a message, that brings me, that brings me tranquility, that brings me peace, that makes me happy.
Hmmm,
And now another negative music or that has to do with violence, that has to do with, with with, with other issues, other problems eh, or, or
personal things, I don't listen to it. I, only listen to anything that brings me, a type, a type of message, a type
some sort of joy, something of
Aha.
that brings me tranquility, brings me peace in my life.
Yes, look, I liked the idea of what you say that really the music is, is a companion, is a companionship. Right, I, I do feel when you are alone, and, and
Yes,
and you listen to music, you don't feel alone. Then, and, and especially if it's a music with a message, like you say. Because, messages that make you reconsider
meditate, so.
Aha
Then, yes, up to a certain extent well is essential. imagine if, if there was no music I don't, I don't know I have no idea what would happen without, without music.
Besides look, I love to dance.
Aha Ah see
I love to dance a lot. So imagine, without, without music well, I don't know, don't know what we would do.
Yeah Look you see, you see, then, then let's put this dance, you dance when you are happy. The music has brought a, a
a joy, understand.
Yes, yes
And, that's why I tell you, is something is something like, like you say, indispensable, and
Hm That's, that's like food for the spirit, like
we and
like a oh, something that propels you to keep going, to rest a little and keep on going in your routine or whatever right.
Yes No, that, that, is my opinion of music
Hm mm
And I think I think that I share it with, with, with many other people because, really, unless they have a preference for music,
Hm
that they like something specific.
Aha Yes
But tell me
Well so far you and I are in complete agreement really. Because yes more or less we coincide in, in our way of thinking regarding music and
yes
and like we start focusing more or less on the same type of music, because I too listen to any type of music, but it does takes me
I'm much more interested in, classical music.
Yes
Because like I tell you, the ones, the other types of music, well I would listen to one, two, three, four songs, already the fifth like kind of bores me, or like I'm not liking it
And in, and the classic well no, that one doesn't bore at all.
Yes, and
Then, yes, yes is
And it doesn't bore, and even less when, when you have knowledge of who's playing it, of who
is Hm mm
and, who was the writer, and how old it is, like that, because I, because I also start listening to classical music, and
Hmm
whe- I have a friend who's a professional pianist,
Hmmmm
in, classical music.  So he
Ah
eh, when they play, they're playing something, and he says, hey, this is Bach, this is Beethoven, this is the other.
Ok.
And so he tells me more or less what, what he's playing, and I more or less understand through, through
through him, well.
Yes yes
But, when, when you know, when, he really hasn't brought it to plain paper
Yes
to paper.  Eh, it was in the paper, what, who's playing, what they're playing, and you understand a lot more, so it makes you like
you appreciate it a lot more, therefore.
Yes, sure, yes, li- it's like when you listen, when you tell something, like a story that they told you.
Aha
Well yeah, you put the emphasis according to what you think it really relates to.  Music is like this.
Hi, my name is Leticia
Hi, how are you?, Hi Leticia, How are you?
Fine, everything's fine, what's your name?
Uh, my name is Jaime, I'm from New York

Right, i spoke to you, i think it was last week, like, a week ago, i was, you were headed for some beers, i think

It wasn't, it wasn't you then.
It wasn't me, it was someone from Philadelphia too.
There are many Argentinians in Philadelphia then.
yes, wow, you talked with another Argentinian in Philadelphia, how crazy.
yes, it was an Argentinian in Philadelphia, I think.  I won't say with the same voice, because it can't be the same voice, but.
And you don't remember the name.
At least.  No, I don't remember the name, but, this.  Eh, What did I tell you?  I don't know if, so she said she was
to get a beer and it was when I got a beer then.
Ah no, I don't know.
You don't remember, no, at least it wasn't you, it wasn't you then.
Ah and ah, sure, how nice.  And where are you from?

She talks a lot right, she talks a lot, Patricia talks a lot.
yes, we talked a lot, she talked the majority of the time. This is so funny.
yes, yes, And how?
mm? And how did you find out about the study?
on the Internet I was playing with Craig, Craigslist
Ah, on Craigslist
aha
ah, look at that.
eh, tell me, tell me.
yes because that intrigued me, because I think the study is from the university of Pennsylvania.
yes Aha Is the same one that you did.
Sure, yes, yes, yes.
And what And what do you study?
I'm not studying, I'm doing, I'm working.
Oh, you work in the University, how nice.
yes, yes, I'm not studying
Well, we already talked a little of everything, now let's talk about the topic before,
yes, what's more this topic, I already got it another time.
Ah, yes that's why you were so bored right. Me too.
Because up to now every time I've talked, I talked with two women, I never talked with men that's why I tell you that for sure I didn't talk with you.
For the two times I talked, I talked to women.
Ah well then it's good then. The topic is good.
And what are you doing in New York?
What did you say?
What is it that you are doing in New York?
I mm, I have a small. clothing company.
Ah, look how nice.
And then, practically, eh, I do, the buying, the selling,
yes
I go and show samples I go to the deliveries the only, the only person that works there is me.
Ah, look how nice. Have you been doing that long?
the only one. I've been working like that seven years, already.
ah, good.
Although, although this year is the slowest year, but well, it's been seven years. And you, only work in the university?
yes, yes and I do studies no.
When are you coming to New York for a little trip around here?
yes the truth is that New York we wanted to go this weekend, but at the end no. We didn't end up going but. eh, this year I was there twice, it's also not been that long that I've been living here, it's been seven months, so
Ah yes, only nine months.
yes, yes, it hasn't been long,
okay
so, no, I was in New York twice, this year.
And yes, and what, how did you like it? You like it or not?
I like it for, like it for a while, I mean I like it for a while, I don't like it to live there.
Why don't you like it to live, tell me?
Because too much craziness, a very hectic city. I think I would go crazy, I don't know.
That's what makes it fun.
yes that's why I like it for a little bit, but after I want, I like Philadelphia because it has, is more peaceful and also you have things to do, is not that you don't have anything to do.
But anyways we are so near that whenever I want I can go to New York to spend the day.
eh, ah that's good.
I mean and it doesn't come out that expensive.
That's good, No, really right. I, I have gone to Pennsylvania, to Philadelphia, but since I have no ambiance. I don't have people I know, or anything, I've gone to walk by the,
by the, the main avenue, I've walked, I've eaten, shopped, and at night I went to a few restaurants.
yes
to talk with crazy bartenders only and after that I came, I returned.
Sure, to spend the day is good, same here,  in comparison to New York there are not that many things to do, that's true, but,
yes
well, I mean to live is good, because is a city that has a more or less acceptable size and you find everything you need.
And how about the night, how do I say it, the night life there?
and here all in the United States at least. I don't know in New York, but here everything closes, very early to my taste.
Oh, yes, And you like it?
and the, the weekends after to eat, after eleven it's difficult for them to be open.  I'm used to go to eat hm,
At this time or at nine or something, so, not so late, not so early.
ah, ah, at this hour the chickens go to bed there in my cit- there in Panama.
yes, not for this, in Panama they also eat dinner late.
no, yes, eating dinner early, and after going to bed early because there's nothing to do anymore.
ah, they eat dinner early and they go to bed early in Panama.
yes, yes, at, no, at eleven at night the restaurants are already closed here for.
ah, look at that.
Di-difficult to find a restaurant open later.
I didn't know this.
yes
No, it's the opposite in Argentina, people.  The restaurants open at eight at night and until two in the morning, three, they don't close.
ah, That's good.
And the, the bars where you can have a drink, they can be open almost all night.
Almost that, no, yes, there are bars that are open later, but.  Usually, for get it, the restaurants are closed early.
hmm
Early, well Leticia, tell me, tell me about the technology and the,
The, the technology, yes.  Well, I'll tell you what, what I said to the same person I talked to.  That,
Tell me
That well, that things around here that I feel I depend on are the computer and,
and the telephone.
and of the com- and the phone up to there only because by the computer I also manage by the phone let's say, but, I mean the computer more, than the phone, but the phone also, no.
You sound, You sound relatively young Leticia, how old are you?
what?
How old are you Leticia?
Thirty one.
Thirty one.
yes
You sound like a fifteen year old girl.
Really
yes
No, I'm not that young.
yes you like a fifteen year old girl
How old are you?
I'm thirty seven years old
aha Well
eh
Up to thirty is good, the thing is not to pass the thirty.
yes.
how nice, Thirty well, I can stand it
The bad, the bad thing is that time doesn't forgive, Leticia.
No, that's true.
eh, that doesn't forgive not for love, nor money.
yes
He, he will, will continue to keep getting older, but forget it, that's only a number.
yes
after the, after the mm
yes
well you already entered and admitted it, it means, that, that, you feel good, about your age. Ah, because there are lots of people that,
No, yes, yes.
it doesn't feel good to say thirty one, thirty two, that's it. Especially the women. When they already pass twenty five, they don't want to keep aging.
Well, yes, obviously, I also don't want to keep on, but well, one ages.
And
what are you going to do.
Exactly what can you do?
yes is like that. And how do you feel you depend on technology?
I depend on technology only, eh, the same as you, the eh, communication, what has to do with technology, that if eh, I have to do a fax, send a fax.
receive an email with, with pictures,
Sure
or, or, send a, an inventory on excel.
Sure
eh, receive an inventory on excel, send a wire. To pay for merchandise also. Right now the phone,
Sure
is very useful also, because, I take, I've taken pictures by phone, I've sent an email and the person has seen the merchandise without me having to show it to them or having to go there to,
the office.
ah,
To, to send picture, you understand.
yes I understand.
So, Because yes, let's say you have one of these electronic digital cameras, that you take pictures, you still have to take a computer,
yes
to, to download the pictures and then send them.
yes
Well with the phone you just send it like that and no,
Sure, yes, yes, yes
and, and yes, I really depend, it makes my life easier. It facilitates things, they make it much faster, and, and I like it, well I like it eh,
Who doesn't, who doesn't like to make their life easier, You understand me? so, in that sense, that's all I have to say about the
the computer,
yes, yes of the communications more than anything.
yes, yes exactly.
yes besides I think that it was the revolution of the last few years, the topic of the communications.
Aha, then, yeah, yes practically all, I think that I already elaborated, much more last time that I talked with, with, I don't know with whom, I think I spoke with an Argentinian the other time, there in Philadelphia.
yes
Mauricio.
Mauricio.
Mauricio. Yes
Mariano, no.
Mariano, Mariano, Mariano,
Is my husband
Ah Mariano is your husband
yes
I spoke with, spoke with Mariano, I don't know if I spoke with Mariano of the same
It could be, it could be that you spoke with him.
of, of the same topic, ask him if he talked with from Panama Oh, no with Mariano I spoke, Mariano I spoke, I think that I spoke of something else with Mariano.
It was regarding the women, the abuse, the abuse of women also something like that.
ah, it could be, I really don't know. But, there are many Panamanians in the United States, or no.
No, not really, I have, I have.
No
eh, I've been like fourteen years in New York and don't know.
You don't know any Panamanians.
No, I don't know any Panamanians.
Hi, I'm Arturo
Good Night, This is Lourdes
To whom I'm speaking to? Hi Lourdes, well
Good night, which is the piece of technology you use the most?
well, depends, I think that music, All that has to deal with music
Oh, like MP3 players and the
Because, yes, Mp3 players, CD's and all that, any kind of music playback, but I think I listen to music practically all day, then
I can't stop to use the cellphone, I was sometime without a cellphone and I didn't used that much, now it might pass a day I don't make a call, or be called by anyone
I see
And well, also the computer, but you use that a lot
And those, and technology, has helped to choose music or what?
I think that technology has definitely helped, because, when I was younger, the only option was having some tapes to listed
I see
And in the road, and now, if you want to choose a song from a tape, it was hard because you had to forward the recording and it took time
Sure, sure
And now, with technology, from a MP3 you can see all the music you have and you can pick a song
At any moment
And in fact, with iPods you can have almost all your music library, at any moment, that's really cool, it's really easy
Well, figure out that I would say that the computer
yes
Because eh, the computer
aha
Because I use in my job, I use it at home, eh, for things, I mean for anything, right?. If in the morning we are going to
yes, I see
work, the first thing my husband does is look for the weather cast in the computer
sure
And if we need to save information or, eh, eh, keep the house accounts, then we do it on the computer
so, we don't have to care about papers or anything
yes, right, but you must have a backup, right?, you must have it well protected because in case of malfunction you would loose a lot of information
Well, look, that's our sin, we are very bad with the backup so we keep paper records, for five or six years, but after that we destroy them
But keeping the backup like more regular, eh, at home, eh, we are not very good at that, in the job we have a
that, eh, everybody save their documents in a drive
aha
and so, they access the drive, they work in their own computer, but they save in the drive
In a drive, oh, OK
And so, it is a way of more or less preventing in case of
yes, because it
worries me
not long ago, my hard drive was deleted, well, a beverage fell on to my compouter
Oh no
it did in my laptop, it erased everything that I had, I had super important pictures of trips and lots of music and things like that
and I was pretty stupid because I didn't back it up before, so I lost, I lost everything
Oh, that's a pity, I'm sorry.
it was horrible.
I'm sorry, you see, that's another thing, we, the ones that have, for pictures, we have the pictures stored in the laptops
aha
But we have an external drive with copies of all of them.
Oh, okay, that's great.
And now that we have a new baby.
Oh, yes
You know, you take pictures of him every time he smiles, you take a picture if he farts, a picture, we take a lot of pictures of him
yes, of course,
so, we have hundreds of pictures and maybe four or five are really nice pictures, wonderful pictures, so we do share those with our friends.
yes, that's right
so, we keep the rest in the special file. Some are in the computer and we have a copy in the external drive.
oh well
But you are right, when I was writing my thesis, my master
aha
oh,oh, I had to file it on a certain date in order to be able to graduate, right.
aha
And can you believe me that after working on weekends, on all sorts of arrangements, uh, i was changing my computer from the university to the house
Yes
And all the changes i had made in the document got deleted
Oh no
yes,
Darn, such a trauma
And after crying like an idiot for like twelve hours i said, well maybe that means that the next thing i write will be a lot better than the previous
Yeah, i mean, yeah, i hope so
And so, uh, so with that mood, well, i, you know me, i stayed working the rest of the week and i met the deadline
Yes
But, it's true, i mean
wow
that's one of the things that, it's technology, exactly, exactly
yeah, that, that is hard for us, right?, we have to
Because then you become a slave of the computer or whatever technology
Yes, sure, exactly, if you lose your computer, or you lose your cellphone, for example, or you lose something and you don't even know how to communicate with anyone, you don't have
Sure
you don't have a phone agenda and you don't have anything, because everything was
It's true, look, i, i mean, the, my phone ran out of battery once
right
and I couldn't find, I couldn't find the telephone number of my dad, I don't know it by heart. They moved, eh, the number is new and believe or not I don't know it, because I have it saved in the cellular phone agenda
yes right
and I don't it by heart. So it is, it is a question that helps a lot but also makes you somehow a slave to technology
yes right, right now we become more dependent on that, before, maybe, I mean, I mean before people, people managed to live without, but right now
I think it would be the same with or without cellular phones
Sure
it's just that, we learn to depend on them, actually I don't think that have changed, no, no, not so many things have changed, but
Sure, sure
But, but yes that's it. There is a lot
Another, another piece of technology that I have realized how important it is, is the microwaves oven, because before
oh, yes
I have never cooked in the microwaves
No
because I don't like the taste of microwave food
yes no
but now, with the baby
aha
to prepare his food
aha
In five minutes I can steam cook for him pumpkin, 'yame', 'yutia', banana or whatever I want to feed him
Right
And so, i don't even have to think
And before it took more much time or what?
Exactly, exactly
Yes, i have also noted that right now, because, uh, i just started living here alone in, in the school, i lived at home with my parents before and
and the, well i worried about the food and now that I've started cooking and all that
right, right, right
I realize now that, it takes a lot of time, and sometimes i mean, i don't have the time, because i have to work, i have to go do homework, or i have to study, whatever, and the, I'd like to have a microwave and i don't
right
i have to get one as soon as possible, because yes, it saves a lot of time, it's really impressive
Sure, sure, to re-heat, not so much for cooking, the taste is not very good
Yeah, not to cook, exactly
But for re-heating
right?, but then there are those instantaneous foods in the airports or stuff like that
Yeah, because then once a week, of course, of course
that, well, you can buy and cook a lot faster, and it doesn't taste very good, but it nourishes you
Sure, but, and, the other thing you can do is cook once a week, you freeze it
right
and defrost the meal, uh, according to, the days of the week, right?
yes, that's a good, a good technique, to defrost everything there
here we do that with minced meat, we season it slightly, marinade, salt garlic, nothing more
aha
then we save it in individual packages
yes aha
and, one day we thaw it and make tacos, another day we thaw it and make tomato sauce for the pasta
oh, look
another day we thaw it and do some other thing, and since it is already seasoned all you have to do is put it in the microwaves, heat it and mix it with, whatever, right?
whatever you are going to serve. Oh, great idea, great idea, maybe I will use it too
oh, do it, you'll see how useful it is
yes
eh
because otherwise I end up cooking whatever too quickly, usually pasta. because it is the fastest thing I can do and
Sure, boy this way you'll end up putting on sixty pounds
and that stuffs me, what?
That you'll put on a lot with the
yes, right?, with the pasta diet
with the pasta, eating pasta, just pasta, right, right
yes, no, no, I must start my new diet. But anyway I don't have,, honestly, I don't have any problem with
with weight, I am rather thin, I don't know, my metabolism processes everything very fast and I hardly gain weight
yes, but until you are twenty-five. twenty-six, thirty
Well, likewise, yeah, exactly, that changes things
So you see, there's no, there's no "god forgiveness", yeah, right?
yea, right, there's no, there's no, they don't discriminate by race or color
No, no, there's no metabolism that can stand it
Everyone, yeah, it's true
The, although sometimes you don't notice, but the other technology that has also made life easier is the washing machine
Yeah, it's also impressive
because the first, the first three months i had my baby, well, i washed all his clothes by hand, because we didn't, since we were using a public machine, i didn't want to use
Yes
uh, put his clothes with other people's clothes, because i didn't know what
right, yes
Look boy, what a horrible thing to have to wash every two days, because it piles up a lot
Right
And then, well, it's not soaking, and rinsing, and no, it's soaking,
Yes, i can imagine
scrubbing the clothes, rinse it, hang it
Yeah, no
uh
A different story
Exactly, exactly, so
yes I think that also that's like what I was thinking now, the technology where it's changed us the most is  in the simple things, in the daily life like,
having electricity, having I mean having electricity to have a refrigerator, those things that we now see as basic.
sure
are, that has affected us a lot, it has changes us a lot we don't even realize it but, but, if you start to take away those fundamental things like the refrigerator, imagine living without a refrigerator, it would be so hard.
no exactly, buying everything, buying everything daily
Everything per day, yes everything fresh, everything per day, it would be ugh, imagine. It would be, another story.
and in fact one of the reasons why many kids would die when there was no refrigeration was  because the milk you would buy in the morning already in the afternoon the milk was, curdled, it was spoiled.
Hello?
Hello?
Who am I talking to?
This is Paulo, what's your name?
Paulo?
yes
Paulina.
Oh,
Where are you from?
Lets see, people will go to

Neighbors, yes, how are you?
Fine, how are you?
Fine, where do you live?
In Philadelphia.
Philadelphia.
Yes, what about you?
In Georgia.
Oh.
In Athens, Georgia.
uh uh. Uh uh. And how is everything well?
Good, what are you doing, studying or whaht?
No, I'm working. Working in whatever.
yes. yes.
Uh uh. So that.
How long, have you been here?
No a year.
A year?
It's going to be a year, yes.
Ah.
yes yes. you?
Um, eleven.
eleven years?
Eleven years
Uf. Man
yes, I came. I came here just after the after the how do you say it to um
Fourth half I don't know what it is.
to High School
oh, High School
The High School, well, yeah, fourth
Yes, uh huh
That's it
Studying here?
Huh?
Are you studying
Oh, i came here to study and then i got married, so my husband is getting a doctorate and we are here in Athens, still studying.
Oh, oh, hey that's very good
Oh yes
Uh huh. I have my husband here that's also
And that seems like, yes
He's doing a Post-doc
Oh yes?
Yes,
Oh, very well
Here in Penn University
How's that?, in which area?
In biology, molecular biology
Okay
Uh uh, and what are you studying?
how nice. I'm home with the kids and
Uh uh.
he's studying technology
Uh uh.
that is from the area of the occasion.
Uh uh
Ah yes
Well. a lot of kid? A lot of children?
Two
Two kids?
Andres is three years old. And Cristina is a year old.
Ah, cute little ones.
yes.
Beautiful.
yes, and do you have kids?
No, no, no
Not yet?
We are thinking about it, not yet.
No, it´s all right
we´re, uh, used to the life in the United States, after that we´ll see
yes, no?
We want to, but we can´t do it yet. It´s not economically
It gets harder
sure. Sure, sure. First we have to come here and get settled, and then we´ll see. So, all right, has it been a long time since you last went to Chile?
Let´s see, we went there the last time, yes, a long time ago, let´s see, I´ve gone back twice
Oh
and the last time it was because my family came here, so
Ah, very good
she, when did we last go? 2000, 2001
Uh uh
Four years ago
yes, yes, a long time ago
yes, because I was pregnant with Andres
Sure
And we went to collect blood samples, in fact, because I was working in a laboratory that, a project called, molecular genealogy
Uh uh
where they make a data, a database about. Like the, more or less like your wife, about
Uh uh, yes, yes, yes
They take some blood samples and you were there with mu husband
Oh, that's nice
and they will take
Nice, nice
And the last time he went to Chile
Oh, we were in Argentina few time ago, like a month
Oh really?
yes
Oh, that's nice, all your family there
Oh, yes absolutely everything
Oh, that's nice
That all
You miss some things
yes, I miss
other thins are less missed here
Yes, it happened to me, I mean being all those
Mm, no,a year is a year
little time, and somethings they had, well, yes, yes
In bank, the moment you enter you are getting out
That's fantastic
things yes, some things are much easier here.
yes, and even the required power that you have here
yes, no?
yes, and when we met in Argentina everything seemed, like, we weighted everything and it was cheap.  But it's not the same.  With
here and we buy and we deprive ourselves, like, in Argentina you know that when you go with one hundred dollars, it didn't seem like one hundred dollars. They're charging us a lot.
For this.
yes.
A lot of aha, it's like.  Well they're all, they're all
No, yes.
It's the same.  So, well.
Some things are strange too, I remember this month when I went with my husband
Hmm.
We had to make presentations and everything and sometimes there were some things that's part of the culture no more.  It seemed, I don't know, we had the permission and everything for
like transport blood and everyone seemed to us
yes.
they opened our bags, took out my bags of shampoo and conditioner and said, what's this?  Shampoo.  So, with the papers and everything, well good.
Some things were more complicated, were heaver than here, here it was easier to do things.
Sure.  Sure.
But other things like eating avocado, here it's really expensive.
Uh-huh.
any food.
yes, yes, yes.  Ah in Chile, yes, we eat a lot of meat
yes.  Here it's expensive, very expensive.
here it's really expensive and it's not the same, so that we had oh, terrible, we spent thirty, forty, fifty kilometers when we went to look at the airport and we immediately stopped at a grill and I started to eat meat like I
like the carnivore I am.
No it's true I miss it and mare that here I buy everything cut and everything
Everything cut up differently, and I don't buy it because it's so different for
yes.
or anything yeah no no no.
And it's really expensive, yes.
yeah, no.  Uh-huh.  So good.
No, and it's from a friend who's in Argentina too, eh.
yes, we're
She always says, no.  The meat that I no.
yes, the meat is horrible.  The wine too.  Here it's expensive and
The tea too, even if you can buy tea and everything well
yes, we can find it. Yes we can find it and it's fine, yes, yes yes.
Yeah.  Life is good if there's tea, everything's good.  Nah.
Eh, no, we're missing meat.  Now we have to dedicate ourselves with coffee too, everything's good but these things that you've also lived.  You go finding
in the taste of the food of the most
Yes.
Afterwards everything is good.  There is always something similar that we will find so it's good.  What is that?
Ah, that's great.  So. And um they gave your wife the scholarship, how does that come together
Yes, yes, yes, the one with Penn University, us, we are from Mar De Plata, sort of near Buenos Aires
Uh huh.
And from there from Mar de Plata and everything they said okay and they gave me the J1 J2 visa
Uh huh
It allows me to work and for the time being we are working, as it goes working at Penn and I work.  At times a job ends and I start another.
I've only had this for awhile it's my third job.  So but I know very well
Yes.  It's difficult at first but afterwards
Yes, yes, no
Things get better.
Yes, yes, yes, I spend my time getting to know more people. We don't go distinct people that
Yes
They offer work and well you make friends here and there.  And since I know a
No yes
a guy from Chile also.  I haven't seen him for a long time. He's a music professor.
Oh yes.
Uh huh.  So I don't know, he's been here about 10 or 12 years.  He left once.  Didn't he tell us.  You don't remember.  You don't remember.
Ah, no, no, I asked you about the music professor.  Wasn't it one time, he returned once to Chile, didn't he.  Ah, he said he went back five years, but afterwards he missed it here.
it happened that he was in Chile and here
No yes.
Because he has his life.
yes, no.
here too, right?
You miss it, I say not the next time that we go on a visit I say it is better to go for a I tell my husband that if we go it is because he is
he is American but he speaks Spanish
Hmm.
I say, I would like to live for a time in Chile or another Hispanic country for children to learn Spanish well.
yes, fantastic of course.
Because here all their friends only speak English and we at home speak Spanish but is like if, they prefer English because
They lose it a lot, right? It is a lot easier.
all of them speak it, of course.
For them.
It is possible to go for a while, I say the ideal would be to be contracted from here.
Ah, they would have a great time there.
yes.
This is what we all want. It is very difficult to find. All of them Argentinians, Latin American all of them say it is the ideal, right?
yes, because they
But until now I don´t know someone Maybe that
I don't know, my sister is also married to another gringo, she and he are working, she works for the government in some construction companies, he is, uh
Um
How do you say construction manager there?, Construction engineer?, i don't know
Yes, uh, foreman. Well, he's an engineer
Well, uh, but i don't know, uh
Well, yes, right?, but so, to run Argentina, uh, with six
Well
Uh
The thing is that each working company has several parts or projects in several projects and they were re trying to be employed for like two years in a project in Chile, but
Um
it didn't work out so
Oh
Well, let's try again
Uh huh
later
Uh huh
But, i told him, he told me "if we go to Chile, instead of spending all our money in, uh, going to the most expensive schools and all that, we take a
all the money and live well and afterwords we come back with a small saving too
sure, sure, yes
Instead of living large, right?
And how much is the dollar in Chile?
the truth is that
You don't know what the difference is, no idea?
I don't have any idea.
yes, we're seeing on the Internet, it's three with forty three cents.  One dollar for it's three with forty three pesos.
it's going up.  I don't know what's happening in Argentina.
But even in Chile it's more, it's like five hundred, six hundred.
ah yes.
But I don't know how much it is
yes.
how much it is in Chile and Argentina, I don't know.
Sure, I don't know, I don't know.  Sure.  No, I don't know how it is
But things were expensive when we went, some things were the same price as here and people don't earn as much as here.
Sure, yes, I know this.
Some things were as expensive as here and
yes, yes, we saw it.  When we went there, to the, the
yes.
crazy, what they charge.  It's crazy.  And so after a while I got my car insurance,
ah, and the gasoline
and, and well since I
terrible, no.
borrowed in the tank and started well the needle so I said to the boy who was there that no no, that way, that way
So expensive,
No yes it's true, it's like three times more than here or more.
Sure, sure, sure.  It makes them rich
yes.  And it's expensive here and now but
Han, but with a salary more or less of a manager, no.  There it hurts every time that you're going to charge, you have to have the tank, no.  No, no, no.  So
This is something that's oof.  If I go back one day.  At least like, how we said, now I have a friend who went back
Argentina.
to Argentina and close to Mendosa.
Yeah.
There, on the other side of Argentina.  And each time I have to call, I call on the telephone and it's, yes, yes I was there for four or five years
and he went back
You get used to it here.
Ooh.  And they say that it's difficult for me to buy a car and
Hmm.  And to open a bank account.  You have to, I don't know, it's complicated.
yes, it's complicated.
Hello!
Hello! How are you? Who am I talking to?
Marcela
Marcela, Good afternoon, I'm Lorena. How are you?
Well, thank you. Where are you calling from?
Where? Where am I calling from? San Antonio, Texas.
yes
And where are you?
in, eh Saveville, North Carolina
Ah, in North Carolina And where are you from?
I am Argentina. And you?
Ah. And, I'm Mexican.
Ahh
How are you?
well, How's it going for you?
Well, many, many thanks well, today's theme is pretty interesting, yeah?
Yes technical artifacts. What's nee- yes, well look, the dishwasher
Yeah the juicer, the planca, the microwave,
sure, but
eh, the radio,
yes, yes
the computer,
yes, perhaps they are, eh, want, eh are talking of, of more modern things, more digital, things that we've had in these last years, and that would be the computer and the cellular.
Oh, yes
has influenced our life a lot and yes, they are technological advances. Because well if we go to places where they still don't have them, where, instead of the blender they have
to use a mortar and pestle
Ah, yes
Right? or the manual grinder and,
yes, or take wash the clothes in the river by hand.
and, exactly Right?
I shoot myself
then I think that yes, these are definitely technological advances, that have influenced our life a lot.
yes, yes
and for good because I frankly, I wouldn't be too much in the plan, in which there are people in the, social experiments Right?
yes
That leave all the technological advances behind and want to live like that, totally natural. well that's interesting, for a brief time.
yes
Very physically exhausting right?
No, look, what surprises me is this that my grandmother my Dad's Mother
yes
she was, I don't know, 30, 30, or 32 years when she got married, in 1918
Oh
So, she was old in that time
yes
Being that old and getting married
yes
And then, she was, well, my grandparents were are Catalans
Yes
And then, they make cloth, you see?
yes
She embroidered, all the things she used at home, the blankets, all was embroidered and all was done by here
Oh, that's nice
All the cloth she used, all the cloth her children used, she did everything, except my grandfather's suits, that were made by a tailor, but she could made that if she wanted
The shirts
Oh!
she did
yes
All tat, and it cooked delicious how they cooked and you read about all days in the Argentina newspaper, a Catalan newspaper and a French newspaper
Oh my God!
yes, and they did
wow
she was the manager, the one who handled all the money of a factory of overall uniforms that my grandfather owned
oh my god! she was an exceptional woman, don't you think so? although
how come she could do all that, when I was a child she did have a washing machine but she used to do things
the traditional way, you know what I mean?
with her own physical strength
And I think it is because we do, we do a lot of things but we spend almost a third part of the day in the car
Absolutely, Our time
and when we get home we are exhausted eh, and then we sit down and watch TV
that's it
and talk on the phone
less every day
understand?
because sometimes I miss the telephone a little, because I think, you don't talk to your friends not even on the phone, because you don't take the time
No, that's not true
sometimes
that's right
for, for that
Oh, so
but, you are absolutely right
se
I agree absolutely
it is very funny, I mean, they had less technology but achieved more things, of course they didn't have the chances we have nowadays as women
uhm
but they achieved a lot in, in, in the matter of production
of production, of course
and we don't, maybe the women, I am an Artist, so it's like I don't really count, but women who have
eh, professional jobs working in companies, eh, who are accountants, doctors, lawyers, things like this
Well you decide less on your own time actually, somehow your grandmother could organize her time in a more personal way, because, well
when you are an employee working for some other person
uhm
well, often your time belongs to the employer also, often
yes and so the production goes to
and then
to the employer
yes, and it takes most of your time and energy, like you say, when you go back home after driving, after driving the car, after
having worked for eight or ten hours in some other place
yes
and when you finally get home you go, oh!
Sure, you want your time
What did I have to do?
you want your time, because you've been giving all your time to others
And it's true that when you use certain technologies, you avoid learning how to do things they way they were done when those technologies weren't around
if someday a bomb falls or a fantastic situation like that, you'll have to start civilization all over again
yes, yes
well, then I wonder: how will we do it?
we won't know anything, you know?
if we didn't have everything at hand
My sons, I have two sons, one is 23 and the other is 17
yeah
And they went to a school for, for, for, seventh, eight and ninth grade. They were here in the mountains of North Carolina
there are about 28, 29 students, tops
wow!
and they live 4 or 5 in cabins, and they're in the middle of nature
Ah, then they have to learn that, learn how to survive
and they have no computers
wow!
no tv, well, there's a TV that
yeah
that sometimes on weekendsd they bring it, to show a movie, they go and rent a movie
wow, how interesting
but the boys to everything we wake up early in the morning, because I work there in the fall
how great
you wake up early in the morning, everyone helps with the breakfast and there it goes walking, a, a half mile until the
school buildings that are cabins too
hmm
you and there, they start the day with a half hour of singing.
aha
anything, any song, anything that you want that the boys can play and after the boys play guitar, the teachers play guitar and after that the day begins.
and you know
but
at the end of the day
but how interesting
they've done, we've done, we've achieved many things
aha
you know, of course not, what do I know, the boys grow up constantly doing things, doing work but also
we return a little bit to what you were saying, about not watching television
participating
not having a computer
yes
no way that should take your time, your time is to be used in other things, look how interesting really
yes, yes, yes
technology is not completely good
yes
it takes a lot of your time
yes, I think it absorbs too much energy
the boys now spend the whole afternoon in the Internet
oh, yes, and playing video games
and every afternoon in the week, right?
mhm
then you don't have a chance to give your time to other things
yes, so, sometimes I wonder what will be of that physical creativity, understand? that creativity that comes from being among
us when we are very young in the streets, trying to, not to get bored and the comes an idea, and then another one. Now they talk about
ideas, boys talk about ideas, but while they are playing games on the cell phone
right, yes, yes, you are absolutely right
so I don't know
it is, it is relative somehow, the use of time, nowadays, how we are using it still having all these entertainment devices, television,
yes
computers, video games, and all that stuff, they are great consumers of our time, and therefore of our creative activity, like you say.
yes, yes, it comes to destroy our energy
and of our energy
So no, I don't know and I'm very guilty, I'm now trying to not turn on the television because I have a lot to do. Because I turn on the TV
and even if I'm doing things, yes, going from room to room fixing putting this I go shopping, return, this and that. the same is like
it sucks my energy.
yes Let's see, Listen and why, What do you do? how is it that you're an artist?
oh, I'm an actress and also direct.
Ah, okay
then when I'm not working, I'm here in the house in the house
Okay
I paint the walls fix things
well, yes
build new rooms,
aha
thing is working, is
exactly, like resting but working
Sure
And in well, resting, making adobe like they say
sure
here in my country.
yes, And what do you do?
eh, well look I'm a teacher.
Ahm
yes
God bless you
for small children
Ah what a thing.
Eh, I love it, eh the truth is that I love it, because there
Oh, yes no, it's a vocation.
There you have a whole reener- You get filled again with positive energy
yes, yes
Because they really are something else, they are not yet,
yes, yes there are no limits,
they are not so educated on the other options yet
mhm
so there yes all the use of time has to be always very creative and, and and even though at schools they are promoting a lot the a
support in the use of computers for education. But well it's not generalised yet And it's you and well you shouldn't satanize the either,
let's say, the technology because precisely with respect to education, computers are, yes a marvel
oh, yes no that's true.
Usin educational programs and all that,
No, and unfortunately we have to maintain the popula- tion. to the level of the Chinese.
yes, that have a very high technological development.
because they do have a technological development and they are advancing very very, very fast and in that culture education is sacred,
yes
and in this culture it's not.
No,
and then there is where we really can fall behind. we will fall behind but
Your kids, eh, What are they studying?
they are both artists, unfortunately I don't have any any
Hello Jose
Hello, How are you? My name is Marco, And you?
Jose
Hello Jose, How are you? Where are you?
In New York
In New York, I am in Philadelphia.
OK
Technical devices.
technical devices
What type of technical devices do you use?
eh, for my the computer
mm
Eh, Eh, something essential
essential it's what
I use it every day. eh
Connected to the internet.
Yes connected to the internet. am, I helps me to to check mail from work, the personal mail. Eh, I can see, eh eh, the pictures that
I'm taking classes at university. And then sometimes they put, eh, homework,
On line.
and they put different things. eh, raleted to the class, so I have to check it, that. every day.
Yes, I also, I also worked as a computer technician. I assembled them, dissasembled them, fixed them
Okay, yeah
eh, I have, of course, a network here at home, made with 3 machines, a couple screens, my phone, which I´m using to talk now, it´s a, it´s a
how do you call it, a pocket, a pocket pc, eh
hmm
one made by, by hp that basically I use, connecting by wifi
okay, hmm, hmm
to internet, i check my mail, I download videos, I even have movies, you can have a SD card, I have
hmm
hmm, I have, all the information of people, I don´t remember anyone´s phone number
hmm
and I almost don´t remember my own phone number because I don´t dial the number, but I use words, or I use the name of the person I´m
calling
ah, okay
yes, now everything is, at least me and other people I know too, used to put directly the name without, without remembering the number
eh
yes
I have there my mail, my electronic mail, the e-mail addresses too
ah
all goes in the computer, or in the phone that can also connect to the computer, and can move information from one to the other
mm
I listen to music on -mp three through my phone. I put the headset and listen to that.
mm What type of phone did you tell me it was?
eh Is a, is a -hp is an ipaq
okay, okay
That basically the phone in itself is, wide, eh
aha, yes, yes
is wide and it's basically pure screen
okay
a, is a
Has, and it has like a typewriter, it has like all the letters. Like a small processor like mm
I mean ah, it even has I think that it has, eh pocket word and also excel things that are installed in
okay
in the
But it does have a lot of keys. There are, are, a lot of keys.
It doesn't have any key, it doesn't have any key.
oh the keys only the normal ones.
No, no in the, it doesn't have, it doesn't have eh, it doesn't have a keyboard
okay
like that, complete, I had before this one the,
hmm
the, the trio
hmm
And it had, it had the complete keyboard.
hmm
I wrote with this with my two thumbs, I wrote pretty fast.
hmm
eh, but now that it has a screen, it has, it recognizes hand writing,
hmm
eh, I've also learned to write rapidly.
hmm
eh, and it connects with, with everything at work, I also go to class, there are classes where I go in person once a week, a four hour class.
yes hmm
And, the rest is online.  Eh, the subjects are all delivered online, all through email, eh
okay hmm
it seems to me that we're really used to it and I think that we can get used to, we could and should get used to it a bit more.  For example, to see dates
friends' birthdays, family,
hmm
this is something really easy to put on the computer, on the machine without thinking, literally
hmm
Oh, remember
Mm
All the dates and all the events, I think that not only the ones remembering looking in a while, It's not that often
I think that we depend to much in this technology, or too little
I think that we could also, decide, I mean, there is certain people that can't remember more than the telephone numbers
that can be a bad thing
Mm
and basically, according me, I've been using that kid of device for several years, several years
yes..
And after I broke or lost the plastic device, I don't remember anything, I don't know anything
Mmm
And I ask myself for my own telephone number and I don't practically remember
yes
But know, of course, with the connection, or connection the device to the home computer
Mmm
It's always there, I don't lost the information
Mm
You don't lost the phone numbers, the names, specific data, Things you don't always remember, without a note, and when you write those down, you usually write in
a piece of paper that is in reach, at the moment, you remember
yes
you don't necessarily find it back when you need it
right, no, you can get, uh, a lot of information in the computer, and retain it still, to a point where
Yes
you need it or don't want it
And that's why it will only give it to you when
Yes
you remember to ask for it
also, yeah
that's the other problem
Uh
Uh, of course, with the new, uh, new programs that are there and remember to remind you, my phone reminds me in the morning, i mean, i have
my whole day is on the com- on my phone
oh, OK
Uh, see, in a schedule that i have in
uh huh
my whole day schedule, what i do since the hour i start working
uh huh, uh huh
until the hour i get out, the hour at which i have to go pick up the kid from school
Uh huh
To
You have and organization
Exactly, and finding her in high school, sure, for me coming back to faculty to see the classes I'm taking
Mmm
And looking in one look, I see that I have to do in the day, things that before you were always trying to remember, or write down in a
in your arm or in a paper, or as I said
Mmm
Not always in your disposal when you need it
Mmm
But, it's, I think that people, there are people that dedicate too much, not dedicate, but have, they have
yes, yes, it's needed to much, not now
Mmm
no, it looses the human side, let's say
yes
And for example, you feel that you are trying to talk, to call some companies for problems you have
Mmm
Call to the telephone and you have to deal with
With a machine
With a machine and try to
And operator or a machine, like, press the number for that, press number two for that
yes, exactly
That, on one side, i understand that on the side
it
On the company side, uh, yes, it has a lot, a lot uh, lots of complaints, and they kinda want to organize the way to help the client, i mean
did you change direction or do you have a question about this, you know, maybe so
It makes sense, yes
i helped him/her organize those questions, so that the person that's going to help knows what the problem is. Or what specifically about the problem
Exactly
with it, but, uh, it's very frustrating to call a credit card, and have to talk with the operator
that will possibly have consequences, uh, bad ones. Like you lose your card and have to speak to an operator to put pressure on the
uh
that you have been stolen and you want to talk to
yes
them to cancel your card before someone will use it illegally
The way it looks in theory, and i think that most of the time it's like that in companies. The private companies
those public companies and government, typical throughout the world, i guess
uh huh
Uh, they'll find, you'll find that they go around and around more than a snail, i mean, but many others don't, they can't get you the person
Uh huh
Because it almost seems like they're trying to avoid talking to you
Yeah, of course
But
The company, the company, as they did in New York, or what they are doing in many places
the public transportation system, it's doing everything, when you go to the local train station and you buy a ticket, you buy it in a machine, you don't buy it with a person, then that affects
Sure, that might have sense, because it's a really easy transaction, and it might be really fast the machine, while a person
yes, yes, yes
The person is making money by hour and there might be benefits
yes
if you pay, let's say, $10 per hour in the work
Mmm
and the company has some benefits, healthcare, and things like that
Mmm
Hello, my nameis Miriam.
This is Gloria from here in California.
Yeah, How are you, Gloria? I'm from Toronto.
OK
Eh, electrical artifacts Are you dependent on that?
No, what everything, what I use the most is the computer
Uh uh.
yes, the television, no?
Right?
Uh uh.
We are very dependant, I also with the computer to be more informed yeah border
Uh uh.
of the city, right?
yes, over all I use it to communicate with family.
Now, that it's become cheaper than calling
Than the phone.
yeah long distance, yes.
Definitively. Uh uh.
yes, and tell me, Have you been using the computer for a long time?
No, eh. Less than a year.
Oh
Oh, less than a year
I see
The television that
From all the life
The news and all that,
yes but
but, is not that also the
The television
Being a fan of being all day in front of the television, I do use more the computer
Oh, really nice, nice
Yes
Instead, I was born watching Television, I really like the television
Oh
But it's bad
Really bad, but, there is nothing else to entertain us, right?
I try to
Mmm
I really like to watch the news and sometimes I'm really nervous of the talk show that sometimes I watch
Mmm
But I try to, when my son is around I try not to watch it.
Uh uh.
of the
Is the first thing they tell you. Well, the pediatrician tells me, No TV
yes is true.
Guadalupe tells the girl, No TV Guadalupe. And she there loves the TV.
yes, well, is that sometimes there are things so
Uh uh
bad. So entertaining.
Uh uh. yes
That's why eh, that's why they make it, so entertaining so that one becomes hooked.
Mm, yes, now the radio is little, only when my husband is here he likes to listen a lot like a lot to that rock music and everything even though
he's already up there in age he's always liked rock.
Rock how nice, the rock
Uh uh.
Latin or American rock?
More than anything eh yes you could say Latin because is eh is eh a group eh, I don't know where it's from. I have no information of
that type of music.
Oh, how nice, how nice, well is
Uh uh. Uh uh.
also eh because honestly music makes the heart happy.
yes, that's true. I like romantic music better but I'm not so much of a radio person, more the computer.
It takes us back. Uh uh.
I don't know if it's good or if it's bad but yes. I like to research a lot.
Okay.
Uh uh. Technology is not bad.
But, do you go into the chat rooms?
No, No, No, No, No.
No, eh? I don't waste my time with the chat also but the
No.
my husband does lose his worry a lot.
Once I went into one of those and I didn't like the experience because sometimes is just so they attack you
It's true, it's true or if not the people seem very
Mm.
I don't know I don't trust it.
Not all, not all the people are sociable. In one is just to offend you.
It's true there are very ignorant people that go there, yes.
Mm, yes. Uh uh
Okay
Then. I don't think that there's anything wrong, anything wrong, more than anything the computer because I use it mainly to mainly to get information.
Tell me, and the washing machine?
No, eh, yes to the laundromat, I go to the laundromat.  I don't have one here at home.
Yeah. You don't wash small things by hand?
yes?
In exchange?
Sometimes I prefer to use it, I to it by hand because sometimes the washing machines don't do it well.
No, they don't do it well.
Hmm.
But I think that for the washing machine to wash well, I've looked for the secret, it's to not fill it too much.
yes, right?
with clothes, yeah.
Uh-huh.
But washing by hand, I can do this with everything, while I think that yeah my liking for the television and the washing machine I think would win.
No, I do it by hand.  Eh, all the colored clothes I wash here at home.  I sometimes wash the white clothes here but
eh I give the rest to the laundromat.
But, but you have a big space because on the other hand no
For me to to be well.
A house has to be
Eh, you can say, every two is ah, duplex
oh so.  You have this, a bathroom that's big where there's a washing machine.  Where you wash clothes.
Don't think that, I wash here in the kitchen sink
Oh, look that, Well
I put it in water and i put it there to soft the soap
I see
And after, I cleaned myself in the same, no, it's big
I congratulate you, because I had to do that in Peru and, hell, I delayed it until I was with nothing left and my mom made me do the laundry
Oh
Here in Canada, the first things I sold when I arrived was the washer
The washer, no more soap in my hands
No more soap and cold, and besides I don't know
yes
when i tried to do the laudry manually, and I used, I used gloves
Oh
It's hard, because those detergents are really strong, right?
yes, that happens to me, and I have my hands also like that
No, you have to use gloves woman
Oh, well, I don't really get along with gloves
Because, if not, you are going to get arthritis, because those detergents are mean
Also, right?, yes, because you have the need of using the appliances
Didn't I told you that
electric.  It's true.
Yeah.  Yeah.
Hmm.  There really essential but sometimes you get addicted to the things, no?
They're very, yeah.  Imagine, sometimes I think, what would they have done a long time back?  We went with my son to visit a village that was called Pioneer Village.
Hmm.  Hmm.
From the Pioneers who came to Canada, right?
Hmm.
And they taught them how they didn't have electricity and had to do everything like they really lived.
Hmm.
I
Before they were sent around using things like that.
Yeah.
The televisions used a car battery.
Yeah.  Yeah.  Life was really hard before.
yes.
It was really hard, now the truth is that in homes
technology has really advanced.
they save time, yeah, and it saves time too.  It saves time.
yes.  Definitely.
Imagine how hard it was for our mothers who also had so many kids
Um, uh, yeah
Oh no, poor thing
Yes, they're essential, to me, i think that yeah, there are a lot of comfort here, well, that you can't have in your country, well, you never had
No, no, no
Right?, here you come to socialize a little bit more, to update yourself
Yeah, it's true
Um
But int our countries [...] is also being introduced
Yeah
the thing is that power is expensive
But, the one who has no money... uh huh
Power is too high
Yes
But sometimes here too, i don't know, it depends, it depends on the use you give to it, because if you abuse it, power costs too much, uh?
That one day rising too much
Yeah, although there are
The only consumption i have is the computer, yeah, my husband doesn't even use it. We supposedly bought it to learn both, right?
Uh huh
But now i know more because he's going to study computing at school and all, but he doesn't like to touch the computer at home
Yeah, that's it, yeah, it's just people now, uh, now we study or work in what we have, i mean, in what we need, but that's not what we like
Mm. Mm.
we only do it in order to survive, right?
yes.
But the people already don't follow their heart.
Mm.
It's what they like to day and it's already almost that they are very sad.
yes, it's a necessity.
Already. That's true.
yes. But, yes they're very important those electrical devices in truth because
It's here?
There are a lot of advantages.
yes, yes it's
But also sometimes it's wholly dependent on one thing
yes, because
Because when I don't use the computer for months but. On the weekends, now that I'm here, I don't get on the computer.
Oh.
Mm.
No, I'm not so dependent on the computer. Also I don't like very much either.
No. I like it.
No, computers bore me.
I like downloading music, I like it, from some countries. I like it, if something comes to my mind, I search for it. Well, that's a second brain, right?
I fins a waste of time the Internet
yes
Because sometimes when I look for something
MM
there is so much information that I don't know which to choose, and the one I choose
MM
is full of propaganda or the information is not that good, so I got tired of it
That, mm
I don't know, honestly, I don't really like it
yes, but I also say that there is a big addiction to television, right?
But it is necessary, already
Well, everybody has his hobbies, let's put it that way
His, yea, yes, right. Tell me, do you think the telephone is a need?
Oh yes
Of all, of all the devices we mentioned, which one is a basic need we can't do without?
The stove
Oh the
To me the stove, because I use it all the time. The telephone also, you see
The telephone
anything one to the phone an emergency or something, the telephone.
Yes, I honestly think I mean, basic, basic would be the phone
Mm.
The stove I don't know, you never cook on the kerosene ones? or gas?
Of gas, also, aha.
Okay. The stove could be replaced
yes. the phone, yes, is also one.
But the phone is essential. Is essential. I deem it more essential than
yes.
that the television and all the phone.
you are always connected if you have a phone handy.
really?
It's very necessary for even when one goes out an emergency or something. Mm.
yes, also for. Just to say if you have a meeting and something happened and they call you to tell you yes you know don't come Don't come anymore
you save time, right?
Mm Mm
I deem it so
Mm.
So essential that. And to find jobs. To call the hospi-
Everything, uh uh
what do I know already.
Ah yes Uh uh.
The telephone is so important.
It is.
Okay. And what else could be essential?
Mm. What is used the most is the radio, the television.
The television.
The computer which already became
yes, yes it's become here.
Uh uh. The microwave.
Like that everybody, right? Oh, the microwave. Do you use it much?
No I don't like it at all, to heat up things there, my husband does like it because he says it's faster but I like it better on the stove.
Okay
That's why, I've heard now many things about the microwave. The blender is also an essential part for me. Eh, my husband is Mexican and he likes a lot the
the chili sauces and all that. I use the blender a lot too.
Oh ah yes I on the other hand I'm lazy when it comes to the blender. I use it when
Oh.
I need it
The toaster all that.
Uh uh.
Mm
And what would you do in a city? town with no electricity?
Mm
It would be hard, right?
I don´t know, I come from a place where I grew up that had no electricity and
Uh uh
with firewood, with firewood
Really?
yes
Wow
Uh uh
But you have to go and get it, right?
sure, and yes, there´s a place where you have to buy it, and I spent all that
Oh
MM
and the firewood, the whole house or just the place where it´s lighted up? In the room where you set it on fire
Mm, yes, it reaches a lot
Oh, look, how nice, I had never
Mm. Mm. It´s essential during the, eh, like right now, yes, it´s raining a lot, we have to heat the house and all that, no?
Hello, yes, who is speaking?
Silvia, hello, how are you? Silvia
hello, this is Alavaro
pardon, what? Alvaro?
that's my surname
oh ,yes, yes, pleased to meet you
and where are you calling from?
I am calling from the state of Louisiana, but I live in Indiana
aha
and the artifacts, what kind were they?
what?
I didn't understand the lady on the phone, she said they were, electronic devices, is that right?
yes, electronic devices, and things like this
oh, electrical. mm
so you are from Indiana but, where were you born?
oh, I was born in, in Indiana also, but raised in Laredo, Texas, with my grandma, there is where I learned Spanish, we are actually Mexican, ah
OK
my grandparents are from there, my parents were born and raised in Texas and we hardly noticed about the many trips to Mexico, we don't have any relatives there
aha
but the electrical devices, I don't understand in what way..eh
but, look it doesn't matter, eh, you can talk about something else, of whatever you want, yes
oh, really?
yes, yes, yes, is not mandatory to talk about the topics that they put
ah, that's good, because that's what I didn't know, is my second time that I talk on the phone. Because the first time was a topic very
hard, for me anyhow it was the topic of religion, to see if organized religion affected positively or negatively
yes, eh, I think that I talked with someone regarding that also
aha, aha, and how many times do you call by phone?,
okay
do you talk on the phone several times a day?
eh, they call you only once a day
oh, really?
but, this, this call for me I think is the twenty fourth
yes, oh, that's very good
mm
I love it because yes, to talk with another person ah know where they come from, and where do you come from?
I'm from Uruguay
ah, how nice, and never, I never, ah I don't see the difference in your, you don't even have an accent nor anything for me the same, right? because, ah
we've known families from Uruguay and I don't know the accent seems the same, as the Mexican for me and how far are you from where? no ah, I'm not sure where Uruguay is
Uruguay is to the south of Brazil.
oh, really?
Yeah, well, just south of Brazil
Oh, wow, so it means that they do speak Spanish in Brasil?
No, they speak Portuguese in Brasil, and
oh, and
And Spanish in Latin America, but on the border
and, right
I'm sorry, on Uruguay's border they speak, uh, Spanish and Portuguese too
Oh, and its, oh, they speak Portuguese?
Yes, yes, yes
Woe, and
uh, i, can i speak Portuguese?, a little, just a little
Right, a little, yes, i can understand them a little bit, but it's hard for me because they do it very fast, yeah, and there were also others, right?
Uh, i'm sorry?
How many others, uh?, oh, it seems there is another call coming in, I'm going to ignore it, but let me see who it is, ok?
OK
oh, just the Dalva, no problem, it's just i bought a new phone and i can't understand it yet, i haven't studied it
Oh, it's a cellphone, I'm living in Austin, Texas now
and where do you live right now?, in Austin, Teas, well, you're not too far now, i have a sister that lives in Houston, Texas, and we haven't seen each other for seven years, i don't understand why she doesn't come to see us in
Oh, yes?
Indiana, I'm like half an hour away from Chigago
yes
and so we grow up in the cold and my work brings me to many states to, to explain to someone the benefits of their work
and for two or three weeks we go as a group, and face to face we explain all the benefits that they have, the health plan, the life insurance plan
the plan for, and, the ah
aha
well, everything the have, no?  ah, and right now we're in a casino and there are like five thousand employees and I've worked from five to
to six in the morning, no, here I start at ten now that they put me in
aha
from the, ah, nine at night to six in the morning
aha
and people are really really relaxed here, really nice, ah, it's what they call the by you
what's it called?
and the last names in the bayou from Louisiana
ah, I think that I know it, I've passed by there
oh yes, it's the place where they say Kinder, Louisiana and a lot of personnel, people here seem Mexican, but in reality they're Indian
aha
and they have their reservation and they give them, well, they govern their own nation, right?  So they can feel comfortable, so they can return their rights to them, ah, the earth
but really strange because for me, here everything is, a, French, the food, the last names,
eh,
they can be white, dark, or Indian, and they all have a French last name, it's so strange to me
uh, that had been a French colony, right?
What?
that there, there there they'd been a French colony
uh huh, that's what happened, and they got last names from them uh huh and here hurricane Rita hit them pretty hard here, the Wal Mart's store here still isn't, uh, completel- completely restored
ah, yes?
here you see, yea, the stores look all broken, some of them still are, uh the trees uh, you can still see them, well they're damaged a car that
got stuck under a, uh, a big tree, and they still haven't uh they still haven't gotten it out
ah I mean that
mm hmm
sh- it must be pretty moving, uh, all that yea
and uh huh, I've only, I've only been in the southern states and they give me choices to go to the north, I told them no, for that
you can stay at your home and work there, uh and we, we've had to stay in hotels, you never know co- what's going to happen to you here we've had good ti-
they always treat us well but the people, I just started this job, and the people who work with me are older they're like fifty up to sixty five years old
uh huh
I don't know why it's like that but yea, the people have already been doing this thirty years
right they're more experienced
mm, mm hmm, and what kind of work do you do?
look, right now, uh, what I'm doing lately is pizza delivery um, delivery in, Do- Dominos Pizza
mm
hello?
hello, my name is Leticia
ah, how are you?, my name is Mariano, here from Philadelphia
ah, I am also in Philadelphia
ah, that's good, how did you find out about this contest? about this contest, study
eh, in truth, eh, I think it was trhough Craig list it was, now I don't even remember
ah no, a- I, I found out through through, how do you call it? through a friend I have
ah, and, and where are you from?
what I am from Buenos Aires, from Argentina
ah, me too, yes
don't tell me that's good, and, what do you work, here in Philadelphia, too?
yes, in Penn
ah look at that, , me too, I'm here at the University of Pennsylvania,
really, in which floor, where are you from, in which building?
in the biomedical re- cla- eh this study is from Penn, that why it must be
ah
ah, and what do you do here?
I'm doing, ah, let's say that I'm working as a technician
aha, as a tec- as a technician aha, in which area?
mm in, in the part of lypids and and, and well, and cardiac illnesses and well, a bit of everything
a little of everything, there are many Argentinians, I, it hasn't been long that I studied here
yes
it's been like a year
ah, well me it's been six months
six months, but there are many Argentinians
yes, a bunch, and what, what do you think of the topic?
there's a bunch of, I didn't hear the instruction to well, is, is, is I think that is of living in the city or no, right?
yes, what do you prefer to live in the city or, live in, in the outskirts?
no, I would prefer in the outskirts I mean, in the like that kind of the country, a place like that with a lot of nature, a place where the women can't be tempted and spend too much money
but what, what are the advantages of living in the outskirts, for you?
you see that women are super spenders and, and for me to have peace, be able to dedicate myself to the more essential things in life, be able to dedicate myself to the family, be calm
I don't know, I think that the contact with nature is essential
and, and, and, why wouldn't you like to live in the city?
and because, I don't know, I don't know, I feel one gets into a rhythm in that we also come from Buenos Aires and Buenos Aires is much more, eh what do you call it?
terrible in that sense, but but, I prefer much more, a smaller city this is small city, in comparison to Buenos Aires, and the truth is I feel much better
so, despite being a bit far from the family, and sometimes one misses, I like, I like, I think that the size, in the city of Buenos Aires there's a madness of people
I was living in Palermo which was a nice neighborhood, no, is not that it was bad, but I felt like a pressure in my head that I didn't like, there's something that I don't like about that
and I don't know how to define it, but, but, I like it more to have a house, have my feet on the ground, be able to go out and step on the grass and
I don't know, simple things
and but, in this country you think that living in eh, ah, in the outskirts is compatible with a peaceful life, because I mean, you have to travel every day probably until
Until downtown to to, to work, if you work downtown or in Penn  in this case, or
yes, yes, and i think that yeah, because you can have a car or you can use the, public transportation, lets say, for the week, it's not bad
you can go in train or in subway, i don't think it's bad, i think that, it's a good option
but Philadelphia is also a very special city in that way because
and, that's true
they say, like not every, not every city in the United States have that public transportation availability
Yes, that's true, that's true, besides, Philadelphia is little, you can walk a lot
And how long do you plan to stay  here?
and, around two or three years, three years i think, i came to do a post-doc so, you see, you never know, uh, I'm with my wife so
sure, yesterday i spoke to a guy from, from New York that asked me if i knew a girl that worked in Penn
Oh yes?
That's argentinian, but i don't know who he was talking about, because, i, the guy is from Panama
Right, and what girl was that?
But he didn't know the name
Oh, it's just that there are a few argentinians, i don't know, i don't know if it's good or bad but there are a lot
And i know, he told me she worked in Penn and lived in Philadelphia but
Oh
He couldn't remember her name
Oh, yes, no, i don't know
And, uh, and well, i, I'm happy living in, living in downtown
yes, do you like it?
yes, it is not as aggressive city  as Buenos Aires
I feel very good over here the city is very nice.
where do you live?
I live near South Philly
oh Me, too
really? do you know Paula Stein?
Paula, yes, yes, yes
she lives near my house, not too far away.
yes, yes, yes, I know her.
Yes but I thought it was a comparison of another area.
of course.
because, there are things to do, you know, maybe during the night time would be safer.
yes
I feel comfortable here, if it wasn´t for the two little mice
It is full of mice in Philadelphia
It must be something of philadelphia, Because there are Many in Landlord too
of course
so for how long do you want to be here?
maybe three years.
something like this like, like three years.  Are you single, are you married?
I don't know, yes more I'm with my husband, that in reality we both came and, and well
aha
he came to work, but the truth is that he's not working a lot, like
ah, no?
yes the truth is well, in the end I'm working now
yes yeah, yeah and well, it's a big of justice, every time each
yes, and and well, everything was planned in a way and good, but he works, but the truth is that
but neither
I'm the one who
ah, yes?
earns more, and this, no?
how strange, in general it's always the men, no?  those who
yes but no
not in your case
no no but, we're happy all the same, we like the city
yes
yes the truth is well, we take advantage when there's a study so, so also
that you can study, now
that, that also lets us do something more this, this thing
that can, of course, participate, right? and I saw one of Viagra that was very funny because they gave you, mm, double the normal dose and you could, mm,
and they made you vision studies for, I don't know, for five months or so, it was good money, like the mexiacns say, it was about one thousand eight hundred dollars
figure
so
there are studies for anything you want, but I, I mean I wouldn't inject anything for instance
no?
these things, I don't like, medicating and so
but well, if something happens to you they give the money to your husband so, nothing it was just a joke, mm
eh, n-
no, no, right, injecting stuff, no
and, and
no, I'd rather not
did you make many calls with this one already?
I think about fifteen, more or less
oh
but now I am, I am calling from another phone because, I don't know if you received the email, but if you make five calls from different phones they give you, how you call it? they give you more money, they give you five more dollars
oh, yes, yes, yes
so now I am calling from the office
yes, they called me, they sent me an email with that
yes, yes, so, you can call from five different numbers and you get fifty dollars more
sure sure
so that, eh, yes good
good, good, that's good, that's good, everyone I know, who speaks Spanish, I'm telling them
ah, yes?  You know many Spanish speakers?
hmm yes, yes a lot
a lot?
yes, many are engaging in this
yes, yes, I don't know if they will continually do Fisher studies and
yes
that, like, because I saw that there are other languages too, I don't know if they will open another one for Spanish, but what I read in the mail, it's probable that yes, but, but I'm not sure
yes, I don't know, in truth I don't know, but it's interesting
it's yes, yes, a very interesting idea, true that
yes, the only thing that well, yeah two times the topic of the day repeated and well
well to me too but, but since you speak with different people in general
and at times yeah
it's good, because you exchange opinions and see
yes, yes
see how they think
yes, yes there are times when it's interesting to hear other opinions
a Venezuelan and this, it's nice, really nice
ah, yes, yes, the Venezuelans have an accent very
ah, from Los Angeles yes, I love, I love the Venezuelan girls
yes very, men like them a lot, especially, it seems to me that the Argentinians in particular
yes, ah no, but, yes, yes, women like that drive men crazy, you imagine that you are talking with Catalin Fulobo but, but my God what a beautiful accent they have
yes, yes, yes
there are other accents that I don't like too much, but that Venezuelan girl's, or the accent of the Venezuelan girls in general is very pretty, the Cuban one also
yes and the Panamanian is very similar to the Cuban I think
eh, you think?
yes, I find it very similar
I mix those up a lot, the Cuban
and but, Panamanian also a lot, and I didn't know how they talked, no?
I can more or less distinguish the Cuban and Venezuelan, and then the Mexican but the rest, no, no, no, no, I find it hard
sure, sure
honestly, do you have any plans for today?
and do some Christmas shopping eh, yes
ah, really?, my God
yes, yes, I feel like buying a few things, let's see
your poor husband, you go with your husband?
is like that, life's like that, one works to
that's true
to also pamper oneself, no?
totally, yes, no
I mean, I think that it's part of, of, of everything
exactly
and no, and well, for me the truth that I
Lurdes.
Iliana.
Hello Iliana. Good evening.
How is it going, Lurdes? How are you?
Ah, fine thank God. Well look I live in the city. Eh, and I love the city life. The happiest day of my life for me was when
I sold my car because I moved to the city and here the bus is very good I live in New York.
Ah, A, you live in New York?
yes, yes.
And where did you live before?
Before I lived in Connecticut. In Hartford. And well, in the outskirts in a little town called New Britain. And to get anywhere
I had to drive. I needed my car. Not to go to the supermarket. I could walk.
Oh.  Sure, I don't like those places for example.  Everyone told me that Los Angeles is like that. Whatever is the city you have
what do you call it, go in car everywhere.
Sure, sure, Where do you live? City in suburbs or what?
No I live in Boston.
Ah, okay
In reality I lived in the city before. I'm Argentinian and lived in Buenos Aires and
Ah how nice.
and I moved over here, yes let' say to this city and I'm not used to it, no?
Sure, sure.
Oh, friend, Boston seems quiet for me
Sure, compared with Buenos Aires
Sure, it's a quiet city, New York, not at all, is not a quiet city
Well, look, for me, the convenience of having all to my reach no, having the supermarket near, the work near
the care of kids near, the doctor near, all the mail, all is, I mean, I can walk, all it's near so
Oh, knowing that I can take the train or the bus and get to any other neighborhood, and i arrive to a totally different neighborhood
where I live there is a lot of variety of
yes
food, really ethnic variety, and well, a variety of services I really like
yes, that's it, I also like it, I live on the outsides of the Downtown
Mmm
And it keeps been the city, but I work Downtown, then I have everything there
Oh, that's nice
yes, it's really nice, luckly
And do you think this is the ideal place or you'll like to?
No
okay
Not at all, I Love everything, I love it because it's safe, I love the city because you can transport yourself without a car
Mmm
and let's say, that's all good, But I don't really like the weather
Aye, no, this is cold.
Sure, no, his favorite his whole life.  eh, something a more difficult city, let's say that but not, hot.  I need heat and the beach, I realize.
Sure.  Sure.  Sure.  I understand you perfectly.  There are times when these snows fall and I say, aye my God, each time in this country again.
Sure.  Besides you forget.  The summer comes and it's all so nice you can walk in the city.
Sure.
and you forget and after winter comes and look now
Yeah.
you remember that it was, you will suffer and
Sure.
and above all the winters are long.  Here it's until June.
Sure.
Cold.
Hey, And there in Boston it doesn't snow much, right?
yes.
Uh.
yes, a lot and after it freezes.  The floor and you slip and everything, it's all a mess.
Ah, yes.  And.
And you, where are you from?
And for.  I'm from Puerto Rico.
Where were you born?  Ah, less.
From Puerto Rico, here borrowed, but figure out, one of the questions was the ideal house of the ideal site to live, right?
Yes
And I think that I would like to live in one of the both extremes, I mean, have a house in the old San Juan
That even if it's not the great thing, like New York, but it's  comfortable because it's all together
To have all in hand
Exactly, or live in the country, with a farm, and have a coffee plantations or some cattle, and live in country, but
everything that stays in the suburbs, the developments of, well, all those of cars, none of them I like
yes, sure
So, It would have to be one of those extremes, Totally urban or totally country like, right?
Sure, yes, for me, instead of the country, a day in a beach cabin
Oh, really?
Yes, I love it, so, I would be able to have a house in the beach and nothing else, only the sea, or a city, a big city sure
Where you have everything, walking and done
Look that
Everything else
the idea of the beach didn't come to my mind, but does no sound bad
No, with a house and a little bar for tourist, cocktails in the night, like being able to live and done
Sure, and it's done, hey look, now that you told me that in Puerto Rico
yes
The snake, oh,there are many people that comes visiting and they found out that, well, that there is almost none touristic development
so what he developed is really local and finished doing what you just described.  They buy a
Sure.
they have a guest house, they have a little bar for the people who are visiting there and live the rest of their lives there in this dream that you just described.
Sure, and well they are happy, I'm sure that they're really happy.
yes.  yes, yes, yes, yes.
But for example, look, I have experience.  I was in Costa Rica.  And there was an Argentinian family with three little kids who did this.  And this is paradise.
but look at what happened.  They were, the woman had a nail from the table in the eye.
Aye, no no no no no.  Don't tell me.
yes, and well, after they had to sell everything in Los Angeles, to operate on the woman and this and the other so
and everything to have a hospital well
Aye, yes.  No, because I imagine that there they didn't have anything, no
Sure, they didn't have anything.  They had to go to
the center
The United States for the emergency that was all
Ah,
terrible.  In the end it was a disgrace because I only knew them as happy and after I met someone who knew this happy family and they told me this tragedy, the truth that
Aye.
I don't know, whether to because
It's not the rise of the fall.
Sure.  No.
Ah, what a shame.
yes, but well, everything everything is suspect. They know it all, you lose and you win a little.
Sure. Sure. It's not definitely, because here for example well I like it a lot but the pollution is one thing that well that I think my son, my poor son
will grow up with asthma just thinking about it because since there's so much pollution, right?
Sure.
since this is a city.
yes, yes,
But well yes, like you say, everything has its pro and its con.
Sure. yes or the stress you have in a city.
That too.
That makes you age faster and let's say everything, well.
Sure, the cost of living is much more expensive.
They are all a bunch of Sure.
eh. You are making for example you make good money but everything goes in rent, the food is much more expensive.
Sure, as is.
Not always do you find everything fresh.
And what do you do there in New York?
Well here I work in that public school Columbia.
Ah
teaching.
what do you do?
giving classes to Masters students.  And making investigations.
ah, wow.  And what topic do you teach?
well I work with prevention among youth.  I also work with urbanization.  That so, I study how the city helps and promotes the health and
the way they contribute to our neighborhoods and all these things, and how they influence the health of other people.
Sure, ah, how nice.
So.  So here is the ideal place because I have a huge laboratory here in New York, no?
yes, no, sure.  I'm here in
And where are you?  In in
doing a post-doctorate in genetics at Tufts University
Aye how nice, how nice.
yes.
Are you doing a lot of work in the laboratory?
yes.  Sure, exactly.
Ah, okay okay
What happens is that a half hour is all automatized, I do, yes, it's not not so terrible, let's say.  Before it was worse when it was bad, but now.
it's more automatizes so it's easier.
Aye how nice.  How nice.  I remember when I was working on my Bachelors at the University of Puerto Rico where I worked, I was doing
yes.
eh, working in the laboratory of molecular genetics and my lab partner and I were the only ones who could insert piece of, ene, ah, in a
that we were manipulating
in a
I went, I jumping hopping because of the plate that we had prepared the things,
Sure yes yes yes.
all the people like kind of cream like that. Us with the blue plate and well the only good experience that I have with genetic. Besides I'm a disaster with that.
Sure, well no, but that is good, you remember and everything.
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
yes, no I more than anything I do like I amplify more, genes and ready. Is more automated.
And that is, is, eh, what type of investigation? What you are doing now
I'm like Pharmacogenetics. Is like a sort of molecular epidemiology. I get populations, cases.
Okay
And controls. I analyze genes and variations in the genes and try to associate the
Ah, how good, how interesting.
yes for example now, now what I do is a population that took a drug that decreases the cholesterol and some respond good and others no
To the drug. You see that one also takes a
Okay, Sure.
and then I try to find different variations in the genes that are
That can explain the
that are the Sure, in what are good or bad respondent of the drug.
Okay. Ah, how interesting. How interesting.
yes, the truth is that, luckily what I live has nothing to do with the beach and cocktails
Eh.  Yes well good.
I tell you that when the experiment doesn't work, this more emphasizes the idea of the beach and cocktails
Aye all the same but look.  What you have to do it, you have a little savings jar for vacations and every time an experiment goes well, you
every time that the experiment turns out bad you put two and this is like you're vacation fund and such.
Ah.
you see, so when your vacation time comes, above what you calculated it to be, when it's a really good snowfall
yes.
you go to the beach with the
With the Cocktails
with the cocktails yes above all.
Sure.  yes, yes, yes, luckily right now I'm going next week to Miami, my brothers live there.
Aye how nice.
Yes, it's a breath of fresh air.  yes.  Sure.

ah, well, good
so I'm like independent, aha
with a micro entrepreneurship
sure something like that
well, how good how good, how good, how good,and, I also do a little of everything now this is already, this is my first year here in Philadelphia and
ah, okay
and I was in some jobs and now I'm in one eh, cleaning some offices there, but well
ah, okay
to get through the winter a little, it's not very nice, but
and yes it's very cold, a lot of snow I imagine
yes very cold, a lot of snow and I was working in painting, in construction and no, you can't work anymore
ah, no yes right? because everything is outside, then it's too cold
too cold and too  many hours in construction no, no, no the last days I was already coming almost frozen
yes terrible although now well
so well mm
so luckily here the, the climate is, is better than over there in Philadelphia?
ah yes?
well yes I mean, because over there, here, even today it was hot, today it was like twenty, twenty five degrees, something like that
I can't believe you, I'm moving over there
yes, it was sunny and everything here
where did you tell me you were?, that I don't remem-
in Atlanta, Georgia
ah, in Atlanta, aha aha, ah, but is much better climate then than here, no here the climate is terrible
yes I can imagine, or
a terrible cold, and yes this week we are happy eh, because there are no temperatures below zero, because this week we have everything one degree, two degrees
ah, I think oh, my God
so this week it's supposed to be nice well, obviously the firefighters
listen and oh and it's going to get worse before becoming a problem
sure, eh for for January we have temperatures of ten degrees below zero, eight degrees below zero
wow, how awful, no I would die I would die I can't, I couldn't
you couldn't no?
and no, And are you from Buenos Aires originally?
there near Buenos Aires, Mar de Plata
Mar de Plata, ah how beautiful, also Uruguay
eh?
that's is on the way to Uruguay?
no, no, is not, if you go from Buenos Aires you would have to go to the south, to the side of Patagonia
ah, okay, okay, okay, okay
it's four hundred kilometers to the side of the Atlantic more or less yes is the Atlantic Coast
ah, okay I mean, not so close either but also
four or five hours from, from the capital of Buenos Aires
ah, okay, I already understood
aha
no, what I was saying and, how's the climate there? the same but I imagine is not as bad
no, no, no, no, there's no snow or anything, there are never any temperatures below zero
it could be the same as in Chile the only time that I had terrible weather was when when I was little we lived in Punta Arena
I don't know if you can place it but it's the city more to the south of Chile
oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
is
terrible, over there no
yes, there was snow and all the pipes froze and
ah
we had to go out, to look for snow to have water
ah, how hard
yes, no super terrible
aha, and how long have you been here in Atlanta?
I'm here since two thousand
aha, quite a bit yeah
yes
and, do you miss Chile or not?
yes, yes same as you, I go back every time I can, for example, I was in Chile for all of two thousand and three
ah, nice, the whole year?  how great
yes
aha, aha, aha, yes, yes, yes, there's a lot of, of Chilean people here in the United States
yes like, in any way, but only it's not so interesting because they don't get together as much as other groups, like, I don't know how the Argentinians are but
it's hard to have a Chilean party, for example, for the ten, for September eleventh there was a, a kind of patriotic party here in Atlanta but
there was, there's a population of five thousand Chileans in Atlanta and only two hundred went, so since
eh
yes eh, and in, look, and they told me how, for example the Brazilians, if they had a Brazilian event there would be ten thousand there
yes, yes, yes, yes
but the, Chileans are more modest, I don't know how, you know like it's the same, in South America we have this reputation, and in a certain way it's true
yes
aha, aha, so we don't get together much, everyone does his own thing and that's it
sure and I don't know how Argentinians are
no, Argentinians, at least here in Philadelphia we get together a lot
yeah
yes, yes, yes, in fact all my friends here, well the people I know, they are all Argentinean and some Mexican also who like coming with us, Spanish too, we join with Spanish ad Chilean often
it is very dif- mmm
only one friend, I had a Chilean friend who was with us
mm
but
I see
well, I don't know how it will be between them, if they join often, honestly I don't know, so, anyway
sure, and it depends, I, in this system, I have talked to two persons from Spain who are there for the
yes aha
and then an awful lot of people from Philadelphia I have talked to, I guess it is because that's where the progarm is from, actually
that here is what?
this program, the one why we are talking is from the university of Philadelphia, so
mhm, sure, ah, people connected here and
sure, because I, I have already talked to about fifteen people from the city of Philadelphia
they connect you, aha, aha
yes
aha, yes, yes there are a lot, they gave me the mail too and I enrolled myself immediately, and yes there are many enrolled here in Philadelphia, talking about the program
and have you had many calls?
yes, many what?
many, have you been called many times?
yes, yes, is that I didn't hear, sorry, that if
yes, no problem
yes, yes they have what? you said
if they have, if they have called you many times to talk on this system
Oh, yes okay, I already have twenty two I think
ah very good, very good, no this is my second
ah, is like amusing I like it
talk, yes is very good yes, the truth is that I like it a lot
yes
the truth is that is very good, is very good to meet people and, and well, and make some money
yes sure and, I've always gotten to talk always with people from, to start with many Hispanics, I mean I've gotten to talk with Mexicans
with Spanish, with with eh with, of everything, and also with people of many ages, I mean, I've gotten to talk with young people and with old people I even got to talk with
with, like that, excuse me that I'm trying to give directions ah and what is it called? and today I talked to a mother and her daughter and they lived in
different states,
ah, yes? ah
but with, sure then I talked with with a lady Rocio let's say, no and, I spoke to the daughter first, that I got to talk with a lady named Rocio and then the lady asked her daughter if I had talked with a
Chilean from Atlanta that was named Alicia and then she said yes I talked with her
mm
two days ago something like that
ah, very good
yes
well, and what is the, step, staying there in Atlanta to live? or you don't know?
ah, no yes I'm already like set up here I think, for a while
you are staying there already, aha
yes
aha
in, in fact, eh
ah, we are seeing, we don't know what well, we've been here a very short time and well, we'll see what happens in the future now
sure
my husband is working and studying a little here in the university of Penn
scholarship
sure, yes, yes, he's working there and
alright
and well, depending how it goes
mm
in life, day to day we'll see if we decide for now everything is fine, for now everything is fine
sure and you, and how did you arrive to Pittsburgh, I mean Philadelphia, was it by chance, so to speak?
no, no, no, no, no, because my wife was looking to do the post-graduate somewhere, somewhere
ah sure, mm
of the United States and well, it presented here for the University of Penn and
and
we got in touch immediately and they sent him the okay
oh that's nice
so, we came here right away, yes
oh, that's good
yes, yes, yes, she came with a job and all settled
sure, do you miss Argentina?
and I don't but my wife does
no? oh yes, that's normal, oh, for example
yes, oh, is it? yes, yes, yes, yes
so, I came here with my family, mi mom and my brother, he's been fine and I'm the one that travels to Chile often
oh
to to visit, and I still have family over there, so
aha
really
you do miss it
so
sure, sure, oh, we just got here too, we were in Argentina about a month ago
mhm I see, a month ago, oh wow
and well, fine but maybe, she's, she'd like to go back
sure
miss a lot
yes yes is true, and also you can maybe return to visit
when are we going to return?
sure, maybe to, to,. you have family there? to go visit
all, all, all, I have my brother in law, all, all all the family is there
ah good
no here it's just as two alone
yes ah, wow
so, it gets complicated
no wonder she misses it
sure yes, yes, I miss it, I have my little nephews and and well, we miss them and well over there with the family is much easier, but we no
from my family absolutely nobody is going to come over here so, we will be alone, we will work and next year for the end of the year we'll see if we go or not
sure
as long as we can go even if it's once a year
what, sorry
I say as long as we can go once as year
yes that's why it's good, during the winter would be good like that you would be less cold because over there is summer now, so
sure, sure, yes, yes,yes, that's what we were thinking
that's that's the fun thing
eh, but we thought about doing it eh, in January of next year that we'll go there and catch a bit of heat on the beach and all this, and we're saving now
in the dead of winter here
sure, especially because here it's the worst
it's crushing, the winter here
yes
terrible, yes, yes, yes
and, and do you live in a city or more in the suburbs, lets say?
no, I prefer to live in the city, always, yes, yes, yes
yes, no me too
you, yes?  yes, yes I lived for a while in a place that was pretty far from the city and I didn't like it at all, it's for more solitary people
yes, right?  nothing more than it's very boring
I love living in cities, I don't like to go, yes, yes to the shops, the banks, the car,
sure
Hello.
Good afternoon. Oh, I'm Lorena.
Hello. My name is Juan.
Where are you calling from?
From San Antonio.
Oh. Well, we are quite close then, I'm calling from Spring Branch, it's about forty kilometers away from San Antonio.
Oh, hey we are quite close! I think we might be neighbors.
Oh really?
We might have came across each other in the street.
Mm.
Without realizing it.
How's your neighborhood?
Oh, my neighborhood, it's well, that, it's a city. It's a mid-size city, it's quiet if you compare it with other cities, that's the truth.
as always, it has some dangerous areas but the quiet ones and the areas where people live and for other, oh well, it's quite stratified.
Oh no, well look, in my opinion, oh, we decided to move to San Antonio which is the biggest urban center around here
around the center of Texas, we moved fifty kilometers or thirty five miles away to the North because we were looking for something more rural
less urbanized and well, that's what we like, exactly, yes. We like green areas, we like the natural protected areas around the lakes. Oh, that
And all those things we've found them here, we just moved here, it hasn't been that long. Since we moved here.
Hey, for what you are saying, it seems to me that you live in a recreational or holiday area, it seems to me that you can spend
a weekend there, or a full vacation.
Well yes. That's it precisely, but only for the people who like this kind of contact with the nature, right? Because you know there are a lot
Uh uh
who don't choose this kind of life because they like the big urban centres and it has nothing to do with the difficulties or not of natural lifestyle, right?
Exactly. It's not my case, I would love to have some place like the one you live in. But the ideal place woul also have a beach
if it had more
No, well yes, beaches are something wonderful, right?
Exactly
How would be your ideal home? Thath was the question, the subject for today
Well, I think I would rather have a couple of houses. One house would be in the beach, with a view of the sea
With a very nice design. Maybe with a swimming-pool, and so. But I would always like another house, that one would be for the vacations, to relax
But another house that would be closer to a some more movement. For instance in the city. In an interesting city, where I could, eh
combine both lifestyles, some things in one place and then the other for a change. One single house might not be the most suitable, not the best thing
There is some need of changes, like when you take your vacations, right?
Uh uh
you go there on vacations and you are so well there that you would like to live there. But from other's experienecs I know that
when you get to live in that place, after a month you are already fed up with it, and life becomes routine again, so changing from one
lifestyle and city to another would make it nice again. Only one kind.. well maybe would be better
having a couple of them
Well, but then you must agree that we are talking about idyllic situations, right?, because you would be moving
Of course
in the daily life, it is not the most desirable thing. I don´t know if you have a family but having a family with children that have relationships of
friendship and schoolmates
Ah yes. Ah yes.
and activities and moving well that results to be complicated, right? However, I tell you
Oh no, I say that in a case like summer vacations, right? Because they don´t have school, you are going to stay away for two months.
Or, suddenly well vacations here or there twelve days And suddenly well, I don´t know, you go and the kids are with their lives and when they grow up
I am no, well Is like looking for other opportunities maybe on business, you make some in one place, you make another one in other place
Right?
yes.
I don´t know. You can invent something there.
I think that it depends a lot of the location that you chose for living.
Exactly.
Eh. The job opportunities, life opportunities or how close can your life style be in relation with the place you have chosen to live, right?
Exactly. Maybe, I can tell you an example if you had both kinds of houses about thirty of fifty miles from distance
yes, no, no, no, no, no.
Maybe is not so different.
It would be fantastic. Now.
Uh uh.
Eh. The reality is that there are countries in which, you can find, for example. I am thinking in the beach, right? If you think in Mexico beaches maybe it is true that almost
like not urban places. There is a little town to join it with activities at the big city but I star to think in the beaches, like for example in the United States
Where i say, every port, or every little beach, i don't know, it's a reason for great development, and the, well, all the, uh, usual consumerism options are present in the shopping
all the movie theaters, uh, all those things, right?, even if they're
Yes, yes, indeed. That could be something... something... it's, uh, interesting to keep in mind, right?, and i imagine that these kind of situations, for example
It's not the same to think about San Francisco, that has a beach and it's a city, right?
Um
You can have both conveniences at all time, bu in the end i bet it's a city, San Francisco, than a beach, i
I'm thinking more of a place, i don't know, maybe like Puerto Vallarta, right?
Um
Well, you can be there for a while, there are peak seasons, there are low seasons. So you take advantage of the peak o low seasons, depending
on what you want to do and an X town. Since every time distances are getting smaller, for example, if you go from the United States to a
beach in Mexico, it's maybe three hours away by plane, you go and come back. Just in a day, easily. Or the same in Texas, if you're in San Antonio or
you have a business in Corpus, but you combine, like in the winter, the business in Corpus is not too strong, it can close down, what do i know, something like that, that's
Since they are idyllic situations, it's figuring out, right?, when the plan is well made. Right?, well
Yeah, well, uh
Yes
We, we take it, that's it. Yes, right now, uh, sorry, sorry, they're talking to me here
So, in that way, when you talk about idyllic situations, like you don't have to finish the project or have to be, it doesn't have to be a real project and
stable, just an ideal situation. Something like that, those would be the conditions, right?, well, for a man like that, right?, but yeah, the thing is that i would like to
have that kind of alternatives, combine something in which it's completely a holiday, on vacations, let's say, like a luxury, right?
Um
No, quiet it bears much spending and things This one, related to consume, don´t.
Hmm.
I di what I want, when I want in that place and that is all.
Hmm.
Is like in another place Well maybe is combined with the work. I say that because Well the same Sometimes to be doing only one activity well
for a time well it is a routine and it makes you tired and you must know what to do with You can or cannot have a work
Of course.
and in the ideal place Right? You can go on a vacation while in other side you are
something of work, or business.
Hmm.
Maybe in that sense for example, an ideal situation would be, not only a location, but for example to have something you could
routinely moves. For example as if you were a boat owner right?. To have the location and you go to that
to that and that is all. You know a region and you pass through it.
Well, yes. But it sounds to me a lot more like a
Right? I miss the holidays.
to have a retired one life, right?
yes. yes. Honestly yes. Well. It is a
Of course.
opportunity, right? Every time they are not talking about vacations but a location and I say The closest to that would be to have a
house in a beach location and to relax right?
Mm.
how about if you could have some business? In the beach of or no ah?
Ah sure, sure, sure, sure. That's always an option very
That you don't necessarily have to be there the whole time. Perhaps you could
very feasible.
for examples, thousands, right? And then it goes very well
Uh uh.
today you dedicate yourself to see if you sell something and see what you buy and And you are there these two, three months and
Look to talk about idyllic things if you allow me to interrupt you. Right now, I'm going outside my house
no?
to the back part of my backyard and now I'm going to give the deers some food. I'm seeing that here is full of deers and so I'm going to give them a little bit of
No way.
corn to the deers. That's the type of
is Rudolph there?
Pardon?
is Rudolph there too?
No.
Go Rudolph
But, but really this contact like this with nature and with
Oh.
Hello?
Hello, hi, how are you?
Fine, Marcela.  Who's speaking?
Ah, Vicente, from New York.
How are you?
We haven't talked before, no?
yes, yes. You live where I want to live.
Aha.
You live where I want to live.
Where, where do you live now?
I live in Fayetteville.
In Fayetteville, North Carolina
In North Carolina, yes.
Aha.
So no, it's a town, it's a big town but it's a town, it's not a city, you see?  it's not
A city, yes.
so I, eh, like, being born in Buenos Aires, I'm a city, a city rat
You from Buenos Aires?  It's Argentina, right?
yes, I'm Argentinian.
Aha.
Sure, I lice here since I was 9 years old, so I'm not longer Argentinean , well
Yes
But
Well, I have been in New York for several years, I'm originally from Panama
Mmm
and well, what can I say, Also, and all that from New York, but I like New York, the thing is that I'm not that used to New York
that sometimes, okay, we have to talk about, living in a city, living in the town, and yes
Mmm
yes, we want to move from we are now, right
yes
Okay, and well, I live in New York and in a city like Manhattan
yes
and when I go to New Jersey or Philadelphia
Mmm
And when I go upstate, right?
Yes
Eh, up the state from the city
yes
is like in that moment being in a foreign country
yes, yes, yes, yes
oh this is, look at that street, that street doesn't have
Mm.
it doesn't have a a name
Lo-
and and it's
yes, yes, yes.
which house? What's the house number? Street
You feel lost. Oh, it happened to us when we first moved from Los Angeles, we though everything was dark, the streets had no name, people knew the name of the street but
Oh, exactly, that's what I was trying to tell you, yes
but we, that didn't live here, we had just arrived here, didn't, I mean, we had no idea where we were
oh oh oh, you tell me that you come look for me, come visit and you can't find the, the street because it has no name and sometimes when you get home you know that
Mhm.
you get out of the car and you have to walk to that person's house because there are no numbers in the houses so there are things that, I don't know
Not only that, but
Oh?
it's like, in in Manhattan everything is in the side, you want something, you walk two blocks and there you have it.
yes yes, everything is close, exactly.
Everything is closed, easily reached.
And everything, exactly, if you need something you can go look for it and you find it.
yes.
there are specialties here to, there are so many people, you see
yes
There are specialties, you can go and buy thing, that, that, that you wouldn't even imagine there is a, a store, a
Hmm
there is a store for, for things you wouldn't
It's very, very concentrated, in Buenos Aires too. If you want a special button, you go to the House of Buttons
Yeah
Eh, it has 5 stories and they only make buttons
Yeah
and they have thousands of buttons, but if you see they don't have a button you like, you go and talk to the designer, and they will design the button you want
it's ridiculous
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
eh, but what happens is that Buenos Aires is such a huge city
A
it's like, like New York but it's huge, absolutely huge, sometimes you feel like you're traveling
Well the
constantly
New York is not so big because of people's concentration in New York because
And no, sure, eh, eh, eh, I mean
people from New York are going upwards, they're making, eh, one on top of the other.
Yes, really concentrated everything
all buildings, all it's really concentrates, exactly, for being the more populated, from some countries in America, is Mex, Mex, Mexico
Mmm
Mexico City
yes
which is also Mexico's capital
yes
Do you understand?, and the reason is because Mexico, Mexico city is, if you lived in Argentina, an Argentinian city
Mmm
There are not, many, many cities in Argentina, understand?
yes
But in Mexico there is a major city, Mexico City
and the rest are towns
yes, well, a country with only a city
Mmm
it has to be big
yes
because if you only have one
yes, no, that's true
because, in New York city, when you are in the Unites States there are many cities, cities and the
I like, I like being, I like going to the mountains here in North Carolina. I'd like to have a hut, a place where I can escape to form time to time
Oh, exactly, because I, I was also thinking of retiring, retiring already and I had this surprise, no, no, I know that, I had an Argentinean friend
Mhm
eh, that talked to me about, I am, we are accountants, ok?
Mhm
And when he told me that, that in Argentina some time ago, there was a profession where people watched the inflation, right?
Mhm
and go to the shops in Buenos Aires and change the prices, every two weeks
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
he says that if you don't buy now, and go back after three weeks, forget it!
No, no, that's true, that's true
yes, and he says that is a profession,m people who have specialized in that, and I said, What?
And also, there were people in the times when everything was so, when they gave such a big interest on money
yes, bu ,by, from
they called it doing the bicycle, you bought one hundred dollars when the dollar was low and trhen you sold them when it was high and put it in the bank to get the, the, the
tax
eh, the, the interest, and then you took it out and called it doing the bicycle because the guys went from bank to bank within the city area
Aha
and so they called it the bicycle. And what do you do? I do the bicycle
But, at least, the thing, see, I remember that in nicaragua I had the, the
Mm.
in the banks in Nicaragua we have sixty and, sixty five percent interest in the money
yes.
six five now, many businesses don't don't make sixty five percent earnings, understand
yes.
but the thing is that many people would hear it, hear that, and I would laugh with him, because many Latins would hear that and said that yes
you, you, you buy currency from Nicaragua they give you and you sell it in the bank, they give you sixty five percent. But, but the inflation, right the inflation
Sure.
is one hundred percent, so you lost
You lost, you always lose
yes, so you lose, right?
And you, and you are from there in Manhattan, where do you live, in an apartment?
yes, that I live in a house and but, eh, I, I thought sometimes of moving from New York to I don't know, because I have a little business that I'm doing here now, and perhaps the business will take off.
Mm.
Because the opportunity, the opportunity in New York is very big also, understand?
yes.
You can find a lot of things to make money, right
yes, yes.
Eh, and, if there's this or that and look, the people from New York ah, what can I tell you? I, I remember twenty five years or thirty years before, when it was only
Puerto Ricans and Dominicans.
Mhm
Now, you see, we call the people from Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, 'chorritos', 'chorritos', right?
yes, yes, from all these places
that are, that are of mixed blood, you see
Mhm
Oh, half-breeds here, eh, and 'chicanos' also, there used to be 'chicanos' in New York, they were from the West End
yes, yes, yes
eh, eh, eh, West, West, but now
yes, I think that when I arrived to the United States, and we lived in New York, there were not Mexicans, they were all Dominicans or Puerto Ricans
yes, 'chicanos', now there are more than Puerto Ricans, more than Puer-, than Puerto Ricans in New York. And now
they didn't tell you, but the blacks are not the, the, how you call it? eh, how you call it?, they are not the minority, ok?
yes
Hispanics are much more, there are much more Hispanics in, much more Hispanics than blacks in the Uninhibited States
yes, no, there are little, sometimes, there are less
they are ahead now, they are ahead
because the Hispanics are ahead now
yes, they are ahead, because in New York, you see, there are 'chicanos', there are Incas from Peru, oh, you see, the Incas from Peru play music in the street
Mm
eh, their music is a little
Oh, yes, the collars they sell-
with the, with the, with the
yes, flutes and things
with the flutes, yes but that music is how do you say? too melodic.
yes, yes, yes, yes.
Sometimes you got to put rhythm, cause now a day everything has rhythm and everything is you know, faster and all that
Mhh.
Cause now the rap, ah, is in the, the Latin songs you see
yes.
ah rap like the regueton, regueton.
Is in all of them now.
I was talking to a lady from Spain and she told me that all of the clubs and bars in Spain play the regueton.
Mhh. hmm
yes, how you know?
yes.
But peop- that, that is the one uh, it has the influence but,- here in New York, how can I put it, here in New York there is
everybody, and you can find people from everywhere, from Argentina, and Chile, there's one, no two people from Chile in my house, and chicanos, there's people from all over the world, from Spain and everywhere
yes
and so Latin people, well we are talking about borders, right the Mexican borders.
yes, yes,
there, like how the come, how they come over here and.
And more and more are coming
And what they have to do to come here, and sometimes they die, there's people that... because they have a desert, right?, a desert
Uh huh
They die, oh, what a terrible thing, but all, if all the Latinos could come to the United States, they should leave, not, not all of them, but most of them, come to the United States
Yes, yes, no, it's true, because we all have TV's and we all see the things that are here, on TV, and we all want to do that
And
and so, in order to have that, how will you buy that if you don't have any money?, you have to go to the country where you can work and make a lot of money. The thing is that people think
yes
uh, many times, the immigrants believe that they, they're going to come here to work and then they're going to come back
And they're
with all that money
No
But what they don't think about is that, uh, the culture swallows you, you start spending, you start having debts and you don't get out anymore
No, but the thing with the culture, no, you change, you change, uh
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
When i got here, you, you'll eat less, and use less, look, I'm here, there are some chicanos here that have sneak-, uh, how do you say it?
sneaker, right?, sneak-, what do you call them?, sneakers
Right
Those are, you know, the sneakers, the ones you use for sports
Uh, yes, yes, yes
The ones that cost one hundred dollars
yes.
You see a Mexican, that wears, has a eighty dollars blue jean
Hmm. yes.
For them, eh, in their country they can get dressed for a year with eighty dollars.
yes, that is true, that is true, look
But the thing is that people
we, my family, we knew
Ah?
we know only one case of an Argentinian family that came here, to Los Angeles and didn´t spent a cent, that people
they didn´t went out to dinner, they didn´t go to the movies, they did nothing
Ah, no well is eh
and they lived,they lived as they lived as, as poor people, lets say, they ate right and all that stuff, but they kept all the money, they kept all the money and
they came back to Argentina, exactly as they planned, after five years
Hello

from Orlando in Florida
Orlando, very, the heat very pleasant now in December, right?
well not so much, but yes eh, I know that it's much more than there in the north
yes, I'm already freezing here
eh, yes, well, well look that, that well eh, like we heard the topic of the day precisely spoke of that
mm
so then I tell you well eh, allow me to start, if you don't mind
aha
eh, I lived in New York
aha
for, eh, seven or eight years
mm
and, I liked the city very much, the environment, the cultural life, is, eh, is wonderful but the weather factor doesn't help me
mm
then, there I identified a, a, a, eh, a determinant factor for the place where I should live which is mild weather, or hot
okay
then for me, eh, the climate matters a lot
aha
number one eh, the matter of the landscape two and of course also that that, it doesn't really have to do with, with the housing in itself
aha
but it's important the type of city where you can develop according to your profession, or or, whatever you are looking for, in fact well then here let's say that,
I am in that sense, well, a little better that, that in the north
mm
but without recognizing that there, eh, eh, in New York, specifically, there's a well, eh, eh, an incredible way of life, especially in the area
social and cultural
mm
tell me about yourself
well I, I'm originally from Mexico and I'm from Mexico City, and I've been living three, four months in Philadelphia, so then is not something that you say
yes
that I'm used to this type of climate, so then now I'm just recently, getting also a climate
ah, yes, very very little
yes, whereas in Mexico, well you'll never see snow during the year, nowhere in Mexico, except in the mountains, right?
oh, of, which city, which city, I'm sorry, do you live in?
in Mexico City, it's the capital
Oh, fine, yes
so, this to me, it was a huge change because of the cold, the cold, overnight, I mean, one day we woke up and we were below zero
I mean, it was a very drastic change and I'm still not used to
sure
the cold weather, it's been hard for me, I have a lot of work and since I like warm weather better than the cold, so, to me, weather is a very very very important
it took some time and I know that I will get used to it but right now I do miss the warm weather of Mexico.
sure
so, this, well yes, that could influence my decision regarding the place
oh, oh, yes
so, in Mexico I was used to living in the city, it's huge, right, no? Mexico is huge and you have so much things to do
yes
so, when I first arrived in Philadelphia, lots of people told me that Philadelphia was the fifth biggest city in the United States, but still, I do feel the change, right? the size of the city
yes
so, this
yes
since I live in big cities, well, no, no, I don't actually know a lot of small cities or anything, to me, small cities are fine, and we often visit New York, so there's a difference between Philadelphia and New York
but, I honestly think they are similar, I like them, I like the warm weather.
sure, both are
and, a big city for me is something, I don't know, indispensable
eh eh now, eh, also in the introduction it talked of the dichotomy, let's call it that, city-country, what do you think, city
aha, mm
or country, where would you live better?
between a city and what, pardon?
and the country?
ah, I think that in the city because in Mexico, my dad lives in a well is not, is not the city but a town a little bit far from the city, and he basically lives like that in the country
yes
and, I mean, is very pleasant and all, but sometimes, like that's limited a lot right? the activities, things to do unless you have a lot of ingenuity, right? and
and have a lot of creativity to manage, but, essentially for me, for example, it limits me a lot
yes, yes
the activities I can do in a, in the  country, in a in, in, in in the country, yes right in a, in town far from the city
but, also I don't go to the limit of , you know what, I will never live in the country, because I find it very nice, also living there, right? and it becomes something also indispensable
aha
and with the pollution of Mexico City, is so brutal, that is important getting out of the city every now and then
yes, yes, I suppose, yes
then, well, also the country for me is an option, but not like that to live, every day of the week, right?
well, eh, look that for me in this case I would try to combine both things as much as possible and that can be achieved
aha, aha
in the outskirts of the city there are many outskirt sectors in the big cities that combine in some way those two factors, they are very close to the city
but many of the country things can be enjoyed
sure, like living, like living outside, in the outskirts of the city
yes, yes, like living in the, in my country it is called, I am from Colombia, in my country its is called the 'leaks' of the city
OK
that is exactly the outskirts, the place where, the place the urban area ends up and somehow begins the rural area, but not being too far yet
yes, that is an option, you have the city on one side, with the urban lifestyle, you can live like in the city
it also happens often that you may have some emergency, and being far from the city is like a kick in the ass,
so, in the situation you are putting me now, you are close to the city but also, as I told you, you have the calm of not living inside the city
yes, I also think it's a good choice already
mhm right, and this makes possible, for instance, having more green areas
damn right
yes, even, according to your taste or interest, some kind of orchard or vegetable garden, because many people like to cultivate
mhm
or gardens, that's what obviously you can't have in an apartment
mhm
animals for instance, it's also much easier having animals, several, not just one
aha
so, that would be nice, in my case, I would pay for that, I wish some day I'll make it, but, however I am quite adaptable, whether it is the country or the city
whatever it is, I'll manage to enjoy it
mhm
yes, that's it, that's the good thing about it, if you have a problem there, a health problem, which is exactly what happened to me in New York, well, there are lots of
you are happy in that city
you have to run because that's what got me out of there, it wasn't because I didn't like the city, it was that I couldn't stand the cold and I was getting sick of it
oh, really
of the weather, yes, of course, of course
yes, I hope that this time that doesn't happen to me in about six months because I haven't been here during the winter, oh well, people say that winter months are January and February so
oh, yes
I don't want to think about how cold it'll be here in January and February
well, no, it might be,
I  might feel better, right?
you might, if it doesn't really hit you that hard, you get used to it, in fact, many people like the cold, they like the
oh, weather seasons
mhm
so, you know, every organism is different
mhm, that's true
so, about the housing itself, the one of your dreams that they said, how would you like it to be?
the one of
two stories? wooden floors, what do I know! crystal
oh, I mean, the construction?
yes
well, I don't know, to me that, I don't know, I find it surprising that most of the buildings here are so shoddy, I mean, it isn't even a wall, it is like a
like a drywall or something like this
ah, no, the inside, here the insides are kind of cardboard, I don't know
yes, I don't know what they are made of, but when the Tornado appear they take every single house, so
architecture here is very simple, these kind of things for instance, you w¡ill never see them in Mexico, even the, even the poorest house is solid, right?
I mean, made of cement not cardboard, but well, maybe cardboard but not this kind
yes
so
ye, it is a metal structure and then, eh, the outside is kind of, yes, I am not exaggerating, it is a fine cardboard
yes, I mean, but the house looks fine, I mean, you see the house from the outside and it looks fine but, a little push on the wall and you break it
yes
you break it, so this is, mm, I am not used to that nd I don't like it either
it's just a not too strong building, right? obviously it must have its
yes, but tell me, finally, since
like this one
I think it almost hung up, eh, did you choose living there? or is there a particular city that calls your attention?
mm, no, I came here because I am studying
yes
mm I came to study my degree,I studying the first semester, so this is not an option, I chose Philadelphia
but obviously I had a choice, right? and Philadelphia seemed very interesting, I had already came here before, but not to live in, not for a permanent residence
mm, but I liked the city very much, I liked it not being as big as New York, New York, because that was a
tremendous chaos, so I liked it not being too big or too small, right? so
yes
this city is fie to me, and actually, like you say, I don't live in Philadelphia, but in the University, so
in the campus, right? that is
oh, we-, very well
that is outside the city, so I find this very pleasant, right now I am very, very, very comfortable, the only problem is the weather, I mean, by now
but I hope I will get used soon
yes, you'll get used to it, and have a good coat ready, because the winter is about to come
yes, I haven't used a coat in my whole life, it will be my first time actually
a good coat, thick, good gloves, good, good, eh
earflaps and all the stuff, absolutely
earflaps, hat all that will be decisive when the time comes
yes, I will have to get used to it, the worse is yet to come, but, I'll make it, I'll amke it
oh, yes, sure, sure
no doubt about it
because, definitely, the most critic moment, eh, is after midnight, as usual, and by that time you should be home already, I guess
yes, but, for instance, here during the week, because I think it started snowing about three weeks ago, but it snowed already so the temperature is already under zero
I mean, the snow has frozen already, and it is permanent already, I mean whenever you open the door there is snow
oh, that's right, yes, it's inconvenient  to move around, because when it's frozen you keep slipping all the time
there is ice, so it is quite unpleasant, right?
yes
but the best of, the good thing is that these last three days the temperature raised a little, so the snow melt
oh, good
so, that's good, right? obviously I think that the temperature will go down again soon, but I hope it is not too soon
sure, yes, yes, well, now, what was you name again?
I am Nicolas
Nicolas, so, then, eh
it was a pleasure talking with you
a pleasure having talked to you, have you done a lot of calls already?
mm, I don't know, I don't count them but I have done some
I have done about ten

And

eh I think that yes in reality how one would like to live, eh I don't know I would like to live a little bit further from the city but,
aha
on the other hand, I'm from Buenos Aires which is a very big city and I'm used to, to living in a very big city.
oh yes, very interesting, And what's the population of Buenos Aires?
I think, the truth is I don't know, eh, exactly but I imagine that it's like ten million, something like that, eh ten, ten million, yes, I mean
two million, oh, ten million ah, is the biggest center of population in Argentina, right.
yes in Argentina, yes, but also, much less than what it can be in Mexico or in Sao Paulo which are cities that in, in Mexico I don't know how many are there but in Sao Paulo there were like eighteen million.
ah
so, but is, is the capital center so to speak and the, the surroundings that
yes
there are, there are many towns that are called, misery villas, I don't know if you've heard of it, like the favelas in Brazil.
aha, yes
They are the poor neighborhoods.
yes
and there, a lot of people gather that arrive for work from the interior of the country.
aha
here is not like that too much because no
yes, well here in Los Angeles, the population particularly from Los Angeles I think like ah
are
like ah four million
yes,
And but there are other areas, the county of Los Angeles, and it has I think that the total is like ten million
and do you do something related to Hollywood, with the movies.
ah, yes, sometimes I make commercials.

ah
being near the cows, horses

it is difficult to live here with this cold, but
maybe you would like Los Angeles, Half of the people from this place didn´t born here in Los Angeles County.
eh, of course
yes
but eh then I don´t know if we are going to stay here, eh, we are going to stay a long time here.

mhm
yes, I'd love to, when people have a dispute I try to oh, help them reach an agreement before they go to trial.

yes, mhm
and they need another job, and that's normal.
And what, do you have a manager?
I have a manager, for, for the movies, yes.

Aha.
Hmm.
And so, I, what was I going to tell you?  I went with an old one, I have an old one that's a puppet
and I say that it's my husband.  And who feels and doesn't answer me.  And doesn't ask me what it's for.  I do it to everyone, people laugh, everyone thinks that I'm crazy.
Aye, how cool, so you're really
Yes.
you're really funny and smiley, ah, okay.
Yes.  I have a friend, she's a clown, but my friend doesn't dance with them, I like to dance and play, I do it really differently than her.
she's better, doing faces, painting faces, but I think I paint the face too, but, I like to do activities with the kids and
Well yes, because the kids are those who want to jump and
pe-Exactly.
paint and dance and that's how they're happy
Exa-Exactly.  But she does a li-ah, like now, the party that we went to I was jumping with them, and she told me that they had to stay quiet because if not
each time that I have a party they will expect the same
And, and
Aha yes, because I like to dance.
Aye, hey Gloria, and how did you get into this call?
I applied like one or two years ago on the internet through money and shopping
Oh.
one that I belong to and they sent me this then, I did it last year, eh, eh, last year it was dif-, very different I mean, this year is, eh, speaking in Spanish
And last year how was it?
it was, you had to call from different cells.
Ah, yeah, they did that one too?
Yes.
That, now, yeah, I don't know if you got the email in which you have to make five more calls
Aha.
from five different phones and
Ah.
they send you fifty dollars more.
Oh, yes.
Mhm.
Oh, I didn't see, I haven't seen my, my, my, my email no, no, no.
Yes, you have to, for example it can be your cell your husband's cell, the cell of a friend, five different ones.
Aha, aha, yes, I had
And then
I got like a hun-, three hundred dollars last time
Really, and how long did they take after you finished to send you the money?
Ah, like eight weeks.
Aye, my god, two months?  Well.
No, don't count on the money, if it comes, when it comes it's a gift
Well yeah, yeah it good that you tell me, because I was thinking that when it ends, in the end my check will come.
No, they take it very, and if you didn't send the, the the tax form
Hmm.
they won't send it to you.
Why not?
Because you have to send a form that they, they demand
Yes, I saw that, but well I ignored it, right now I'll print it and send it
and yes, yes you have to send it or they won't send you anything.
And.
And is this the first call you're doing or have you done a few?
No, I think that I've gotten about ten.
Ah.
Like ten calls, this, and so it's good, more or less the beginning, eh, the first time it took forever, but after I learned that we could talk about anything
Aha.
so it wasn't so difficult.
Oh, really?  We can talk about anything?
Yes.
Oh, I thought that when we had to talk about anything, but it had to be about the first topic, so, you know.
Ah, no, no, no, no, at most you can speak of, do you know my friend is the director
Yeah
of the program?
Oh, okay
Then she´s the one who talked to me and said hey, Liliana, because she just, she´s been here for a little while, and said, why don´t you sign up? It´s very easy, I don´t know, I don´t know how much
Yeah
and that´s why I signed up, then the first time
Yeah
ah, it felt like an eternity because we were talking about, about the United States, and the United States in the world and God knows what
Yeah, hmm
and I was talking to a very old gentleman, who was driving the conversation, and there I was, who didn´t know what to say
Ah
Then I talk to my friend, and I tell her, hey, those 12 minutes felt like an eternity, I didn´t know what to say to this man because he sounded very old and
well informed, and well, I´m very young and I don´t have so much information
Yeah
And she says no, she says don´t worry, you can talk about anything you want
Oh, okay
The only thing you have to do, you have to speak in spanish, but you can talk about anything you want, and I was, ah, OK
Ah, good, then it´s good, then
Well, yes, and then
Yes, one day I got a man and it was very hard, but he started talking and I didn't understand him
MHm
he spoke a horrible Spanish and I couldn't understand it, but I went along and I talked about other things, you know, about the subject I was supposed to talk about
because I don't know, now I woul speak about anything
So
er-, oh, horrible, it was horrible, those twelve minutes seemed like one hour
That's how I was the first time, yes
I thought, oh my God
I mean, I do know about what is going on and so, but I don't know it so in depth
Aha
like that man who didn't stop speaking, and, oh, I felt so stupid
Aha
and I told,  I told my friend 'I can't do this' and she told me, just talk about whatever you feel like, don't worry
So, your friend is the one who recorded the conversation. The one who did the commercial, your friend
No, there was one before, right?
Oh, because I talked to that girl, the one who did the, the introduction, because before there was a man, an American who, oh, you didn't understand a word
Yes. Yes, that's what she told me, she told me before there was a, a person who spoke English so bad that nobody could understand a word, and then she talked
to the directors or whatever, and told them to change him
Aha
they changed him immediately, but it was not her who talked
Oh, OK
But she speaks perfect Spanish
Oh, ok, ok, yeah
But yeah, she was the one who told me "you have to change this, it's horrible, you can't understand a thing"
And what kind of work do you do, are you a housewife?
Yes, i do nothing.
Oh, ok, OK
I have, well, i have my two and a half years old boy
Right
And, uh, and I'm at home with him, i take him to the library, i take him to
Oh, ok, right
to the museum, my husband works and two or three days a week i work at Gap
Right
On, on this Mall, like four hour, it's like ten hours a week
Oh, ok, OK
And that's it, but no, i don't do anything else
Oh, ok, OK
Until, until he's a little older
Right, yes
Good evening.
Good evening, yes, How are you? Whom am I speaking with?
Fine, How are you? I'm Marco.
With whom?
I, I, I, my name is Marco. And you?
Ah. Where are you calling from?
Eh, from Philadelphia.
Ah, How are you? You're speaking with George, from New York
Ah, George's speaking, How are you?
Fine, thanks. How are things with you?
Eh, I've been great, u, let's see, city, What part of New York are you in?
yes. I'm in Manhattan.
in Manhattan, yes.
In Harlem, mm
That, ah that coincidentally the, the question is about
yes.
the places where you live.
Uh, Mm.
Did you move to Manhattan from a place less, eh, less urban
No, urban just the same, from Bogota, Colombia.
Ah, we- well
Where are you from?
Eh, I, I, in truth, I grew up in, in Asuncion, in Paraguay.
Ah, yes? yes, B- Bogota is a very congested city, similar to New York.
Ah, yeah.
The only thing, it's that it doesn't have a train.
Ah, yeah. No, ah, in,
But, equally populated. Mm.
Asu- Asuncion is not, ah, Asuncion is a city, it's a small city. Eh, then, I, in truth, bei- being there, eh,
yes.
you know many more people from the countryside, let's say. Eh, I have family that has a,
yes. Mhm.
and uncle of mine is from, he owns a sugar cane plantation.
Oh, wait a second, it's that I can't her, a second.
yes, yes.
Hello. And what, and the city where you live now is it a small city?
yes, yes.
Ah, Philadelphia. No?
Co- eh, do- yes, I'm in Philadelphia now.
And that is very similar, right? to Asuncion, with respect to size.
No, no, Philad-, eh, Asuncion is very small
What?
Compare- eh, Asuncion is small in comparison
yes
Eh, Asuncion has
Pardon, pardon
I think, about three hundred thousand people, yes, yes
Hi, Hi, I hardly hear you. Can you speak louder?
Oh, sorry. How about now? Do you hear me better?
yes, yes, I thought it was the cell phone but no, again, I can't hear you. Well, now, yes. So, the city, which is bigger?
Ah, no, eh, Asuncion is very small, Asuncion is only three hundred thousand people, four hundred thousand
yes, yes
But, the so called Great Asuncion , is about one million people. But that basically means Asuncion plus five or six cities around it
yes, yes. mm. I see. Small towns annexed, mm, I see, And the plave you live in, are you satisfied with it? would you like to move?
I am, mm, I am alright, eh, downtown Philadelphia, in the
yes
it can't be more downtown than that, basically
Mm, I see
Eh , eh, it's like if I was in Manhattan, living, living in, in Battery Park. It would be something like that, eh
yes. Mm, I see. Is it very crowded? or noisy? how is it?
No, I don't, that's something I always liked of that city. Because I know, I know, for instance, Buenos Aires, eh, I know
yes
some big cities where it is, it is very noisy, there is a lot of noise, eh
yes
vandalism, mm, how you call it? I don't know the word, crime
oh
crime, and so on, that is something that
oh, yes, I see, the usual
it's something that here,
in big cities
right. Usual things of big cities, inc- including, unfortunately,
yes
Asuncion, although it's not a big city compared to
yes
eh, compared to, but talking about crime and things like this it qualifies, let's say,
And would you rather move to a rural area? or do you prefer big cities?
I am, I am, eh, I just, I just moved here about one and a half year ago, more or less, here downtown
yes
Before that I was, not in the suburbs, but in a district that, a much quieter district, much more, eh
yes, mm
Even more with the, eh, houses, that have courtyards, back courtyard and, and front courtyard, and grass, and
yes. Mm
with, of this style, which is something I have always found very nice
yes
Eh, but being here in the city, in the city downtown, I find it much better
Hmm
I can walk to school, walk to, walk to my workplace
yes
eh, my husband also, he also walks to his workplace
yes
I mean, the child goes to school, eh, that is right here, about four blocks away
Mhm
before he used to go to a daycare, eh, a daycare
yes
that is across the street, in front of our Hauser, and everything is so near. One think we have realized, the big difference between being in the city or being in the suburbs, where
is the va- my wife's family, for instance. People walk from the door of their houses
yes
to their car
Mm, yes
To the car. From the car they drive
yes.
ten miles, or five miles, or where the parking lot is, from there walk to the door.
yes.
After that walk from the door to the car, and from there all the life, is around the, the car.
Hmm, yeah.
Eh, while us, now, we are used to, walk. her family comes, for example, and they want to go somewhere, and yes, we go, and the car, or this, or a taxi, no, is near here.
yes.
Of course, for us, near here, around the corner, to me, it looks like if I were crossing the street, there are ten blocks.
yes.
yes, eh, ten blocks, ten blocks is a, very near here, it is  around the corner. Eh,
yes,
while a, a person from the, from the suburbs, comes walking three blocks, and, and, and almost has a stroke, it looks like.
It is very far, very far. Hmm, yeah.
yes, is is, is an issue of being used to it. We had a, we have a child, he is five right now,
yes.
and when a year ago he, year and a half, when he came to the city with us, eh, he was not, he, that thing to climb to the
the, the car and get sit in his, his seat inside the car.
yes.
Is that, now he walks a couple of blocks too,
Of course.
in the beginning, he asking please lift me, lift me, please, no he walks and gets used to it. And now, he walks the ten blocks. That's little for him,
So, conclusion, you are fixed, satisfied
I am very satisfied, eh, with myself, I grew up
The ideal place
I grew up, as she grew up, in a place with a large courtyard, I grew up with a German shepherd
yes
I don't like the idea of having a dog
yes
I don't like small dogs, and I don't like the idea of having a big dog at home, enclosed
yes, yes. That's not a good idea
No, to me, eh, although many people do. It is, apparently, here in the city, you see people walking
walking their dogs, their Great Dane
yes
They are, where are you keeping that Great Dane? I'd like to know. That is something that, it's like if there were courtyards around here, eh
In which conditions does the animal live?
yes, right. And that is something that, I would like to but, I guess that once we have, after the baby, and
yes
a couple babies more, I hope, eh, at least, eh, we may be able to retire somewhere with a larger courtyard, somewhere I can
Sure
play with an automobile, eh, playing mechanics with the automobile
yes.
Eh, we sold our car a year ago because, we didn´t like it anymore,even, the idea of having a car. Because,
yes.
it is so difficult, in a comparative way, as I say,in the city everything is so near.
yes.
that, so, that way at least you feel.
yes.
And, there where you are living,
No, where I live, is, eh, I work far away, I had to take two trains.
aha.
Then, eh, sometimes, well, I am a computer programmer. And, sometimes, I have to give maintenance very late at night, or something, and, and even when the train service is good, at night it is very,
very, it is not too good. right? Then,
Yeah.
well, I always, New York, you don´t need a car because the train transport service is very good, hmm.
Yeah, yeah.
But, where I am living now, and I came from, in my country, I was used to going  out on weekends to eat, to go around the city.
yes.
Then, I bought a car a year ago. Hmm. But I am tired of it, because the parking space is limited, I am always looking where to park, where, to fix schedules,
many tickets, but, at the end, it gives me freedom, anyway, of, of going out from one place to another. Right?
That is true.
yes, I´d like to go to a smaller, quieter city, hmm
Something that is getting very interesting, now, it´s something they´re, city carshare, that, the, uh, Philly Car Share, and things like that, you basically pay
a monthly amount, an amount around 100 dollars, I think, more or less
Hmm
and you pay, I think 15 cents per mile, or something like that, and basically, they lend you, let´s say, you´re renting
really, but they give you a car, all of them are hybrid cars
Hmm
hm, you , they have certain points in the city, and for example, here, we have like three points in a 3 or 4 blocks radius from our home
Really? No, I don´t, I don´t know about that here
and basically, you walk there
yes
and they give you, they give you an electronic key
Hm
and the computer in the car knows it´s your turn, let´s say, that you have, uh, the schedule
yes
names, schedules, you go to the car, you get in and use it
hmm
It, and, your time ends, where, you, you park it again where it should be
Hmm
and you leave it there
Ah, it doesn't
Each one, each person has an, an electronic key that, sure, only in your time is when the car opens,
yes, Ah, really?
and, eh, it comes, comes with a card inside the car, so that you can, eh, fill it up with gas when you need to,
Mm. Interesting yes
Already, already everything included, and, I find that interesting. Because, the idea is to assign a car
Mm.
when people come to, to, to visit, for example, they ask us,
yes, yes
they ask us, Where is there a place to park? Ah, no, this is Philadelphia, there's no place to park
yes, is hard in the big cities.
if you want, if you want, if you want to find parking, stay out of the city, In the suburbs there's places to park. There's none here, there's none here.
I remember,
Hello, my name is Wendy.
Hello, good morning. My name is Carolina.
And, ah, well the topic is, ah, That that, oh where do you prefer to live? In a city or outside of a city?
Aha.
Is that right? So, ah, where do you live?
I live in New York. And you?
Ah, really? Okay, yes, I live in ah, Arizona, but I visited New York, yes. And I have friends in New York.
Oh, really? Ah, how nice.
yes, I like New York but for me no, I can't ah, live in New York because there are so many people
Mm.
an, ah, I like to have a car and is very hard to have a car in New York, too much traffic.
Mm.
Here in Phoenix is the city is really big, but there aren't that many people that it's impossible to drive and here there's no subway system like in New York
so, the people here have to drive to work and
Mm.
other places
Okay.
What do you think, what do you prefer? To live in the city or outside of a city or
Well, for example, I that live in New York, I already have more than three years living here
yes.
so then what happens, see that I got a job in Midtown, Manhattan in the mere center of New York But I in the suburbs
am working and I like it a lot I prefer it having to take the public transportation
yes.
to go to my job
yes, when I was there I also used the subway
then Mm, okay.
It was very easy going to the places
Yes, sure.
on the subway yes But in many cities, they don't have a good subway system
Sure.
that's why people have to drive eh, that's why in Los Angeles the traffic is horrible, because everybody has to drive and
and there's no subway system
Mm.
of bus yes, but
Yes. Well.
is more, ah
Here with
How do you say it?
like here then the transportation is very I mean, one gets to places better on the subway than the private car
Mm yes.
so, the truth that, eh, to me the city is good to work in, no?  like, during the day, the working hours, and there are many
shops, there are many things, and you can rest because you have the weekends, the suburbs, no?
yes, exactly.
Excellent.  I really like what they say, what would be the city or the place of your dreams, eh, the house of your dreams
really, since I have my house, it's really comfortable, big, eh, I feel really good here on the weekends, because everything, during the week, what could be done?  Nothing.
You get back from work, you're tired, if you have some activity
Hm.
you come ho- and, ah-
So-
hmm, what can you do, no?  In the summer I use it a bit more because the day is a bit longer, so there are many more things to do
so yes
yes.
a city, well would have places to go but if not, I come to my house, I have things to do, tend the garden, fix the house, no?  like things
that really, like, for me, I find working in the city from Monday to Friday and the weekend to spend it in the ci-
it's much more comfortable, no?
Yeah, yes.  In what part of New York do you live?
In Queens.
Ah, yes, that's where my friend lives too
Hmm.
yes, yes, I visited Queens yes.
Aha
Like me, I live outside the city of Phoenix, in a suburb, it's called Tempi, that's where the University is
Oh
from Arizona, yes. And I rather live not inside the city, but outside, right? See, my job is about ten minutes from home
so I don't have to go to Phoenix where the traffic is so heavy
Mm
so usually, I usually don't have traffic problems, because my working hours are usually from seven in the evening to three in the morning
because I work in a bar
Mhm, oh
yes, So it's fine to me
Oh
I enjoy living in a big city, but not too big
MHm
but mmm but I also prefer living in the outskirts
MHm
because I know I won't have the problems of the big cities, that have too many population, right?
I see, overcrowded cities, right?
yes. And Phoenix is
Study
a big city but not as big as New York or Los Angeles
Mm hmm.
Atlanta
Yea.
but yea, there's more people here who are uh, arriving here, well, yea, it's also got a future
Oh, yea?
there's still not really a big city like Atlanta or like that that city, but now there's so many people that it's really hard to drive to places
Mm hmm.
to do things you want to do
Yea. Mm hmm.
Oh. Yea, yes, when I was in New York I took the subway everywhere and it was really easy to use the subway
Right.
I didn't want to, I didn't want to have a car there to live if I live in New York
yea.
because people drive, or I think the people drive uh uh crazy there. It's dangerous to have a car in New York.
Ah, because I have, I'll tell you I've felt I feel really comfortable, my house, to go out on the weekends
Ah, yea?
yes, no. No, I've never had any problems, I hope I don't have any God willing, right?
Yea, it's because I think you're used to driving in New York because in my experience
Yea
to say the, the people stop in the street and yea, for me it's strange, people here don't do that, they can't
you can't, here, oh, stop in
Mhm.
the middle of the street to let someone out of the car but in New York, it's pretty common, yes, people are used to it
oh, to some things but to me, it's not
Sure, aha.
yes.
Well, not only that, I also believe that, for example, in the suburbs, the value of the homes is cheaper than in the city, isn't it?
I see.
Are the prices high over there, for houses, too?
Mhm. Oh, well,
How is it? What's the value of homes over there, for example, in Fenix?
Oh, well, it depends on which part of town you want to live in, oh, you can get a nice house for oh, oh, mm, around fifty thousand
Mm.
yes, that's not, prices there are kind of, oh, it depends, if you want to live far away from the city
Oh.
you can, you can buy a really big house for little money, yes.
Mm.
But, if you want to live close to the city you have to pay more, but all things are big around here, they are not
small like in New York or Chicago, most of the people here live in houses and not in apartments
I see, aha.
Yes, How, how are you in New York? Do you like living there a lot?
Oh, yes?
yes. I like it a lot to visit
Oh, okay.
I have a lot of fun there and I like the food a lot
Mm.
especially yes in. Queens my friends take me to Colombian restaurants, Ecuadorians of those, right? yes.
Mm Mm where are you from?
I'm in Phoenix Arizona
No, but where are you from?
Oh, Oh, I've spent most of my life in Texas, El Paso, Texas.
Ah.
and but I'm from the United States, yes.
Mm, Okay, aha.
Ah, have you spent all your life in um New York?
Pardon? Pardon?
Oh, have you spent all your life in New York?
No, I'm from Peru.
Oh Really?
I'm from Peru.
My mom visited Peru. Oh, yes, my mom visited Peru
Oh. Oh. really?
like one two months ago
Mm. And did she like it?
I want to live, eh, I want to visit all the places in South America
Mm, okay.
yes, well, also Peru and yes, one day I want and
Mm.
Like backpacker. You understand?
Where?
The backpacking I want to go on a trip as a backpacker
Oh, okay.
do you understand or not?
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Aha.
backpacking yes.
Yes, yes, yes, mm
yes, to South America, yes.
Mm, okay, aha.
My fri-
Eh, good afternoon. From New York. I'm John.
Good afternoon. Is Lurdes.
How is it going Lurdes? How are you?
Hello, how are you?
Fine, thanks. Where are you from?
Eh, I'm from Puerto Rico.
Oh, yes. How nice? And where do you live?
yes. Here in New York.
Ah, also. Ah wow. We are neighbors then.
yes. yes.
Well, what do you think of today's topic?
Well is like that, I think that any type of assistance should be linked with the economic and educational development of the people that are receiving it.
Eh, the assistance.
Mm. Mm.
Because. Eh, assistance without help to get out of the situation, well no.
Mm.
To give what there is what it does is convert the assistance into a crutch, in a crutch that doesn't help the person grow.
Right yes.
right? And then. It seems to me that assistance with eh that's combined with assistance to for example study or to develop a career or for training
that is, significant for the person who's receiving the help well it could have eh, I think that it would make more sense.
yes.  yes.
And what do you think?
Well, I think that we should be more like the systems in Europe.
Hmm.
Or in Canada.  No?  Because I see that here
Hmm.
they pay very little and there are many people who are older who are, are having a lot of difficulties.
Sure.
And so
Sure.
it should be a little balanced, in a system where a person is spending good money, well, they should receive a bit less.
okay.
No?  And if you're earning more, you should receive a bit more, because.
Sure.  Sure.
It's really hard, it's really hard here.
No definitely.
In, in New York, the system is, eh.  You're really pressed.
Sure.
No?
To me, I think that it's, for example many times they penalize the people who are receiving economic assistance
Mm.
for things that the system itself put in its place, because, for example
Right.
for example, one of my coworkers has a friend that received help, her program was
in training, she had a job through a help program and when she finished her training, she got a
well, we can't help you anymore so you should look for a job elsewhere.
yes.
And this was after she had already developed a, I mean, she had developed, she had opened up a bank account, she has so happy and proud
of her work and all those things and then
yes.
oh, the same system that she was in, it, it
Mm.
placed her to work with an agency that she was working
Mm.
it didn't, I mean, it didn't help her to get a permanent job, right?
Right
So, they do give them help but only to a certain point but, if there's no way to help them develop the
the type of jobs that a person is training on, well then, it doesn't
yes.
it's doesn't really helps them.
Mm. Mm.
no?
yes. I have, I just returned from traveling from
I don't know it
and a friend whom I was talking to. The wife has had ten operations.
ah, good grief.
in the foot. Imagine that, if the companies only pay eighty percent normally,
Ah good grief.
he has had to pay twenty percent of ten operations.
Oh, my God.
And you can imagine that the poor man already doesn't know where to stand because
Sure, sure
he can't, then
And with the medicine being so expensive nowadays.
yes, exactly. Then.
The medical care.
The poor man doesn't even know what to do because is his wife and he has to do everything possible but also the money he already, already doesn't have any. He doesn't know what to do.
Sure, Sure.
So I think that he has to
And he doesn't qualify for any type of help?
What?
Doesn't qualify for any type of help?
No. That's also the problem. If one If one earns a little middle class right? and if you earn
yes.
decent money well then you never apply for anything.
True, true.
Sometimes is preferable to be that they push you to be poor
Exactly. True.
right? So
True eh.
And that's the problem that
True eh.
that like that and well. Eh. One, one likes to work and one wants to get ahead but sometimes the systems forces one but I stay, I stay where I am and like this I can keep on receiving
Public Assistance and a bunch of things that
Exactly.
it shouldn't be, we should do something so that people improve their situation.
Sure that it's an incentive instead of eh a right?
yes. exactly. Exactly. So. I don't know. To me it should really be how it is in Canada that everything, that everything is free and no matter what and
Mm. Well ah over there is I agree a lot with the health insurance universal system.
Mm.
Is something that makes a lot of sense in in Canada the
Mm.
the health is seen as a right.
Mm.
same as here the education is seen as a right, the public schools and etc.
Mm.
Over there the health is seen as a right, no?
Mm
and I think that the problem with this country is that the, I mean the history of the development of the medical profession
Mm.
was very eh linked with what was the development like they did it as if it was a business, right?
yes.
Then being seen more like a business than like a human right to receive access to the health, all the problems that area associated with
Mm.
that if, the costs are very very high that if the eh eh the treatment um. When when they seem instead of improving. Eh, um instead of reducing the cost of
of the services
Mm.
the fact that the education in medicine is so expensive has made it then
yes.
that the medical care is treated more like a business than like a right that all people have.
yes.
he received the, the medical insurance.
yes.  yes.  No, I definitely agree, wait a second.
yes, of course.
Hello?
yes, of course.
yes.  So, yes no, definitely, like this has become a store so they want to charge people every day the companies are offering
less and eh, they want to take more benefits from people.
Sure.
And they don't want, they don't want to give these same people from transit
Hmm.
They don't want them to retire until they're seventy two like how they could retire at fifty five.  This is quantity.
Aye.  yes.
That and I think that and good, they should come to a compromise, no?
Sure.  Sure.
But.  I think that it's been like this for many years well imagine if you get there and you retire and they say that you have to wait seven more years.
Aye, my God.
wow.  That's a lot.
I feel like crying just imagining it.
Hmm.  Hmm.  So we'll see if tomorrow we'll go to work or not.
Eh.
This is another thing.
Ah, true that they're
yes.  yes, it's night.
well yeah in Queens they started with the
yes, with the, with the adults yes.
with the strike, no?
yes, in Queens it already started.
well.  Tomorrow everyone who has it will be close to the house.  I don't have to walk a lot.  So at least I will get there.
how nice.  how nice.  I don't, I work from home.  so.  Tomorrow, so we'll see if we last.  It can't last either because imagine if we're in the middle of Christmas,
Sure.
we have everyone, visiting outside
Sure.
everyone has tourists, this will be a disaster.
I think that what's happening is like.  The really bad experience that happened last time with the negotiations
yes.
was that the people of MPA didn't have money
Uh-huh.
and after the book appeared
Uh-huh.
fixed
yes, right
Eh, anyone would be disapointed and of course you will be able to  ask for more
Yes, And also the people who, like us, are paying, and now they want to increase it, now in two thousand seven they want to increase it again.
again, they want to increase it? how much will they increase it now?
Because they want to do a new building, and new offices and everything. That's not right, behind us who are the workers
Right, right, right
So, let's wait and see. So, about medicine, eh, I have also noticed that they are offering
eh, packs, right? I've seen them announced on TV
Mm
they cover you for the thirty percent, the forty percent. You pay about twenty-nine dollars a month
Mm
and the cover you for the forty percent, that's nothing because if you ever end up in a hospital you won't pay less than fifty
if it is something serious it may be one hundred or two hundred thousand dollars
Sure
just figure, you're broke
Sure
with something like this. So, there should be a something, not to affect people this much, because otherwise people will
the will all go broke, or will be afraid of going to the hospital, because if they go and are found something serious, it will cost the wife
eh, yes, the man, the husband dies or something like this
Today yes.
while he was at the hospital, now he leaves his wife with a debt of fifty thousand or a hundred thousand dollars, forget it, you have to
Exactly. Exactly.
So we'll see what happens there.
I I think that there is that there when we have to think in in medicine as or the as a busincess
Mm.
like to think mor in those like hm eh a human right,
yes.
that everyone has the right to receive health care
yes.
so we'll have a universal system of of medical care, no?
Mm.
and when we have a universal system of medical care, prevention will be much more important and then we'll be able to
yes.
for example to avoid having to be in so many hospitals for example right now, many people wait, they avoid, having to go to the doctor when they have something that bothers them
Mm.
and when they finally go then they cannot hold it any longer and they go to the doctor, they end up needing much more care care more expensive than if they had gone in time
Exactly. I also agree with you on that that is also
right?
part of what they have to do and I for example, I take care of myself I go to the dentist constantly and I am happy because I go because I've gone and the dentist tells me, I am happy that you came to get this cleaning because
if not look the roots will get worse, that's the other thing.
Sure. Exactly. Exactly.
So you have to do, have to do the maintenance
Sure.
constantly because if not like like you say, if you go at the last minute, already when
Sure.
Betsey
good evening my name is Marcos and you?
eh my name is Betsey, fine thanks and you?
hello Betsey how are you? eh everything good, everything good ah eh happy holidays eh
how nice
let's see your opinion about social assistance,
ah
eh it said something in comparison to the European cities and the truth is I'm not too familiar with how the European cities have it done, from what I understand several of the countries
do use even socialist systems eh
mm, hello
like yes yes sorry I put the the headphone eh
oh
for example I know that England has a socialized social medicine system eh that system of medicine that that that is
the system they use is socialist
mm
eh have you ever been have used economic assistance of the American social system being the welfare that they have here
ah no well because I live in Canada but
ah okay
when I moved to Canada, I mean I'm originally from Salvador
from where
and in, I'm sorry?
where are you originally from?
I'm from El Salvador yes
Oh okay okay
so, in order for us to get some help, to get some help,  we had to apply for welfare.
oh I see
but I think it's different in Canada than in the United States, I wouldn't know.
oh, and that's another country that I'm not familiar with, I don't know its system, I know the system we have here, I was involved in a
car accident caused by another person who had been drinking
mhm
oh and I had a really bad accident, I was in coma for five days.
Oh
I was in intensive cares for a month
mhm
and I remember that I had a bit of brain damage but thank God, I'm fine now
what can you do
and I got well fine, oh, I used the healthcare system, welfare/foreign that they have here in the United States.
mhm
for a while, I used it for a while, for about four or five months.
mhm
what I did when I went to eh to apply to be able to have the assistance
mm
eh it was a, it wasn't a very nice experience so to speak, eh the groups of the people that were there I went and I worked, I started to work soon again because
I felt useless sitting at home not doing anything
I can imagine
eh that bothered me not doing anything
mm
then I started to work even before stopping the assistance which theoretically is illegal but I did it anyways eh like they say here under the table I was working
yes mm
when, then when I tried the first time eh to get out of the system of social assistance eh, the people in the office, the people in the
offices of social assistance of the state tried several times and tried a lot to convince me that I didn't have to leave the system of social assistance
mm
that I could stay receiving checks indefinitely
really?
and that what they were telling me I really found it disgusting
aha
I'm a person that always worked a lot eh too much even according to certain people
mm
but and I see that and I know my job when I pay my taxes, I don't complain about paying my taxes I really don't complain
mm
I grew up in Paraguay, South America
oh aha
and I know that here tax evasion always leave the state without the money to do the most basic things
mhm
and while here we have for instance beautiful roads, we have for instance the social security system which is basically paid on the taxes of the citizens
mhm
and I think it is something worthy, it is worth it but I keep seeing every day people who abuse on the system
sure, also here
yes, they abuse the system, but I think the system is worth it despite those who abuse
mhm, I see
it is worth maintaining it because I for instance went back to the working world bounded
mhm I see
but, eh, trying to go back, that kept me, that maintained me, I didn't loose my apartment thanks to that and of course the help from my mom, but I had enough to pay for the food
mhm
I had enough for the basic things, even the eh, even a medical insurance
mhm, sure
paid by the state which was wonderful for me at that moment, it came like fallen from heaven
mhm
really, and that's something that is worth maintaining despite all those who abuse the system, right despite them is the right word
sure, sure, right
correct and I believe that it is worth it and I know that in the, in other cities and in other countries they have different systems
oh, the American system has a lot of, lots of mistakes, lets say, but it works.
mhm
and as they say, even when talking about stuff like democracy, it's a good system in theory but oh, the American system is not the best one I mean
it's not a perfect system but so far, for what I can see, for what I know, it seems to me that it works or that
mhm
it's not the best one because it doesn't work all the time and it doesn't work as good as it should the whole time
mhm
oh but it seems to me that it's the one that works the best and yes
I see,
you are from El Salvador, I grew up in Paraguay in South America and I was there when the dictatorship ended in eighty nine
aha
the dictatorship had been there for thirty six years and the country was under the hands of this dictator, general Alfredo Strossner
bla bla bla, every day I'd listen to it, but, like I say, Paraguay's system also has, they have a system of of of
social security but it's a beautiful idea the way it works here, everyone has health insurance provided by the state, they all have health insurance given by the State, they all have
aha, is it that way in Paraguay?
that's in paper but
aha
that's the idea
oh I see
in reality it doesn't work so much like that basically the idea is that there is an
really?
issue there's a system that everybody automatically has eh medical insurance from the state for being a Paraguayan citizen
mm
and that's true, the problem for example is there is not eh there's not enough, enough money to pay half of the patients that go to the doctors
mm
and my parents both are doctors where I know that system well
oh how nice mm
eh but there inside but and that dad for example works in the hospital the public hospital, what was the hospital called eh clinic hospital that was from the city
aha
eh and he worked there without without charging eh he's a doctor and the doctor he has how do you say it ah
and the state pays him oh
the state would pay him what
mm
is the equivalent I still remember that they would pay him one hundred seven thousand Guarani per month was his monthly payment and one hundred twenty and seven thousand Guarani
aha
in that time with the change to the dollar
aha
I think it was a total of approximately seventeen dollars
seventeen? oh
monthly that was that was what they paid him dad driving in the, dad drove a
wow
mercedes
mm
that in which he basically eh would go to the clinic hospital
mm, aha
several times per week to help his neighbors and ah the state paid him as a doctor a little less than what his gas was
oh wow okay
that's to get there but eh but all always did and is like I tell you is a system that exists but doesn't work the system here in the United States
exists kind of works in several cases
mm
while at the same time in several cases it doesn't work but like I said I think that up to now is a system that works a lot I had heard a lot of complains regarding the
social medicine that the English use for example
mm
but I know that in the Nordic countries eh they have taxes much more higher than the taxes here in the United States and those taxes but the people don't complain about that because in reality
they have eh free medicines eh automatic health insurance from the state eh the eh the universities also are all, there are several at least from the state and
Silvia
Hello, How are you? Adrian's speaking from Toronto, Canada
Hello good, ah, from Canada you say.
yes from Toronto.
Oh from Toronto, I'm from Indiana, I was raised in Laredo, Texas And there is where I learned my Spanish. Ah, what country are you from?
eh, I was born in Argentina.
Oh, excellent. And I forgot what topic, that was that we were talking if they told you
it was the health system or whatever, no but I have a question, you were born in Texas and were raised in Texas
aha
But your native language is Spanish.
yes, no in, yes well we were raised with my grandmother who didn't let us speak a word in English. And, forcefully we learned Spanish.
Mexican right, my grandparents are, Mexicans, my parents were raised in Texas and, I was born in Indiana We are seven and, we all speak Spanish, second language but,
grandmother was who taught us.
But the, the school was in English, the school.
Okay Oh yes sure, aha
When you went to the school it wasn't in Spanish
It wasn't in Spanish, yes, uh But we all spoke Spanish, in Laredo it was, we didn't even realize that there were two languages. It was natural that everyone spoke both.
ah, it became difficult, because we arrived there, I was five years old. And I stayed til tenth grade. And it was when grandmother, well she helped us a lot but,
already the topic, aha.
And the, and because of him you learned, do you know how to read and write in Spanish also?
Oh, yes, that too, right, right, it's more
And how, how did you learn?
Basically because my granny, well, she was very strict, well, she didn't allow English neither at home or in religion, she had us write and speak everything in Spanish
And it was, out of necessity, not even asking for the bathroom
No, not the, the question that, uh, it's something very common, right?, not only in Spanish
right
At least all the people, uh, all the immigrants i know that live here in Toronto, whatever the background they have, Spanish or
or what ever, not English
right
The problem they always have with the children is that, they might speak their native language more or less well
uh huh
but they can never, uh, read or write in their native language
oh yes
in, that's why i asked you, because it's odd
Oh, yes, sure, because
I believe you're the first person i have listened that, uh, lets say, from a second generation, because
Oh, yes, that's true
Uh, did you go to, did you go to, technically, from what i can understand, uh, if the school you went to most of the time, uh, is what they consider your native language
Traditionally, if you went to school in the United States, they will consider
uh huh, yes
English is your native language is, no, never Spanish
ok, correct
uh, that's why i asked you, because i know it's very hard, i don't have children but
Right
the
Yeah, extremely hard because that's how my classmates at school and work were, that, they couldn't communicate either written or read it
And to us, a big task was the granny, she was a missioner, we would understand well, but in paper, let's say, she made us write letters, and since she was very religious
well, she had us read the bible every day
that's in Spanish
And, well, in Spanish
At least it wasn't in latin, but well, yeah
Right, yeah, yeah, and the bible, well, it was hard for us to be able to understand what it was saying, well, i interpreted them, she asked us questions
But yeah, it's been, it's, it's been a long time since my granny died, at ninety eight years old, but she was a strong lady
No, no, but i guess, the, the way she did it, she had to make you all take a seat
I thank her my
Yeah, dedicating two or three hours a day every day
Exactly, exactly, that was, that was, she was like, we called her Hitler
Like going to another school, you got out of school to go to another at home
Yeah, that's it, but like that, we appreciate it now, when it was happening to us, well, we didn't think so, we thought it was, well, a horrible task
Torture, yes
insurance torture. But now I can communicate, I need my job a lot, well they are always short, well I sell insurance of,
of health, of life, I'm an agent. And my company, are several, because I'm independent.
um
And I travel the whole United States with a group of people that, that show the benefits to the big employers right, a big company has,
a need to show all the benefits that they get and we seat with them a whole week, for example right now I'm in Louisiana.
In the Bayou which they call it. And here there's a casino that has three thousand employees. And we are here a week and a half. and well is like a vacation because there's,
well they give you massages there, I already won two hundred fifty dollars in the casino
ah well you are lucky, that's good.
yes yes, yes, they pay our flight and, already the hotel.
And you have to explain to the, you have to explain to the employees how the system works.
correct.
In other words that you get the Latins.
I get them a lot, they give me all the Latins, they get in line. And the only thing that makes me sad is that the person is very scared that,
because he doesn't have papers and think that by giving the bad social security, they will get in trouble, they prefer to reject all the benefits. And already after talking to me they realize that is,
the life insurance is free, they don't have to be present in the United states to be presented with it, and to obtain it.
Is anyway, a policy that they will pay in case the employee dies. and they already understanding, already want it.
No, I don't know how it works, here in Canada is totally different. But if you don't have a green card, Can you have private health insurance? That's what you are telling me.
oh oh, no those are benefits of, yes, with the green card here well, since they buy the bad social securities to stay here and so they don't bother them.
And since they think that the jobs, if they realize that social security is bad, well
ah,okay no I was talking, the way that you say is bad.
Yes, they are afraid of being deported. Yes
yes, is, is that it's illegal or is, yes okay. The, the
correct, yes
bad in Spanish is like a quite light euphenism the way that it uses
Yes Yes True. And um, they pay twenty five dollars an hour more, in that job if one speaks Spanish, then,
Ah that's good.
Yes it is, where the rest pay them
eh, that you do talking through this crap of the university of Pennsylvania and I don't know what.
yes yes yes yes And how do you like, Canada in contrast to the climate there in Argentina,
Ah, at this moment it must be minus ten degrees and it's windy, which must be some more, it must be almost twenty degrees of
wow
windchill.
uh uh, uh, uh
And I don't know the truth is it's a change.
mm, I can imagine, I escaped from, I'm from Chicago right, there there's thirteen inches of pure snow that has fallen, and here the people want to see the snow, I said puff.
Well I get tired of it
No, my wife hates the snow.
mm And here there's pure Indians right because they have reservations, it scared me because here they all look like me, or me like them, And well,
Indians, Indians, red skin Indians, not Hindus.
red skin. Yes and I'm kind of yellow okay
what you mean with yellow, are you Chinese?
The person, kind of yellowish I look like, yes, like they say, have olive skin, so, oh, they have their own language, the United States
gives them their own nation, their own territory, it treats them differently, they respect them and I heard an old man say yesterday, he was eighty three years old and he told me, look girl
In English, he told me, I was the boss around here, all the  Indians used to work for me when I was twenty years old but look at me now, I work in the casino, who do you think is giving me my paycheck?
it all comes from Indian money, he said, who would have thought!
he was, he was the Indian's boss.
He was the boss, yes, he would order them to work for, to pick the rice, there are lots of
Burnt food.
I see, Cajun, it's Cajun in Spanish.
oh, no Cajun.
Cajun, okay the translation is Cajon
No, my wife would say that the food got burnt
oh I see, well it's greasy it has, it weakens them physically, many of them have diabetes and it could be a real health issue because all their foods are greasy, fried.
lots of rice, lots of bread, I once went to the store to buy some vegetables and I had to leave them because they all want to go eat out every day, they love it.
the, how do the call it, the alligator in Spanish.
Oh, the alligator.
Aha, crocodile, isn't it?
oh, no, it's not the crocodile, no, it's the alligator, isn't it?
Alecaman.
Cayman, a
Oh.
Cyiman is the word cocodrille is crocodile alligator is cyiman
Aiman
Cayman -c a i m a n - cayman like
Oh cayman. oh
like Cayman Island something like that
Oh, well here there are a lot because in the bayou here, everyone. What did you say?  And they are 12 feet, they're babies, they're small and
They go out, I still have never seen one, pero they say that if the male gets angry with the female, um, they will never be able to
Uhm to prove that, it's true that it won't be possible, this one defend because, he put's her so that they eat her, those animals.
So that the caymans eat here, they throw her to the caymans
Hi,
Hi, who's speaking?
Leticia
Lety, this is Ines
it seemed to me that it was you Guacha
what do you think about today's topic?
I didn't want to say anything but
I didn't hear either and then I say mm
No, no I knew it was you this is a truchada,
Do you understand, I was all nervous, I with whom will I end up talking
Is your first call
oh yes, is the first time, Lety what will it be
oh, really good,
yes, I was that I was dying of shame, I mean, ah, who will I end up with! A person I know to break the ice
no, no, no, mortal, mortal
that's good, did they call you?
they called me yes, I was about to call, but I said well, they called me now and
Ah, sure because I Sure, I went to the gym, I came back and I said, ah, that's strange that they didn't call and I will call myself and
yes, no, And didn't they call Pablo?
No, but Pablo put down only weekends, because he now you see that he works in the afternoon
Ah, you're right
so he talks on the weekends
ah, ah, okay and Sure, because when he arrives it already ended
And able, In reality is until twelve, so I figure that he could
the schedule
I'll tell him later because today I was noticing, since today my activation arrived, I was looking at the details and all that, I figure that he'll be able
yes uh, how good, you know that Mariano tells me when
no, yes how good
Why don't you call Maria Ines and tell her for her to call now
Like that you can talk,
like we talk, I mean, but we'll get to by chance
Besides is more exciting by chance, understand
Sure, that's why, but also I don't know, I heard you and said, is Maria Ines, but I didn't bring myself to it
Only by hearing you I realized it, by the doubt, see when you say: who's speaking?
No, mortal, mortal
how good, and you are, have you talked with Mariano?
yes, I mean, no, no
ah how funny,
No, because I was calling, calling, calling and I mean nobody understood me they had me waiting a long time, because sometimes is a schedule kind of
that sometimes yes, yes, the other day Pablo was also a while to try to get
No, no yes, sometimes they take long, I said well, I mean you call, I tell him, to see if they pass
Sure
So
Sure and you guys have the cellular also
No, no yes, yes, precisely yesterday we went to the faculty and then, well I said I'll call from there to take advantage that I'm on another phone
Sure and there was no problem calling see that
Then that's why
To get out of the line, you have to press the nine, no, there's no history, you call and is normal
No, no, no, nothing happened nothing happened, I dialed the number from where I had called, see that they ask you for it
yes,
And well I dialed that number and everything fine
ah,
So no, but no
ah, really good
No, no, fatal, fatal and the other day I talked from the cellular but now I want to talk a eh, I don't know one day from, from my laboratory
You already have two outside calls, of what's its name
Sure, I also really need from the other cellular
ah, ah,
so
Sure you already have several. Well, but since it's a one eight hundred you can really ask anyone for their cellular
ah, you have, no because the minutes
count
They count I think that even if they are, yes, I think so
ah, No and we are killing ourselves, on top of it
But well
eh, we have one phone for both of us, you see that you can't make more than one call per day Then like, either I call, or he calls
No, no, no, it doesn't matter we both call with the same phone eh,
Ah, yes and there's no problem
is the same, no, there's no problem, no, no
ah, it must be by code then, by person
Is by code because you put the
Put your pin
Put your pin, yes
ah,
yes, yes, so there's no problem because of that No and also I said well, yes with the code, I mean our code has the same phone no,
yes, I was scared when I joined of not being able, since it was the same phone, but no
No me too but no, there was no problem, no because, I mean I suppose in reality I don't know, they are studying the language
The important thing is that they are two different people, to register how they talk
yes, the issue is talking, I figure I don't know
yes,
Well, they're recording me and they don't pay me afterwords but
No, i don't think so, because besides, they give you a subject but, no, i mean, you can talk about anything you want
yes
yes, yes
Right?, sometimes you talk about the subject but
but, uh, if you don't know you can start, well
Not necessarily, yeah, if you want to, yeah, i don't know, if you don't have a subject and well, you say the subject of the day, what's your opinion
Sure
But also. yeah, it depends on the person who you're with. The other day i spoke to a girl from Panama that wouldn't stop talking, she didn't let me talk
Right
I mean, i think she spoke the whole time
That's funny
yes, yes, yes, and then i talked to another that had already talked to the girl from Panama and he said "oh, that girl from Panama talks a lot", and yeah, i say, "yeah, i couldn't say a word when i spoke to her"
And i send, Pablo, i sent him, look, so the... can show up at any time
Oh yes
at any time, uh, i don't know if he's going to sign up, but we sent the mail
One, oh, very good, no, that's hilarious
Hilarious, well, we all know each other
yes, yes, besides, this is the time at which i call so
Sure, what time is it, eight, nine?
yes,, this is about the time in which we always speak, I don't know, in general
Sure oh,
Well, I was called today but if I hadn't I was going to call them in a short bit
Sure, yes, until twelve o'clock isn't it,
No, until ten o'clock
oh, until ten o'clock
No, yes, I think it's until ten o'clock
oh, so Pablo is not going to get here because he comes back around ten, ten thirty o'clock
No, he won't be here on time, no, you are right, no, so, not during the week because I think that during the week it's from five or six PM
mm mm
So, no,
Well, they can call him during the weekends, what can you do
Sure yes,
The last one, well he'll take whatever he can
yes,
yes, well, and some news
No, yes, you are thinking, what news
We recently saw each other right? Did Pablo leave today, did you see her?
yes, no, he left
He left, he, today the life, the last time, he leaves tomorrow
No, yes, no, I mean I didn't see her today, no, no, no
mm
No, the one I came across was Estuar and
mm
I told him well we can have lunch one of these days I don't know, I tell him
yes,
Because in reality, they still have my cake mold and they never gave it to me and I never also went by to get it
ah, and the, you want it
And, and, and, and, I also wanted to give them a card and I think that is easier to go to your house or you come to mine, we'll see each other in Penn I told him
but at the end nothing happened, I don't know, where he always has lunch, where, in the laboratory
No, he I don't know, before he had lunch, it seems he had lunch in the laboratory, he always ate in
Sure, but with Lucero
But then he said it was too expensive, and it's too much So, it wasn't very clear where he had lunch
ah, ah,
No, No, NO, I eat eat in the laboratory almost always or sometimes I come here to the house No, No, No,
Sure, but you always take food
No, No, what happens is that I sometimes buy it and take it up to the lab.
And where do you buy it? ah,
And I buy it there, in wawa or or if not also in the Chinese that's next to it there
ah,
But, but generally i take, i try not to take money to spend
yeah, right?, and besides, well, i don't know if it's right, but the Chinese guy is selling a tastier food, but we, i swear to you that were we eat
i get sick of the food
It isn't attractive at all
No, hey, it's good, do you know what's going to the wawa?, a
No, the wawa, i can fall asleep
it breaks you, the only thing i can buy in wawa are salads, that, well, they're not tasty, but they're salads
Yes
And then, yeah, soon, uh, they kill, those things are delicious but they'll kill you
Yes, you can't eat there everyday, it's obvious, right?
Right, so like, well, i prefer to get bored with the cheap and i take a sandwich
Sure
Well, yeah, a sandwich, an apple, and i go like that, and well, at night like very
And, right, yeah, obvious, right?, it's just, i don't know, I'm telling you, i go to the Abranson, i look at the stuff and it's not attractive to me
yes
The only thing that's attractive to me sometimes, that's true, are the salads or the soup, the soup does
Um
but the salads because, well, some of the, i don't know, they have rice or something; well, they're salads, they don't have much, much mystery, so no, it's mostly the money
Dude, i only went there once and i liked it, but of course i only went there once, when you go there more than once, you must get sick of it
Yeah, i never eat but, i mean, we try, we try to take too, but  i don't eat because it's not attractive, because, well, if i said "i'm suffering because i see so many good stuff
you buy it
maybe one day one meal may tempt me, I won't say never, but it is not only that it doesn't tempt you, but that you realize that they are
very caloric, and that they are not good to eat, I mean you can't eat that everyday because
yes, yes, you'll burst like a toad
yes, yes, so
The time I went there, there were many of such things, I ended up buying a salad and a soup because I thought everything was like too much, like if I go to work after eating that I'll fall asleep
yes, that's it, I can't, I can't eat that day after day, so for lunch
Sure, no, I can't, specially because it makes me sleep and besides I get fatter and fatter, but it makes me sleep
Huge food plate
yes
So I prefer to eat something more light
Right, obvious, right. But the he sent me a mail because on Thursdays we can all go together to have lunch somewhere
Go on
We coordinate and go to have lunch with Stuar
Great, yes, let's go with him, yes
I didn't see him. Wednesday I'll be quite messed up, but I think Thursday will be a quiet day, and there will be nobody
And they start to
They will all leave
yes
So, I think so
Yeah, i don't have history, i have a week very... like that, that cells are growing
No, we'll send each other mails and arrange
growing up and a plate, and see if they grow up, i don't have experiments like that, of being
you can take an hour like that to have lunch peacefully
Nothing, yeah, not tomorrow, but the rest of the week is going to be very quiet
Well
So i don't have history
And well, so I'll send you a mail later and we'll coordinate with, with Stuart, because neither Lucero or Paula are there, but
Sure, yeah, bit if we go with him
Well, if Rocio is there and wants to come, where does Rocio have lunch?, where does she have lunch?
Oh, we can tell Rocio, i don't know, she eats out, i think she always goes to the Chinese or something like that,
Oh, well
She will surely get excited, if we tell her
Well, so we'll include her too and then maybe she'll be excited
Yes, yes, yes
Maybe at one, it's an hour more or less... for everyone
Yes, i think it's fine, yes
Well
Yes, yes, so tomorrow i, it gets kinda complicated, but every other day it's all good
Yeah, yeah
Even more, Paulo can go too, if we tell him were, because he's not working
Oh, very good, obviously
Oh, yeah, that
Obviously, so let's go with him
We'll tell him

It's tasty, the salads are very good, very good
And i never ate the sandwich you told me, i ate a sandwich, and i never ate it
Oh, and the sandwiches are phenomenal, yeah, the truth is it's delicious, and coffee is tasty, oh yeah
So we can go to "Ya Pronto" then
It doesn't look like a Yankee place, it looks like an Italian place, like it's name
Yeah, good, no, excellent; you know, I'll send a mail later on and we'll arrange and we say goodbye
Do it dude, did you see the pictures?, Estuar's

And i didn't have any
I sent the things to you yesterday, did you get them?

Yeah, they're really nice, i said... because in the end i didn't know if you went to the site or not, i said, well, I'll send them, because i saw Stuart's
yeah, i already downloaded them, no, because i couldn't, what's that?, WWW leticia dot pruscino
dot com dot "ar"
yes
No, sorry, without WWW
No, well
before it was
yeah, but, Leticia and Pruscino with the first letter in Caps?
Hello, good evening, how are you?
Fine, it's Marcela, with whom am I speaking?
Hello!  Ever, where are you talking from?
eh, I'm talking from North Carolina
ah, okay.  I'm in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
ah, with the cold,
yes, pretty much
Well, we have to talk about the topic of social assistence
yes, correct, well
The truth is I don't know.  To me, I know that there needs to be social assistance of course, but, I don't know, I think that it doesn't work very well
eh, in reality, eh, I also think that no, unfortunately, many older people, who depend a lot on this,
ah, don't have the necessary help when it comes to, an, the quantities that they receive after they retire and things like that
yes, yes
Too low, too low, so
hmm
a low level, eh, that they call, the level, of being poor, no,
yes, of poverty, yes
poverty, and, it's like they don't have any, care with them, because what happens is that they can't, subsist, they simply don't have more help to give them
yes, no, this is true, to me the other thing I also see now is, now, with the system that they have, people have to work and if not
they stop your assistance and you have to try to find, this work, or else they stop your assistance, the
yes, I know
And then, the problem with that is that the type of There's not enough emphasis on the education Then you have, the majority are women, with kids, young
eh, young women that because they have kids don't go to school
yes, correct
Oh, they don't go to school to high school, or maybe they don't go to the University, then depending on how old they are, but then they don't have any training to have
A good job and then with those jobs they have to pay someone to take care of the kids because almost always these are single women
And I think that is not enough, sure that there are people that say and if, you keep on giving money to these people, then all the single women will get
Pregnant and have kids to live free But the human being is not like that understand They are very few, I think
yes, definitely there will always be people that will benefit from that, but
mm
not necessarily will it change the idea of life of eighty percent of the population just because of that
yes,
And what's more, like that how things are, there are many people that benefit, that perhaps should not benefit and people that need a little more benefit that don't get it
yes, I sometimes think that what they should do because those, those systems cost a lot of money And there's never enough money Because is not enough, and you have all the bureaucracy that has to be kept, to maintain the system
Then I think that What I would do is put all the money on a system like the people of, health insurances
So that everyone can go to a doctor a dentist, understand, like there is in other countries That if you for being, I'm Argentina, right, and then
My parents if they want go to a private doctor But if they couldn't pay a private doctor then they go to the hospital that they are supposed to go to
And there they have doctors, doctors that work, that have Private practices but are in a rotation, see, Every certain eh, amount of time they have to put this
eh, serve in the hospital for free. And then like that everybody Can go take care of their health, then the elderly wouldn't have the problems that they have now
yes, I think that
You know what I mean? and afterwards, with all the amount of food that is wasted in this country, I think that instead of giving the people money
eh, I mean, they could be directly fed and given a paid housing, I don't know. Maybe this is even more complicated, but I think that these checks they give
most of the people can't administrate his money, I, I am in the list, you know what I mean? and no matter, the less money
you have, eh, the more suffer if you don't administer it properly, you know what I mean?
yes, yes
So, I don't know, I think that they are giving this checks to these people, and what they need is more education, and some training on how to administer their money
For it to reach, and I don't know, maybe something more practical. Instead, all the money goes to bureaucracy
And the check, which is not enough
yes, I think that maybe, eh, well, eh, as I see it, the worse thing I've seen is the medical care that is provided
to the elder, eh, specially now
mm
with the change to come to 'medicard'
yes
that actually means moving from a public service to forcing people to get their private insurance
yes, yes, yes, they are heading in that direction, sure
and, eh, it is very complicated because most of that people are people without education, who can't, eh, obtain the different
eh, procedures for the new medical insurances, and it is very complicated to them, and
and old people are afraid
so difficult
They don't understand a thing
no, no
do you understand, he doesn't have the capacity to understand, as he is afraid, they feel, they feel that we decide, they are abandoned, do you understand, the,
oh,
They have a thousand things to chose from and they don't know what's best for them and on top of that, they want to take more money because, did you see that every month they take a certain amount of money for medicard
And in reality, I don't see how it benefits society, to do something like that, oh, many
elderly people would want to change their doctors, doctors that they might have had for twenty years
mhm
because they are doing all these changes and and oh, the private companies will benefit from it but the reality is that people won't benefit at all
At all, nothing at all and in the end, yes, if the system is not helping the society, all of it, then, in the end, it won't even help the
private companies, I mean, it will in the beginning because in the beginning they will receive money but then, everything is going to be more expensive because if they are not
thinking about the future, then the society won't value the elderly people.
and you can see that here in the United States, unfortunately, oh, every every decade, oh, the system gets worse for the elderly people
There are many of them now, with that, they will be the biggest group in the society oh
Because the ones that were born in the
yes,
sixties, seventies, there were a lot of babies back then
yes, yes, that's true
oh, so now
The babies, they call them,
the babies, yes, so, oh,  it will be too expensive for the government, too expensive and difficult for the federal programs to
to be able to cover all the expenses, but but, they do have lots of millions to waste on Iraq, to focus on
That's what I've always wondered why are they fighting there and how much money are they spending to help
yes, yes
and if they are barely, they are wasting the money, it's like if they were throwing butter to the ceiling to Iraq, like, not tomorrow, it turns out that they are there
oh, we don't have enough money, we don't know what to do that's why I don't understand it. There are cities where the schools suck, in this country
In this country, where schools should be the best ones in the world but they are not, no, no, you could find better schools in a really poor Hispanic country.
Sure
And, that's a shame for this culture, it's a shame for this culture, that there's people in this country, which is so rich, and it has so many ignorant people.
yes, and it's a shame because at least if we go back to the elderly issues, all the money is wasted in helping other countries.
mhm
They can't assign certain money for medicard or for doctor's expenses for old people because there's no money, but they do it for other countries because people are dying there
Well elderly people are dying too, they don't have a good healthcare, oh, many old people die because they don't have the necessary medicines, I mean people
oh, that's right, it's not just, but now, maybe you are right, this is not going to change because young people, unfortunately, they are not inclined to vote
Well
and the old people that do, and then you have a large population that has a common interest
and that's a huge number of voters, so, it's possible that maybe, in the next decade, we can see that influence, right
But it seems to me that until there's no insurance or a national healthcare system like in Canada, Argentina, France and England
oh, oh, like in most of the other countries in the world, until we don't have something similar here, this is not going to improve because we have to destroy that and start over.
yes, I think that they are scared, of
Tamara.
Hello, my name is Miriam.
Hello. My name is Tamara.
Where are you from?
Where are they from?
I'm from, oh, I live in Toronto, Canada.
And where were you originally from?
From Peru. Lima, Peru.
Oh, well, I'm from Argentina. Argentina.
yes. I see, where do you live?
In Boston.
Oh. Well.
Have you been living here in the  United States or Canada for long?
How?
Have you been living in Canada for a long time?
yes, ten years.
Oh.
I see
And how is health insurance and loans?
Oh they are good, social services? It's good. It's not that bad, yes.
And you have like a social security number like here?
Social security number?
yes
yes, we have, we have. For work, yes.
And do you also have to pay a health insurance?
it depends on how much the people earn.
Mm.
if the people earn more, then they pay like more taxes
yes.
And but that's something new. Before they didn't have that everybody had access to the medicine but that I think a year ago it changed.
And that the people that earn more, pay more.
And are there a lot of health plans?
No, it's bad, you know. Because we have a card and we go to the doctor. When people feel bad.
yes. And do you have to pay every time you go to the doctor? Ah, Because here every time we go to the doctor we have to pay like a
like fifteen dollars for the service.
Oh, look see. No, I didn't know. Is that in all the United States or only in the provinces?
I believe that in the United States
Oh, look.
eh but we have to, first to pick you pick a social that one wants there's like different companies And one can pick one before or also
each one is more expensive
You know that, here like there is eh, there are conversations about wanting to privatize this because now government is the one with control. So then
Everyone, everyone here has the right to medicine. They can do an operation, everything with your, with your card that everyone of us has, right?
but at times it's that the waiting list is very long.
Ah. For operations?
Yes, for an operation.
But, but if you need an emergency, you can go directly to a hospital.
yes, yes. You can go and you don't pay anything. Of course, for medicine you have to pay for it.
yes
It depends. But the hospital, the Y, in the night I don't know if everything is covered.
And how are the doctors of medicine, good?
It's not that bad, you know. Yes, it's good. More or less. I wouldn't say that it's the best, but neither more or less because here there have been many things
like the hospitals haven't been kept very clean. And there have been infections and
yes
bacteria and it has killed people and all that
Wow
yes, yes
Wow
You didn't hear about SARS?
SARS from last year?
Yeah, yeah, it was about two years ago or something like that.
I found out but I didn't think that in Canada. Didn't it happen in China?
In China but in Canada too. In canada, nurses died.
Wow, Nurses?
yes. Nurses died.
Today, no.
yes, it was tough.
No, I had never heard of that.
yes. And afterwards it was scary. Not long ago they also discovered, like they did an audit to the hospitals hospitals and
yes.
and they discovered that many hospitals had, eh, they didn't have their equipment they didn't clean them well. And they gave them a fine to many.
Wow, And how are they preparing of this new epidemic of
Because no.
of eh of of flu?
they are preparing well I don't know, they would It hasn't happened. Sometimes you know that things happen and they don't tell
Sure.
Until someone dies, what do I know, and then they become known. The bomb goes off and it becomes known that or in truth it's not
yes.
it was, it's not like they paint it
Mm. yes.
yes many things get discovered.
And that in Toronto is it different than in Montreal? Because in one they speak English and in the other French? I sounds like the same because it's the same government
it was a bit different.
Mm.
A bit different yeah
And
but I never went to Montreal.
How is the economy between one place and the other?
It seems to me that Montreal is a very big city they have told me once I went to visit
And Toronto is no?
Toronto is big but Montreal has a system well for example of Subway that is bigger and more advanced
yes?
A lines, Toronto only has a few lines and it's not a big thing that you can say
And do you also speak French or not?
No, no. I only speak in English, no. That one has of
And there in Toronto, do you encounter many people that speak French?
Right away, only English.
Mm.
English and the languages of the countries that
So it means that a person from Montreal that goes to Toronto is like a tourist?
they have to learn English.
Wow yes.
They are bilingual, yes.
Ah because I
Sure that
I work in a hospital and yesterday a person from Montreal came and spoke French.
yes, is true. They speak French as first language but yes, they don't want to be left behind or yes
yes
without knowing how to do their documents and in a day now they come to Toronto or to another part the people need to speak
Uh uh.
you need in these countries two languages. In other words French or our language. You need two languages.
yes. And are there a lot of people there?
yes, yes there's a lot, a lot, a lot.
In other words that you it helps you a lot to be seen?
yes, Cool, yes because. There is. Even though you don't find work in Spanish.
No?
One has to speak English.
Mm.
Yes
And, and
No, you don't find work.
What do you work in?
I'm unemployed now, but i was working a while ago, i don't know if you
Um
It's a communications company, Rogers
No
Ok, it's a
What's it like, like cellular?
It's a company, yes, and it also controls the cable, it's a big monopoly, it's a company that
Um
before it was just the cable
yes
It had the TV cable, but now they bought, they bought Canada, it's a big monopoly
Um
So i was on contract with them, they renewed my contract again
Yes
But now the job is over, just now, a month ago i lost it
Oh, and is it hard there now?
What can i tell you, yes, there are people that... there's a lot of unemployment
Um
Yes, there's unemployment, oh yes, you know, there are lousy jobs that really aren't enough
Sure.
There are bad jobs that don't raise people from poverty.
Sure.
Because it's it's a, what do I know, they pay very little.
Sure.
So it doesn't make for
Wow.
Yeah. And tell me
And has it been a while since? What?
Go ahead. yes, tell me, tell me
And has it been a while since you've gone back to Peru?
I went back on two thousand and two
Mm.
and I have not gone back yet but my mom came twice to visit me.
yes.
It's that it takes a lot of money.
yes.
to go. One trip requires too much.
Wow
And you? How long have you been there in?
Eh I recently arrived, recently arrived. It's been nine months since I arrived.
You arrived nine months ago?
yes, to the United States.
Oh look, you are new. And you already work in a hospital?
yes, I'm a veterinarian.
Oh, look how nice.
yes, but I'm working, I have to validate my title. So I'm working as a nurse technician. yes, also I was two months looking for a job, right?
So you are
Because until I got the permit and all, I was two months.
Yes. Well, I'm glad because there are many people many professionals that don't find, eh. And they become taxi drivers or cleaners or whatever
yes, yes, that's true. I was very lucky in that sense. I would like to work as a veterinarian no but
Sure.
Suddenly the one to work
Sure, And then you already found out what you need to perhaps take some courses or yes?
yes, I took the English exams that I had to take
Uh uh
and now I need to take the validation exams. And then once one passes that one Eh, then you register in the other one
but it's expensive, like five thousand dollars. Eh, I don't know how it is that changed there.
And you can't ask for a loan? They don't give loans there?
Eh, I met for five thousand dollars for a North American, very little to ask for a loan. There, there are plans, Eh, of validation
for example that one can do a year in a  hospital and pay twenty six thousand dollars.
Oh.
And there they do give you a loan. But I don't want to do the twenty six thousand dollars one.
No, that after you are in debt.
Sure yes.
Because they charge a high interest.
yes, besides I don't want to spend a whole year I mean I was already in a. The last year of a faculty is very
is like a residency of a person of human medicine, right? and is very exhausting. So
Oh.
I stay without doing it but pass it nothing. Know the exam and ready.
Yes.
But the dogs also have medical insurance.
Yes, Look how nice.
And is more. I think is better for a dog than for a human.
But you have to. Yes, they also say that here. I mean the people are the one that comes and are surprised here, about how they treat the dogs, say.
yes.
When
yes yes is Here, they invest a lot of money a day of incarnation of a day could be one thousand dollars.
Wow
And the people pay it.
yes.
And I work in oncology and oncology can, oh, radiation can cost four thousand dollars and people pay it.
Wow, you see. Mm. But are those normal people, ordinary people with a normal wage or are they rich people?
I really don't understand if they are rich or not because sometimes they don't look like wealthy people, oh mm. But, however, these people
you can see by how they dress that they are not poor but they don't look like the Americans, no, they are not well dressed and however, they pay whatever it costs for the animal
so, I really don't know how it works, so, if they have health care, if they are paying for their health care and maybe, oh, I've heard that the homeless
Oh, the homeless they do have a dog and they pay, they pay more than social security.
Wow, that's good
yes, I, oh, I don't know if I saw this or not but that does happen in England for sure. So, you can see homeless people with their dogs
They don't have money to eat or anything else but they do have money for their dogs.
Look, that's nice. That's interesting. I didn't know these things.
I don't know how that works in the United States but it works. I don't know, it's a lot of money for the poor and there are lots of them that live on the streets by choice.
I see, that's true.
It's not like in South America. Oh, yes. Here it's like many of them are drug addicts.
They chose
they are addicts or alcoholics. Or,
yes, that's true.
people lost their jobs because they didn't want to work on and I don't know how but in Peru I think it must be like that too
it's like in Argentina, there's lots of misery, no?
Really. And the poor, the poor dogs are really miserable too.
yes.  yes.  yes.  The poor dogs.
They're poor things from one extreme to another, eh, because sometimes when the
Hello?
Hello.  Yes, my name is Gloria from here in California.
He-Hello Gloria, I'm Paula, I'm Argentinian and I'm here in Boston.
Yes.
Yes, have you been in California for a long time, Gloria?
Sorry?
Have you- can you hear me?
Yes, sorry?  No, no, I didn't really hear what you asked me.
Have you been in California for long?
Oh, yes.  Oh, it's been seven, eight years.
Ah, a lot.  And what do you think about social security in the United States?
Hmm.  No, the truth is that, maybe in part you're right they don't give a lot of help to, eh, to make you self-sufficient, no?
but maybe sometimes there are opportunities where you don't have, eh, it's not the moment to be self-sufficient, eh, here there are many restriction
like with economic help, like with medical benefits.
Hmm.
We've, eh, suffered a lot in this way, well, because of the governor, right?  Who has limited a lot of the help for people who really need it
Sure.
so, I see this as bad, well because we're all human beings and we also have rights in my opinion.
No, not talking, I think that the system isn't very good, I'm here for three years
Hmm.
and with all sincerity, is not that understand perfectly all these services and benefits, but I have noticed, and also heard that there are many people that cannot access any type of, of
social services nor the medicine, right? and is
Mm.
I think that in a rich country like the United States
There are many limitations.
is horrible. Sure, like I think that the people should be first, right? and that of self-sufficiency
Mm mm
there not everybody can be self-sufficient in every
Mm. Yes.
in every moment
Mm
and No
The truth is that each day the close the doors more, on one as a Latin let's say it like this because I'm Latin, right?
Hm
and each day there are a lot of restrictions eh we don't receive all the benefits that we deserve, so
Sure.
eh, the basis for them is that you are an immigrant, you don't have any rights to this, you are an immigrant you don't have a right to medical coverage
Yes.
eh, there are many limitations, and I truly think that's wrong
Sure.
there should be improvements in that, right?
Yes, and the place where you work, they don't give you medical insurance?
I don't know which one No. Is a hassle here, eh, eh, they pay the minimum here
Yes.
and no, I'm not working at the moment because I have a, a baby.
Ah, how cute, how old?
Aha. The baby turned ten months.
Ah.
Aha, but she has been very sick with the flu, so
Yes,
eh, yes I'm a single mother and there to the extreme of asking for monetary aid and they denied it twice already
No.
and yes, mm
How strange. And that's the state of California, right?
The state of California, I got very sick of
Sure.
the heart, I had
Mm.
I was having a hard time breathing, I went to the emergency room
Yes.
they sent me a six hundred eighty dollars bill
I don´t believe you.
then, for that part, I have seen myself affected, how am I going to pay that amount at once? I look for a job, I am going to let applications in some places in
no place, eh,has called me or anything.
Yes.
I look for babysit eh, they want you to charge them ten dollars for eight hours.
No.
Aha, then I see that there are not benefits, well.
No.
Hmm.
No, it is ridiculous, I have a friend that well, she was not a single mother because she was married but her husband lived in India
Hmm.
so, lets say, her husband was virtual
Hmm.
and, and she got pregnant and had the baby here and the state of Massachusetts pay almost all the pregnancy expenses, the doctor and milk coupons, juice
and the truth is that I in that moment, despite that she , was not, was not American she was not a citizen, she was nothing, she was a student
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.
and, and in that moment it looked to me that the state of Massachusetts have been fine with someone that
Ah, it, it depends of the State, because here in California, the governor we have
Of course.
oh, it has taken a lot of the benefits
Sure, yes, Schwarzenegger is a disaster, isn't he?
He has taken a lot of mmm. And the longer he stays the worse, because he is cutting the, eh, medical insurance, he don't want them, and I've heard that the children born here will no longer have the benefits
they won't be, they won't be born in this country because they are sons of immigrants, they are closing us the door more every day
But that is so because it is a federal law
Mhm. But I don't know, to me it is not right, because although they say that we become a charge for the government, because that's what they say, that we become a charge for them
I say that at the moment, we, we also contribute with , mm, with taxes, don't we?
Right, right
MHm
Yes, besides, eh, I think that saying that the health of the people living here is a charge is quite sad and ugly
Yes
Isn't it? It is like eh
There is a lot of racism
going to invade Iraq and spending millions of dollars
Aha
there but it's not only the immigrants, there are a lot of Americans who can not afford
Black people, I see nobody working here, and, and, and if you come to have a look where they give the money aid it is full of black people
people who, men who look alright
Yes
who are able for working and so, but they are in the same
Sure.
Really? then eh
Sure, sure
on my part I, I see it as being bad because actually, eh, it's getting worse, there's no, there's no help
Yes.
eh
What country are you from, Gloria?
from Guatemala.
You're from Guate-, ah they tell me Guatemala is wonderful.
Aha, but eh, we are also like in one part, eh, I can't say is one hundred percent bad the, the state here where I'm at because it was the first place where I came, right?
Sure.
because yes, at that moment the people from there, the hospital they all helped me, they gave me financial help
Sure.
but it was a collection that they did amongst them which in my country they never would've done.
Mm. Sure.
Eh, they do give me the milk for my daughter because otherwise I wouldn't have money to buy it, right?
Sure.
Eh. Yes, they have helped me
Mm.
But, eh, what I am referring to is that each day they are closing more the doors, eh, they are taking away benefits that are beneficial to us.
Yes.
Aha, they are taking away a lot of benefits that in reality benefit us, I don't know if in all the states is like that, but at least here in the state of California, this is getting bad.
Yes, and have you thought of moving to another state?
The truth is I have nowhere to go, no because I would really like to if I had the support of some relative or something
Sure.
I'm going to go somewhere else, but already now is not just me alone,  I also have a daughter, right?
Sure.
and not anywhere, they are going to say come here and let's see how we give you a hand.
Sure.
Aha, I was working with a Salvadoran lady, I took care of her daughter, she would give twenty dollars daily
Yes.
I would go from seven in the morning and would return at eight at night.
Mm, no.
I had to clean her house, wash the clothes and everything and take care of the daughter.
That's abusive.
Yes, then, eh yes, since I arrived, I've been like this, it hasn't gone too well you could say
Mm.
and to say that I'm going to return to my country neither because my mom gave me away when I was very little
Mm.
eh, I have a sister in Honduras and and she's worse off because she has like eleven kids and practically over there is a country, the poorest country there could be in Honduras
Mm Sure.
then eh just wait to see what happens here because it would be a mistake also to take my daughter from here that here I know she will have benefits
she will have her studies and all, something I won't be able to give her in my country, right?
Sure, sure.
Mm.
Then you've been here eight years or eight months?
Seven years.
Seven years.
Mm.
Ah, a lot.
But, yes. Everything has gotten complicated for me, if I haven't gone back is because, because I have nowhere to go, right?
Ah, for your daughter.
No because, perhaps I wouldn't be here, and because I also don't want to
Mm.
eh, to shatter my daughter's life, I know that here she will have more opportunities

Next year, yes.
Mm, this upcoming year it looks like they are going to do them again and I don't think he'll stay I hope the one that comes improves the, what he is right now removing that no, no, no

Yes, well and probably will be a democrat, which that always helps, right
Mm.
social security, eh, they have more social concerns and this is a way
Mm. And in the state where you live, no, no, things are not too complicated or how is it there?

Yes
Hey, there's this dude there in New York, what's he called?, Howard Stern, right?, there was something
Oh
Where it's more like this week, i heard in the news that he's not, he ended up in the radio or something like that
Uh, a contract that ended but, uh, that's still going, the person he had pays me, the station he works for, they get a lot of money from his audience
That dude is something, something crazy
Yes?
Yes, because the guy's a pervert, i consider him a pervert
Oh
I don't now if you like his shows, have you seen his shows?
Yes, i heard it, i hear him once in a while, yeah, that's, is not easy, no, no
Yes
And they're not on regular radio, well, here in Canada; uh, i have heard him every now and the, and i find him kind of funny but nothing, when he's
Yes, no, no, no, what i mean is, for example, that the guy has, like, he doesn't, have... yeah, he's funny, his quotes are really
like very rude, uh
Uh huh
So, he kinda doesn't have
Double, but, double meaning, right?
No, not the meaning, he gives it the meaning he wants
Uh huh
That the people like the red ones, the teeth cantudos? of that one
Uh uh,
and then he has no respect, he has no respect towards anyone. Yes hes is a person that has no respect.
Uh uh
he he, he only does it so that the people laugh, understand. And that. For example he has a show that show of house he has a show of
that, that is is televised. But is about what he does in the radio.
Uh uh
And then the girls go and he tells them, listen but here. And they take it off in front of him. Okay. And the
And in front of the camera and I don't know what the man has, the girls go crazy.
Uh uh.
He tells them, oh take off your bra there. Let me see how they are, that if they are good. And he, he tells them Come here that I want to touch them and
they let him, they let him do it. And he tells them, take off your panty, take if off and they even do it. I don't know what it is that
Uh uh
I don't know I prefer, I don't know is I consider him a person like you know a person is a show But I mean, how can a man like that go to work.
And then go home and he has a family, understand?
Uh uh
Because, I don't know if you've seen the show, you've never seen the show?
yes, once that I was in the United States here was here in Canada what is it called E right?
Uh uh.
yes, here in Canada they don't have that E channel -E channel
Uh uh.
It didn't happen. I went once, I saw it once when I was there on vacation in the United States.
yeah. great. You didn't see any of that, what I'm talking about?
yes, well I I saw I think the episode that that I saw it was an interview with Arnold Schwarzenegger or something like that. And I think that if there had been a girl in a bathing suit and
And everything all of her bathing suit but they censored it. It wouldn't happen like
Uh uh. yes, yes they censored it but that is that is that was working like that. I don't know how they're able to convince these women to take their clothes off because there are wo-
I I used to have a roommate it was two women, sisters, Germans both, and I was always watching that and I I sat down and stayed watching it with them
and it was always today I'd say like about two months there were more than four hundred, had seen like about four hundred women and the guy was saying I'm going to break it that I want to watch how that is and
yep, took off her clothes in front of him and said, hold in, so that
those where they give out prizes or something like that, right? Or like a prize contest
uh? No, what happened was the super popular guy like I told you, the popular man that there are woman we cam they have like a certain level of popularity, there are woman that just go crazy
like it just gives them an inclination to do crazy stuff
uh uh.
for for you.
uh.
Understand? For example, I've heard that there are musicians ah here in in Manhattan that when they go do a concert that they're putting on the girls take off their panties and throw them on on
to the
uh uh.
And eh they're just stupid and crazy little things but they do it you know with people, men when they ask to do something they do it. Anything. They do it.
Happens
Then, uh?
With the purpose of coming out in that program, right?
With the purpose of his program well with the purpose of doing what he wants.
Uh uh
With the purpose of doing what he wants since they have him as an idol, you understand?
Ah, yes.
But, Leave me.
But there there each time for example. You have to see these Spanish channels where they do these things more the same. right?
Eh.
But in Spanish.
Well, I was talking with a  guy that there's a song called the mega and this station there's already two people that
that what is it called that they
Must be the same as Howard but in Spanish.
they are the ones that direct yes yes direct the show and they are almost the same as this man. But in Spanish because they really
Uh uh Uh. And but they can do worse things because they are since they are speaking Spanish
Oh.
they can say vulgar things and things like that, and nobody
Oh. Oh yes, they do it
yes, and they don't have for example the problems that came out that Howard had with with the FCC because it was in Spanish and
and nobody from this government cares what they say because they are talking in Spanish, right?
Yes, oh, the, the, he speaks Spanish here, loudly
Uh huhu,
But they have regulations, do you know what i mean?, always, people always know what they're talking about because there's always another stations that accuses you and everything
Oh
But no, they have, for example, they have a, lets say they have a keyword to say bad words, for example, when this man talks about the
the feminine part
Uh huh
instead of saying the word in spanish, they invented a thing that's called "foneta"
It's not
Yes
Uh huh
That means the thing, the woman's thing
Oh, the woman's thing
But
What i said, in Mexico it's called, "doing the cheese", i don't know if they say it like that in the United States
Uh huh, no, maybe the Mexicans still call it the "cheese" among them
Uh huh
But the chaforeta doesn't really mean anything
Really
But, but it's something they have
Yes
they named it like that so they can speak in public, uh, openly, without getting into trouble with the people who regulates. The words, so the words
Yes
They call it "calembo"
The calembo
Uh huh, and that, really, no country in Latin America call the Spanish language like that, but they
Uh huh
At radio level and as authorities they're doing that, and people laughs about the jokes they make, and they make songs
About the "chanfoneta" and the calembo, and their jokes are basically theirs
yes
They take popular songs and change them and put make like that, for example, they have the, the song that says "it lasts so long"
Uh huh
"Oh it lasts so long", and so they put a woman that's, that the woman is singing to the man
Uh huh
Because he has a very big calembo
Yes
And he makes her suffer, she says "oh, it hurts so much but it's just...", but because of the calembo, it explains everything, using that term. So, I'm telling you, the radio can't control it any longer
Yes
But your imagination, and you, you know that
Good evening.
Hello, how are you?
Who's speaking?
Juan, hello?
Juan, Juan
Juan from -- that, is my last name.
It seemed like very religious, is it a priest's name?
No, not at all, I'm a father but of a family.
Hm. Well my name is, eh, um, Rosa, how are you?
Very good, thank you very much, is today's topic.
The welfare system, if I'm understanding, right?
Of the system, really?
Here in the United States, and in comparison
Um, um
Ah, ah, to the European system, well look I don't, I don't have much knowledge of the European system I, um, and, and I also don't know much, much, much of the welfare here, however, well, so
eh, they asked the question that if it should be reduced, the amount of money that the government gives to those who depend on welfare
so that they become more independent or, on the contrary, continue like that or increase it more
Um, um
Well I don't think that just reducing, or increasing the moneys they give the people eh, can change eh, the situation in, which those people find themselves, no, I think that
the economic situations and social well being eh, they have like, their foundation in more basic structures of society itself that would have to be, eh, transformed if they wanted
to generate, a, a change in the economical activity of this, in this dependent families
Oh, oh, yes, we agree on that, I believe that this is not about giving them more or less money, it can be because of other things, no, lets say these, needs to help people, no?
For example, if they say, well, we are taking the money away, if they, oh, if they give the people less money, to make them more self sufficient, the question is, are they, yes, yes, really
the money hast to do with self sufficiency
Sure, it exist
No?
the structures exist or the means for these people to become independent
Self-sufficient, exactly
because you might take the money away from them and they might not have the opportunity to, oh, work or get involved in a, oh, well yes, in the job system
so, because of that, this wouldn't be solving the problem
Oh. Exactly, it's like, in that sense, the question has, it rather has a, lets say a background, that, of course, in, they give people money and people don't do anything, no?
self-sufficient because they have enough money and they rely on the government to live, that's the issue, no? That this question
yes, one would have to ask what type of people, what type of people is requesting this government help
Um, um.
an,d usually, the discriminated sectors of society, the poor, oh, the racially rejected, lots of times, oh, old people or women, and so on, and so on, the ones that are usually, lets say, the ones with
less benefits in the society, so this, um we would have to ask ourselves again, as I was saying in this moment, yes, yes, if the conditions exist for this sectors to
overcome this discriminating situation
Um, um.
I believe that the changes would have to be very, very different and not just relative
Exactly
oh, oh the economical size of the aid, oh, what's the name, oh, the institutions that are giving aid to these groups are just palliatives.
they are not providing them with the necessary tools to become independent
and I believe that it would be best to reduce the amount given to them, to have the same people do the same with less money, no?
They won't be,
yes, because the structure is not changing, they don't have other opportunities, if you say, well, we are reducing the amount of money but
you can get this job opportunity and only the ones that are working, the funds are going to be lowered and you see that we are going to check that
oh, you will get money if you work, and education and healthcare and this and that, and then they will
oh, they will be able to access all the opportunities and general benefits, oh, of this society, well, it's like a, it's like a multi-sectoral measure and not just a unilateral one.
yes, yes, in that sense it is, I believe, I think I read somewhere that the poverty systems, the ones that fight poverty in the United States have failed.
because they haven't been able to end poverty and they have just made people dependent on the government's help so, I mean,
with this, this way of social support, yes, they give money to the ones that need it, so that, lets say, they
They do, yes
can move forward in this economical system
but they can't, no? Oh, oh, unless you have, yes
Yes, when you just keep the population, stable
Um, um.
No? They are not changing the conditions,
Um, um.
That's what has happened since, eighty years ago, there were twenty million of poor people and now the number is eighty million
it's growing, so, it's the same population, nothing has changed, this doesn't let people integrate,  no, no, nothing is going to happen, they are just going to continue getting government help
reall- really as an expense
Sure, but besides, I think that the government does assume it as such
Exactly
Because, making more structural changes would be much more expensive, not only economically, but in social terms, also for this government
I can't imagine, actually, what kind of changes would be the right ones for this case, right? because, well, apparently, what could it be? it may have something to do with cultural conditions, right?
Sure, and racial
questions, rather than what kind of structural changes can the government make, I don't th-, I can't imagine it, I mean, we live in a world that is the way it is, isn't it?
so, in this world, the way it is, you have to look for your opportunities
Well, but, no, no, it's not the same for everybody
It isn't? You may have it harder or easier
Um, sure, because if you belong to a
these circumstances, but then you say no, but let me tell you, it has to do with education, hasn't it? and so, if there are schools there, I guess a lot of the population can access those schools
and however, I guess they may hace some attitudes, or expectations, about their education or something like this, right? I mean it is a very complex phenomenon, I don't dare to think of a
simple solution, right? I rather try to think about how in the conditions under which you have, apparently, several opportunities and paths to follow, but you don't
right?
Um, um
That's it, if you don't do so it is because there is some interest in your lifestyle, some interest related to governmental aids, because it is enough
from this point of view, right? why move if I am getting aid that gives me enough to survive? Acording to my group, right? to how the population is
right?
Well, but from what I hear from you, I understand that you are, eh, giving a very simple explanation to a problem that, initially, we agreed that was much more complex than that
because this answer that you're thinking about, or supposing, to say that the beneficiary of the social security system, well I think that it's too simple the way that you say, I think that there are also many more complexities
and many more explanations like cultural, like, eh, now it's a psychological history, cultural history, etcetera, I think that it's much more complex
yes, yes.
But well, in general, I agree.
yes, it's a simplification of an economic kind, no?  To say, it's a decision many, it's like an economic decision, well yes, I have more benefit, that costs
and like they say, here, hey, well I won't move and they'll give me one hundred dollars, well I don't move, one hundred dollars won't help me much, but if I move
well, I don't know, I say, who knows what kind of costs, of values, or things there are for the style, no?  For example a friend of mine told me that in Guam,
the unemployed are payed, something, seven hundred and fifty dollars a month, no?
Hm, um.
But the minimum salary there, for the rest of the population, is three hundred dollars a month.  So what people do there, they say, I work, I'll earn three hundred
Ah, yikes.  Um, um.
if I don't work, I get seven hundred, well I won't work
Um, um.
So it's, it's simple
yes, well, but yes yes yes it's
and so people declare themselves unemployed and so, well, since they can't
Hello, hello, yes hi, my name is Jenny, I'm calling from New York,
ah My name is Mariano I'm in Philadelphia, we are close by
ah, we are close by, yes
how are you? fine Where are you from?
ah, and good And how are you? ah, I was born in the United States, but my parents are Dominicans.
ah, Dominican parents, okay, you I mean speak English and Spanish the same way
mm ah, more or less, yes I feel more comfortable in English, but
more or less
I also, um, mutually feel good in Spanish, but not, as comfortable as in English
sure, in English you feel much more comfortable, with me is the opposite
yes oh, you feel much more comfortable in Spanish than in English
and sure yes since I was born in a Spanish country, where they speak Spanish
oh okay ah, from and from Where are you from?
sure, from Argentina
okay
from Argentina, What do you think of today's topic?
well today's topic is one that, that more or less is something that one always as a kid of immigrants here in the United States always
it has been present ah, this country was created on the back of the immigrants themselves
sure.
but nowadays ah people that are kids of immigrants want to make themselves feel better by throwing back the new immigrants. and I think that regrettably
is a terrible injustice.
ah, yes is an injustice that, that some times I don't understand where it comes from because we are
hello
oh yes, sorry that call waiting one moment
no, no, I really don't know from where
oh, can you hold on a moment sorry, is that is an important call on the other line, one moment I'm going to put you on hold
okay
hello, yes excuse me a moment Hector
hello
yes I'm sorry I was talking with immigration
yes, hello, they are not going to accept the call eh,
yes they will accept it, because it was just a small instance.
ah well, yes that is a, is incredible, no, I can't hear with the dog
yes, well if you want to cancel the call,
no, is that I can't hear with the dog that's why
yes, I took him to another room and they came in now, so
now he is there
yes
ah well no that, that is surprising that there are people that are resistant to foreigners because this country is basically made by foreigners
yes but unfortunately everybody thinks that because two or three generations of their family are born here they stop being from where they are
of course
unfortunately there is much ignorance in the U.S.
yes, right?
we must not allow ignorance follow progress
and yes
every time I hear something of immigrants, I always remember about their parents
completely
they also did an injustice when they stole the land and their way of thinking
we should all be ashamed.
It was a tremendous injustice
the immigrants founded this country.
we can not complain because we are also immigrants
of course, I think that's important and we respect foreigners.
yes
no matter what race they are from, they  also work very hard.
they work without asking for almost nothing
reluctance
Their purpose is to feed their families, and to have a better tomorrow
yes
for your family and your destination.
yea I, I I uh, I really admire them, the me- for example the closest one is Mexican that he's the one that I that there is no, but
yea yea
they're people that leave their families behind and they come here to work in I mean to start to provide for their families here and, and they send a lot of money back and it supports their family in Mexico
really you have to, you've got to respect them a lot, I I think that besides that Americans can be characterized as not working as hard as an immigrant does because, because of what I see.
no, no here the Americans let someone they know do it, whoever their family knows, whoever their fr- friend is
yea, they call it
through friendships, not through work
what they cal-. what they call networking
complete that makes you, I, worse than networking it's more the old boys club yea your dad studied with someone else's dad who has some important position in some company.
that's going to work in your favor to have known your dad they'll give you a job
right yea
and not because you have the highest grades in your class, simply because he knows someone from your family and that's how they help each other out.
yea, yea it's
and, and that's the problem, the, the closest example for me is that my dad in Santo Domingo he was a lawyer to the, when they had a war there
they had a civil war, he left everything he had, it was his family's
yea
good, they had a lot of land, he came here and with everything and his doctorate and his license to practice law, he came here to give us a better lif- a better
a be- a better life uh
yea
he worked as a janitor.
yes, yes, it's terrible, it's terrible
you know that, things like that don't, they couldn't even ah, give him the respect that he deserves being a lawyer and simply just to teach him English and change it, it wasn't easy for him.
no, no, yes
and, and that's why he made such an effort for us to study
yes
and, and we won't stop our careers so that so that we wouldn't have to make the same sacrifice that he did, and still today. There are people that they think that uh, we are less
because my dad wasn't born here.
no it's true for me as well in Argentina it's a little bit like here because that is basically how immigrants are treated, eh there's a lot for example
I would tell you that Italians they're like sixty percent, seventy of the population
yes but they immigrated a lot more to the east coa- Who immigrated more over such time?
the, the one in Argentina you said
yeah
and the Argentinians are mostly from the turn of the last century
yes, yes that's the problem ah
eh yeah
the new immigrants like they say, Mexicans.
sure, that is
ah, the Russians are just arriving, but I find also that cultures are different, because this one Russian woman that, that studies here, it's great that she came here and left her family behind
Don't ever forget that when a friend comes or someone they know they can get them a job
yes, yes, they're never forget
however me being from a Dominican family I've noticed that here there are many Dominicans that when they arrive they make the effort they get a job they get, a good
a good position in society
they forget about everyone
like they forget, yes
sure, yes, yes
they forget that in their town there are some people that are interested in coming, that they should help them, that, like I've never understood that
yes, yes is
no, I don't know how the people so easily forget about the effort
is terr-
and of all that they had to suffer
is terrible
and they don't help them nor do they give a hand to a person who comes
is terrible, is an incredible injustice.
but is an injustice that we ourselves create
yes, yes, yes
you know, no is like another time like I tell you, the old boys network here you know, an anglo person, American or, or from Europe
sees that a person from their town comes and gives him a hand
yes
eh, oh, they give them a job easier than giving a job to a Hispanic person helping one another however we sticking our nose up in the air and we don't know them, let him do the same that I had to go through.
for me, in reality here in the United States I had good experiences with the
and, mm mm
immigrants
mm
or the kids of immigrants that are Americans but that are of Italian origin
mm mm
that I let's say since I have they tell me that I look Italian.
oh, okay
and, and also my last name, and my family is Italian, but I was born in Argentina
mm mm
in general they have accepted me very well and, I mean they have made me feel like part of them.
mm
but because they are Italians, no, even if they speak English, even if they don't speak Italian, like they identify in something.
yes yes yes
I no, eh, I don't know if they are all like that but at least I had a good experience with them for now
I tell you in the, in the where - I've worked in the school system
aha
and I've worked, I'm now a researcher and I've realized that in both careers, and even in my studies eh, I've realized that is not like that with everybody, no.
really
ah, unfortunately I tell you again, I had a school principal
yes
that was Cuban um and was Cuban descendant and got married to a man from Egypt
from Egypt, look at that
and for her, she was not Hispanic, and nobody would talk to her in Spanish.
ah
she changed her last name to a way that she never wanted anyone to call her
she never again wanted to be identified with that
no, no, and, and she was doubly, harder with the Hispanic workers
sure
so, everything was like she wanted to erase that the family came, from Cuba, that her family were boat people when Castro got the people out of Cuba.
yes that's common in the young people, no
no, this was an older lady, this was a lady like
that, that no ah, a, oh my God
when I was twenty five she was like forty forty five
my God
yes she was a director of a school and I was working as coordinator of a program
my God
and she didn't want me to accept Hispanic children into the program, she wanted children with, with parents with high income who for the most part were anglos that are ah
yes
Hi my name is Yolanda
hi, how are you?, my name is Adrian and I live in Toronto, Ontario, Canada
oh, you're calling from Canada? oh, OK, and I like in, in Texas Texas
yes? Texas, in which city?

no I, I was born here eh, eh, I'm from, ah I'm Texan and my mom and my dad also were born here and, we have like five generations that have been here and after that
I think that we are from everywhere,
okay but ah, but they speak Spanish
well, ah, more or less when I was, my grandmother, she, ah she was the last one that spoke more Spanish now the, my relatives almost all of them speak English but
we speak a little Spanish and we understand Spanish also but here we do use English a lot here
but when you went to school, the school was in English, it wasn't in Spanish
yes, yes it was in English yes, aha
and, and how did you learn to read in Spanish?
ah, I don't know, just that
you learned on your own
yes well I, well I don't know, to write my, my grammar is not too good because I haven't, ah, they haven't taught me how well no, no
they taught us how to eh, ah that, the grammar and all that in Spanish, I always learned it in English, but, it's been a
but to be able to know if, a Spanish book attracts you, can you read it or not?
yes, aha I can read it, there are some words perhaps that I can't understand too good but ah because you see, from other countries
some use certain words for something and in other countries in others, ah Spanish that is, ah, that they call Tex Mex is, is Spanish with English and
mixed
yes of everything, yes but I make myself understood and, we can talk yes
I'm not in the, the, , I ask you the question in and eh, obviously here there are immigrants
aha
the, the, something very usual no matter what background the, mm, immigrants are from, but they share the worry about
aha
the, the second generation, the sons born in, in a country with a different native language
yes
from their parents, is that they never learn to speak the native language correctly or
yes it's alright, yes, because my little brothers, well the one behind me, he speaks Spanish just like me, but the two
the youngest two, they understand well but don't speak too well, they know some words
and, what was the difference between the brothers who do speak well and those who don't?
yes, well, me and the brother right behind me, we raised together with my grandma, and she did speak a lot in spanish, but the
youngest two, mm, well my grandma had already died, so they didn't have much contact with her
it's alright, but was that enough? just your grandma speaking to you all day long in Spanish,was that enough for you to learn it?
it was, but
or did you study?
no, I've never studied spanish, ah, just being around my grandma, all the people who talked to her talked in Spanish
and so I learned it little by little, and
because your grandma didn't speak english? was it so?
she knew English but she preferred to talk to the Hispanic people in Spanish
mm
mh, yes, and it was good for me because this way, mm, me and my cousins who are the same age, we all speak spanish, and my cousins better
oh, less, well, they had no contact with her, they don't speak a lot of Spanish, yes, it's very different.
no, no, but the, the, the, it is different, you try at home and, oh, I know a few Hispanic families
aha
that came here, the children weren't born here but they came here when they were very young
yes
and they don't speak Spanish, they can, they might understand it but
aha
only if it's a simple conversation, their dad speaks to them in a language and they answer in English.
yes, yes, yes, what happens is that
and when, when they speak between them, they speak in English.
yes
but oh well
aha, my nephews, man y times, they don't speak Spanish, they speak English and even my own children do, oh because I was married to a oh,
a gringo and he didn't speak Spanish so, how did you ended up in Canada from Argentina?
Oh, how did I ended up here?
aha
oh, oh, it's a long story but basically
tell me a short version
short version, oh
yes, aha
eh, basically the, eh for, for a bunch of, of, of topics
aha
of, of how is Argentina or how is Buenos Aires I think that since little I always had the idea that I was going to end up in another place
aha
eh, I don't know where or, or, or when but the idea laughed a little, the idea kept growing so to speak
yes, aha
ah, I remember that when I left I was twenty eight years old
aha
and I remember that I told my father and told him that well, I'm leaving, I'm going to go live to Canada and he told me
go, well, I already knew and how did you know?
ah
and because, ten years ago you told me I don't remember according to him when I was eighteen I told him, but
aha, wow
no no, I, the truth is that I don't remember when I told him or in
aha
why I told him or in what second I told him but for him it was like he knew
aha, yes
he, mm
and you already had friends or family there in Canada or, or just that place
yes, a, a, a, a few friends
okay, aha
basically in, in reality I was going to go live to Australia
oh
and and, when I was finding out and saw the topic the
aha
some friends eh that, that were living at that moment here in Toronto
yes
told me no, don't go to Australia you're going to talk like the crocodile hunter and I don't know what, and and it's very far
yes
ah, here is cold but is nicer, and I don't know what and,
yes is very nice, I, I, I've gone to, to Toronto to, I went once a few years back and I loved it, it's very beautiful the area of, of that
that state yes
and in, in, in, this moment is snowing
oh,
a lot, so,
aha well so eh, during the cold season perhaps is not as nice us here it was raining the whole day and it was like in the forties
middle forties, but tomorrow is going to be sunny and it's going to
nor the
be in almost sixty and that's how I like the weather
yes I figure that the sun here we won't see until March
until March until March
that's when my wife said that it gets cloudy
yes
that's what's cloudy in, in, in November
aha
sometimes is in March but
yes mm
no, there is where I don't know, the, my, if you want about the topic of the immigrants, my opinion will be a little subjective but
yes, aha
because you were born in the United States, you lived there, how fine that you are an immigrant
yes yes I tell you, what, what topic they give us of, of immigration and of, of religion and ah those topics that, sometimes but I, I think that
if the people ah have a desire to get ahead and, and are good ah, there's so much in, in this country and I think that
also in Canada ah, to to come and make a good life I think, mm
and of, why doesn't anybody want the immigrants in Texas?
well
what, what are those that patrol the border called?
ah
the other time I heard one in the, in the radio the minuteman or something like that
aha the minutemen is that there are a lot of things is, is, ah, they have many reasons and, I understand both sides but also eh is that
ah is that is very hard for the government to maintain, the hospitals and here there's a lot ah, of crime caused by ah, situations like that
many things happen
criminals are just criminals
not all of  them but sometimes the news talk about that
there are criminal that are immigrants
all mexican, yes
mhm, that is not good you know the border with all the drugs it is not very safe and that is not good how can I tell you?
that is not good for the country
something negative like burden
yes it is very hard for the people who lives close to the border. to maintain hospitals and jails
like I told you there are two ways.This is a seriuos situation
we need to have an opend mind to solve all this.
I understand the crime and all that but
mhm
the statistics say something different
okay, yes
90% believes that if the immigrants disappeared
mhm
Texas will have no crime, there would be no crimes
mhm
hello!
Hello!
Hello, my name is Luisa
Hello, my name is Aurelio, from Washington DC
ah, I'm from Miami, Florida
Miami, Florida, ah, how nice
aha, yes, yes
Listen look the topic they put today is a very hard topic, to talk for twelve minutes, is hard right?
Sure yes,
yes,
Very complicated, But Are you an immigrant, do you live here? or, you were born here
Ah, I live here yes, I'm an immigrant, originally from Venezuela I've been here in this country going on twelve years that I've been in this country
oh
mm
a long time, long time, I'm Colombian, it's barely been two years that I've been here
Ah, imagine that
mm
and how is it? how is it going? how did you come here to this country?
I, I mean I came legally, I came with my visa and all but I had to emigrate precisely for that of the guerrilla Because in Colombia, the guerrilla bothers a lot the people that
that are well off and that, and they killed my dad, they killed my little sister's dad
Oh, my goodness, the guerrilla
And then the guerrilla, and then they were threatening my mom, that's why I had to immigrate here, so I came due to political  asylum
aha
and now I am so, in political asylum process, waiting for immigration to respond
oh, listen, it's hot, wow, I came here to study. I came here to study, I finished mu studies and I stayed here
I met my wife here, she is American, and we married, while in the university, mhm. Yes, but listen, never under these circumstances, wow, this is great
yes, it i hard but
yes
Here we are that's what counts, safe
yes, sure, absolutely. Here, at least, you are safe, here at least there is no guerrilla
yes, at least there is no guerrilla
wow, figure. But look, about immigratio I think that, I mean, you can't stop immigration, it's impossible
Specially in a country like this one, that was actually founded by immigrants, you know what I mean?
aha
and second one, listen, that would be impossible, most of the people here have a family abroad,you know what I mean?
aha
so, it would be impossible to stop the immigration, I mean, no more immigrants or rather only immigrants who are somehow qualified, university graduates, that can't be done
Impossible, unfair as well
I mean, oh, sure, right, such an injustice would be unthinkable. Let me tell you, there are a lot of people who would love to do that
Who would love to completely stop the immigration
Sure so
I don't know if
I heard this past days that they were going, that they had approved or were going to approve a law to make a dividing wall between Mexico and, and
Well the border, of Mexico and the United States, something like that I heard
Exactly, yes, mm, yes.
I think that even if they do that the immigration will continue because look many are the Cubans that risk their lives to come here, and many people that are leaving their countries just to get here
Sure, exactly
Is very hard, is very hard of what they can do Starting with that we
yes,
The immigrants are like the engine of the United States how many of the immigrants do the job that many Americans don't want to do like
Exactly
cleaning, yes you understand me, in the hotels, restaurants, and everything, almost all of them are Latins who do the hard work
Sure Is the same here in Washington, is the same thing I mean the majority of the ones that do those jobs are Latins Are Hispanics, especially Central Americans.
People from Salvador, here in the area of Washington there's a lot of people from Salvador.
Oh, here in Miami there are a lot of Cubans
Over there of course a lot of Cubans and Venezuelans also, you understand me But no here the majority are from Central America, Salvadorans especially Salvadorans
And then Hondurans And look the great majority, I have many friends from Salvador And almost all of them have told me that they've arrived, of course they are already legal in the country
but when they arrived, they arrived as illegal immigrants
Sure
yes sir, they arrived like that Like One told me a story one day, something incredible. That he came in a truck imagine that, from El Salvador, they crossed all of Mexico, in a
truck, and they crossed the border here in a truck. They seemed a charge, yes, it's horrible. But let me tell you, stopping the immigration would be impossible
and unfair. And besides, like you say, the engine of, a nig part of the engine of this economy are the immigrants
You remember
Sure
You have been here for, how long? two years, so you were in Colombia when the September eleventh, right?
Yes, I was still in Colombia
ok, well, you know that I lived very, very near, very near of the Pentagon when that happened
yes
Mm, and actually, I spent most of my time there, in front of the Pentagon, and saw the destruction, something horrible. Well, the ones who did that building, that refurbishment of the Pentagon
most of them were from El Salvador
yes
yes, and there were voices for an amnesty for them, for the people who refurbished the Pentagon, to give them the citizenship
different people, but it wasn't approved, OK
I don't know, honestly, I don't know how all that ended, I think they were given something, some amnesty for patriotic reasons and so, but
but I haven't heard back from that, really, I mean, so much they talked about it, and now, I haven't herd back from it
Here they keep talking about that wall you mentioned, that they want to build one wall, but
That is impossible, I mean just figure, spending so much money in that
yes, considering that they can enter by any other side
Sure, of course
or, and no, no, figure, just imagine that they allow no more people entering, what would be of people like me?
That are leaving the country because they are in danger, to where they go the most it's where is the closest, okay one says well to Canada, but in Canada is almost the same, the same.
Exactly.
you understand me
True, true
I have an aunt that she came here twenty years ago, she came by, by Mexico. She first came, she crossed by bus
train, of everything to get here
Oh, imagine
And she came here twenty years ago, imagine she had to do  everything but thank God at this moment she's a citizen she's already an American citizen
She already has all her things in order, but it was like a lot of suffering what my poor aunt had to go through, when she came here
Well I imagine, imagine so many things, twenty years ago she came Things were not like that, so, let's say so tight as they are now,
yes, twenty years ago
Especially with this republican government, because this government Is totally anti immigration despite what they say that the republican governments have always been more of
anti immigration than the democrats This is a disaster Really this is a disaster, listen one thing, and what do you do there in Miami?
what do you work in?
I study, I don't work
Ah, you are a student, a student of what?
I'm a student, I'm finishing high school I mean I finished High school I'm going to start College.
Ah, imagine, but then you are young, how old are you?
Nineteen
If you don't mind nineteen years imagine
nineteen and
I'm thirty five years old, I was going to tell you thirty four, thirty five I'm a musician, I'm an opera singer
really, I study vocal technique
Ah, yes. Ah, how nice. where?
yes, I want to, no, with an independent teacher And did you ever see a program called "voices of America"
of course, sure
okay, Yacke Aredondo the teacher there, oh, she's my teacher
Ah, listen that's good, excellent, I congratulate you
yes  but But now that, now I'm going to study, I'm going to start studying music
aha
I'm going to start college for music, because that's what I want to do, that's my passion and is what I want to do
Sure, And you want to be a singer? or are you going to play an instrument?
Sure, yes, no, I want to be a singer
Ah, Ah, imagine that, I went through that already and that's a career that makes makes very good money when one works right
And is a career very, I mean, you never finish studying that, I graduated it's going on seven years since I graduated from the University
I graduated from the conservatory in Venezuela also
yes aha
Before yes before coming here and Look that's something you never stop studying, I still weekly go to my singing lessons and all
I have to do
And that's something constant
That, that is the word, the perseverance One has to be very, very constant because
But the nice thing is that that is one's passion, what one wants to do, and when one likes it, one studies it however
Sure, true you're right. To what, to what university are you going to go?
I'm going to go to the community college then I want to go but I'm going to start by the college first, which is better the College first
yes, sure
Really the same subjects as the university, only that a little more expensive
Sure, listen look how nice I congratulate you I tell you something, that's another, another area in where the immigrants here are let's say at the head
At the head
yes sure. If you see the great majority of the singers in the opera companies The ones that do the main roles are immigrants, are people that have names
Russian, or Polish, Italian, or Latins Especially in this area you know that here, the opera company, is directed by the maestro Placido Domingo
aha
yes, And he gives a lot of preference to the -To the Spanish singers so, because he is Hispanic also, he was born in Mexico and was raised in Spain
sure
yes, But you see, that's another example of the immigration, you understand me, you can't stop the immigration
mm
guy, it would be impossible Because there are people that come here, just to sing There are some that come and stay, there are some that come
And well, they return to their countries What's more I have a Colombian friend, eh, sorry, Cuban the guy he moved, he went to Venezuela, he fled to Venezuela
One time when the Havana symphony went to play to Caracas and he stayed there in Caracas and from Caracas
He came over here to this country And look You know, that sure, he who comes from Cuba, comes as a political refugee and
sure
They gave him his residence papers almost immediately, and they gave him his papers in less than two months
An incredible thing, look, and what are you?  A soprano I imagine from the voice, from the way of speaking, Mezzo soprano, ah now nice
hmm
and what are you
yes,
studying in music now?  what, what songs?  what do you do?
what songs do I do?  Well, sorry?  I didn't understand you
Like
yes hello?
Hello, yes, whom am I speaking with?
Eh, I'm Lorena. Whom am I speaking with?
Oh Lorena, Jorge's speaking, from Los Angeles. Where are you Lorena?
And hi. I'm here in San Antonio, Texas.
Oh, a pleasure. How are you? Well.
Fine, what a pleasure.
What an interesting topic today eh.
Absolutely
Absolutely
Hot, hot
hot super interesting and you that are there in in Texas, that
That's it. Well, And in Los Angeles too, so much immigration.
Of course.
And so impor-
How far is San Antonio San Antonio more or less from El Paso, what is?
By car, is
Yeah
is approximately three hours.
Is not much. The border is there in El Paso.
It's not a lot, it's pretty close, hm mm.
Yeah. And good and around here more or less, from Los Angeles to El Paso and that would to the border that would be an hour from Tijuana, two hours , it's not much.
A lot closer, a lot closer.
yes, well what a candid topic. Eh the only thing that I can tell you, for example, that honestly as a Latin, eh, it hurts me deeply that it
no it's not my opinion
Hm mm
it's what the president, it's what this government is doing. With
yes
with, uh, with the, the basically the treatment that this government is doing with immigration generally is okay
yeah
When I talk about immigration I'm not talking only about the, the, the, the, Hispanics, in general, for me it's very frustrating to see how
it's that this government is driving the immigration theme, when basically this country was, and is based on the Constitution and the origins eh, was based on the idea of receiving
and sharing, and of, of working and offering opportunities. To put it simply like that, Lorena, in a few words.
So that's how it is. From the beginning, but also currently. Even though they, eh they want to deny it, well, well immigration continues being the motor of the economy
Exactly
In addition to all of the other forces that already have for well for the structure of the country. But definitely I think that migration is a, a source of renovating energy
for good things. Definitely always the the, rich intercultural of the people is a, a rich offering. No? We cannot say that if we have eh, immigrants of other countries that won't we here
eh, receiving them as a positive energy and learning new things and this, well enriching us, hm mm
Without a doubt and it hurts me, I, I, I I eh the bill hurts, it's true. In this moment there are more or less, eleven million
undocumented immigrants in this country. It hurts to see
Hm mm
or it hurts to see that when you think when you are trying to put eleven million in that bag, there can be, you think that, well
there must be some terrorists in that group but most of the eleven million that are here, I think, are human beings that have just come here to
work and to have a better life for them and for their families, if they had had a good life where they came from, the wouldn't be here, they wouldn't have come here
Yes, one is where the money is, and
Exactly
because if you have everything and you are doing okay and you feeling fine, why would you leave?
Exactly, I believe you are right about that, and I also, well, regarding the mistreatment of immigrants, it's different
I feel it has changed, oh, oh, oh, right now I think that Hindu migration is accepted, for example, some ten or fifteen years ago
now, they still reject, lets say, the Mexican immigrants, specially the ones from Central America, no?
That is painful, that's unbelievable.
Like, no, they are hard working people, good people, and if they, oh, if we think about it, I say, I don't think the Hispanics are going to think about it
about doing any terrorist acts, no, it's not part of their culture, of their lifestyle, so,
No,
it's the same story, of all our lives, witch hunt.
Exactly, yes.
They are hiding it by saying that there might be some terrorist among them so lets get rid of the  eleven million, or ten million and ninety nine hundred thousand.
that are left
Exactly, it's unfair that because of a few, there can be, the majority is being, as you said, the ten million and nine hundred and ninety nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety nine,
exactly, I missed some zeros.
have to pay for that. It's terribly painful, right?, and you know that, when was it?, i believe last friday, or the, yeah
when the, the house of representatives basically sketched out this new law project that, uh, basically has the white house approval
that really has an incredible anti-immigrant spirit, did you hear what I'm talking about?
No, no, no
Well, well, i think it was until last friday, in Washington, they finished working on it until late hours in the morning
Right
and they came on friday, uh, uh, uh, the house of representatives, in English it would be the HR, the House of Representatives
Uh huh
Uh, they presented a sketch of law for approval, well, it hasn't been approved, it will probably need to be taken to the senate, but it's, supported at the moment
By, by the white house, which is outrageous. Up until now, those eleven million people are considered to be committing a civil offense by being, being illegal
Well, they are studying the possibility of converting those eleven million people in, that could be a sort of civil offense
to what we in Spanish would call a major offense
yes
A criminal offense
Oh my
being illegal, that is
Oh my
That's a, uh, another, like you say, a witch hunt. They want to rule out that even the settled
Oh, yes, that's it
of illegal people
Born here who have no right to
that, as you say Lorena, what fault is that of the innocent people born in this country
Oh yes
not to have the right
That shows this discriminatory attitude of the government and the society, I wouldn't like to generalize because there are a lot of people in this country
No, no
who don't exactly agree to that stance, but what the hell, always those fundamentalism
Right
Always those attacks against the minorities, against the week, eh, like if they thought this is the only way of showing their power, exerting the power on the
minorities, right?. Oh, it's outrageous, really
Another thing that, ok, basically this plan that the Parliament is preparing and that to that level, to their level
they achieved some treat, is, eh, not to give, not togive the nationality to those, well another thing
I've heard is giving a two year term to, basically to the companies, for them to have the time to check all the documents
and the social security of all their employees
Hm mm
To see what is the real situation of all the employees. Oh! and I almost forget the worse, the worse is
that this new one doesn't have any organized plan for those eleven million to pass neatly to a system
that allow them to legalize, eh, eh, normally. But the
Wow
the most interesting is that this measure to be taken by the Parliament
Hm mm
the house of representatives is never going to be passed by the senate. Well they planned to take this to the senate in February or March but yes, yes,
eh, they expected a eh eh, the people that understand that, and study, that ninety percent
but what
that this bill is never going to be approved
yes it's barbaric. But simply, it's been that
Hi.
Mauricio.
Hi.
How are you? Mauricio.
Ah, How are you, Mauricio, how is it going? Paulo speaking.
Oh, Paulo.
es, How are you? It's my pleasure. Where are you from?
Eh, no, I'm from Panama, I thought that you were Mauricio from, from Argentina.  How are you? I am, I am Jaime, from New York.
Ah, Ah, and your name is?
Jaime.
Ah, Jaime, Jaime, Jaime. Ah, Mariano, you were saying, from Argentina, maybe. Or not,
Mariano, yes, Mariano.
Ah, Mariano, my friend. He speaks all day long
yes.
by phone.
How are you?
How are things going?
Good, gooh, thanks God.
How is it over htere? Cold, no?
It's very cold. Same as there, No?
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, the same here
It's almost the same, we almost have, almost
The whole week below zero and
Well
And well, here we are inside, having a few beers, warm
Well, uh, Christmas is in the air
What are we gonna do about it?, so, well, i don't know, what are we going to do?, do we talk the subject?, a very hard subject, immigration and i don't know what
Yeah, that's a very delicate subject
Yes, yes, uh, let's see, i don't know, that if immigrants are necessary to the United States, well, yeah, i say let it get filled with immigrants here, the United States, well, it's complicated to work, right?
Very delicate, yes, it's complicated, and the problem is that, the problem, i don't think that there really is a, uh, any, uh, immigrants, uh
How can i say it?, a shock on the economy
Right
What they have done is helped, because there really are jobs that the locals don't want to do
Sure
you know?, so, immigrants are needed to shake the... a little bit, uh, how can i say it?
Yeah, cheap manpower, that's what we call it, i don't know how you call it
Yes, yes, for example, uh, a meat store, they don't want to work in a meat store, they don't want to do the, the delivery, they prefer to be in the welfare system to
before doing, uh, a cheap manpower job, like you say, manpower
Yes
Something that, unqualified
Aha
And, meanwhile, the only persons who, who do that are the students themselves, or the immigrants, for
It's the immigrants, yes, yes, yes
For need. So, I really don't think it is any economical problem, it's just competence, it turns out to be some kind of competence. That
eh, about, let's say, when the system, eh, you want to apply, mm, how you call it? when you are unemployed
yes, yes
unemployment, and they send you to look for a job, and you do
aha
of course, you won't talk about that you went to, well, looking for a job to, to a shop to do delivery and so
Sure
But, this jobs, yes, if it was nor for the immigrants, no one would take them
Nobody takes them
Exactly, nobody does them
ye, no, yes, yes, yes. No, I think this gives energy to this country, all the immigrants. Just look, all the food places where the people from Mexico are working
they get paid
Mhm
little money. Well it's alright for them. But they are
yes
I don't know. At least they have the chance to work, that, that, that in Mexico, and maybe also in our country is difficult enough
So. No, I agree that, to me, it is people we need here, eh, it and is good for the country because it is cheap labor. I was working in construction for some time also
yes.
and all that we are working here, it was eh, Spanish speakers, Latinos, or a lot of Africans as well.
Thing that, that the, the national doesn't want to do. You see? Because, he is too strong, or rather too, this
Sure. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
I, What I have, eh, I consider, for example, okay, the them-, the issue of immigration, how it relates to, they treat the amnesty issue of immigrants as it relates to
the illegal flow that comes, comes to the country.
Mhm.
Eh, that yes, they can, they, can control that about the borders.
yes, yes.
The thing is that there is authority, that clouds the vision, for for, because the traffic, also, eh, is beneficial to them. Right? The traffic of illegals,
Sure it is.
and the, the rest of them.
It's beneficial for them, yes, yes.
But, I would have to say that they can make, the authorities they should make, or, or, the government, of the United States, they should have a, a, this
to not say yeah, that's going to be, this, How I say it you? the right to stay here, that they register, taxes
Mhm.
Right? And, that they let the authorities know that, about what they're doing, the taxes that they give. Eh, the taxes that they could generate for the country.
yes.
and, and the help that this, that this could represent for the economy, well.
I think that now that's the plan. Right? I think now, I don't know, they've told me that, that you've already planned to do something like that, to not swindle the people. Or you know, to not give the citizens, to not give them papers, but
but yes they can pay the tax. But, anyway I don't see it like that either, there are people that are working for many years like  that. I have known a lot of people here
that for ten years, twelve years, they've been working and they haven't been give their papers, five or six years working to get papers. And they are people that are very hard workers and been behaving well day after day.
they've got to make it easier to get papers. Right?
yes. Well, I, I think, I think just like you. Right? As an immigrant, I think that these people
And well, in, in, in two, three years, you realize who is good or bad people, if they're a worker or not, and there you go. And then they have to facilitate getting papers. The other day I was reading in the newspaper
yes. yes.
that yeah if they, if you become a Marine, in four or five months they give you your papers
Really?
Yes if you do, eh, yeah you, if you enlist in the Army.
oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
in four or five months they give you your papers. And, a worker, a laborer, that's working, What do I know? Five years and they get get them
Well, well. Exactly.
It's like that, ah
The, the, the system of, for example, the system that you are talking about, they are there, they are going to monitor
Mhm.
to those, to those persona, and about the taxes, to what, to what kind of problem that gets you into,
and, all that. And with this number, you know, this, those people they can also, eh, report something, some cases of abuse
Oh yeah
or, nastiness like that, that they have the liberty, at least, of that, that they're not going to deport them, or, or that
you're going to have, going to have problems with the authorities. But, at least, the authority, they can monitor these people, without them really have the, the, the,
the rights of a citizen, the rights of a, of a, ah, a resident person
yes
But, that is already on survey, I mean, that has something to do with the, for instance, like me, I was working with a person here in the, in the
about abuse, mm, women's abuse
Mhm
Physical ans mental
Aha
In the, in, this same week, in the same survey
Oh, the system, really?
yes, but, eh, and then she led me to believe that she was a M- Mexican, and she led me to believe that she really
was living that situation
Oh
yes, so she told me, but really there are many people who don't report because we are afraid of
Oh, really?
we are afraid of the system because we are illegals
Oh
So, I told her, where are you from? and she told me, no, I am from California. So, alright, I have been in California, I know the amount
of, mm, illegals there
Oh, yes, right?
The working mass, yes. There are too many, too many, far too many.
Too much, yes, I was being told just yesterday
Them he told me, he told me, yes, there are people who don't report because we have immigration problems, and we are afraid, you know what I mean? Then
Sure, yes, yes
so, I say, with this number, with this social security or with this tax ID, or, how you call it?, this situation of the the person being here and payin his taxes,
he must have some privileges, some rights
Aha
but at least, the government is scanning and knows, he knows where, you know what I mean?
yes, yes, yes, it's alright
Because, because just dropping us like this, because there is no, there is no documents, to
to be abused, also. For instance, a friend of mine worked once in a pizzeria, a long time ago, and the man
yes, yes
worked for a week, that week was left in fund, then he worked another week, he got paid, then he worked another week more, he didn't like it much and he only got paid half salary
Mm, that happens often, right?
the thing is, yes, when he quilted
Oh
the man didn't want to pay him for the time he had worked. So he worked almost two weeks fro free
look
you know what I mean?
yes, yes
So, these people have no support at all, no, no, there is nobody who actually watch over them
Who are they going to complain to?, right
yes, who're they gonna complain to?, so, by fear of, of, of being, of being deported, or fear of, of not having the documentation, they don't make the report, you know what i mean?
Uh huh
And, i have found a bunch of cases like that. I have found a bunch of cases
that's horrible
yeah, once, a boy in a, in a discount store
Uh huh
A beauty, a beauty, uh, a beauty discount, um
Right, yes
He worked there, you know, supplying and putting the, the things in the shelves and for, keeping inventory
Right
And suddenly, he realizes that people comes and steal
Yes
Well, i don't know, he caught two guys that were stealing
Yes, yes
He took their articles and he told them, "look, they're stealing from you", and the owner came and "oh", he thanked him, but the guys were waiting for him outside at closing hour and they beat him up badly, they sent him to the hospital
Oh, look at that
Yes, right, so, the owner was the beneficiary, why didn't he do anything?
He didn't do anything
And he didn't, he didn't do anything, so the, uh, the guys took, the day they gave him the beating, they took his money
Uh huh
And they left him there, they left, they had to send him to the hospital because the man was bleeding there, someone found him
Uh
And, and after that, you know, the hospital sent a very expensive bill
Huge, right?, it was expensive, of course
After that, yes, yes, yes, big, big, after that, uh, every pay day, every pay day, they waited for him outside
Yes
And they stole his money
Oh, he had a really bad time
Bad, because of that situation
Look at that
And, I'm telling you, because he was afraid of, of not, of not, you know, not having where to report that, to the police, anything
He couldn't do anything
He couldn't do anything
He's alone
Exactly, do you understand?, if there's one, if there's one entity that can give them, for example, the tax register, that
that can help them with certain, not cert-
hello Vanesa's speaking from San Diego
yes Rafael's speaking from Vancouver, Canada, nice to meet you
how are you? Is it cold over there today?
no it's nice here we've had some very sunny days and the truth that we can't complain this December, it was the nicest December in a long time
ah how nice
of San Diego I don't ask anything because everything is said, everything is said so Vanessa I eh is like saying I'm going to the table and I know there will be good food in San Diego
in other words you've come here already
yes no I was there a long time ago, I remember and very nice I was traveling I was around all of California from the north to the south I went til almost the border
ah how nice what an interesting trip the truth is that the coast of California is incredible
yes yes is very nice, have you been more to the north?
yes I drove a little after San Francisco but I would like to go for sure that's one of my dreams before moving from here
well here I'm here I'm here by the accent, what part are you from?
eh well I'm originally from Puerto Rico
Puerto Rico aha, aha I bet you don't know where I'm from?
Argentina
very good how how fast are the Argentinians identified eh
ah but what a beautiful accent
eh I"m married, I'm married to a Mexican you know
pardon
and she and she, I'm married to a Mexican
ah
and you tell me that your are in love with the Argentinian accent
yes that is true to me from all Latin American accents it is the most beautiful , it truly is
Is it the most beautiful from all the Latin American accents to you?
yes
well thank you very much, thank you very much from my part because we are around thirty seven or thirty eight millions of Argentinians so
have a little piece of it
yes it is very beautiful
and, how long have you been in San Diego?
since two thousand and one
and are you going to stay there a little bit more time or are you
yes my husband is in the navy in the navy he is a sailor
ah he is ah working like in the navy but lets say you are traveling lets say you are like
he travels a lot yes he travels a lot but this is the base where we are now and if God wants we are going to be here until two thousand and seven
ah so after that he could be transferred to another place
yes before being here we were in Louisiana and I met him there
ah Louisiana and from there, from Louisiana base
yes in New Orleans
so what and where do you like most? I think that you like most California right?
Oh much more
and because New Orleans is not a city, I don't know how it is now but
it doesn't compare
no no is very anyway no no it doesn't tell me much as far as the quality of life
no the quality of life is not good but the only nice thing is that of all the United States I find that it has a lot of history, the buildings from the year one thousand
seven hundred, eighteen hundreds
ah yes yes yes
and you don't find that here in California it has many flavors a
yes
very nice city with eh things from when the French and Spanish were there
sure yes it has a lot of history that's true and speaking of history because I heard at the beginning of the conversation that one of the topics, the topic of the day
the topic of immigration
yes,
and I say well I'm also an immigrant so
sure
I've been in Canada for fifteen years
ah
so I'm already Canadian and I travel to Argentina to see my mother my siblings, nieces and nephews but I've already adapted here, I feel very comfortable, I feel
well like an immigrant right?
yes
and I think that Vancouver where I live is a very cosmopolitan city there are many immigrants well from many parts of the world we all share in some way each group with their
oh, its own characteristics, that's what has made him bigger and I believe that immigration in general, we are talking about a certain type of a more qualified immigration cause maybe
sure
there's people that I mean, are criminals all over the world, no?
yes
and that's something but we are talking about people that have a certain type of idea, of progress or of doing something, to plan something
and I believe they can give so much to the place where they arrive and I think that in our case, we all speak Spanish and of course, English of the United States is our second language
and that implies that this is important because our cultures are mixing and people want to get to know the Hispanics and so on, and so on.
and it happens the same thing here, I think, San Diego, how can I say it?  I think they all must speak Spanish, right? It's normal.
yes, many many Mexicans and I, oh, before I moved to this house where I'm living now, I was living in a city that is near the border and I would walk a mile in the beach and
I would be in Mexico and I was embarrassed because we as Americans or the United States, we can go into Mexico when we want and so, it's not
the Mexicans they, obviously can't come in here as they please and I don't like that.
sure, the problem is that all those controls, I'm no expert in this subject but at least, I see that the situation that we now see in our borders
is that there are many many problems and obviously, that's not positive and it doesn't show a good image of us and I think that the United States wants to change that image
to be flexible about not having to live under this psychosis regarding the immigrants because the immigrants, well, in the end, they were immigrants too, the ones that first got here.
to the United States, they were all immigrants.
yes
so, I don't understand why they now discriminate people if I believe that immigrants contribute or I mean, in general, immigration
it doesn't matter where they are from because each of them has its own culture and its own traditions and languages, but in general,
mhm
I believe they bring growth and a supply of fresh blood to wherever they settle, the immigrants.
yea I agree but and I'm an immigrant too right I I understand wanting to have a better life but so even to what point are they going to open the doors to the United States
because in reality people die every day trying to come here because right everyone wants the better life that supposedly we have here in the United States
well even the point that, even to the point that they could open the doors and it's not really going to affect things too much not just our quality of life here but for people that
that come here too like what's happening in Europe now that they're the European Union is opening their doors to other countries and
this is causing lots of problems
no no uhh I think let's say uh everything's extreme let's say I'd say may it's not the the most opportune thing but I'd have to do things with a certain set of criteria and I say criteria because in Canada for example they have the policy
on organized immigration means to uh that there are lots of them even every year there's even a minister of immigration and they could perfectly well do the same thing here. Does the United States have a minister of immigration?
uh yea I know they have different quotas uh I mean different amounts of people that they allow from each country I really don't know how they choose the different people
but that's that's the green card, you're talking about the green card
but yea uh yea exactly
uh well but that's a lottery what you're talking about
well uh uh unfortunately I don't know exactly what the details are about how things work here but I know that some countries just uh
they only allow a certain amount of people to come into the country uh that every year but I don't know the details now with NAFTA
Mexicans can show that they have a job in the United States and they can come here to work and sometimes to live but on the other hand they can't come in
but from other countries I don't know
I mean but but for example if they have, if they get a job and it's and you come into the country it's for the number of years it's been renewed
right? hello?
yea yea yea
it's been renewed they can't they can't allow yea they've already showed they're people who work that they're here because not because of the opportunity, I don't understand
yea no I agree, I agree
I think I think that I think that eh to put this in a state of xenophobia against foreign is not in general good
besides in America that in general is a country of immigrants of a so nobody can say I have not  drink from this water
so in this aspect we would have too to be a little bit more tolerant and the concept is that the United States should have too a policy
more flexible, there are a lot of people I don´t know how many who are illegal
yes
and I don´t know how many that creates too a very serious problem inside so to find a way that those people who already have or are working and have years, those people
they must have rights because they have demonstrated that they came to work and because don´t so they cannot be chased or been thrown away I think that
I think it would not be fair, you choose the place they cannot forbid because at last the man puts the border
but the world in theory belongs to all we can have we could always have access and when we have good intentions, we are persons eh lets say people without criminal eagerness, terrorists or another things
and well I think that there is where they should put the law and that is obviously they are going to give a renew
to approve in all sense so it is possible in any country, any country
yes
can have a better quality and lets not talk about qualified immigrants so people with a university degree right?
yes yes that
that yeah that yes yes I hear you
if not is is is a very difficult situation because I feel that eh I don´t know I really don´t know because somehow I would like everyone to be welcome
Hello, good evening.
Hello how is it going?, good evening.
Good evening. My name, Shaun, I'm talking from Toronto, Canada. What's your name?
ah, how are you Saun? my name is Paula and I'm in Boston.
in Boston, no, I don't know ah, Boston. I've never gone. They say well that it's a city with a lot of history and of
of a lot of culture. Is it true?
yes, yes supposedly, eh supposedly is like that, here is where all the independence movement of the United States started and it's where the pilgrims arrived
eh, so it is definitely a city with a lot of history, and is a very beautiful city also. How is Toronto?
Toronto is, is, look also, well, right now, I'm here visiting. Well, I'm from Toronto but right now I live in Vancouver there in British Columbia
Ah, they told me that Vancouver is wonderful.
yes, yes is, is wonderful but I returned here to Toronto for Christmas, to visit my family
ah
But Vancouver is well is different now in Toronto there's a lot of snow and is very cold but not there in Vancouver.
no?
no,
no?
a little bit of rain and some days of snow every now and then but, usually, it hardly snows there in the city of Vancouver.
mm
But there are a lot of hills, many mountains, where there is snow, that they are only a little bit far from Vancouver.
yes I, eh, knew a guy who was from Vancouver and he would tell me you could go skiing in shorts
yes? I, I don't understand, I still haven't gone yet. But, I think that, well, for example in, in these months, I can't but, they're there, this
for example, yes, yeah if you take a helicopter and you go to a hill where there's snow all year round yes, yes you can go.
ah yes, no, I don't understand what that was with the liquid but all that but here it's more when the summ- the winter
yes, yes, but up high
yeah, umm ahhhh
well, there's always snow, the snow on the highest peaks. But I wouldn't want to go wearing shorts because
yeah
for example, one fall and
sure, not that. No but I think that he's talking about how warm it is you know that you could
yes
ski or
mhm, yes it does, it's warm and for example, for example in Vancouver it's, for example right no like four, five degrees out
But
yes
eh, a little bit of, for example, one hour outside of the city you go up a hill and there's snow and it's like ten degrees below zero out
yes
yes, it's kind of strange how the climates vary, go just a little but, over well, by the mountains and, and, the and the sea, ocean also
mmhm
there's, this eh, variety of climates
Sure. I, And how come you speak Spanish if you're from Toronto?
Well, eh, I'm part Canadian, part Mexican.
ah, and you grew up in Toronto.
and so yes, from here from, from Toronto. And where are you from?
I'm Argentinian. Address me by "you".
from Argentina, ah.
yes, from Buenos Aires.
aha
mm
There's a desert I believe, I don't know if it's in Argentina of is in Chi- Well, there are parts of Argentina that are, is very closed to the border of Chile, right?
Sure, Chile and Argentina share the border, the Andes.
by the aha, that by the south of Chile there are many, there's a desert there called Atacama, or something like that, right?
and, is not to the north?
no? is not the north?
is not, ah is that, mm embarrassing I'm not sure
ah
yes
I worked, for some that went there to Chile to film, eh, by
yes
the border of Argentina, Chile, they were filming the, the sport of kayak
yes
in the I think is called the river. I believe is very well known
ah, talenfu yes
yes, uh, it's
of Argentina
aha, is from a- but they were in Chile.
ah
But I think that the, the river goes by both eh, sides, right? by Argentina, and, and by Chile.
ah
And it looked well
yes
great, that that is the river of, the kayak and of the white waters.
yes, I tell you, the south of Argentina and of Chile is also beautiful.
yes, which is still virgin land. That not, this is not developed.
yes, yes is true. But also as scenery
mm
is very very beautiful.
yes
So man, and we have to talk about, what do you do? what do you work in?
Ah, I , well, I'm I mean, I'm an actor, ah, artist.
ah, really?
yes Well, actor and, and writer so,
yes
I do several plays, commercials, things like that so, for no, no, well not yet a star, but
sure
perhaps, perhaps someday. But just an actor, because that's my, my career.
mm, and what, what, have you acted in lately?
well, ah soon I come out in a play that's called Tony and Tina's wedding. I don't know if there's in Boston one of those plays, it's call-
mm, Tony and Tina's wedding?
the weekends
yes, ah how nice
yes, there's a lot of, of those well, is like the same play but they do it in different places. Maybe there in Boston, I don't know.
sure
And, and some I did a commercial a few months ago and things like that so. To keep on is, is, is a is a, a struggle so, like any other
sure, right? is also a sacrifice
mm, yes, and are you a student there in Boston?
No, well I was a student up to last year and now, I do cancer research.
ah, are you working for John Hopkins or
No, John Hopkins is in Maryland
ah, Maryland
sure
Is Marylan far away?, but it's more or less nearby, no?
eh, no, Maryland no, it's not too close. I think that by plane it must be like an hour, an hour and a half.
ah ah
Eh, from
and you're in Harvard there or
well, yes I'm in Dayna Harvard which is like it's affiliated with Harvard.
in Harvard, ah.
So I've been working there since April and well, happy.

About cancer.
ah, about about cancer. yes
yes So that
yes I- I had an aunt that died of of, of cancer in the lungs
mm
three years ago
mm, I'm sorry.
No, but, ah, well, the most bo- or the best rechers- research that you can do againts lung cancer no sm- is not to smoke, no?
yes it's true, eh, did she smoke a lot?
yes yes, yes she smoked a lot. But never mind. So that eh,
ah
but perhaps one day, well ah, that there are hopes so, for some types of of cancer that
That's why we are working, yes.
mm
And Shaun, eh, I think we have to talk of, of the rent.
yes We have to see, but I don't know, I don't know well, is like they've told me well, the, the organizers of that
of that research that they are doing that is a, is something suggested only, But if, if you want to talk about that
Ah, you don't have to? I thought we had to talk of the topic.
No, is not, is not completely necessary, is for example, they suggest the topic, right? is so that if one doesn't have anything to talk about.
Ah, then you don't have to talk of, let's say, no
yes, if there's nothing else to talk about you can talk about the topic. But
sure ah
they say that is, is only a suggestion.
Ah, well, better. And how did you find out about this program?
yes I saw it on the internet in, in the site of, of Craig's list I think.
Ah, they told me.
You have Craig's list there in Boston?
yes there is.
yes in well in every city there's a Craig's list right? and
yes
and, they said well that they were looking for speak who spoke Spanish and,
yes
only me, I hope it pays. that's the point, you will do your, your twenty-five calls and, mm, then yoy will be left without
I hope not, because I'm talking on my cell phone
nothing
So, I hope they pay
yes, me too. And they said they would pay some extra fifty dollars if you do five calls from five different phones. Did you hear that?
yes I heard that. I have already talked from two different ones. How many did you talk from?
I, it will the fourth, but I'll make the five, for instance I've talked from here in Toronto and my house in Vancouver already. I think I can make the five different places
Sure, yes, I think somehow, and how many calls have you done?
This one I'm doing with you will be number nine already
You are my call number two
Oh, the second one, right?
mm
ah
I just started. I knew through a friend of a friend who had done it
mhm, I see
Eh, but no, I don't know if he had finished and if he had been paid, or how much it takes to get paid, right?
I hope they pay for Christmas, extra money fro Christmas
oh, I hadn't thought about that, that would be nice
yes, me too. Well, but I've heard it takes from eight to twelve weeks once the study is finished
hmm, yes
Until the check arrives. But no matter it has to arrive
yes, sure, let's hope it arrives. Totally
even if it, it arrives
That it arrives just when I have to pay my cell phone bill
yes, yes, me too, fortunately I have a, a phone of, how do you say, how do you sa-, how do you say landline in spanish?
A fixed phone
yeah, where I can talk, but, sometimes I've received a call from, from the cell phone, but it was at night and during weekends, when it's, it's free.
Sure
yes yes
That's the best part. But well, I don't have a
yes
landline. So this is the only way I have
yes, me too, where, where I'm staying, where, in a girlfriend's house, where I am, I'm using her, she lent me her phone, I am
Sure
I make local calls, and, how do you, uh, uh, uh, toll free, how do you say toll free? ah
toll free, I think we don't have those
ah, no?
toll free
no
eh, toll free.
Well toll free, aha.
I suppose. yes, a call, eh free.
aha
Free.
yes and right now is there cold in Boston or is there snow?
There are many - Do you talk about Celsius, right? or Fahrenheit?
Celsius.
Celsius, because  In Celsius, eh, I think we have it is felt like minus seven and there was like minus five
Ah, there is snow too.
is not, eh, no. It snowed when was the last time it snowed? Friday last week.
ah
No,last week it did not, the one before that one. But it was so cold that there is still snow. Then what we have is
a little of snow but there is too much ice.
aha
Then all the houses are covered by ice.
Lets see if, hopefully it will be a white Christmas. Oh, right?
Hopefully. It looks to me that it will not, besides I saw that
Hello, this is Vanesa from San Diego.
Oh, hello Vanesa. My name is Elena and I'm in Miami right now but I live in Boston.
Oh, that's a big change of weather!
That's so true, I just got here and I'm so happy here because the cold in Boston is terrible
yes, I've heard that lately, it's been pretty cold in the East.
Oh yes, we had around eleven degrees and well, not here, my siblings live here and they told me it's cold in here and to me, it's just so good, right?
I, my grandmother lives in Miami and I do like Miami but in my opinion it's to hot.
Sure, it is during the summer, the summer is pretty hot here.
yes, well, I used to live in the South, in Louisiana and the weather there was also hot and humid.
Sure and in San Diego you have like the perfect climate, isn't it?
It's perfect, that's right, it's amazing how pretty it is, right now we have around seventy degrees and during the nights it goes down to sixty
I live close to the beach and we have the same weather throughout the year.
Oh, that's nice,  I sometimes think that, although I have a job, quality life here in Boston is not good because of the weather, right?
Mm, oh, and speaking about today's subject, housing, is housing expensive and hard to find in Boston?
It's quite expensive, sure, you end up living in an old small place with rats. My sister used to live in Boston in a small apartment and the
Mhm.
with rats and nothing, lets say that no, she couldn't have a washtub and spend two thousand dollars
Oh. Oh.
and now here, she lives in a private neighborhood, with two bathrooms, one in each story, it's unbelievable.
yes, it's amazing, here in San Diego it's also like that but I don't know, for two thousand dollars you can get a decent place, I mean, I do think that Boston is more expensive.
Ah, look, yes, no, but the truth that Boston is really expensive.  And I no, the truth, with the topic of today I don't know what to say because
I've been here a year and well, I'm renting and I don't know if I will stay living here, I don't think about buying.
Ah, yes, well, we here, when we came to San Diego, let's say that a house that's two thousand square feel, something for a family of five, pretty comfortable
was about three hundred thousand dollars, and now you can't get, in five years it's gone up so you can't get anything of these size under seven hundred thousand
like the prices have more than doubled in five years.
Ah, yes, I got into, it's amazing how they went up but so, what are you going to do?  Spend your whole life renting?
No, and this money putting it all
yes.
in a credit to buy a house
yes, I prefer to rent because here renting is much cheaper than buying, obviously, the rent is much cheaper and buying isn't on-, I mean
buying isn't only the price, it's the taxes you have to pay and so you have to repair it if something breaks.  I think that it comes out much more expensive
to buy
sure, sure, it's incredible, no?  It's really difficult here, it's really, really expensive
yes but well, you have to pay this, at least here, I know because the climate is so nice and it's such a pretty city, people are disposed to paying this amount of money.
Sure, and how long have you been living there?
Since two thousand and one.
Ah, and where are you from?
eh, originally, well, I was born in Spain and I grew up in Puerto Rico and I'm in Louisiana, in the United states since the eighties.
Ah, okay, ah, wow.  From Puerto Rico so, yes, everything, right
yes.
I talk most to Puerto Ricans.
Are there many in Boston?
I am from eh, How?
Are there many of us there in Boston?
yes, yes, there are a bunch of them, there are a bunch of them.
Ah.
But I say that with this of the telephones, these calls too with the always talked to Puerto Ricans
Ah, yes
but, ah, no, I talked to an Uruguayan I am Argentinian too, I don´t know if you notice it by the accent
yes. yes, yes, I notice it, I have talked with someones from Argentina, from Venezuela, from Mexico I think that one from Colombia. With many. yes, I have been doing this
for a time. And you?
Of course, yes, yes, the true is that it is good, to talk suddenly, right? you get informed about another things, and we earn some money.
yes, yes, it is very, interesting, I have really liked it. And Why are you in Boston?
And I, eh, I made a doctorate in genetics and well, I , I came to make a post-doctorate here in Boston.
Ah, wow.
In an university.
Which one?
In Tufts.
Can you say it?
Tufts University
Ah. yes, yes, yes, yes. Ah, how nice, how interesting, wow.
yes, the truth that
And you don't plan on returning?
And what happens is that I, I've been here a year already and practically no, the climate is not for me. I don't want to live in a place with a climate like that, so
yes, yes, yes.
Boston is not going to be that, I know
yes
later I don't know, I love Buenos Aires my city, my people, but there's no work, and no, and and I already, one here works, is very
easy to buy the reagents and and all and, mm, and over there is very, everything is expensive, and then is complicated to do research and work in what I want.
yes.
But
Well.
Sure. Oh, yes, I hear you.
It's just that, no, I don't know then well and then you are, are thinking of Miami, with your family, perhaps.
And sure, then here, come to a university and since we are here my sister with her husband also are, my nephew, my brother is, so then that's another thing because,
yes oh what happens is, that now I say this, because in summer in Boston is beautiful and the quality of people  and the
no, everything is very cultured and you always talk with someone who studies this, that works
yes.
is very nice, everything super interesting
yes.
but, and in summer you love it, but later it starts the minus eleven degrees, the snow, and that it freezes, that it rains and that and there you remember
how ugly it is, right? and everybody stays home and is a little unsociable, then, the city and the people are sad in winter and
no, it's not worth it to have a good job but to live that way.
No, you're right.
And the houses are small and everything is very expensive for, for everything to be so small dirty, with rats, and how can it be no?
Ah, I didn't imagine things were so bad there.
No.
In that regard.
yes, is that yes, I just rented with a friend an, a very nice apartment without laundry without anything let's say that, ah, I have to climb three floors by stairs because there's no elevator, everything is very old.
yes.
And mm and very nice, in a very nice neighborhood but, it cost us one thousand six hundred dollars
For each one.
and I'm talking of no, no, both, but is an, an apartment with two bedrooms.
Ah.
In the best neighborhood only
For everything fifteen thousand five hundred?
One thousand six hundred.
One thousand six hundred. yes, is a little expensive.
Sure. Without laundry without elevator, without anything. So, but, but well is that one is used to it because is what you see here. You can't imagine that
there can be something better, right? for that money. So then one starts getting used to it, sometimes.
Oh, yes, yes, well, so, then hold on there until you decide what you can do, because you already finished the doctorate and you are doing now in
The post doctorate.
Ah, wow.
Sure, perhaps later already
How interest-
I come here or I would also like to go to California, right?
Mm. yes, is, here is beautiful and there are many opportunities in, in that in the branch of, of
yes.
of biotech and things related to that
And what do you do there?
I work in an employment agency
Ah, look at that.
yes, but originally I was a civil engineer and I didn't like engineering and now I'm working to find people jobs
Sure, the eh, sometimes is good and sometimes no because perhaps someone comes and cries, I don't have a job, no, and it's kind of sad
yes, to me is very sad very, very sad, especially the immigrants from Mexico that come and don't speak English and want to work and don't have the necessary papers and I feel very sad, but is very
is very good when I can find the people a job and that
Sure, sure, yes, sometimes
And is
yes,
And is very interesting, is very interesting and the day flies by, and I like it, and is, I mean, you have to think but you don't have to think that much that I don't get home with a headache.
Sure.
I mean that eh, eh, yes, I like it I'll see if I stay with this, before that, for five years I was teaching.
Ah, and what did you teach?
I taught kids all subjects kids that are home schooled, I would give them Spanish or math classes
Ah.
and I was doing that
Are there a lot of kids that are home schooled and don't go to school?
yes. yes, I home schooled mine for four years
Why did you decide that?
because the schools here are really, not, not so good there's no, they don't provide good education to the kids and there's a lot, a lot of kids who
well, nothing, that I find that the kids are very spoiled, disrespectful and they don't really go to school to learn and I didn't want my kids to be in that
but now that they are in school, they are in a school that we found which is very good and they can be there
Ah, okay and then you would teach them you sat with them an hour a day, that's how you taught them, what did you buy the, the
yes.
book, the same book
yes, yes, and then, eh, I would give classes in my house and other kids also came to learn different subjects, depending and well like that I would make money and they also eh
could be with other students, not just be them only in the house all the time
Ah.
and I liked it a lot.
How fun, yes, that's good.
yes, I learned a lot. I really learned a lot by teaching the kids, I learned more than what I learned in the University, that's the truth.
I always say that the best way of learning is by teaching
yes.
because you have to, you have to understand and think about the questions they might ask so, you end up learning a lot.
yes, yes, yes, not me, I really  like it, all the subjects that I had studied in the University, I learned them and now I can write pretty well, I didn't use to write before
Hello
Hello
Hello, how are you?
hey, oh, hello
hey, we have already spoken right?
I, oh yes, yes, yes, I do recognize your voice, I do recognize your voice
it's good that we get a chance to talk again, oh
you are Juan from San Antonio
exactly, that's right
My name is Lorena
aha Branch
How have you been?
Fine, hey we are now to discuss housing subjects. What do you think? It's a very basic subject, isn't it? It's like they were asking us about food.
or about
Well, yes, what do you think about it? What are the benefits of owning a house instead of leasing?
It depends, I was once told that Jews never buy houses because if you have a lot of money you can lease a big house
for a lot less of money of what would cost you to buy one, build one
Buy one
buy one
aha
no
aha
It is simply a question of money, if you have little money, the impact of the rent on your earnings, on your expenses is very high. If you have a lot of money the impact of the rent is lesser, so that
like always things are relative it depends on the circumstances of each person
of course they are relative to the global income you have, no
in effect
monthly
in a
because it is another illusion to say, well I am going to buy a house and I will take out a mortgage I am going to be paying
well the same that I would pay for a rent to buy my house and I have always think like that like an illusion because anyway I paid and paid and piad
aha
and well in thirty years you would finish to pay the mortgage
in effect
eh, the, the psychological question is always more positive when you say I am paying  for something that is going to be mine. because if you pay a rent there is always the
sensation that you are wasting your money, no
it is like that That could happens but as you say there are thirty years of being paying and paying and paying and if for any reason you fall behind two or three months you lose everything
yes, they can take it out, yes that is such a terrible thing.
then that could be serious, right
hmm
aha the issue turns hard to have a plan
yes, it's, it's a very very serious commitment, if enter enter one and it's also that, no, the largest companies that sell new houses and that have furthermore
their own mortgage company and still no man well they sell you on the house like it's a facility, no, don't worry you won't have to put down a deposit, you won't have to pay closing costs you don't have to pay this, you, you, you enter it
yeah
and even though it's a house that's really pretty big and that at best the payments are going to be high and a pretty big effort for your level
well you enter into it because you're like, like this well deceived by all of the marketing gimmicks that they have you know to sell the house
yeah yes yes in effect that happens yes like always you go with the optimistic outlook that things are going to go great in life and that here the next thirty years are going to continue living and that you won't have any sort of setbacks for the next thirty years
sure you'll have a job, you'll have income, you won't get sick eh, none of this uncertainty for any reason, well yes actually
it's this, it's
well yes
it's double edged sword, right
yes, well it's that anybody could get caught up by this business, I tell you, I always
yes, now on the other hand, in the state of Texas, the price of housing are pretty affordable compared to the other state of , of the union, I mean the United States, not
well this
yeah
well here right now the housing market well it's at a truly impressive peak they are building houses as if they baking bread same house
that they sell I sometime say where are the people coming form that buy so many houses,
yeah yes, it's incredible and that's happening in a lot of places I think there is a large amount of internal immigration and, and international towards here
there's a way that there's a very interesting market for the builders of housing and in general for all real estate. Eh, I imagine for example that like eh
mhm
that's observable, a lot of people come from California and they establish themselves here easily
yes, me too
yes
I have heard that it is at least at half the price of what the houses were costing in California, here in Texas state
yes, I think that, well, I've heard it too and it is much more economic, I mean ,a house here costs, I don't know, hundred and twenty, hundred and fifty thousand, there it may cost
five hundred, I don't know, up to a third part, more or less
aha
so
yes
I guess there is a relation more or less interesting with salaries, with the income you can get in California, because they live much better here, right?
of what they could
aha
living there, and the same in other states or cities
precisely, precisely in these conversations, the other day I talked to a woman from Guatemala who lives in Los Angeles,
she told me that her husband was earning only nine dollars the hour, what means that there is not such a big difference, or that we also have to consider that
there are certain economic areas of the society that are always marginalized, and have more difficulties to reach, ah, those goods
yes, that may be true as well, eh, but well, I think that there is a sector who is in that situation, but I guess, from what I've heard, from other professional areas
in a certain level they earn much more in California than in Texas
mhm
Maybe that person is working-class
yes
unqualified people, I don't know there's a low level of employment and in this case well yes if you get a pretty low salary
yeah
there's no reason for it to be very high, but the professionals they get such a really high salary in California, as I understand it.
well about that question that
and the percentage mhm
and then the question that are making us do they said that there's a little housing bubble here in the region eh what do you think?
well the stats they show that if there is a bubble eh, there is there is a notable increase in prices, fifteen per cent per year in price of real estate
yeah
ah which it isn't a very elevated bubble I think, that's not such a great growth as a high that shot up like what happened in California or New York or other cities
en those well they doubled or tripled in price every year after year in the case here prices they were growing about fifteen percent, to mean that that's an increase
very good for investors, but it's relatively small when compared to other locations, well I guess that some investors  they should of been in California instead of trying to sell something here in Texas
no but it's something important because also the other day
yeah
was reading some news that was indicating that there had been like one thousand almost one thousand five hundred houses available last year that hadn't been sold
to, yes
ah, you know that were here like they had already came the, already, yeah
returning back here
market, it seemed that I no, no, it would be so important as a business but it's not the same situation here in, in this area San Antonio anyway
according to all the forecasters it's going to keep on growing at least for the next four years. Anyway that would seem to yes be good and anyway eh yes if there had been an inflation bubble with the housing prices on a national scale
a lot of people discovered here that this area is growing and is going to keep on especially, because of our region's economy more people are going to keep arriving even though it's so spread out
it go slow, right
hmm, hmm
and it is a growing that will spend another four years not with the actual tendency
aha
if they do not stop it in four years this is growing. that is the point while on average across the country the prices have stopped.
on average, like in another regions, no, that could be growing
hmm, hmm
average How does it looks to you?
well yes, very, very interesting eh, is, however is also very interesting that for example compared to other countries, lets say Mexico eh, the cost of a family house here
is inferior to the cost over there in a country with less economical development, no then this
exactly
well always is contradictory and interesting
in effect it looks like that this situation of the housing this reflex many is a general condition of the economy when in some places it looks like they have lower prices, they have higher
hmm
at last those are surprises. things of the market
hmm
but but as it is said, there are some capitals that define and move the things in a way that they are always try to earn, the big ones, no
in this case I think that well the way the big companies are building here, it means that the signals are, good for the region.
Must always be aware, to see what the big ones are doing so the small ones
yes
ones can do something, mm
on the other hand
James, from New York
Hello, yes, who am i talking to?
James from New York
Oh, how re you?, you're talking to George, also from New York
Hi, how are you?
Fine, thank you, what else, what do you think about the subject?
Uh, first of all, i don't understand what's that bubble that's
oh, i imagine we're the same, i really don't know, i imagine that's like sudden elevated prices or something like that, i really don't know
Um
they, they surprised me with that term
Yeah, because it depends on the area, it depends on what house you're thinking about, in which area, because if you go to
yes
North Carolina, you can find a house for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars, that's a mansion
Um
Right?, if you're here in New York, it's rare to find an apartment there on the Bronx
Um
for that price, do you know what i mean?
Yes, uh huh
Uh, to me it's important to have, uh, like i said, a piece of a house
a property hmmm
or a property, yes, because really with the housing prices going up, and the most important for, for example, for my
yes
that like I told you, eh, after you, sure, after you, after you, indenti- indip-, how do you say?
independence
are independent from your parents or are independent you have, you have to look for a way to find a property, a housing for, and you know when this
what you think changes this has a value and
but like an investment or like
that like, yes, like an investment and to live also because with the prices in New York
the rents
the rent is really expensive
yes, what they ask, hmm
you know, so you have something like a a strong
but what do you think of the costs of maintaining an apartment, a house here in New York
because yes, yes, you start to think you can pay for an apartment we'll put, to say, a price of two hundred thousand
two hundred thousand dollars to say the cheapest, a good apartment more or not in a very good area but two hundred thousand dollars, eh, a maintenance, let's say
five hundred six hundred dollars and we'll put a mortgage that puts you in total and a thousand, five hundred dollars a month.
hmm
between maintenance, the rent right now for this same apartment you will pay around one thousand eight hundred, one thousand nine hundred to two thousand dollars
yes
understand?
mhmh
when you stop paying, the place is no longer yours, you must leave, and find some other place where they will charge you the twenty percent of what you were paying before
yes, I show apartments for a company called Manhattan Apartments
yes
here in New York and let me tell you, honestly, there are no properties for rent, eh, in a good area, a good place for less than
let's say, mm, two thousand three hundred, two thousand, two thousand five hundred, for something decent
yes, in what area?
what you find for less are mouse holes, something that, that is not, is not worth, it's not, it is profitable, but it is not worth it
yes
not worth it, it is not worth it, you know what I mean?
yes, I have seen apartments around here for one thousand six hundred but in houses, almost basements
yes, yes, exactly
this kind of things, and the average for one room is about one thousand two hundred, one thousand four hundred, almost
yes, I
I am talking about Queens, I don't know, in Manhattan it is much more expensive
there there are some on that price, you can find some more, but really, in Manhattan at least, there are no
no in Manhattan it is impossible
there aren't, there aren't, it doesn't exist
we- I have an apartment with an stable rent, but that is really hard to find
aha, Where do you live in what part?
no I live here in Manhattan
in Manhattan yes but that is like
two bedrooms
that as you say is a privilege
yes because next door, the same apartment cost almost two thousand dollars
you see
in the building next door that, that they fixed up not too long ago, they remodeled it
okay
but not the rest, the common, no forget it, if you go downtown sectors like this are very expensive mm yes
yes, so then let's say that you, well that you don't have the luck of having this apartment
yes
you yes you have, for example I managed to get an apartment by the grace of God
hm
eh the apartment right now is valued for let me see, one, two, three, four one, two, three, three times the price that I paid
Where do you have the apartment?
I have an apartment in Iverdale, I don't know if you are familiar with that area, the street is called Lakeview the apartment is lakeview that would be like two hundred sixty four by there
mm yes Yes, the advantage of having a property is the appreciation, really
but the yes, the apartment when I bought it two years ago
yes
I paid fifty thousand dollars for the
mm not but any, any apartment right now cost almost four hundred thousand dollars, no.
right now the apartment yes, the apartment, right now is valued in one hundred eighty
no I think that more, how big is it?
is big is big remember that
yes I think it's worth more
remember that is yes remember that the more uptown you go
mm
the bigger the apartments are
yes mm
then eh, with that
no but with two hundred thousand you don't find an apartment here in New York, nor in the Bronx nor anywhere.
no, no, you hardly can
very hard mm
you can find it, but hardly, no
last four years I think it has increased
aha
tremendously mm
then
tremendously
by you having a property for example you feel calmer that the property is yours
mm
if you have any sort of problem you can put in on the market to sell it
I am, I'm very scared to buy especially in a condominium of a building
you see and get money out of it
I don't know how people respond with the maintenance fees and all those types of things. Because here any repair is very costly, let's say that it gets damaged that it gets damaged
yes
one of those things, if the people are not responsible uh
mm yes but when for example if you have a house at least
mm
that's more more dangerous still
ah no of course and the inspectors and that it is in bad conditions and that
yes when you have a house for example
mm
the oil which is very expensive, a repair like you say
the water
you already when you have a house are every week inside home depot buying and that
yes,
you know you spend money you understand me, when you have an apartment for example the maintenance is fine eh the repairs are done through the
the board
mm
eh, the apartment does have good funds, what you have to worry about is that they don't decrease too fast
yes I think that
and
I think that the key, key here in New York, that's what I've learned, that in my country is very different what I've learned is that if you have a good management
set, but if you don't have good management in that building
aha
you're dead mm
yes you are,  you're right
the insurances
you're right
maintenance obey the construction laws
for, for example a friend of mine bought an apartment also in Brooklyn like two years ago.
mm, yes
and he bought it in fifty thousand dollars
yes
the day he bought it let's say, that the day he bought it, the day of the closing.
business ah
the business yes, the eh came a person from a co- a real estate agent
yes
and come and say that if he wanted to sell the apartment, because he had sold one down
yes
and even, he had showed it to some people, then the other one who didn´t buy it
hmm yeah
got interested and then wanted, was looking for one in the same building
yes
and offered, two hundred sixty thousand dollars
how come
can you believe it, two hundred sixty thousand dollars
yes hmm
aha
right now the same thing is happening, I was reading that in new Jersey is happening the same in New Jersey where the people is selling and the next day the one who bought is wining two hundred thousand dollars
aha, in all, not in all places too because I have a friend
no, no it depends of the area
yes I have a friend in Arizona
hmm, ah it is not that it is very cheap right now
yes but eh
everybody is going there
aha, he, he bought a house in two hundred fifty thousand dollars
hmm
But only bought the plans, you know, of those houses that
uh huh
that they tell you how it's gonna be
Yes, yes, uh huh
And in three, four or five months the house is ready
Yes
Well, in, in six months, the hose was supposed to be ready
right?
And they stalled a little, because re-financing, it seems that people wasn't buying homes a lot
Yes
But when the house was ready
What's it gonna do?
Yeah, he sold it
There, yeah, a lot of people are taking them there, it's very quiet, i don't know what that is
Yeas, and he went to Vegas, he ended up going to Las Vegas
yes
That, with that money, look, with three hundred, i, with four hundred and fifty thousand dollars you get a mansion there that you can't almost buy here, but you can there
Yeah, no, it's very hard here, and you really need to know where to buy
Right, uh
Yes, i was looking at that for two months, but no
For this I tell you, that always, for me it's important that you will make a home, even if at the beginning you are going to be a little bit
because I, I'm going to tell you, if I already have a man with a large family
of course
I grab it and sell the property that
yes
and I go and take this money and put it into a Downpayment or on a large property
yes, mm
then the payments are going to be more comfortable
yes
then anything is going to be more comfortable, I'm not going to put all the money into the property only that I take it and leave it in, leave a
a part in the bank in case of an emergency. You see
of course, to quit, give it
but that if you have a property, that's what I'm saying, like if you have the luck to have an established apartment
it's very economic, mm.
it's economic, but I've seen people that are paying a, look, right now, the hundred, hundred and fifty, there is one, one uncle of mine that his neighbors pay three thousand dollars in rent
if it is going to be, not everything is impossible now
if then
many people are taking to the Bronx because people are leaving because they can't pay
and it's for this reason that the, I mean for Manhattan, we are doing it in Manhattan, let's say right now for, I tell you, for the, the number of people that I have showing apartments
yes
Hello

Hello. Hello, good evening.
Good evening, Aurelio from Washington -DC
From Washington -DC. My name is Sean, I'm calling from Toronto, Canada.
Toronto, Canada. A pleasure, What's your name, again?
yes, Sean.
Sean. How are you?
yes, Fine, it's a little, cold here. There's a lot of snow. That's why I came. Well, I, now, I live in Vancouver, British Columbia.
Aha.
But, I came for, for the vacatio- well, I came for Christmas. To, to Toronto, to visit family here.
Ah, how nice. Where are you from originally?
Well, I'm, I'm from Canada, well, I'm half, half Canadian and half Mexican.
Ah, okay-
And, I was born in Toronto, but I lived in, in Mexico and in Canada, and right now in Vancouver, so. And I came here to, to visit, the race, so.
Exactly. I mean, spend the vacations over there.
yes, and where are you from?
I'm originally from Venezuela, from Caracas, Venezuela.
From Venezuela.
Aha, yes.
They say there are a lot, they say that Venezuela has, is the, the capital of beauty pageants.
Ah, sure, yes, They say is one of the most beautiful in the world.
They said yes, I say that there are, there are, many of them win, right? The, the  Miss Universe, the
yes.
they are from Venezuela but, it is true that many have surgeries to
No, that rarely happens unless she's an actress or something, but, if she's not, then no
Oh.
No, no, no, it might be pretty common nowadays, isn't it? With
Plastic surgery, aha.
yes, well, yes but, no, not so much, yes
Oh.
and so, where would you like to go on vacations?
Well, I, I'd love to go to Europe because I've never been there, I've traveled through Canada and the United States,
O-
and Mexico but not Europe, I still have to travel there, Europe, and always, oh, it's like, oh, well, like they say, it's, it's, it's the old world.
Sure, the old continent, sure, yes, yes.
Aha.
Oh.
I'd like to but, last night I was speaking with one of my friends who was in London
Aha
he was showing me his, his pictures of London and, and,
Did you like them?
aha, yes, It has always, grabbed my attention, more, England, and England and Ireland, also.
Ah, how nice, yes.
yes, more, more than, I mean, also, France and Spain, but more, well, ah, for, for a single trip, it would be too much, to know all of Europe. Right?
Sure. No, yes, I can imagine, mm.
yes.
Well, for me, I tell you, me, I've been in Europe many times. I've been in,
And you?
not too long ago, precisely, two weeks, two weeks ago, we arrived from Italy my wife and I. We spent a week over there. In March we were also in Italy, again. I was in France.
And, I've been in England, also, in London, for example. London I think that it is, the capital of the world.
Mm.
They say New York is. No, no. Not true. I tell you already, that that's a big lie. London is the city.
London.
That's the city of the world.
Ah.
There you see things that you don't see anywhere else. I mean, is something, eh, a city which culture is always awake twenty four hours,
restaurants of all types, people of all types. Mm. I mean, is an incredible thing. It can't really be described with words. One, the people have to be there to,
To know, and,
exactly, to, to see it.
and realize, what it is, so,
Exactly, yes, yes.
culture, yes, I remember being, mm, reading the, the problems they have nowadays in Paris, with the mm
Oh, with the
the, the Muslims, well, the
Sure
But they say, well, that it has nothing to do with being a Muslim, that it is related to, noth- nothing, eh, for instance, kids who have, mm
whose fathers don't take care of them, mm, who don't have two parents at home, and are only into the culture of
violence and rap music, and all that
Sure, mm
And so
yes, well, it's horrible what happened there. Mm, it is a real shame for the French
aha
yes, specially them who, you know, pretend to be an open, peaceful and civilized culture, and look what they went into!
Aha, yes, yes,
yes
No, mm, I don't know Paris either. But, mm, I've heard that, well, that it is just like it looks like in the postcards. Or you see, well, many African people who went there
mm, who went there as refugees. Eh, apparently they are all hidden in the outskirts of the city
Sure. Look, when I was in France, eh, you can see a lot of blacks, certainly. But not more than in London, let me tell you.
Ah
It's the same, I would say it's the same. I, that's what I saw, you know what I mean? Maybe it was my, I mean, I was several days in France, in Paris specifically. We stayed in Paris for more than two weeks
Aha
and I have also been in London for one week. MM, but I think it is rather, mm, I don't know. I think it was a junction of things
of many negative things
Aha
in ,in Paris, definitely. MM, because in London there also many black immigrants. From Africa, specially from the countries where
Engalnd, well, was the, was the colonizer. And the same with France
Mhm, yes
But I think that they are, it is also a part of the problem of, you know, those immigrants haven't had any chances
Aha
You know what I mean? MM, and I think that the English have been, let's say, the only country that has colonized and has let, somehow, that the country's culture,
for instance in India, em, as you can see the Indian culture, the Hindu culture has always maintained
MM, it was never destroyed, you know what I mean?
Aha, yes
Mm, they didn't, the English didn't do like it was done in this country, right? where they really destroyed the so called indians, because here in this country
Aha
Mm, it didn't happen in other countries, no, I don't know why actually. But I think it is a part of the problem that France had
and Spain had, also, when the Spaniards where the colonizers
Aha, so, then
They went, right, they went to destroy Mexico, figure
yes
Mm, and, even nowadays I don't think that Spain makes many concessions to the Latin American immigrants
There are, so, eh, immigrants that go from, from Latin America that go to, to, to live in Spain. Are there many?
See, there are many Venezuelans
Aha.
that have gone there, And, because, well, I have known, in the years after second world war, there were many Spanish that went to Venezuela as immigrants.
Then, of course, that people was set there in Venezuela, had children in Venezuela, business and all that stuff. And then, well, in some way they are related to Venezuela.
Aha.
And, of course, the children of Spanish born in Caracas, or in Venezuela, or in any part of the country, have relatives in Spain. Then, they have to, you know, traveling
round trip. Now, the last I knew was that Spain, now is requiring a visa to all Venezuelans to travel to, to Spain.
To Spain?
Yes, and it was not like that before. Before, ah, Venezuelan citizens could travel to Spain without needing a visa.
Hmm.
And, now they are requiring the visa.
It could be because many of them went there and stayed, or nothing else, well, are there, are there?
I could not tell you. But, that, there are, I come again to that issue, Spanish have not given, lets say, plenty of opportunity to immigrants,
so, to Latin American immigrants. Do you understand me?
yes.
I don´t think so. They have never give an opportunity to anyone. I think because what I see, that Spanish culture is a very closed one, since,
since they, establish as a Catholic State,
Aha.
since the 1400 and so until, until Franco, remember they expelled all the Muslims, all the Jews
Oh your God, aha
all those things
yes
After Franco failure, after Franco was gone, it was when they opened them a little bit.
Aha
But, the same, the culture, I think is still closed. It's not, like English people. Do you understand me? English people is a little more opened.
yes, ah, on the contrary, what's its name? the phenomenon I say, the multiculturalism. This, has worked, has worked against, ah, ah, against the, their, the system in Eng- in. there in England because, also
Right
the, the, the in immigrants remain closed, hm, no, I don't know, I don't know, no, no, there's no, I don't know, there's no, ah, the , what, how do you say?
Ah
They don't assimilate
Aha. They don't assimilate, aha
Exactly, yes
And there it grows, for example, there, there is an example that the, the, the terrorists, there, of Al-Qaeda, have grown there in England that
Aha
they have the mosques there where, where they go and say, well, that that, that is too much, hm, the eh, the, the po- and, and, they take the poverty as an excuse to look for
their soldiers, well, in that war of, of terror, that exists.
supposedly yes, yes, yes, yes. You know what, what other thing I saw in England? Well, that, well, I don't know, but, we, we diverted from the topic a lot, because supposedly they were vacations. But, when I was in England,
well, I discovered that, that there exists, actually, races mix. You know that here in the United States they say we are,
American people say, that this country is a, a blending pot, literal translation, melting pot
Aha. It doesn't matter, aha.
And really, this is not a melting pot, if you compare it with England for example. Here we do have lots of groups.
yes.
The blacks are with the blacks, the Chinese are with the Chinese, the Japanese are with the Japanese, the Hispanics with other Hispanics.
yes, it's the same as in Canada, aha.
Exactly. It's hard to see them mix, do you understand? You watch a commercial, for example,
¡Hello!
¡Hi!
¡Hi!
Hi, my name is Solanne
Hi Solanne, I'm Solanne [Alicia]
Oh, Alicia
How are you?
Fine, thank you, and you?
I'm fine too, here in Atlanta, Georgia
In Atlanta, I'm in the Bronx, New York
There, hell, it's cold there, isn't it?
Yes, yes, yes
Oh, i think so
yes
It's a little cold here, but nothing so terrible
Ok, it's not as cold there as it his here right now
Usually no, i mean, likewise, obviously in the winter it's quite cold
yes
yeah, but for starters, it almost never snows, so that's already good
Ok, i thought i was mistaken, i thought it was the opposite, i thought it was colder, uh, here than
mm
that, there, that here
Ah, no because we are more to the south
But yes, the other day someone told me, no, no in Atlanta is not as cold is like
Sure but also is not as nice as in Florida that like is never winter there, then
Ah, yes, Okay Then the topic we have today is, eh
The trips.
The trips, well
Precisely
Precisely
And now you, Wouldn't you like to go to where is not cold? That's where I would go.
Sure, where is not cold, because I'm from a tropical country, I'm Dominican
Ah, yes so
And I like, I like my heat
yes is true. And there in the, in the Caribbean, how did people live? like there's never winter Right? or no?
yes, eh, never, is never winter, like here there's no winter but is very, very mild only a little cool, a little temperature there but no very little, you can wear normal clothes, what you wear here in summer.
Sure, Good, because spectacular
In fact is not winter, for the winter here, no, is never winter there
Luckily
mm
Yeah, right?, it's like, uh
Yeah, right?
The other place i would like, uh, i would really like to travel everywhere, i have been in China, i have been in Egypt and I've been in South America, in Europe, so
I really love travelling
Oh, yes, that's good
Um, the part i would go to now, i would love to go to Bolivia right now
To Bolivia, yes
Yes, because a lot of interesting things are happening now regarding politics
Like what?, OK
So, i find that very interesting
Ok, ok, i would like to go to a place that's not too far away, because first of all, i don't like planes
Oh, really?
I don't like planes too much, but i would like to know, uh, another place
Uh huh
But that's near and easy, because I'm lazy, lazy
oh, sur-. sure, sure
I like to travel, i like to know, but i don't like
the effort, lets say
No, planes, planes, i don't like them because... many hours
No, yeah, it's true, it's a bum, and, where have you gone that you liked, i mean?
I haven't, i haven't, i have gone to another Puerto Rico, an island that's near Santo Domingo, but no
Sure
Another country, just here, the United States
Oh, yeah, i mean, and you don't care much about planes, lets say
Right, i would like to meet, for example, i have a curiosity with like Jerusalem, those places
Oh, yes
Uh
anyway
But, it's pretty far, and i would like to know Europe too, but i would have to throw out the
Sure
the fear towards planes a little bit
It's true, yes, it's terrible
Yes, my brother has invited me to Europe a lot, he, regularly, my brother travels regularly
Brothers?, oh
In his vacations, he goes to Europe and all that
Oh
And he's invited me several times but
It's not that
I still haven't decided, i can't, i haven't decided
Like if someone invited me to Europe, I'd be happy
Yes, he tells me you're going to love it if you go
And yeah, where does he usually go?
Uh, England
Oh, yeah
He visits several places there, you know, because he does love to travel, he loves it
Yeah, good, to me, the truth, planes do, for example, i go back to Chile approximately every two years because i am originally Chilean and i have family
You're Chilean
Yes, and i have my family there, so every two years or so i go there, but the plane trip is awful because
Since they go through the Caribbean and the famous Bermuda Triangle
OK
There are always horrible storms, so you're there in the plane and the whole plane moves like that, horribly, and, oh, you get very nervous, horrible, like that
¡Hi!
Uh, it's like, I'm getting a call here
Oh, right
How's the temperature in Chile?
It's very good, Chile is something like, i don't know if you know, it's a very long country
Yes, yes
So it reaches many geographical areas, so in the north
Uh huh
It has, yeah, it has a desert that's like an absolute desert
aha
And there's where it's hot but at night is a crappy cold. Because there are no, there are no clouds whatsoever
Okay
to cover, so then there it almost never rains and that's true; then in the the central area is like really moderate I mean there's a like hot winter,
but dry
mm mm
and I mean, not winter I mean summer, summer is really hot and is dry but in the winter is like it rains
mm
and, and is, is like
Okay
will get to zero degrees
mm
Celsius I mean thirty two degrees Fahrenheit but it doesn't, doesn't get too cold but then going more to the south
yes
it already starts to get cold and for example I lived in a city that's near the Antarctic even
mm. Okay
And there it was horribly cold, it even snowed like for three straight months, it's something horrible
Wow
Sure,
Wow
So then there's like everything, that the
yes, yes, yes
interesting thing of Chile, but
Eh, is like Colombia
Colombia
I think that Colombia has, yes it has those, those same characteristics, that it has parts that are cold, parts that are mild, other parts there
yes,
in the mornings is a little cool, then is cold at night
Sure, It must be that, that makes sense. Oh, they say Colombia is a beautiful country and I haven't gone
yes, they tell me is beautiful also
unfortunately
give me a second, give me a second Oh, I don't know who's calling there. Eh, What did you say your name was?
Alicia.

Hello Fifteen years yeah, okay
Then since I was eleven
Oh, yeah,

But then you have travel a lot for your age Alicia
Is that I am very interested in traveling and so people that, have asked me, how do you travel so much, And I, I am the kind of person that
yes
I never buy new clothes, and never buy an I pod and things like that,what I do is to save all my money and
Okay
and then I go on a travel,
Okay, okay, perfect, I do all the oposite
Of course
I buy a lot of unnecessary things
Of course
Like clothes, shoes and stuff like that
Sure
And, and i travel, yeah, i travel a lot, but to my country

Not, not to another place, i go two or three times to my country, i have been there four times this year
Oh, that's very good, and, uh, you have
And yes, i have my family there, i have my daughter here
Uh huh
And all my brothers live here, my dad and my mom lived here and they went to live to Santo Domingo again

Oh, of course
I always go to them, i have been there four times already this year, i wanted to go again in December
Lets see, wow, until Easter, of course
but yeah, but because of the money thing, like i said to one of the questions, if money wasn't a problem
Is true.
I would've gone again to Santo Domingo.
mm
My daughter is going now, to spend the new year, thirty first in December
She's going over there, how nice
She will be over there, not me
Sure, is, is even if perhaps you had the money, perhaps you would even live in Santo Domingo
Of course,
I tell you immediately, if I had money I would live in Chile, I don't
Sure, Sure, sure, sure, nothing like your country, your land If I had money I would live there
Sure, is like that, unfortunately that happens like that But no sure I like to travel I mean the last trip I made was to Egypt, it was last year, it was in June
To Egypt, wow. Egypt sounds interesting.
Sure yes, it was
Ah,
But oh it was hot it was one hundred thirty degrees.
Wow

In the Nile
The Pyramids, all, all the typical stuff
yes the Pyramids, yes that must be really pretty really interesting
yes
You are, are eh, motivating my curiosity
yes, And, and nowadays is very easy to travel, I mean is something of Look it could be I mean well the same, eh, three thousand dollars Perhaps is a lot of money but is not
so much so to speak, I mean one can save up and, and
Okay
you can find a tour to go to any part of the world, I was seeing they were offering some what is it called some promotions for cruises
aha aha
by and, by Asia, South America, by Europe, by all parts and All those
okay
what is it called they were offering ah, For one or two thousand dollars one could be Eh, let's say two three weeks in a, in a ship like that, traveling all over, or Asia, or Europe, or anywhere.
Listen how good, how good,
so is really easy to do so to speak. But is also a matter of time is the other
yes,
For example I have now been, I'm in a relationship now let's say. And, and ah, that's why I haven't been able to travel much
mm yes, yes
For example this year I haven't gone anywhere
Okay, what do you work in Alicia
Well I was working in the Atlanta newspaper before, Atlanta Journal Constitution in what refers to, to Advertising but I quit not too long ago and I started doing things

ah yes
aha accompanied by my family and
why?

I don't know it's been one of my biggest dreams, more than anything because of the history that I've heard, eh
yes I lived there nine years
Pardon?
let's see, I lived in Israel nine years
oh yes,
yes, I just arrived from there, in fact
aha I would like to visit another country which is Spain but sometimes your financial situation doesn't allow it, no
yes
and yes
the truth, you are a believer
Pardon?
Do you believe in God?

And because you would really like Israel a lot
aha
is very emotional for the people I mean all the believers and
mm
for religious people in general

all the religions and the history is very nice
yes it has been one of my greatest dreams to visit Israel, but eh more than anything I'm giving time for my daughter to grow a little more because she's one nine months old
ah how little,
mm
like that she can also enjoy
yes then
and  your daughter was born here
yes it is one of my biggest dreams, and save most of all for a trip of those

only we three live here in a place named Vallejo
an no the truth is that I don´t know it, still not
aha, yes it is very near San Francisco, California
don´t travel if
San Francisco [is also] a very nice place
Yeah, and what are you doing there?
Oh, I'm mostly here because of my family, lets say because of my husband, right?
Yes
Uh huh
Because he had to come here on work
Yeah, on work
Uh huh, and what, what does he do?
So we have had to travel a lot, mostly, we've traveled to Honduras
yes
to Nicaragua
Wow, is it nice?
Oh, yeah, i liked it
Uh huh
Because it's part of Central America, right?, part of my places
Yes, yes, sure
Yes, i did like it, but the places I'd like to meet would be Spain, and Israel, my biggest dream is to meet Israel
And, is there many people from Guatemala that go visiting to Nicaragua and Honduras?
Uh, yeah, there's a lot of tourism over there
Uh huh
hmm there are many tourist over there
And in matter of money, is Guatemala, Nicaragua and Honduras more or least the same currency exchange? Are they similar or is one more expensive that the other one?
the, lempira is the currency of Honduras, that currency is the more
hmm
degraded you could say it is not worth much so
yes
Guatemala´s currency compared to that of Honduras is much better the change
of course
aha and now in Nicaragua the most widely used is the dollar
ah, yes
hmm, it is like in El Salvador, now they changed the currency to dollars and the Cordoba was from there, the Colon now is the
yes I knew that it was like that in El Salvador but didn´t know it was the same in Nicaragua.
aha, lets say that the most widely used is the dollar because it is the most worthy currency, right
of course
hmm
ah
yes so we have four years of being here in the city of Vallejo
yes
one season and to travel after that to travel again, so I have satisfied my wishes of traveling, right
ah good it is fine
but now as a tourist I would like to go to Israel mm
yes eh, ah that, in Israel is nice because there's no winter, I don't know how it is there where you are at but here in Boston is too cold
Here is raining, yes it's already been raining for a week
and in Israel there's, no ah no at least there's sun but is very cold
mm
and in Israel the winter is very, very short of one or two months
mm
and one can travel from April until November that it never rains
oh how nice
it will always be a nice day and is, is very nice and the evenings are very nice also
mm And which would be the place that you would like to visit or how?
and I um think that Polynesia, I don't know it was always a dream of the beautiful beaches
mm
but in the Caribbean, I've also never been there I don't know eh, Guatemala that - The beaches are nice right?
yes there's a lot of eh Mayan culture
yes
mm And what's the obstacle, so that you can travel to those places that you would like to
and and the money and the time
mm
eh also is too far, Australia, New Zealand is too far
oh
so, I don't know if here there are flights eh, I mean if living in the United States you would have to go up to California which is quite far from Boston
mm
and from there a trans-pacific trip which is called
mm
they are very expensive
oh yes is true
those tickets but I imagine that at some moment from here to thirty years when we are old
possibly
yes, when we are retired
oh yes,
And in Guatemala is Antigua?
antigua Guatemala, there are the ruins
yes
there's a place that is called they call it the Saculeu ruins is a very beautiful place but cold enough
yes
there are many ruins, there's a lot of Mayan culture, eh the truth is nice
because I, I read a book from a Chilean writer, Marcela Serrano
mm mm
and it's called Antigua my love
mm
the book and it talks of old, and I felt very much like going to visit, it looks
is very beautiful there's a lot of tourism there, yes everything is expensive, because of the demand from so much tourism and all that
sure sure
everything is very expensive there
and the tourist treat the locals good?
yes
yes
more than anything the ones that visit old Guatemala are the Americans
mm
there you will see Americans with their backpacks, I call them on their back
yes
and as if they were from that place there, very
adapted
aha, yes
aha
aha, and when they see someone dressed like a native they already start taking pictures and they buy the necklaces that they themselves the natives make there, and is very nice
yes And do you miss the Guatemalan food?
no, I make it here, I find here everything they have over there
ah yes you do find everything
yes
ah but how nice, and what
aha I prepare the tamales and all that, eh
ah and the tamales, but don't you need fig leaves? no, not figs, corn husks
of bananas eh we use banana leaf
ah because in the, in the north of Argentina they use corn husk
of banana, I don't know what you guys call it oh
for the tamales
is the leaf, How is that leaf?
is a thin leaf as if it were eh, you know the corn? the corn, that you eat
aha oh is different
is like the leaf that covers the corn
ah okay, yes the Mexicans use that leaf a lot to wrap their tamales
ah well it must be from there then
aha, yes
And, what filling do you put in the tamales?
eh yes we cook the dough and in the middle it has meat, mole
mm
a little gift that I call it
And tapioca? tapioca is like a, like a potato
Oh, that too, but they use it more on the Nicaraguan and Honduran tamal, they call it "nacatamal"
Oh
nacatamal
nacatamal
Right, the Nicaraguan and Hondurans call it like that
Yes, and, does your daughter like it?
I make it a lot here, i mean, i have met, i have met lots of people from different places like that, through the sales
Yes
Right, so, i have met a lot of people through the internet, that's where i travel mostly to places to meet, usually to a place, i still go to the internet and then i imagine I'm there
Oh
Right, so yeah, they're some of the places i would like to visit, and i hope some day god will help me with
Yeah, it'll work out, it'll work out
the economic thing, so that my daughter can meet other cultures, other things, right?, uh huh
Yeah, sure, unfortunately I'm not there, but i could have taken you in
Right, thank you
If i had gone to Israel
Uh huh
And, and that, don't you eat like a special kind of meat, like some chili or...?
Yeah, that's more in Central America and in Mexico, yeah, they  use spicy things a lot
Yeah, and they don't in Guatemala
eh yes but is different the, the way of preparing it with the Mexicans, my husband is Mexican
ah
and I had to adapt to his customs
uh And you like the tacos and those things that they eat in Mexico?
mm the truth is that I'm on a diet, I don't eat a lot but yes at the moment that I ate them I liked them but too much fat
And ah your daughter what do you think she's more Guatemalan or Mexican?
mm no that one is more Mexican than
and will she talk with your accent or with your husband's accent?
I don't know since here they are other customs no, than in our countries
sure
aha
And do they have a big Guatemalan community, where you live?
yes there's a lot by here
mm and
mm I mean that I don't feel so out of place, yes
sure, you have friends from Guatemala
yes, the majority that buy tamales from me
yes that, that's the best, to feel accompa-
yes aha here in Boston I've been like some eleven years
wow it's been a long that you live here in
aha yes I liked it a lot
Have you been living here in the United States a long time?
eh yes I'm going on, twelve like fifteen years already
wow wow yes Boston is, is nice but is very cold
then is cold because the little times we spent there it was too, too cold
yes, yes
we passed by Las Vegas, a beautiful place at night, I liked that place a lot
yes
that since that time, since that time I haven't gone there again until now for the new year we might go to
wow how nice and
ah aha, to wait for the new year over there
And you go to the casinos?
I like the casinos a lot
hm
but all the money, is what makes everything
yes the truth is that I don't like to bet because I'm scare of losing the money
no, no, I'm not the type that will stay without anything because I like to play like twenty dollars, but yes I've always had luck when I play
ah great
aha those two years that they made the dinner for my husband from his job, we've always won, this year we won an organ, last year we won a
yes
-DVD player
wow how nice
I mean that we have been lucky in that But yes, it would be nice to know other cultures, I like a lot that of the cultures
yes and well you have to go to Israel, the truth is that culture is different, is like is a culture like from Middle East, kind of rough
mm mm
eh but the historic places are beautiful
mm
and there's a lot of contrast between each city
mm
in other words one goes to Jerusalem and is a historical culture and
mm
the architecture the city old something that you can't believe
yes and
hello, oh, this is Mariano from Philadelphia
hello, how are you, this is Luisa from Miami, Florida. From Philadelphia, how are you? very good yes.
How are you? Where are you from?
I'm from Colombia, aha
Colombia, you have the cutest accent in Latin America.
And where are you from?
From Argentina
I can tell,  yes, yes
I can tell, yes, I can recognize the Colombian and the Venezuelan accents, those are the cutest ones in all Latin America.
yes
yes, that's nice, have you been in the United States for a long time?
I arrived here two years ago, I was two years here yesterday
oh, two years, I've been here for eight months
oh, that's so recent, oh
so, yes I don't know that much
a bit of time and
a bit, a bit
and but, are you bored, do you want to go back?
not now, I'm studying a Doctorate and a post-doctorate here in the University of Pennsylvania, so, I'm busy right now and I do miss things from my country but some other things are better here.
so, in general, I'm happy.
of course
I made many types of friends Colombians, Mexicans, Argentinians, Uruguayans
oh and you traveled here alone or you traveled with your family?
no with my family, with my wife
with your wife okay, good
yes, yes also we are getting to know a lot, which is precisely today's topic
yes
that we are traveling a lot, there are many places to get to know and that for me is one of the things I most like to travel
I don't know if
travel and what places have you traveled to
look
besides Philadelphia
no and I was in New York, Washington, Boston eh Virginia, New Hampshire eh I was in Florida a few years ago that this this thing let's say I know a little
quite good so to speak I've been in a few places and New Jersey and and now well now for the holiday break that there is between Christmas and new year
eh we are going, I'm going to California
to California
that I have some friends so I'm going to start knowing a little that side over there
sure and what has been the place that you've liked the best
that I've like the best I liked, well I like Philadelphia a lot
yes
But the cutest to me was Boston, it's very nice, yeah, New York is an impressive city, but
and crazy
Boston seemed to me... yes, yes, do you know New York?
I know it now, yes
Yes, that's very... i like it but i think it's crushing
Yeah, like very accelerated, like everything's so fast
If you're, you're in Miami
I love it, i live in Miami, yes
you live in Miami
i live in Miami more or less since i got here
Well, i love Miami because of the weather, the people, i don't know, Miami is very good
Yeah, it's quiet, even though it's a little bit more expensive than other places
Yeah, right?
Because it's touristic, yes
Sure, sure, but i, one of the possibilities i was considering, because i love the weather, i mean, the problem with these northern cities is the weather
that, for example, it's awful in Boston, even here in Philadelphia it's a very tough, very long winter, and i don't know, the truth is that in Miami you're fine the whole year
Yeah, it's cold right now, but it's tolerable and you put on a sweater and that's it
It's... but what's the temperature for example?
Oh, i don't really know what's the temperature
But a sweater and it's done
yes, with a sweater that's it
in other words that eighteen, twenty degrees something like that well
I think that if it doesn't manage to go down it doesn't manage to
well here last week there was a day of eighteen degrees below zero and that you die of cold so no yes yes later
I would like to apply for some position in some university to be a professor or something like that perhaps I would leave more to the side of Florida
ah yes here nice how nice
that is
but that and then as far as today's topic to what place would you like to travel and with whom, tell me
well one with whom with my wife obviously
obviously,
yes I really don't have many options really but
oh with your wife oh with your wife
and with let's say I would really like to go to eh eh what do you call it to Europe
to Europe
yes but Europe it's very expensive but really Europe there's a lot to see eh and then something that I liked a lot that let's say I want to continue to get to know is
all the part of Central America that even Colombia no eh that while is not in Central America faces the Caribbean also but I was in Guatemala, the south of Mexico and I liked it a lot and
and I want to know Costa Rica, Puerto Rico the the Colombian Caribbean which is in Cartagena of India
Santa Marta, San Andres
sure all those places that are beautiful
yes
so you are from Bogota
no I'm from Pereira
from Pereira, that's, where's that?
it's between Bogota, Cali and Medellin
aha
is all in the center
aha, and is it dangerous there
eh no is a small city, is a city that it's barely growing there's no guerrilla by there or anything like that, no
there's no guerrilla
no is a peaceful city
where is the guerrilla, in the jungle
more in the jungle yes like by
more by the side of Brazil so to speak
yes more towards there, more like to the south like towards the amazon and all that
sure, sure, sure and is a big problem right? there in Colombia
yes that's a big problem, every day there you see kidnappings and in the news that they killed such person that they killed the other
how incredible
but thank God with the new president that we have he's putting a hard hand in the country and things are improving.
really mm
I don't know if you've heard that they approved the law so that he could run again as candidate to the presidency and they are going again to well like to re-elect him like that you understand me
of course, of course and and where eh
yes madam no my aunt talked to me I am embarrassed
ah and where would you like to go
I would like to go to Germany
Germany Why?
yes, I don´t know I am so interested in Germany because of the things we hear the Nazis and all that stuff, movies, I don´t know if you saw that movie
yes yes it happens the same to me yes yes yes
the pianist I love it, I would love to go there
there is so much history, there is much history because, I would like to go to Italy because my family is Italian I would like to go around Italy by car
yes I would like to go to Italy or if not go to wait I think I don´t know until this moment I have think of there Germany or or or France
those countries yes well Argentina,

to Chine well I can tell you Argentina it can be very cheap now
with no but it is
Argentina , was devalued, Argentina is very beautiful eh
yes I have never go there
and and devalued a lot against the dollar so going to Argentina now is very cheap and very convenient what do you do here in the United States
I am a student
student
is, I have just graduated from high school I have just graduated
ah, ah you're young
yes I just turned nineteen
ah look, I'm twenty nine

I just, yes, I just graduated high school, what happened is since I'm three years behind
sure and you, what instrument do you like
well, eh, I sing
you sing, ah wow
yes I sing, this is why I want to study music
ah very good
even if obviously to study music you are obliged to learn an instrument obviously
no sure, sure, at least one, no?
at least some, yes, at least pianos, organs, so
yes and you have to think about applying to a place to study music like Berklee, some of these
for now, no well for now I will start at Brawer Community College which is public
aha
eh to do the same credits that I would do in the university but cheaper right? first two years later I do plan on transferring to the
sure
that have a good
sure there would be good for you
sure
sure, you feel like
sure and with that career I can travel all around the world I certainly could
and you probably feel like and feel like returning to Colombia some day or do you plan on staying here
yes no I have the hopes of returning to Colombia but I don't
you're with your family here right?
me yes yes with my mom and my little sister
good
what happens is that I can't leave the country because of that of the guerrilla, I'm here on political asylum
ah look at that
so I can't leave the United States for ten years
and for asylum because, because something happened to your family
eh yes
oh, how terrible
exactly they killed, killed my father and my sister
wow, how horrific
yes very horrific then well
and your dad was in politics
my dad no my dad, my dad
ah
and my little sister's dad was ex-military
mm
then that's why they killed them but well thank God we're already here and we're already safe
well I'm very glad that you are fine my God what a terrible story, the stories of
but I swear to you that I would love to return to Colombia
yes yes I imagine that the people there are so warm right
yes very
although I don't know don't know in Florida but here there are a lot of Colombians
here no here in Florida there's a lot of Cubans
Cuba yes is full of Cubans but there aren't so many Colombians
there are Colombians but not that many
not that many
no
no and the nicest place if you had to recommend to go to Colombia, Cartagena
the nicest place is San Andres
San that's, that's in front of Cartegena, no?
San yes is an island in front of
well the San Andres island because, you know what happened to me several times with Colombians, I said Cartagena and they said no no, San Andres
yes it's the same
that it's prettier
because it's an island so it's like there's more, I don't know, I don't know how to explain it but it's nicer
sure, it's sweeter, San Andres of Cartagena
eh no it's the same
it's the same but well no
it's the same, because they're both tourists so they have the same rates
one day I'll go there
yes,
I hope I don't know, if I get my goal in life, it's to travel everywhere, it's what I like the most, I have a lot of fun
I would also love to travel to Brazil
I've been to Brazil like five times
yes, and how was it, really nice
wow, great, it's really great, it's something that won't surprise you much because you come from a Caribbean country, a warm sea so
it will be different because of the music of the food, but for example a country like Chile or Argentina that has this whole southern part
you will find really different landscapes, you know?  sure
yes, what countries has San Andres, seeing that in San Andres, in Argentina
no and the south of Argentina that's called Patagonia
yes
is eh is very cold is mountainous is is like if you see
Hello?
Hello?
yes, Hello?
Hello.
Hello, Manuel from Orlando speaking, with whom am I speaking?
With Blanca from Arizona
Ah how are you Blanca?
Fine thanks.
Very good, well I'm listening, tell me about your travels
Uh.
and after I'll tell you
Ah well I love to travel.
yes.
Ah, this year I was able to go to places, well, yes, two place in Colombia and Guatemala.
Correct.
I went to Guatemala for a month and two months in Colombia. I'm Colombian.
Ah, very good, me too.
Sorry?
Me too.
Ah, yes?
yes.
From where?
from Merechi.
I too,
Ah what a coincidence.
I'm also from there and I love to travel.  I love to travel, if I could I would travel all the time.
Well we agree on this, what we need is time and money.
And money.  Hmmm.
Because to me it's so relaxing, so revitalizing.
Hmm.
And well, I've been able to visit some countries some cities, as many as I would like.  But here we have the right that I can mention that has really called my attention.
It's one time that I was in our neighboring countries, I was in Ecuador, Bolivia.  And above all, the part of the Sierra.  Eh, Peru, Bolivia, all that.
Macchu Pichu, Titicaca.
Hmm.
This was an unforgettable trip.  And I did it for forty five days.  And then, well there's the beach and all that.  In the Caribbean that's called Granada, some islands.
And eh, there people are spectacular, really really really nice, really honest and the beaches are really beautiful.
yes.
Eh.  Well, before telling you where I would like go to, tell me more.  In Guatemala, for example, where I haven't been, how is it?
Well, the truth is that I say really bad luck now that I went to Guatemala.  My husband is from Guatemala.
yes.
But then we had
That is true.
planned to go to the duenas and all that historical part and from the Mayan culture and visit all that part.
That´s correct.
But we arrived in a season when there was a terrible winter There were many landslides every
Ah of course.
we wanted to go to the ruins eh, that a bridge had fallen, that there was a landslide, this or that. There was always something in the middle.
Ah that was because of the hurricanes season.
Exactly, yes.
Ah, yes.
And and I do visited Guatemala, it looked to me as an incredible place and the
It looks like, yes. yes.
The volcano in front of the city. that is spectacular.
I have seen it at the television on documentaries, that is a beauty.
That is a beauty. It is beautiful. There is a hotel, a very old one that was left as it was after the earthquake and the flood. Because what happened there with the volcano was a a
Ah yes.
that there was a volcano but it simply as in
Like in Colombia it caused a and after that a flood.
like in Colombia. That caused a flood. Because there is not snow at the top but it was
Uh uh.
flooded it was full of water and was like a point
Ah, yeah.
flooding the city.  In such a way that many people and many things were lost.
yes.  And, and the costs too, did you stay there or not?
But it's pretty.
There in the
Eh, eh, no.
Oh.
Since we're close to here, like an hour and a half, we didn't need to.
Ah.  And it's true since your husband is from there you didn't have to pay something, sure.
Hmm, yes, my mother in law, my father in law are living there now, there also North American but they went over there.
how nice.
They were tired of being here,
No, no, these places are beautiful and really nice.
yes.  Well,
yes, yes.
and more, I really know very little, I know Canada and it seems pretty.  Already this year I went to Canada twice.
yes.
Because before moving here I lived in Boston.
Uh-huh, you were very close, no.
I didn't live, yes, we had the chance to come and go and I also have family living in Canada so we were able to go and come often.
Oh and sure, that's the reason why. Which one is the dream of your life, have you been able to make it true yet?
Oh, I wish to go, I dream of going to the pyramids.
To the Great Wall of Chine, or which one.
yes, yes, the Great Wall of China.
Uh uh.
Oh, the pyramids in Egypt. Mm. And then, then, there was
yes.
But before that, I think I wouldn't want to go to the Middle East, they have so much problems there and it seems to me that it's all part of their history.
It's really interesting actually.
yes, yes, yes, yes, I think that that's why everywhere
Greece too. Mm.
that's right, I agree with you, I'm interested in the way in which their people, of course, going to the pyramids and the Great Wall
Uh uh.
oh, traveling to Greece and to the Italian civilization.
Italy.
I've only been to Spain in Europe and there are lots of things to see there but you never have enough time. I'm very interested in Italy, imagine
Time and money.
And Europe it's particularly expensive nowadays because of the exchange rate, right?
Mm.
When i went there i still got the other coin and you changed your dollars the way you wanted somewhere and you got them multiplied, not anymore. Now you take your dollars and they give you less
Yes
Because the Euro is worth more than the dollar
The euro, yes, that's true
So, it's also harder because of that, because the costs have risen, but we have hope, and of the neighbor countries, which one interests you?
yes, i would, i would like very much to go to Mexico, to the Pyramids of Mexico, i would like very much to go to Peru
Uh huh. Yes, yes, they, there's a lot to see there
Yes, and
The south too, Chile, Argentina
And i would also like very much to see the falls of
Yes
of the Iguasu
That, and Brazil too, that's another destiny that
Because i have seen documentaries and there's a point where it unites, I'm not sure, correct me if you know it better than me, Argentina, Brazil and Chile
ad Paraguay, right?
and Paraguay
Yes, yes, in a specific point i think those three countries
Uh huh, and there's, there's a point where the falls are and that looks so beautiful
That's a marvell, it's a marvell because there you have
That immensity, that, i don't know
Each of those is two hundred and sixty six
Um
Little and big, there it's two hundred sixty six separated
Yes
In one place
It's that, i do know the ones from Canada, I'm open and i know  it from both sides and i think it's incredible and nice
Yes, it's a beauty, it's a beauty, oh, and speaking about jumping and waterfalls, i would like to go to the
yes
Salto del Angel in Venezuela
In Venezuela, uh huh
Sure, it's the highest in the world, there's so much to know
What?
So much to know
Oh, so many things left to see, and we lack will, because the only thing we lack is that, will
So much to know, that, no, but look, we're lucky that we get the desire to travel, there's people that don't
Oh, i do
Even having the means, they don't want to
I'm telling you, if i had the way, that would be the only thing I'd do, dedicate myself to know, to know, to know
Me too. Definitely me too, and stay here for a while in every place, no eight days or,
yes
Wait here until I don't want to do it anymore.
yes, sure, in the place that grabs your attention the most obviously.
yes, yes, I want to stay there a month, well I stay there a month.  In the other only a week, only a week.
yes, it's true.
But without worries, no.
yes.  Now speaking of tourism.  We're prone to wanted to always know the outside that we almost never know our country.
Ah, with all the marvels that are here.
yes.
Well, believe me that when I lived over there in Columbia I traveled in the west and on the Atlantic coast.
yes.
I traveled on land to many places.
yes, yes.
But I still missed a lot because I don't know the east.
Aye aye aye and there are many beautiful things to see
I don't know anything about the Llanos for example, I don't know anything about these departments in the east near Alcalde and all this.  Maybe I'll go there.
yes.
There's a lot to see there.  But the problem, you know, it doesn't scare me.
Well sure, there are failures like the failure of security.
Now that this has gotten better and it's scary, so.
yes.
But hopefully, hopefully everything will run.  A beauty, really pretty, and, and, and.
And we also have a bunch of nice things.
And above all playing, it's good to play.
Uh-huh, yes
Well there's a town, a little town, everything.
Now that I went too to play for a bit in the park in the east in Tio Queno.
Ah.
Amazing, we went for a walk several days.  This was great.
This is a marvel, you really like knowing what you say.  That one here goes to play, if there's nothing to do, they're all commercial centers.
No, and here all the towns or the cities are the same.
Exactly and they all turn around the commercial centers.
They're like photocopies.  But I say, and now here that I came to Arizona, and Boston and Massachusetts for example there's a town called Rock
yes.
that's a town of artists and it's on the seaside and is really picturesque.
Ah, it must be really pretty.
It's picturesque, the most beautiful thing, and there's another little town
yes.
um here in California the name escapes me but I went this year too.  It's in a European style, it's like if you were over there in
True, it must be really pretty.  But a question, and why, why the change?
Scotland
Why from Massachusetts to Arizona?
Because of the cold.
Ah, well I also lived in New York yes, that was the cold that I endured, yes.
Because of the cold, because of the cold, I mean and besides here my husband had family and so we took advantage of that also.
And have you guys already adapted?
Well yes, I am, I'm here.
Sure, they say the weather there is very good, very benign.
No no
Well,
yes, during this time by mid-year is very hard. But then it's two three months of unbearable heat, well but
But if one gets in the shade the same because you tell me there's not much humidity.
there's no humidity whatsoever. It's a dry heat.
Ah, that.
you go out and you see the dry vapor.
yes.
but it is tolerable. If you have a bottle of water with a hat you're fine.
Ah look.
That's true. The humidity there in Florida is very bad.
The summer is terrible, is terrible. Around this time is good but the summer is terrible.
Mm. I have family in Florida and I've been there many times and over there I would like
yes.
Hello!
yes, eh, Good evening.
yes, good evening, this is Jorge from Los Angeles, California.
Hello!  I'm Rafael from Vancouver, Canada
wow, that's interesting, how's everything going over there?
Well, here, eh, it's fine, let's say, uh, doing what we have to do.  Every day.  Eh, casually, casually because we have the same, the same hourly usage
So there, it's six in the afternoon there.
Sure, we're eh, oh, it's, exactly, because we're both,
Sure the same
we're both, on the coast, on the Pacific Coast
yes, exactly
Exactly, and, let me say something more!  Let me say something more
yes, of course
You're Argentinian, no?
Well, the truth is that I, eh, it's the third call that I've done in the system, and I'm a little surprised because there's
I'm new, I'm a amateur, but evidently they discover, they find me, I can't pass to the other, to another place.
yes, eh, I'm right, No?  you're Argentinian?
yes, yes, yes
Me too, for this, No?
Ah, also
but of course, yes, yes, yes
But, but, but one moment, but
yes, the, yes the, yes, yes, the, the accent, the Argentinian accent

yes
You have I mean it's a bit mixed Because probably Well, Eh, speaking English, so probably and in a medium maybe, like
Los Angeles possibly, because there is in, in the, in the, let's say the tone, in the color of, of you voice there's a
A small difference from the traditional
Well, sure, but you are right
Now I've been here in Canada for four years, eh
How long have you been in Canada?
Fifteen years
Aye!

Fifteen

you came here?
I was there five or four years ago, I was five years ago in San Francisco I went all around in a car from Vancouver up to San Diego.
Well, where okay, where I really live is in Hollywood of course I know Hollywood
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Well, I, I live basically like six blocks from Do you remember the Chinese Theater?
Let me see, let me see a little that
On Hollywood Boulevard The Chinese Theater,
Hollywood Boulevard, yes I'm placing it
The Chinese Theater is famous
yes Exactly, yes okay
Well, I live six, or more or less eight blocks from there
Ah, well, well, Speaking of Hollywood
Tell me, tell me!
you know You know what Vancouver is now called?
what, what do they call Vancouver
Eh Hollywood North
Exactly because, because basically all the producers from here from the United States many go film
yes
And exactly, much in, they are right.
But,
They are going to film Vancouver
It has been transformed here, what Hollywood proposes it remains as number one, but number two is New York and the third one is Vancouver in this thing
in this moment: it is amazing, I am hmm, I am a tourism guide.
Great! how wonderful, how interesting
And, What do you do Jorge?
I, I basically work in the, the, the, what in English is called Customer Service
Customer Service
Yes,
I
How amazing, Tourism guide.
Eh, going around the city, because I have to work with tours I permanently see in a day three four places that are in the
the buses with all the equipment to film and well
Of course, because it is cheaper.
So yes
It is cheaper for United States producers.
but
Work and film get, everything is cheaper if it is done in Canada
yeah, but there's a catch
¡Say it!
and there are other things, that maybe aren't related. We're not only talking from the dollar point of view, or other, other costs, but
this place, and they go meet the surroundings, it has multiple landscapes in a very near radius, which means that here we have a city
an ancient city, a modern city, a Chinatown, uh, we have, uh, snow, we have mountains, we have forests
That's wonderful
we have rivers, we have lakes, we have beaches, uh, i don't know, something more, i don't know if there's something else out there
it's, it's really beautiful, that
So, that, that
that's very nice
That makes a, a producer call you
Hi, hi, hi, hi ,hi
Hello?
Hello Good evening, how are you.
Oh, good evening, how are you, how are you. Ah, this is Vicente, and I'm calling, I'm speaking from New York.
From New York, ah, hi, we're close by, my name is Edo, and I'm in Philadelphia.
You're in Philadelphia?
yes right here.
Aha, aha, where are you from originally?
Eh, I was born in Guatemala, but, my family came here and I was very young, I was seven when we arrived in Maryland
Were you born in Coronara of Guatemala?
yes
So you have lived all, I imagine all your life here?
Well yes, the majority of my life I've spent it in Maryland it's only been three years since we moved to Philadelphia.
Ah, Philadelphia, aha.
To Phila-
Ah, very good, very good, very good. Well, I'm here in New York, and the strike just ended, we had a strike.
Ah, is true, eh, ye, they were really, like if they had to walk a lot no.
Oh yes, the strike is in New York, which is serious, because New York remember, is not like many other cities, other people
so close so separated, for many that use cars.
Sure sure
Here, here we use a lot of public transportation. Because a car here to park a car in New York, can cost you, can cost you a lot of money
yes, yes, yes but then to have, to have a contrac- if you have a contract all right, you will get paid monthly, two hundred, three hundred
pesos a month
I know
That is what people, most of the people pay for rent, understand?
Oh ,the most
So, it's very expensive, and, and the fines, oh. The fines are really expensive in New York, and they take your
Oh wow
car, mm, if you park in a forbidden place, when you come back, after going into a shop or whatever, be sure that when you go out your car is already gone
Oh my God
It will cost you like two hundred pesos to get your car back
Oh, and where are you from?
But that's life, see. So, we should be talking about, what? travelling
Trips, no, actually I haven't traveled a lot in my life, I think
Me either, I only traveled when I was in the army. You know, and I was a soldier
Oh, in what arm where you?
yes, and it costed nothing, because of course, I was travelling with the army, right?, to some countries in Europe, things like that. But no, when
when I was in the army, the thing was that when you get there, i didn't have much time, I had to be in the army. I couldn't
go out to visit other things, most of the things, eh
Oh
Wait, wai a minute, ok, just a minute, OK
yes, sure, OK
Oh yes
Well, eh
I, I don't work, I haven't travelled a lot, I would like to travel, eh, to other countries in the world, Europe, Africa, and so, Japan, those places, you know
yes, I have, I would like, maybe before going abroad, I would to know a little more the rich and famous places in the United States
Oh, you would like to know more about the United States?
Eh, eh, yes, I would like to know a little more yes, how you call it? for instance, over and above having been to Maryland, and Philadelphia now, well
I know New York, and Los Angeles but not so much, and, how you call it? I would like to know, eh, eh
Las Vegas, San Francisco
Maybe, yes, but rather than the Yellowstone Park, that is in
yes, yes, yes, aha. The nature, I know what you mean, eh, and I, I would like to do a little more of that. Sometimes I go to Miami
but in Miami it's very urban, understand, much of a city. My brother lives there
yes
And the Cuban, oh, the Cuban have, eh, they own Miami. Oh yes, there are so many Cuban, eh, in Miami, and all the business and stuff in Miami
And, most of the thing s depend on the Cuban, eh, because the Cuban, eh, the Cuban were like, eh, they were like the Jewish of the Latins
And he liked money. I am very, or, or , ah, money, right? That's why, eh, Castro started the revolution, eh, because
Cuba, before, had a lot of capitalism, understand?
yes
Very few had a lot, and most of the people had nothing. And then started the communist revolution, understand?
yes yes
And that was what happened. That's why, that's why Cuba left like that, because, you know, since it belongs to everybody
but the, the rest of the country, the other ninety percent don't own their ass
yes, However you would like to visit Miami
Right, yes. Miami, that takes you there, Miami is the, the thing is that Miami, and, and, San Franciso
they have, uh, I had things, like, I had things, like in Latin America, eh. I had trees and things, that, athat are kind of tropical, you understand?
Yes
Eh, like in, in Miami, you see, palm trees and all that. And sometimes, when you see the palm trees, you think
yes
Central America and  Latin America. But there is a lot of that, in Miami, orange trees  and all that stuff. It's like
Yes
it's something very, very beautiful. But I would also like to go out to, to visit Europe also, you know what I mean?
yes, eh, that's what I thought. Now, the part of Europe that probably attracts more my attention is Italy
eh, maybe because when I was studying I took a course on, on Renaissance art
Oh yes, arts, arts, in, in, in in Italian, yes
And, eh, yes, what you call it?, eh, I liked quite a lot the things I saw, I would like to visit some of those cities that are so old
Aha, yes
maybe, eh, eh, see, eh, see for myself what, what I saw on the pictures we were shown
Hm
And get to know
And most of, most of the arts stuff is old, you know, like in, like in Italy or Rome, right?
That's the capitol
Oh, yes?
Uh, sometimes, many of the cars, the big cars, they can't or won't, that, to see the big cars over there because everything's very old and
And the streets are still small, you see
Oh, yes?, i didn't know
Because, of course, Rome is, its if you read or if you read the bible, Rome is't like they say, in the English of, the eternal city.
Oh yes
Uh, uh, do you, do you understand that?, the eternal city, that, that Rome is a city that, you read and Rome is in the bible
And it still exists, you know, the same city exists
Right, right
Lik-
Um, yes, it's very ancient, so much history coming from
Yes, they are, its very old, and sometimes it, the big cars, i don't know, a building, sometimes the, the very streets are
like they're breaking up, sometimes. Because there's, they are always fixing something in Rome
Um
they're always fixing something. We were talking about the Michael Angelo painting, right?
Uh, yes, about the, about Michael Angelo's paintings, the structures that, that, what's it called?, that he helped build, uh, the sculptures that
Donatello, uh, and, and, i would like
Uh, of, of, what's he's called?, in the, in the Church, Chris  thing, Christine, what's it called?, like
the, the Sixteen Chapel
This and that, and I have to, to, nowadays they are still passing it, they are always passing it, day after day. You see, it's years and years
trying to conserve it, understand?, because it's so old. And sometimes, the paint is coming off, and sometimes the chapel itself has to be repaired. I've heard
United States and many countries around the world, make donations for its maintenance, understand?
yes, yes
Because it's so expensive to maintain those paintings. It's just different, the chapel is interesting. They were in the, here in channel thirteen, here in New York, I don't know what channel it is there in
where you are, it's called the public channel
Aha
They were talking about this things. Paintings, and music also. In Spain there are a lot, a lot of paintings, a lot of very nice paintings
yes, I guess Spain is another nice place to visit
Yes, oh, yes. I was in Spain for two days, I was in Madrid, but I didn't have the time to visit everything, museums and all that, eh
I was there for only two days
Wow
yes, um
yes, um
I was in Madrid for two days, also, just like you. Ah, but I didn't visit much of Spain. But there are, in the
culture, Spanish culture, eh, eh, has a lot of Arabic influence
Oh, really? Arabic?
yes, in ,in ,Spain, because just remember, the Arabs conquered Spain for seven hundred years, a lot of people don't know that. For seven hundred years the Arabs controlled
Spain. Until the Cid arrived, remember the Cid? Have you, have you read the Cid?
Aha aha
The Cid, the Spaniard that pushed the Arabs out of Spain. But yes, they kept the architecture and the
painting, the Spanish have many influence from the Arabs
oh, yes
Understand?, yes
I didn't knew that
yes, yes. I saw it, I read a lot about that. It's like, I don't say the word " ojala"
Have you heard any other word that say "ojala", I hope this happens, I hope this is
yes. yes
Well, that's Arab
Oh
That's it "oajalá". That was Arabs said, the Arabs to Alá, he Arab God, right
Yes
and everyone says, if Alá gives me permission of that happening, if Alá wants this to happen
Oh
But, now there is a word in Spanish
Sure there is
But it's witten different in Spanish O-A-J-A-L, something like that, do you understand?
yes, yes
But it's interesting
yes, in reality I didn't knew that
That's really interesting, there are many things that came from the Arab, that are in the Spanish, and the architecture, oh, the Spanish architecture
The architecture is more Arab that Spanish itself
Mmm
Because the Arab had the numeric system we use, the numbers we use now, they are Arab
Sure
And well, many people don't know that the numerical system that the United States and Europe and the whole world is Arab
7,8,9 that's writing Arab
Mmm
And it's really interesting, I would like to visit Latin American, but I have to be careful, there is a lot of crime there
That's the bad thing. Latin America is one of the most beautiful places, but unfortunately the situtaion, as it's now, with all the crime
With all the kidnapping and gangs, well, you don't travel really secure, and visiting all places like before
Can you talk a little bit higher, talk a little bit higher
Oh, Sorry
Yes
Well, unfortunately the crime, the experience is not as nice, when you travel Latin America, so
of being able to
yes, yes
or other countries, I would have done it, more easy. But, why taking vacations if you are worried that something can be done during that time, no
yes, and the thing is just starting, in Panama and other country also, but as I was saying, I talk to so many people
many people from Latin America now, and
Hello, My name is Celiana.
Hello. How are you? My name is Adrian. I live in Toronto oh Ontario, Canada.
There, How are you Adrian? And where are you from?
From Buenos Aires, and you from where?

There, look how near. The first time that I talk with an Argentinian.
yes, Where do you live now?
Now, in reality, I'm vacationing here in Miami. Because my brothers live here. But I live in Boston, near of let's say I die of cold like you.
A little less that in Boston but yes.
yes, eh.
There's a little less snow
I suppose that a little less but the only thing that makes me feel a little better is thinking of the people that live in Canada.
yes, There, that is worse yes more snow also and colder.
There, less you.
is going to be colder.
It is true, it is true too. It is not true. yes, and What are you doing? have you been living there for a long time?

There, a lot, a lot.
Of course. eh?
Many Argentinians? Are there many Argentinians?
No. Not to much. Neither there

Look, how good. Very good.
yes, Do you live in Boston recently?
Me yes almost a year.
There, then yes.
Well, in January I went to live, yes I work too.
Are you happy or do you miss it?
Something.
the milk candy, mate and the breadcrumbed meat?
And I do all that in Boston. And drink more
The mate and the milk candy, yes
Tell me.
eh?
Tell me, what did you said?
The, the mate. I ate breadcrumbed steak and more milk candy.
No, No. Milk candy eats my roommate lets say. I don´t like it very much. I drink mate everyday and yes That is not weird but I miss those moments
the hot That kills me. Weather kills me.
Don´t worry is like with my wife she is never going to get used to that but
Uh uh. And yes, the truth is that I don´t think so because of that because of that Buenos Aires Are you going to come back or not?
That is what makes me, what stops me to think about staying here or not.
yes, but why did you went to Boston?
well, Why did I went to Boston?
yes, Why not to , why not to Miami?
Because I had a good job. Possibilities of
There. yes.
growing and all that lets say but I don´t know if that is better than Buenos Aires with the family and its weather. But now it will be seen, it will be seen.
For now, I am living this that I like, I like where I am now, what I am doing and everything.
Are you happy?
yes. yes. I am Happy. yes, very happy. And you, how are you doing?
I don´t, I don´t have many complaints yes And what I miss most is the food. Eh
yes.
and eh and I miss it almost daily.
Do you miss a steak?
Not, not in a special way, is the flavor eh the, the American plastic food and everything is tasteless or it is to spicy.
Or.
Total. Total.
The, the pizza left my mouth swelling because it is very hot.
yes, did you see that everybody. The world eat practically  too much spicy but I think the spices are meant to sleep the mouth so they cannot feel
the food flavor. Right.
yes. yes. because they get used to it and after a pair of generalization it is a form of but
Of course.
yes. I don´t know how is in Boston, but here in Toronto is like kind of zoo. A
yes. yes. The same than in Boston.
Eh, The, And they complain, I don´t know about the people the Argentinians but many, many nationalities complain about the spicy food and that kind of stuff
At least they are Hindi or Pakistani, for them is good. Another issue with the food, but.
Sure. Um. Irish Restaurant and ask please, no spicy, no spicy and they say, no no? I said no, i said no a bit that spicy
Oh my God, that really gets my head. It's missed a lot. And the tourists that go to Buenos Aires love the food. So it's there when it's good
no?
Why don't they do it here?
Sure. Like that. Like that. I know.
From the from the eh, Is meat very expensive in Boston?
And
Good cows meat or?
There's only one restaurant for example Argentinian that the that if you buy the beef it's twenty three dollars.
Oh shit. Twenty three but it's a motherfucking restaurant in Boston. in the Neighborhood.
And that is like a little restaurant tango it's called Argentinian that it's not in a very nice neighborhood or anything and nothing no, very quiet.
Uh uh. that's good.
yes it's expensive. The truth is that it's expensive. But
He, the they make the grill and it's a good grill.
Ah yes.
but the on Saturdays yes one for two must cost no si sixty, seventy, eighty Canadian
So, ten dollars?
yes. No no.
There. Oh, ah good. It's a bit expensive as well.
yes, but I see that like that. And the the worst is that in the evening they have some Latinos there to singl boleros and
There, really
sing shit, that's unbearable
Yes, well. There are things you have to stand, I guess you too, working from home
No. It's just that I have not working bad in Buenos Aires, and now all that shit, and it was alright
yes
I was fucking sick of it. The overall situation and
Sure
the day in aprticular. But
Sure
I remember when I went to see my old man and I told him I'm leaving, shit, he said I already knew
I asked, how did you know? Because you told me ten years ago, he told me
Oh, really?
I don't remember when it was, but he told that when I was eighteen he started with that 'this shitty country' 'I'll send it to hell' and so
I don't remember but he told me, I guess he did, if he remembers I guess it did happen
Of course he was chewing that for ten years, it was not just like that
yes, it's quite peculiar, but well. Another detail
Sure
he
my sister lived in Boston, my brother there. So I came to visit them, and found this job, and now we are the three of us living in the United States
At the end, I came to visit them in Miami
the cold like this is the truth.
Totally.  Totally.  yes, the truth is that, it's great.  My sister says here, how cold and I'm like no, it's a little hot, how crazy.
But I don't know how it is now.  I don't know, twenty degrees.
twenty degrees as such.  it's it's crazy but it's winter so that's why it's cold.
Do you get to go to the beach?
yes, just got back from the beach.  We were at the beach all day.
yes.
This is good, eh.  The truth is that good, to live like this too.  To me I realize now that winter is returning to Boston and that
climate is really important, people are in a totally different mood.  Perhaps in Boston people aren't really sociable, I don't know but
Hmm.
we Latinos aren't made for this cold.
No the, no this the other topic but I just saw the truth and eh, they go skiing and not in
Sure.  Sure.
It was a culture, on the part of the culture, now we have the culture, and all this shit too, but in this, between this and and
Sure.
be in the car for half an hour to go skiing or snowboarding and pass the winter like this so
No.  I'm going to start snowboarding because last year I skied.  And now I'm snowboard
No, I only skied once in my life.  No, no, no I wasn't very good at sports.
Ah, really?
yes, no, no not with sports.
Oh, look, look, you know, it's the only way I can spend the winter doing something, so yes, I'm going to start snowboarding
You bet
I have a friend, I have a friend who has been living here for about three years, he used to ski in Argentina, but since he arrived he started
yes
snowboarding, and he became psychotic, he goes every weekend. No, no, I know he does go because he is not that simple
good evening Nancy's speaking
yes good evening Patricia's speaking, whom am I speaking with?
How are you Patricia?. I live in New York, in New York.
hello Nancy what country are you from and where do you live aha yes what's your culture, what Spanish roots do you have
eh I'm Colombian, yes
okay I live in Wilmington, Delaware and I'm from Panama so we are neighbors
yes
geographical neighbors
yes yes very true
what do you think about music nancy
well much in many senses unites people because when there's been disasters enters competitions right? and music also relaxes you a lot
exactly
its messages like that
I totally agree, at the beginning of this recording they gave us a quote from an ameri- poet, eh a British poet
mm
ah Long Just that it says that eh music is the universal language I totally agree with that
yes because one suddenly doesn't understand let's say the lyric or something but
is if
but it like reaches one
if you don't speak the same if you don't speak, if you don't speak the same language sometimes is not necessary because if you have music in common you can
so have full assurance that there's communication
yes that's very true one communicates there's no need of being with
totally, what type of music do you like?
I listen to a lot of romantic music
ah yes mommy
yes, and I love Alberto Plaza a Chilean singer, he's a Chilean singer who's all his songs are
I've never heard of him I'm a bad Latin
yes, are about his wife of how much he loves her all he feels for her
ah my God but you are so romantic
yes and now since I have a baby then I'm devoted to listening also to baby music and I play him Mozart and all
aha you've begun, ah how nice, how nice, I like to listen to music
so that he relaxes
eh primarily I listen to whatever is on the radio
yes
I like to listen from reggaeton to classical music when I'm traveling
aha, yes because he doesn't let us sleep so
eh by the highway ah very relaxing exactly right? you forget the stress and everything.
yes
ah I don't  know many of our Latin singer songwriters
aha
Oh, i know more of what's contemporary in the reggaeton
yes
and i know, i also know, in my mother's time, i said Los Panchos
Right
things like that, right?
yes, of all those i know that if i finally get the music i listen to it, but you kinda get melancholic every now and then
oh girl
if you listen to it long enough
um, i like it
yes, that's good, because, lets say, its a ways for you to relieve the stress, you relax and you feel comfortable
no, definitely, definitely
that's the best way you can rest at home
and, and it's also good for, and it's also good for sending social and political messages
uh huh, yes
right?, there's, secretly, in the background they're telling you more than four things
yeah, but, yeah, that's very true, I'm here right now
have you heard any composition or heard our singer Ruben Blades?, uh, Ruben Blades
Uh, yes, right, yes, i love him
well, his career, in his first career he is a lawyer, look, the baby is no fool
right, he knows the, he know what he says
and he writes when there are political situations in our country, he writes songs right? depending on his point of personal view and that's personal
yes about
and look at the things that my daughter comes up with from these musical intrigues
yes yes is very true, yes that's exactly how Ruben Blades sings, mm
Does the same thing happen in your country, that the songwriters, do national songwriters sing?
yes yes they are also singing them that's why I've heard Juanez also
yes Juanez is very famous he's gone to Panama a million times
works, aha yes so he's been in Florida also
and he's very good looking also
aha, how he wants, yes
aha is the one that comes in girl give me your money
and yes, yes
ah for example eh what type of music do you like to dance to?
eh I like salsa and I was learning to dance reggaeton
ha yes ah
because reggaeton it's really hot here
and you think that we could, could music be used to unite people
yes
me too, you know that I eh I read
yes yes
no I'm sorry I saw the television -CNN that they did a study I don't which university in California did a study that the kids that take music classes
in grade school especially when they start young
mm
eh if they learn to play a musical instrument or are involved with the music in anyway for example chorus
yes
that those kids their mind eh eh learn more, they are more intelligent
it develops normally, yes
mm so you already know you that already have a baby
yes
think, start thinking musically
yes I put it and I hum and she gets there and kind of moves her little mouth and I love it
imagine, imagine, imagine the power of music Nancy that makes a, how many months old is your baby?
five months
imagine that the music has the power of making a five month old baby react
mm yes because they immediately come look and
I believe that God gave us the music
yes yes then by that medium, that's an incredible communication medium
it has to be incredible, is incredible and is look that I've been eh saw a documentary about an eh American eh from a relatively famous band
in this country, eh I would say in the seventies he and his band went to Africa
aha
to learn about those of the wrong that, that I'm thinking in English now yes many many of the African drums
well yes ah yes
no?  What we call swing
eh swing, there they're removing itt
aha and so he was put together with a really famous band and I don't know where in Africa they made an album, you saw this combination Nancy, it's look
spectacular
from hell, there's another dark girl too who's called Sade
aha
she's African, her dad is English and her mom is African and she's so cute
a cute dark girl
cute and she has this song, the swing that the woman is, is international
aha and it's from
now from Latin music you think, for example, because I know that in different countries the native music, the music from the countryside for example, no?  Not what you hear in the city but in the countryside, we call it
yes
what we call this in Panama, ah, what it's called in Colombia, you, cumbia
the cumbia
what they hear, what they hear in the countryside in the little towns
hmm now I don't remember
they hear everything
yes, yes they make a mix of all the music, of everything
oh typical, typical music
aha
typical music which is completely different from the one you can hear and dance in the city
yes, absolutely, and to them it is something completely new
but, despite that, despite that, see how it is opening, and that amazes me because I think much of it is in the culture, it is very important if you don't have
culture, you are almost like a beast
yes there is much of the person in that
and music, and music has a lot to do with that, it's involved and even, for instance, the singers from the inside like we call them
that have come up, and are now listened to all over the world, just figure Panamanian from the inside now being listened to in Europe
I had never heard them
can you imagine that?
yes because I had never heard about them, where did that come from?
right, right
yes
and it's something tat, to me, to me it's a wonder and it affects me in a very positive manner, sometimes it makes me, like you said, melancholic, right?
aha yes because it's like, look it's nice, it's not too late for them
oh, but I don't want to hear those things
yes ,yes, because here came Carlos Vives last year, and when we went to buy a ticket it was too late
I can't believe it
and you go, God we noticed too late!
he goes to Panama every once in a while
Carlos Vive yes, he comes here, is the first time I hear he's coming, not in New York
in Miami it's the first time, ah in New York ah the first ah so that tells you
yes
that they are seeing his musical geographic field.
yes
he started right? in Colombia hopped over to Panama, Mexico, now he's getting in the market and look let me tell you music is a huge business.
the video production and all that, it's big business there's money
yes yes because at least they would tell D'yankee
like crazy
that a boy was asking him that how did he do it to get the money
exactly and PDiddy, P'Diddy
and yes yes he would say, he would say singing counting with
multimillionaires my love
aha
but they are, look I act eh I do, I do the eh part in back what people don't see when they are watching movies
aha
and ah is very hard the other day I had the opportunity I wasn't forced because when they did the feature film eh the feature film it seemed that the audio was poor
mm
because there was enough money for one or the other but not both so then I had to go
ah
had to go to do the audio
to do everything well, oh, oh
at once, speaking at once and I saw, no?  I will tell you girl, this is hard and so I started thinking about people who are doing this musically
when you see them in the video recording in a studio
yes because they play
you know what this takes
and they play record and record many times and there are stops and
and and it has to be, it has to be, exactly Nancy
yes if they make a mistake there they give
you know I thought, I thought that the trick was to learn to read my lines to see the la la la ti ti tin pa pa pa
and finish and
I gave myself an end, I said look girl, I think it's going to be a half hour of this
Oh my god
and I did this for two hours
like, it took you double what you
aha, no it took them
yes because the truth, you imagine, no for them it's easy to get in a recording studio
Hello, good afternoon
good afternoon, Marcela, whom am I speaking with?
Hello Marcela my name is Niky, nice to meet you
hello, nice to meet you, where are you calling from?
I'm calling from Florida, and you?
I'm in North Carolina
ah, well not to far
not too far, no, no
no, are you Argentinian?
yes, I'm Argentinian, and you?
ah, I'm from, I'm Dominican
ah, look, the first Latin person I met who was not Argentinian, that I met in the United States when my parents emigrated was a Dominican lady
yes, oh really? how nice, how nice
yes, yes but I haven't met many,
I've met many Argentinians, that's why when I heard your beautiful accent, I already knew
ah, thanks,
yes well, what do you think of music?
and, I love music
me too,
and it seems to me that while people listen to music and dance they don't fight, isn't it true?
it's true, yes
So it's a good thing, that of, that you can, uhm, I don't know, we export enough music and still fight each other
yes, sadly, I, I love music when I was a little girl I thought I'd be an artist, but I don't have the talent
ah, yes
I buy a lot of CDs, and, there are a lot of movements in many countries about music and bringing peace, I've seen
for example, in England with Africa
yes
but, I haven't really seen a deep change, sadly
no, no, and I also think that this, uhm, this exporting music thing, it depends, I mean, music doesn't export itself
yes
and then, when you have big companies like the ones in this country
yes
then, there's a lot of music exportation, the music that, that's made here
yes
and not all the music, just the super popular music
yes
and the super popular music is super popular because these companies are selling it and pushing it, and they have money to promote
yes, yes
then, uhm, other music from this country, or from another country that doesn't have the, the money behind to promote it and
and export it, it's not listened to or exported, we have, we have to
yes,
to be like an archeologist, looking for something new
yes, unfortunately yes, I've heard that many artists, when I listen to them, in a concert or buy a CD, they are part of small independent companies because they want to
have some freedom, I mean, to make their own music and not be part of a corporation, it's hard for them, really hare
yes, yes, yes, yes because these people, they live, I mean no, these people, they don't have the, oh, contracts with big, big money, these people, well
they work, for every, they work for every penny they get.
yes
what type of music do you like?
I love all kinds of music, I mean, specially, I don't know, I'm not old enough to say music from a
mhm
I mean, like,if I tell you, for example, I collect music by Carlos Gardel, I mean
oh, you do?
that's before my time but I love it, I really love it and also music from the thirties, forties, ballads from the fifties, all kinds of music, I studied music, so, as I said, when I was little I thought I would become
oh mhm
well, I also collect classical music, merengue of course
yes
but, all types of popular music, in Spanish, in English, all types, I really, really like it, I mean, I do find it hard to listen to hard rock
but sometimes, there are some rock bands from Spain or South America that I do really like, so it varies
yes, yes, yes
and well, I also like jazz and I don't like, you know, rap is very popular among young people
rap, yes
and I think that music is very violent, but sometimes there are young people that are, there are artists that so, that are playing but they have positives messages for the youth
yes, yes, yes
but because of that it changes, and you?
the question is to try to understand, I don´t understand them, but I think that it is because of my age too because I am fifty one years
ah, yes
and then this is what, not to me, I don´t know, my mother is like, I like it, so, I like every kind of music, but
my younger son who is seventeen years old, he loves to hear music
yes, oh yes?
old, music from the sixty and the seventies and he, he loves the old rock, and
wow, that is unique for that age
and, but from very young, he was a little one and he liked to hear rock from the fifties, and he knew the lyrics
oh, yes?,
and we don´t know how, so I say that in another life, and now he plays the guitar, he is a guitar player and
how good
he plays classic, plays jazz, plays blues, plays everything but to me, I don´t know, sometimes to hear music from my era, you say, ah yes, I remember that, but constantly
it bores me, is like that, I have hear that, it is over, I was,
yes
Do you understand me? or it has to be much more - something more, older than me, or this, or something that is happening now
yes
eh what happens is that my husband is also a musician, he, he
oh, how nice
eh, plays, eh, piano and writes, and then
listen, how nice
then I tend ah, ah, to listen to what they bring, is rare that I bring something home, sometimes, sometimes I find something and I, I bring it, if not
What are you listening to, what are you listening to? and, and, I listen to what they listen to and especially my youngest son, I like all the weird things that he
sure, sure
that he brings as long as they're not old things
yes
but it would be, I don't know, it would be a good thing for the music to bring peace, but
yes
no the truth is I haven't seen that, I mean, we can look at, at, at Bono from U2
yes that's why I think of him, yes, he tries, but I don't see
but is not necessarily I mean the music, and it gave him fame, and it's the fame
yes, yes is true, is true, yes
what he is using to, to achieve what he's achieving, I mean, is not that he went over there, played a song and the people were transformed
sure, sure
you understand me?,,e
but at the same time, I also think there's someone from your country that is, I'm forty two years old and discovered well discovered this singer already,
in the eighties and she perhaps you can tell me if she inspired people in the seventies and it's Mercedez Sosa
ah, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes she really, ah, inspired people, inspired people who were against
eh, the military
sure
ah, she w-w-was an inspiration so they could continue with the work that they were doing.
sure
so, against the military, so, hmm, eh, yes, this woman is a barbarian, I, you have to know that I was born in fifty five and I've lived here in the United States since I was nine.
wow
and I've only returned to Argentina in seventy one when I was sixteen in eighty five, when I was thirty
and now, we went with my husband, eh, the summer of two thousand four
wow how nice, you've really seen the different stages of your country
yes, yes, you can see, you can see the difference
interesting, I don't know Argentina, bu- I've traveled a lot and I also grew up in the United States, in New York
it's- hmmm
ah, and I came really young, so I completely understand
yes, it's a, it's a rare place that we're in, because we're not from here but we're not from there,
yes, I call it between two worlds
like, you know?  and yes, yes, yes that's it
or more, be- between many worlds
yes, people sometimes ask me and I, what do I know?  It seems to m- I like being in this situation, because it seems that we can look at the world with a very objective eye
yes I agree, I agree
this, I mean, we can as Americans look at our American culture
yes
and, and really see how it is we function and at the same time we can look to our countries from, where we came from
yes
and since we have that idiosyncrasy because we were raised by people from that country
yes, yes
eh, also understand that is, in them, that we also are
yes
how that works and how it is - why that doesn't work
yes
I don't know, and sometimes I get in trouble with people but
I like how you say it, I agree, because like that we have the power of like choosing choosing, things
yes
that one really. I understand it is part of oneself, but things that are also perhaps not for me I think many times I've visited the Dominican Republic but many times I think
when I go there is a much smaller country than yours and one, well I feel it's really hard for the professional woman, I'm an attorney
mm
and, it's such a small country, although the city is big, my family comes from Santiago and it's a city of a, a million people, but
even then you really can't, is like the rest of Latin American where you really know the last names is a society thing, what family they come from, and
ah
and, is, there one feels, like the duty of the family more than in the United States, it's a much bigger country, one can choose his
His profession, and is not, is not hindered the duty of the family and the woman and all that, I don't know, I can choose, I can say, yes I love merengue, I like Spanish it's a part of my soul, but besides that I am a professional and I'll stay in the United States
and so I choose music as well
no, it's just that I, I think that also in a small country where the purchasing power, the power of menoey
has a limit
yes, yes, yes
virtually, do you understand? so, if ,if you come from a rich family, the you can have more money, but if you come from a middle class family, since the country is so small
yes
you have no chance, I mean, once you have sold to the hundred people living there, you can't sell any more
yes
you sold already, so, in a country with a bigger population, there are more opportunities because unfortunately, money talks
yes, yes
then it doesn't matter what class, eh, or what family, right? not even what class,or what family, or what's your name, because
eh, what matters is if you, if you can produce and make money for me
yes, yes
understand? and then since there is many people among whom I can choose, then everybody has the chance to stand out
yes, sure, sure
that's why my, my dad, in Argentina, Argentina is such a rich country, and he says
yes
the difference between the United States and Argentina is one zero, we have a little more than thirty million inhabitants and the United States have almost
three hundred million
yes, yes
and that makes a lot of difference and we will feel it, the power and the monetary powers will move to
Hello
Hello good evening. How are you?
Hello, How are you? I'm Alicia
what yes I'm Ever I'm calling from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Where are you?
ah, Philadelphia, I'm in Atlanta, Georgia.
ah okay, we are still in the, in the east coast no
yes, yes precisely here is quite hotter that in Philadelphia
how nice, how nice oh, yes, you are more to the south, I suppose you have good weather, we are here putting up with the cold, though today is not that bad, today is like forty degrees
really ah, it's good in Pennsylvania is colder, how funny.
But we are awaiting some snow this weekend, I think
Really, just in time for Christmas, how exciting.
it would be nice a white Christmas like
sure that's never happened to me, in fact.
yes
yes, never, I've never had snow in Christmas.
you haven't seen snow
yes, yes I have, I mean, when I've lived
white Christmas
but never for the twenty fifth of December it never snowed so then bad luck
well, the topic seems to be the music, no and
yes, the music, exactly
music helps unite different societies or different types of people, no?
mm I think so, yes, no, only because there have been revolutionary or cultural movements in which music has played an important role for that movement, for exampl
in Cuba, the troba, Rodriguez, Pablo Milanes and all those people, oh, the messages, the political motivation through music.
It's like in the United States with the hippies, right, music was a fundamental part of their
their movement, their messages, so the problems is that nowadays, people listen to stupid music that has no meaning, the songs are, by the way
very boring love songs, I'd say, so, sure, this music has no message, so, obviously it doesn't unites people,
it creates a space between them instead of uniting them, do you understand?
yes yes nowadays the music is based in romance, relationships and not in
Sure
there are no political or controversial
Sure
between the Hispanics I know, maybe Ricardo Arjona
Arjona in some way yes, but he's too posh for these things, but sure, Arjona has a
yes, well
oh he does have political messages and all of that but he's more general, he's not a revolutionary like Silvio Rodriguez, it seems that
maybe, he's older or was a bit older, how can you say it? Well he is less idealistic and he has more existentialist subjects, I love Silvio Rodriguez and one time
I went to Mexico City to watch him play, it was fantastic, I was eighteen years old and I went to Mexico, Mexico City just for three days to watch them play.
wow, was it good?
Oh, it was excellent, he had some really good new songs, really good ones, the guitar, oh the music, he played the violin and the guitar, so
I´m interested in technique, and I noticed that his style had, had changed. Uh, uh, the guitar was more, was less "folk-styled" than in the seventies and now
definitively more guitar
wow
hmm, yes. And you?
I´m not that talented in the artistic sphere, I have no talents
What? oh
I mean, I do appreciate music a lot, and I like, I like espcially the ones that have a message
Sure, good messages, I mean
eh
instead of
I think you´re right when you say that in our history, in crucial times, music has been important
Right, exactly, and now, well, music is always the voice of a generation as well
yes, you´re right, eh
What kind of music do you like to listen?
Well, generally I like, oh, Hispanic music, most of all, Latin music
sure
it has more, uhm, kinds
But for
more emotion, more passion, but, how do you call it? but, I also like americ-
But for example, what kind of Hispanic music? Latin rock, or more like .. I don´t know, cumbia, ranchera, more like, ballads, I think they´re called, what style do you
I really liked the Salsa
Salsa, yes, it's true
Salsa, I think it's my favorite, how is it called, after that, I really like Arjona's music, I really love it
Arjona is really good, really goof, I remember
And now there is a rhythm really fast, but
eh
is reggaeton, but sometimes, the messages from that music are not necessarily the best
What kind of music is reggaeton?
yes, the reggaeton, have you heard Daddy Yankee, Daddy Yankee?
No
Daddy Yankee
No, I don't listed, hello, hello?, what happened?, that's weird
Hello, I don't know there was some kind of interference there
Yes, that's weird, I haven't listen, Yankee dale, it's his name?
it's called Daddy Yankee, also well, Don Omar, Tego Calederon, Ivy Queen, They are the most known inside that genre, it's like Reggae, but, it incorporates something from the merengue, some house
Oh, it's really moved
yes, yes
So, it's nice to Dance, it's entertain, I'm into listening Juanes at this moment
Oh, yeah, Juanes, he has a little nice music, and well, he has some messages in his songs, right?
Excuse me?, yes, but generally only humor and I can listen some romantic and then, I get bored, because, there must be something more in life
so, in a way, I do like Juanes' songs, specially because they have rhythm and he has a wonderful voice, I mean, I love how he sings but, after a while it gets boring
you know, I'm dying for you and all of that, do you understand, I mean, it's a bit
corny, isn't it.
sure, it's corny, that's right, I had forgotten about that word. Hey, where are you from?
I'm from Guatemala.
Oh, Guatemala, that's interesting, I'm from Chile
Oh, you are from Chile, okay
you know, there are some good Chilean rock bands that I really like, I don't know if you've ever heard of Luz y Vela (light and candle)
No, no, I haven't heard of them but yes, there are lots of bands, South American groups, Rick, that are very good, right
Like the Petineli, have you heard of them?
No, no, I haven't, there's a group called, I think it's an Argentinian band, it's called the Mosca (the fly)
Oh  no you haven't heard them, those must be kind of new, right?
I don't know if they are new but they have nice music.
The Mosca, is that Rock music?
it's kind of, yes, it's like Rock but oh oh, yes, it's similar to Rock
I'm going to have to listen to them, there was an Argentinian group that I really liked, the Suite del Garabat, that was the name, it's very, very, the music is like
it's entertaining and it's now in Chile too, the three, I loved that group, I don't know if they still play but they were very good in the nineteens.
Do you like American rock?
even, I do like it, in general terms but the old American rock, for example, music from the sixties, Bob Dilan, oh, British bands too, Pink Floyd, I loved the Doors, that type of old music, I love it.
and now
And the group, the group Queens?
Queens they're good, yes also, from
And Creedens, the group Creedens?
Queens, I never liked queens because I don't know is the same as the stones /foreign, I never liked them too much.
no
For some reason.
for a group that is more a little more modern, but that was good, was Guns and Roses I don't know if
Ah, Guns and Roses were very fun but they did have music like heavy
yes, but also they sometimes had romantic ones and they were very good.
ah, sure, like that one, yes I remember the video even the November rain but well, or also that song called patient that song
I don't know I loved that song
And do you like the group Mana?
Mana are also good, I haven't heard it much but what I've heard I like, let's say.
is, very, quite good Mana
They are more, like laid back yes, from what I've heard. But oh at least
mm Not necessarily, they have
no
The last angel of love Well is not the last but is one of their newest.
recent ones ah that will be faster perhaps oh
Are there a lot of Hispanics in Georgia?
Yeah, plenty, they're usually like, uh, I'd say people from Mexico
Uh huh
But also a lot of people, there are allegedly three thousand Chileans in Atlanta, um, and a lot of Brazilians too
oh, yes
there's a little bit of everything here, it's very interesting
i knew a boy that was from Atlanta
Yes, oh yes
Yes, we met at a University we were in, West Virginia, a few months ago, and... what's it called?
Um
uh, he told me he was from Atlanta and told me it was a pretty diverse place, but i didn't really know
Oh, yes, there's even a Hispanic newspaper publishing, i mean it's like
from the Hispanic world, how much?
Hello! Good evening, How are you? My name is George, New York
Hello! hi, my name is Paulo, I'm here in Philadelphia
Okay, how are you Paulo?
Hello, how are you? how is it going?, good, Where are you from?
Fine, fine, what did you say?
What country are you from?
Ah, Colombian.
Ah, from Colombia
yes, And where are you from?
Ah, yes from Argentina
Ah, nice to meet you
Aha, how are you, man what music you listen to there?
Good and Music!, music from my country, I like salsa a lot,
Ah, yes
a lot the ballenato typical music from Colombia
Ah, you know what's more typical.
yes, I don't
And the reggaeton is from there Right?
the reggaeton also now the latest because you have to be in fashion
I don't like it, do you like it?
And I was last year there in Venezuela and I have 25 yo daughters, 20 yo, 19 yo, 18 yo and they like this
They loved it
They learn yes, and what music do you like
yes, I like, I listen to National rock, which is Argentinian rock
yes, tango
And I also have, yes many tango also, and well, other music called Samba, which is more like country music
yes
From the country, in Argentina, so, most than anything else, Tango and National Rock
And from here, do you like any
from here?
some kind of music?, yes
No, not much
Oh
Not, really, I'm not that
You don't like any
Not really, I don't have idea, of what's being listened recently, I mean, I stayed with music that
yes, from our countries
From, yes, it seems that happens to all of use, did you when when they are
Mmm
Once I got here, I started to listen more music from each country, many people said me that, Chilean, Mexican, they told me that
that this had happened and able to listen to international music, when they were in their countries and when they came here, they listened to native music.  I don't know if this will be true or not, it happened to me
No, yes
So good
And what do you think about music?  Is it a bringer of world peace or?
No,
what's one of the questions, certain?
No, I think
I don't think so because
I don't think so, look at the things that happen and there's music that
hmm
Eh, how many thousands of years and the things keep happening the same, they're things, I love music, it relaxes your soul
sure, but there's
But it's nothing more than for this.
yes
So, eh, nothing, no, well, it wouldn't me, I repeat, I love music, but, no, the world wouldn't be nice without music, but I don't think it fixes anything either
No,
Just ask John Lennon
yes
it complicated his life
They killed him
what?
John Lennon, he was killed when he was 25, right?
He was killed, right
yes
He was killed too
but the one who ki-, the one who killed him was
yes, some nut who said he was a fan of the beatles' or John Lennnon's, I don't know
he said, no, he got a message and had to kill him, but didn't kill him out of hate or anything like that
yes, a nut, a nut
Well, he went crazy in a minute, the guy, and killed him just reading a news article. About the man
yeah
he got like a signal that he had to do it, and just did it, uh, a lot of people kill, but no, he really didn't attack him for the music or anything like that
No, I think music helps in every way, right, a concert help to increase brotherhood between countries and all that
Maybe it's not enough, but I think it helps something, right? at least is therapy for many people and
another way like you say it calms a lot, uh
hm
It's weird, I think that, not like soccer that for example creates passion, music doesn't cause that, at least, no?
hmm
it doesn't cause fights, or turn people against each other, like the passions caused by an event such as soccer, right?
sure
You more than any one know it since you are Argentinian Right?
yes, yes
There the bars are fierce, for example
Amazed yes, yes
how about the music The music does, in something, in something in fact contributes, no
It contributes something to peace.
yes I think so, anyways, right?
yes, yes
And what do you think of classical music? do you like it? it's never caught your attention or?
it catches my attention but in reality I don't know anything about classical music
yes, no, no, you don't listen to it or anything, I'm also not a Every now and then when I pay attention, I listen to it a little bit, but no, I'm not such a lover of music
mm
of classical music or anything like that. Our country has a music an incredible amount of music, diversity of music
A lot of rhythms
yes lots of rhythms that we have in a lot of regions, very different
mm
We have regions that are Flat, mountainous regions, valley, coasts so then the music
ah, goes changing there yes, yes
Uh, the music is very diverse, very diverse
It's very diverse
mh, it's really diverse
Right, just like in Argentina
mm
Just like in Argentina.
The tango, the tango, in Medellin we have, I don't know off the top of my had where Gardel died it's, uh
Right
they love the tango
Ah, yea
uh, that area's, it's a tango are right, Medellin's been known for tango
Ah, really I had no idea.
But Medellin is a, let's say after Buenos Aires
No, I didn't know, that's great, how interesting
yes yea, when I get a chance I read
Uh
About Medellin and its attractions
uh huh
And, and Gardel died there, I think in an airplane accident
yes the air accident was there in Medellin. Yes,
yes, no they love tango they really like it a lot, there's a part of Colombia where they really like it
look at that, and isn't Gabriel Garcia Marquez Colombian? Yes he's Colombian
yes, of course

Yes, yes
Ah Ah just a while ago I was reading the book  The Bio, the last book that came out "The Biography"

yes.
like always the music would
would accompany him
would accompany him, yes that book is very interesting. Very good,
yes the coastal man is very famous in Colombia, in the cities and in the interior for being loud I mean one identifies him by saying there goes
a coastal man carries a tape recorder or a large radio on his shoulder
Ah, yes
Like here the blacks necessarily have to sometimes do Right? That's how it is over there in Colombia. In the capital is cold, cold land
how nice, how I would love to know Colombia.

Ah Juanes is also Colombian.
Aha, Juanes is also Colombian, now there's a lot of music
Ah, Shakira also, but Shakira they don't, don't like her in Argentina
ah,
Because she got married there to
a is true that
with Antonito de la Rua, and nobody likes her, they don't even want to see her
Ah, well that's another thing
So she lost a country to sell records.
yes, really?
yes, yes,
No, well that is very Although they at any moment, maybe separate.
She'll continue with that.
ah?
We don't know, is she still with the son of who used to be our president
yes it appears she is no?
I don't know,
yes she still is, but ah, that time always ends relationships.
yes, so in Argentina no
mm
Since it didn't go over well with people, they had to erase a bit of the map
that will make
A little, not much but still
And that music
In a moment it was furor, everyone was listening, listening to Shakira's music.
yes
And when, since people didn't like the president, since he fixed the President's son
yes,
They played it a bit against
what happened.
poor Shakira
And what music is popular in Argentina now?
Popular now
yes, What music is fashionable?  or, What singers?  What group?
And, and well, since I listen to national rock, I don't know anything more than national rock groups, nothing more
Ah, yes, hmm
yes, they're called "Los Piojos" and "La Versuit" but
But they're not well known internationally
Sure, no, no they are groups who sing national music, above all it's music that if you're not Argentinian you don't understand much either because it has a lot,
yes, hmm
codes and
very local
and very local, and they talk about the political, economical and social situation that, look, if, if you´re not Argentinian you won´t understand what they´re talking about
hmm, nice, and
they´re very local things
I know the situation
Sure
and it´s been very delicate lately, right?
yes, it´s complicated, yes, complicated
has it gotten better?
Eh?
Has it gotten better or not

Oh, are you friends with Mariano and Leticia?
Yes
The other day they told me, "look, i just got to talk and my friend from Boston picked up", they said, that it'd be hilarious
Oh, it was me. Because, the other day it happened to me with a friend, she gave me the info. So with a friend from Argentina in Boston, she says, "hit it, should we call?", so each one called from our cellphones
yes. And you talked amongst yourselves
And we talk amongst ourselves
Sure, Mariano told me about all that. We see them really often, yes, yes, yes
Ah, look at that, that's good. And what are you doing in Philadelphia?
that's funny. I'm also a biologist, and I'm doing a post doc here in, I'm actually in a different department from Mariano, but well, we have a common friend, and that's how we met each other
Ah, uhm, I'm doing a postdoc in genetics in Tufts University
You? ah
And the other day, well, Mariano and Leti came here. Now a friend of ours from the faculty is coming. A very close friend coming to do an internship for 3 months, so we talked about maybe going to
Ah
So I guess we're going to meet at some point, yes
And maybe we'll meet then, look at that. Well, at least we already talk on the phone
Sure, that's nice. And how long have you been there?
A year, more or less, year and one month, year and two months, something like that, yes
Ah, look at that. Just like, well, no. I came here in january, so, ok, a year too

Sure, yes, not even a year and I'm now
Ah, okay, I came here in October
Ah, look at that, how nice. And are you happy?
Well, yes, yes, yes, I don't know. Well, I like, I like, well, they city, more or less, because of Mariano, you know
What?
is not Boston, is not Boston but it is cute and
Yes they were fascinated with Boston, that, that Philadelphia is not so beautiful, I don´t know. But I want to know it either.
yes, no. They have another. So, I went to Boston once, too. I went for a weekend, I have a friend there too. And I loved it. It seems that Boston is like a toy, is all cute and clean,
And Philadelphia is a city like the Argentinian cities, Do you understand? they have cute things but others things are a disaster and
Ah, look, of course, He said the same. The noise they make. I am going to
Of course, yes.
the supermarket to buy meat for, for Christmas because
Ah.
My siblings live here in Miami then I come to spend holidays and feel a little of hot weather.
Ah, look how good. What? Do you have all your family in United States? No? Your brothers.
Eh, my sister, my sister and her brother in law and my little nephew, and my brother, they are living here in Miami.
Ah, look, what a luck to have them near you. Lets see
yes, of course.I really found this work because my sister lived in Boston, I came to visit her and that is how I found.
Ah
But later they came to live in Miami.
Ah, ah, ah. An well, they went to look for a little bit of hot. Boston, cold right? terrible.
yes, terrible. The truth is that it was terrible cold and it was nice too. Here I am, I was at the beach today
Great, how nice.
It is incredible, the same country and there is snow, everything, is like, I don´t know.
And it is different. I went to Miami some time ago, to a congress and, and the people is different, at least. Most of them speak Spanish. You feel like you were not in the United States when you are in Miami.
as it, as it, all of them. And I went to Buenos Aires Baker and I ate some invoices and oh, che, I was listening the conversation of the other table
Sure, not here. Philadelphia I believe, it's even worse than Boston.
Amazing, that's amazing.
because there's no, I mean, we do have Hispanics but, there are no Argentinian restaurants, nothing from Argentina.
Sure, well, we only have one and it's a bit far away, I've only been there once
Aha, and how was it? Was the food tasty or  not?
yes, no, you eat well, that's right, you do eat well and you can have a Quilmes beer.
Oh. Oh.
that's good and oh, I was going to ask you something but I forgot. Are your boys there? Oh no, the boys left for California.
No, they went to California, yes, yes, yes, yes, they left, when did I last see them? On Thursday, I believe they were leaving yesterday, yes.
Oh. I'm going to call them tomorrow, that's for sure. What about you, do you have friends in Boston?
I have one friend but she doesn't know anything about biology, she's a friend from school, she went to Harvard for a while and then she married an American man and she stayed there.
Oh, that's fine, so, she has nothing to do with it, then.
Oh no, nothing to do with biology, no, I hope I get to meet some. I also have one friend, her name is Ana Avalos, do you know her?
Sure.
But she works, I don't really know where she works, I think it's Tufts or in Harvard, I don't know. Ana Avalos.
Ana? No.
She's the only girl, was, she's younger than myself but oh yes, oh, oh, she's in Boston. Some other guys are from Mar del Plata but I barely knew them because they left a lot of years ago.
their names are Liliana and Eduardo.
No, no. No, I haven't met anyone from Mar del Plata in Boston.
Oh, No, and they're the only ones. After that i don't, i don't know anybody else
Oh, look at that, that's good, that's good, so we will surely meet
Yes
And the next time you come to Boston, call me
Just like that, how funny
Yeah, there's no problem
Look, that's very good. It's a very small world, four calls already?
Its, yes, and have you spoken to any
yes, and four less one, that i got a Mexican girl that i didn't know, well, one for you and the other Leticia and the other Mariano, i was laughing my ass of, I'm telling you
Oh, you, you got to talk to them about
I got them, but it was just a coincidence, it's not like we agreed on it or something. Yes, yes, yes, really funny
Oh, look, i haven't. Well, i got this and no, yesterday i was talking to an Argentinian that lived in Toronto and after that no, Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, to tell the truth it's really a bit crazy
Uh
to speak, it's interesting, meeting other people, talking a littler and
It's good, yes, it happens so quick, you see?, like you're left wanting to ask about everyday stuff
Yes, of course, just like that and afterwords, and you make some bucks too
And yes, and while you're at it, uh
That, obviously, and is it very cold in there or not?
Not here, it was really nice today. The truth is that it doesn't seem like Philadelphia, i went out, every time i go out, since there is heating in here because it's an old building, you see, it has air-conditioning heating
Yes, yes
You preserve the heat.  This is why when I go out I put on eighty layers of clothes and I go out.  And today I was too hot, I had to take off the hat, the gloves, everything because it was
There was a bit of sun, it was good.
Ah, how nice.  Yes, I was talking with my roommate who's from Argentina and she told me that it was fifty degrees
Ah.
Fahrenheit, obviously.  No?  What is it?  Ten.
yes, yes well, And there are, yes, it's minus thirty two I think it is, like nine or ten degrees.
Sure, yes. she has a method, good.  Thirty, and, forty makes eh, it's five, forty and five, ten, fifty, fifteen, like that.
Ah, that's good, because I always do minus thirty two divide two but no.
And after, Sure, no, like that is good.  She made the calculation, it's great.
Great.  Sure.  How is it?  Forty you add five, forty five, ten and fifty, fifteen.
Sure, just like that.
The, the rest, you don't add.  No.
Sure, exactly.  Sixty would be twenty.
Yes, there, there, there, there.
There it is, how nice.
Blink, blink the math.
yes, so, no?  We study so much
yes, yes.  And with inches, and with pounds, don't they make you crazy?  I, I, no no no
Ah, I still don't know
Now recently I've started to lose a bit, they say everything to me in miles, in inches, in pounds.  I keep looking at it like they're saying, for it to add up.
yes, I still don't know how tall I am, let's say, in feet.
Ah no, in feet, no, no, no, no. Because even the differences are very small because a person who is five feet is really short, but someone who's six is like
Sure, as such.
But it's like I don't have the, like it's five and something that you should measure, but no, no.
Sure, yeah,that's it.  And, how many calls do you have?
And this is the fourth I think.  Yes, I started a little while ago.  yes, yes, yes.
Ah.  Ah no, this is my seventh.  Ah, I'll tell you something, have you seen that if you make five calls on different phones you earn fifty dollars more?
yes.  yes, yes, yes, yes.
How is this?  It's within the twenty eh the, the twenty five calls or after?
I don't know if it's in total.  Sure, it wasn't very clear to me either I ha-.  Like in reality I was missing a lot and I didn't give, but
And think that it's five plus the twenty, I think it's like this.
Ah, okay.
But I'm not sure.  But seen that when your profile appears, the maximum number of calls appears, twenty.
yes.
So, I don't know, I had a doubt because it the maximum is twenty then it would be within the twenty.
Ah sure well, this, this.  I will write, I will send a mail and I will ask them because yeah I'm already at seven
I want to find out.  Besides here I have my si- my sister's telephone, my brothers, all to do this.
Sure.  And keep doing it, all after the last one is left.
Sure, it's I don't know, five in a row.  It won't be five in a row, it doesn't have anything to do with it.
No, no.  It shouldn't have anything to do with it.  No, no, not for.  No, no.  I don't think so.  Inc-
Sure. Sure, you see. Now, Lau- Lara, is Laura your name?
Me? No, Maria Ines.
yes, oh, quite different, I don't know why, that's so funny.l Well, I'm sure, well, maybe I'll be there next month or something, I'll take a China bus on the weekend and and
And you'll come here. It's on.
and I might go visit my friend.
yes, yes, yes, yes, oh, you are going to like it. Philadelphia is a beautiful city, it has it's ups and downs, it has interesting things to see and
No, I really want to visit, now that we are here right? We should visit places.
We better, yes, I'd have to travel a bit far away, to all the cities that are nearby. I'm still missing New York, it's the first one in the whole world that I saw
I don't really like the idea of it but
So, no, you know what? Go there in the summer, it's completely different
In the summer? yes.
yes, it's really nice, I loved it in the summer, like two days, full, two full days, you sleep there oh, but are you coming back?
In a hostel, I can go back during the day because I live quite near, it's one hour away from here.
Hey, you've never been there yet?
No, no, no, I don't know, I know, everyone hates me for that, but the ones from Argentina too, they tell me they can't believe it, they say I'm an idiot, how is it that you've never been there? And I'm like, no, I don't know why.
Sure, how long are you staying?
Oh, I still don't, my contract is valid until October of next years and then I don't know if I'm going to renew it or not. I don't know yet.
That would be two years. Sure, it's all right.
yes, yes, so far you, I mean, five years top, right? For a post-doctorate but I think that my bosses subvention has it
Sure.
for the pay I receive, she has it for more than a year. So I think that until July two thousand and seven, something like that, well, and
Ah, of course, what a shit
nothing. Now I am looking for a scholarship, but, I am not to excited because I don´t want to stay here for three more years, so let see if
Of course, I am going through the same thing. I have two more years of work in this place, but
Of course.
But it looks to me that I want just one more year, nothing more. Lets say to learn what I wanted to learn
yes.
then I prefer to learn other things. Lets say, I have to make this place.
Are you here? yes, yes, yes. And would you go for the postdoc to another place?
Of course, that is, a thing like that, but I don´t know, lets see. I am happy, lets say, I am happy living this situation but is not the right place for me, for my life.
No, you don´t like it. Do you want to come back to Argentina? right.
I would like it, I would love it, I love it, I´m in love with Argentina but I don´t know. We scientists are jerks. How could you be a scientist in - being Argentinian? Right? We are.
Of course, no. No, no, no. we are big jerks, but well.
And well, see it.
No, I think I am going to come back. yes, I don´t, I don´t
Of course.
Hello
My name is Miriam.
Hello Miriam, Marcela.
Nice to meet you Marcela Where are you calling from?
Well I'm here in Salem, North Carolina.
Okay I'm here in Toronto Canada
Oh, you're far
You're already far, yes.
Where are you from?
I'm, I'm from Lima, Peru.
Ah, I'm from Argentina.
yes, I noticed the accent
you can always see our true colors
Yes And tell me Marcela, Do you travel a lot?
Honestly no, travel, I've traveled, of course the first big trip that I've had, was when I was nine  when my parents immigrated to the United States.
mm, mm
And Then In the summer I'm fifty one so this is old history
mm
in the summer of seventy, of seventy I was fifteen years old and went to Europe. For the summer, yes that was fun, and then the next summer of seventy one we went to Argentina.
In the whole time that we had arrived since sixty four that we hadn't returned.
wow
And this, after I didn't go out any more until eighty five when I went back to Argentina.  I was already thirty and I went back with my three year old son,
hmm
for three years.
aha
And after this, well, I moved, my husband had entered into the army and we moved from Los Angeles to North Carolina
aha
and after I didn't travel again except to go to New York because my older son was at NYU, and now lives in Connecticut
aha
And so, eh, these trips, and to Miami to see my mom and my father when they traveled from Argentina because it's cheaper if they
come to Miami, so I go to get them.
aha.  Oh, how nice, and you travel by plane, or by bus
Well when I go to New York or to Miami we go in the car.
aha, aha, oh how nice.
in the car, yes, but after the summer of two thousand for I traveled with my husband and my older son, who's seventeen, we have two sons, that's all.
aha
And we went to, to Buenos Aires.
aha
And it was the first time that my husband went to Argentina because he couldn't go in eighty five when I went.
Oh, your husband is Argentinian too.
No, no, he's American
Oh, that's nice. And you? you didn't lose the accent
no, because I never spoke English at home
Oh, your husband speaks, uhm, Spanish
No, not at all, because at home, we all speak english, my, my kids are bilingual because when they were little, I speak to them in spanish, it feels weird speaking in English
yeah, yeah, sure
but once my son was nine, and the eldest, was three, I don't know what happened, we started speaking more and more English and now we communicate more in english
yeah
It's rare that we speak spanish, but when my parents are here, everyone speaks spanish. Except Rene, my husband, who doesn't,  no, he knows a word here and there, but he's never made any effort
oh, look at that
And he's said, he has said he's going to learn because he doesn't want to go back to Argentina without understanding or speaking, but he hasn't done anything yet
Oh, nice, but then, you, you have the accent because of your daddy, right?
Sure
Because otherwise, if it's not in the environment, or sorry, in the country, it's very hard to keep it
yes, I think it is. But I don't know. I don't know because I, I haven't met any other people, from Argentina who've been here for a long time
and my sons have both an Argentinian accent
Look, how nice, how interesting
Especially the youngest, the eldest has it a little more mixed up
yeah, yeah
because when he was a student he worked for a long time in a restaurant, and in restaurants he spoke Spanish with people from Mexico
Yeah aha, aha
And so, he has a touch of Mexican that makes him very nice.
yes, because sometimes one can spread it.
oh yes, yes, yes, oh yes.
Without wanting it, one goes around catching it, leaving it here, leaving it there.
yes, yes, yes
And the accents don't mix.
And this is good but, but the little one especially has an Argentinian accent, mixed with the American accent, but it's an Argentinian accent.
aha, how interesting.
this, it's funny, that they still don't have the accent.
And your Spanish is really good, really pure.  Yes because there are people who are like you, true.
hmm
So the English, true, there are people who
yes
whose Spanish isn't that great.
yes when I speak English I speak totally without an accent.
aha
I don't have any accent when I speak English
And you will speak like an American because you learned English since you were really young.
from when I was really small, yes, and in
Yeah but, your Spanish is really good too.
oh, thanks.
yeah, yeah, how nice.
yes, your
Look, I'm a coward, I pretty much don't like to travel.  I, eh, before nine eleven happened I was already afraid of planes.
with nine eleven I'm a lot more scared.
Ah, but you're
I don't like planes much.
you're losing opportunities,
It won't be, because look, I came to Toronto.  And here I stayed, I traveled by car to Montreal, to Quebec, to Ottawa
hmm
And these are my travels, nothing more.
Ah, well, you have to get up because, the truth is that it's much more dangerous in a car that in a plane.
That's what they say, yeah.
Understand me, because the statistics.  And besides I think that when you enter, when you enter with the exit ticket, you know?  It's marked, the exit ticket, if it's your turn, it's your turn, and this is the day and there's nothing you can do.
eh, and in any moment I think, because this can happen also in the safety of my house.  This really happens yeah.
yes, yes, you can go to unplug the iron and there you are.
Yeah, and, it's true.
So this is why you have to get inspired.
yeah, yes, I have to get inspired, and travel there.
yes I would like to go to Barcelona, because my grandparents are Catalan.
oh, look, how nice.
And I have family in Barcelona, but I've never met them, and they haven't met me
aha
They know I exist, but no, nothing else.
mm
And then I would like to go to Barcelona, because when I went to Europe, I went to London, went to Paris. I went to Switzerland, Florence, Rome and Naples, but we didn't go,
to Barcelona, we didn't go to Spain at all.
oh, well look how nice, you've traveled.
And then, eh, I would like to travel to Spain, but specifically Barcelona.
right how nice.
And I'm also curious to go to India.
Oh, India wow, that is so big.
yes and always here hoping for the opportunity to come, I'm not going to see it, what a shame because the issue is going to China,
aha
Oh before because it's changing so fast
aha
so fast everything, that in five years the China that you will see, is not the China eh, that one, go to the China of your fantasy you see.
Of the western people, that we have certain fantasies of certain countries, of how they are,
mm, mm
Uh, like it's going forward so much and it's capitalizing so much, and it's the whole society is changing, it won't be the same China
Uh huh, and, why don't you travel?, what stops you, the money or the job?
Cash, cash, yeah, money
Oh, the money, yeah, well, the money is terrible, yeah
Money
But, and a
Yeah, the truth is that the money, and the children, now  the youngest one is about to finish high school, so next year, when he's at college, i will have more freedom
Uh, but my husband has a more steady job
Yeah, right
And so, you can't just say, "well, let's travel"
Right, right
Do you understand me?, but if i had the money, i would be travelling, because i love to travel
Oh, that's good
I love to travel, if someone has to travel, i say to him, uh, do you need a ride to the airport?, I'll take you; because i love airports.
The train stations, the airpor- i love it, it gives me that feeling, you see, of anticipation, like if I'm about to get on to something that's gonna take me to some place
Oh, look at that, how nice, oh, how nice, you have an adventurous spirit, you were born with a spirit like that, right?
I love it, look, when i was sixteen years old, i had done
Right
a whole plan, to travel through train from Los Angeles to Buenos Aires
right
I was going to go on the train, I went on the train to Los Angeles, to San Diego, from San Diego to Tijuana, from Tijuana to Mexico City, and I had everything,
you can do this?
oh yes, yes you can, you can and my parents,
wow how interesting.
Didn't want me to do it, but they closed their mouths, they didn't say anything
oh
But after the mess happened in Nacaragua,
yeah aha, the
And and so there, in the seventies.  And so it wasn't the same, it was dangerous, a young.
dangerous
eh, a woman alone,
alone
eh, traveling.  I must have been crazy, but when you're sixteen, seventeen, you think you're invincible.
It's true, yeah.
And after when my husband was in the army.  And he came here, my older son, well my younger son wasn't born yet.  He was five and we were,
so happy because we didn't have to come with a van that we had,
aha
has to cross the country, and we had to wait a week, and visit places and things like that, well it happened that, they stole the van.
Aye, what a shame, aha
And just days before leaving.  And when they found it it was totally destroyed, they had taken everything.
aha, aha,
So well, the insurance paid us a little money compared to what the van cost.  And we came by airplane, that adventure was stolen.
Ay, what a shame,
They didn't steal my car, it's not that they stole my car, they stole the adventure.
The adventure, what a shame, it's never too late, now, like you said, your son will to to university, you'll have more free time,
yes, yes, I think that I'll have more, more opportunity.  Now what I have to do is get some money together.
Sure, and don't get scared of the bad guys, the bad people along the way.  I don't know, I've changed my thinking a lot about
You know what crossed my mind,
ah
It crossed my mind, sure when I go to New York or something like that.  I make sure, like, since I'm taking my wallet.
eh, I'm in the middle with a lot of people around me.  You know, eh, I'm conscious, even when I went to Buenos Aires in two thousand four, I was conscious, I didn't go around with my wallet.
aha, aha
Because sure, they saw me with my husband speaking English.
And they think that we have money, aha.
They think, ah, they come from the United States they have money.
aha
And we didn't have money, we were dying of hunger.
Yeah
But this, everyone said don't take your wallet.  Don't take your wallet, don't take jewelry, don't take anything.
no,
Because since the times are hard, there's much more crime in Buenos Aires.
there, there they take your wallet, the
yes, yes, yes
oh, it's like Lima, Lima is terrible, until
Hi, this is Vanessa from San Diego
Hi, this is Carlos, from Houston, Texas
Um, uh, from Houston?
Houston, yes
And, how's it over there, cold?
Uh, here?, no, not at all, it's beautiful here, uh, in the seventies, uh, super cool, and there?
Oh, that's interesting, i thought it would be chilly
No, thank god, the last days, uh, days, uh, uh, we wore shorts and t-shirts
Uh, well, it's the same here, it's always around the sixties, sixty five, maybe at night it goes down to the fifty five, around that.
That's good
Yes, uh huh
Where, where are you from?
I'm from Puerto Rico, and you?
Uh, likewise, that's like
uh
The voice told me
How long have you been in the United States?
Uh, five years and a half
Oh yes?, do you like it?
I, i love it. I mean, I'm here for college more than anything, so i don't have, i didn't have much choice to stay in Puerto Rico
Uh, oh, what are you studying?
Uh, virology, i work with viruses
Wow, that's interesting
Yes
Are you doing a doctorate?
Yes
Wow, look at you, can i, then I'm going to ask you something: there was, reading a while ago, well i, i'm very interested in alternate forms of medicine to, uh
help with diseases and viruses and i was reading about the, uh, coconut oil, have you studied the, or the, what the coconut oil does for killing certain viruses and all that?
Uh, no, i never heard of that before
Yes, a while ago i was reading a lot of that, that it helps for the HIV, the AIDS, the osteoporosis, hepatitis and many things more, and that it's a
a, uh, something, oh, they say it's almost miraculous
Wow, that's good
So, look, so let me, what do you plan on doing after you finish your doctorate?
Uh, i still haven't decided, research, uh, teach, i don't know, we'll see
And what's your specialty then?
Pardon me?
Do you have any specialization?
Uh, well i mean, uh, viruses. I mean no, not in particular
Oh, nothing in particular. Oh, that's very interesting, Hail Mary, that's good, so i imagine you're not going back to Puerto Rico
Uh, no, i mean, i go there every year, i mostly go there for Christmas, uh, stuff like that, but no, in Puerto Rico there isn't, generally there isn't much work for me
No, well I'm talking about the topic, I haven't returned to Puerto Rico since ninety eight and things were like so I don't know, so bad, when I went over there that I have no interest in returning there.
And I hardly have any family anyway so I don't have much reason to go.
Okay Listen, I mean, I always go because here five and a half years. I always go every year at least for one or two weeks.
But, I mean for me, I mean I think that in San Juan, I don't know I don't think that, I've never had any problems, never
the family, has never had problems with anything, so, thank God.
Aha are you in San Juan?
yes.
Ah, how good.
No right now I'm in Houston. I was there two months ago.
Ah
Eh usually, when, the time I have to travel that's what I do.
Ah, I don't, I don't like
Go to Puerto Rico.
traveling too much because I'm terrified of planes
Ah,
and I try not to ride one unless I have to, ride it by force.
Okay.
So
if that wasn't the case, where would you like to go?
I well, In May God willing I'm going to Spain, Italy, to Europe. Ah.
What a good life, what a good life!
yes, yes
Eh, I was there, I was there in May. Eh, I was in Holland
Oh, how nice
And I really loved it, it amazed me. I'm crazy to go back
And you went there to study?
yes, to wo- to work. I was, I spent one week working and one week on vacations
Oh how nice, I guess it was interesting
Oh yes, beautiful, beautiful. Travelling, relaxing, not having to worry for the work, it was basically like I go somewhere, sit down, give me a beer, I am going to
some other place, another beer. No worries at all, that is divine
Oh, how good. And are there many Puerto Rican in Houston?
Eh, right. Eh, for what I am seeing people keep coming here. Eh, when I first arrived I didn't know too many, and the last years it's like people keep coming here, like
Oh
in the medical centre, so there are a lot of universities. So many people come here to study, so
Mhm. Oh, how good. You know what? In San Diego I haven't met any Puerto Rican
Oh
And I've been here about fou- four fi- five years, and not a single Puerto Rican
Oh, sure
Mhmh, yes, so things don't look good, but obviously there are a lot of Mexican and that's all I've met. I haven' met
really, no one else here, only Mexican
Wh- when I moved here there were two Puerto Ricans and, well, eh, the next year four more came, and the other year, and every year came about three or four
always, eh, it is so
And do you think it is because of the working situation in Puerto Rico, that it got better?
No, it's rather because eh, here in Hous-, where I am, in the medical center, there are so many hospitals and universities that many people come here for that
Ah, I have a lot of friends, a lot of them in Florida. It looks like everybody enjoys going to Florida. In Orlando
Eh, basically in Puerto Rico
yes, and specially, by, I think by Orlando, in that area it is, there is
yes, my brother moved there last year, my brother
Who, who? Oh, does he like it?
yes, yes
And is he also in school and so?
No, mechanical. I am the only one in my family
Oh, yes, yes, over there in  Southern New York. And it has also been long since I went to New York and New Jersey
But I also have family there, that's life. No, I don't travel often, now I camp a lot, and I try, I do try to travel along the California coast
and, you know, eh, visiting different places here in California because there are so many things to see, but the so called big trips I haven't done any for many years
And where else would you like to go besides Europe?
Eh, no. That's the first I would like to do, but besides that, I would like to travel the whole coast of California, go part Oregon, Washington
and afterwards Canada, and get to Alaska if I can. But I would like to do that by train or car to see everything
I am crazy to go to Austarlia
Oh yes
because it has caught my attention
yes, my husband, but I have never,I have never had any interest in going to Australia, no. But, what would you like to see in Australia? Because it is in another continent and the difference, but
Eh, a little of everything. Number one, I mean, I have seen documentaries about such things in the TV and it looked very nice, the beach, the
surfing, nature, I mean, you can go camping, backpacking. Uhm, and besides I find the Australian accent fascinating
Do you camp a lot? Do yo go backpacking and so?
I love it, I'd like to do that, travelling. I like going on the Appalachian way
yes
that goes from, I think it goes from Georgia to the very North. All of it. I love everything that is somehow related to nature. I love camping, going to
One of my favourite places, I lived some time in Tennessee, in Nashville. And I used to go there quite often to camp eh, I used to go on river rafting, eh
Things like this. Here in Texas there are not many places to go camping. I like one place, in Huntsville, about one hour far from Houston.
There I can go camping, ether is a lake to go kayak. And I can also go paddling. I love all these things
look, we have a lot of that here, you know. If you have heard about the Appalachian trails, then you must have heard of the Pacific, haven't you?
yes
Well, we are into a group, it's like the boy-scouts but its called Venture Group, it's for both men and women, and we
go on excursion to the Pacific
OK
Eh, backpacking and so, we go for two or three days and try to do little stages, but it is very interesting and hard as well. You would never say it is that hard, carrying those
big backpacks, weighting sixty pounds or so. Very nice. Here the climate is always comfortable, so camping is easy.
I heard San Diego is a perfect place to travel to, you don't need no air-conditioned or heater
No
It's always nice, the weather is really nice there
yes, the weather is really nice, and beautiful, there are beaches, lakes, mountains, deserts, everything
So, if you drive an hour in one direction, you arrive to the mountains,the snow, if you drive one hour in the other direction, you are in the desert
You know, other site with lakes, There are really everything to
Like I was saying
To do, I mean, you can, mmm
Like I was saying, in Puerto Rico, you can be
Really yes
A little low on beach, a little low in caves, or dry forest
Really yes, In a larger scale here, but Puerto Rico, it's the only site I've visit that has that much
topography
And where you would not like to travel?
No, I'm not interested in going to Japan, my Husband has travel to Japan in work, he really like it, but he says is
all that different and that many people, I don't have any interest in, and you?
I mean, nor Japan, nor Chine, Asia in general, it doesn't interest me, maybe a little bit
Good day. Good evening
Yes, Good evening, eh. I'm Gloria from here from California
Ah, hello Gloria, I'm Marco. I'm in Philadelphia and let's start with "Merry Christmas"
pardon?
Eh, I wanted to start with "Merry Christmas"
Oh, thanks, likewise
Thanks, thanks Eh, Let's see, trips Eh, I, grew up in Paraguay, in South America I mean I came from there, I came here to the United States, Where do you come from?
I'm originally from Guatemala.
Ah, from Guatemala, okay
And, yes my biggest dream is to know Jerusalem
Ah
Eh, all of it, and its surroundings,
yes, yes, the Middle East in general
mm yes, eh, but the main thing, the most important
yes
Would be the money
details, details, eh
aha
One thing I had seen in the, we are already in the twenty first century One of the things, for example, communication Which includes, what type of phone are you using? A cellular or?
it's a cordless is from the house,
ah okay, wireless.  I, I for example am talking with a cell phone, eh,
ah
I make my connections, when I call from my house I use the, the telephone company that uses, eh, that's basically a line
hmm
Eh, through the Internet, is the telephone connection
Oh,
I see, I can still talk with my dad who's in Paraguay, eh, family there, I have a brother in San Francisco who I've been to see a few times, some times
hmm
It seems that the communic- it's so, it's easier.  I go to visit my dad once every year more or less
hmm
And I go in twelve house, I go from here to there, Eh, I go Philadelphia - Miami, or Philadelphia to New York, from New York to
San Paolo, Brazil, from Brazil to Asuncion in Paraguay
hmm
Eh and come from the other side to go to Europe, for example, where up until now I haven't been.  But this, this is the place I want to go to
I'm compromising now to, me and my fiance we want to go, we would like to go to Europe, being in Philadelphia it's really easy
oh,
The flight there costs less than two hundred dollars
hmm
from here to Paris, a direct flight
hmm
In one jump, and a few hours, eh, it seems to be that our ability now to be able to travel, communicate, to send, eh
hmm
send, eh, things by mail, by fedex, or by, whatever
hmm
Eh, changes the way of seeing the world.  Everything seems a lot closer.  Eh, from here, I, for example in case of an emergency
Eh, I could practically go to any part of the world in less than a day
hmm
And can go whenever I want
yes, it's like a power
I, I like it a lot
to visit other places and more when you have the opportunity
Sure, sure, I've always realized that, the details, like we said, for example, the money
yes,
Eh, even though, traveling is much cheaper now than before
Yes, but
Yeah,
for me it's not,
cheaper, it's not
To not
No, cheaper isn't the same as saying cheap.  This is, it's less expensive than before, that's all
yes true
yes but traveling still, still cost Eh
yes,
Even if you drive
I would also like very much to know Spain I more than anything have researched a lot but like on the internet each place that I think of on the internet and
yes
I imagine like I'm in those places, no that's the only way that I can do it, otherwise no, my economic situation is not
Not enough for now
It doesn't allow me, yes
yes, that is definitely I wanted to go to Paraguay for example, I remember when I had just gotten to the United States, like ten years ago Eh,
Eh, Calling on the phone to Paraguay, it cost approximately a dollar per minute Eh, And me being young, back then of course I would call home and say hi to my mom
I would talk with my dad
mm
A while: hello, how are you! twenty dollars, it was a while
yes. Now is much easier, right,
Now is much more, that's much more cheaper and back then I would pay more than one thousand dollars. It was the trip from Kansas to Paraguay
mm
Eh, now I'm in Philadelphia, the last time I went, it's been already like two years
mm
it's been already, almost three years that I don't go
mhm
However, the last time that I was there, I remember that I had to pay around five hundred and sixty dollars
mhm
Instead of the usual thousand, eh, it's so much easier now than it used to be
mhm
But they are still, it's still five hundred and sixty dollars that
mhm
and earning per the hour, that's a good deal
yes, yes, if you make some numbers, how many hours, you many hours you work
yes, exactly, exactly
to be able to give yourself a little treat, I mean, to be able to be with your family, no
I remember the last time that I was in Paraguay, some friends were there and they asked me about it and I remember that at that time I was earning about two thousand dollars per month.
and I was working so hard, and I was like a computer technician, eh, eh software too
mm
and I, when, when I said that I was earning two thousand dollars per month, that's
mm
twenty four thousand per year, that's something, but it's not fantastic
Not here
Here, exactly, not here,
aha, aha
I remember when I was there I was wanting to say to the person, to the person I am making good money but I'm not a millionaire and well then
ah, I know some from Paraguay, a couple and I like them a lot a lot of them talk like that
yeah,
It calls a lot of attention, it looks good I like it well, the tone of voice that they have there, you're able to understand it very well
Thank you, thank you ah, one that I remember is that I told them I only make two thousand, two thousand dollars!, over there two thousand dollars
Eh, it's it's well, they would have said a million dollars practically, it's
mh
a ton of money for them. Especially now that they are in an economic recession, with all that, it's difficult to try and
yes, there are a lot of places that you know people would like to see, right? but there's a lot of obstacles a lot of things that they don't allow anyway
Sure,
It's worth it to dream
yes, no, eh, I have a, I have a brother in San Francisco yeah and it's being in San Francisco he also works in IT eh,
Network Administrator and one thing that I know that he can do each time, the new Sony PSP comes, the PSP, it's a thing that is a, the
Like a little toy practically
mhm
what's it cost, I think like three hundred, four hundred dollars
mh
yes, he bought one he was complaining that he doesn't have any money, that he can't travel, he can't come, I couldn't sorry, my mother is here in Philadelphia also
Eh, my Mom doesn't, he couldn't eh, this year he couldn't come to visit because he didn't have the money
mmh
But he had just bought a new digital camera, but an expensive one, he also bought a new laptop too
hmm
expensive,
hmm
because it was the latest, it was the latest one to come out
hmm, yeah I imagine
But the thing is that he for example, with the last one, the new one came out, of this, he had the last one, that had just come out of the factory
hmm
eh, it's still hot, and he has it
hmmm
He's happy with this but, this left him with no money, he almost can't do anything more than this
yes,
hmm, this is a decision that, for example, he made the decision, he preferred to have a new device
He's always so avant-guarde
Ah, exactly, avant-guarde in anything having to do with technology
aha
But, ah, this cost him, this cost him the power
Aye, no
to travel, the power to do things he wants to do
hmm
other things, eh.
hmm
if you have to choose, either this, or you do this
or it's one or the other, say,
One, or the other, it, it can't be both
aha
And this is something that, I think it's stupid when, seeing that he complains that he doesn't have money, but after he talks about his new PSP
hmm
you choose one
People like this don't grab my attention, you know, because more than anything it's like, like I told you, more than anything like always excel, no?
yes,
Even if after like we say, in my land we're snapping our fingers there, because he does it, or now I need
For example, there, I buy things, things recently are pretty expensive but I take care
hmm
I gather every bit, with care
hmm
And I have it for a long time
hmm
Eh, for example, my telephone, my telephone for example, it's an iPod that's expensive, but I've had this for a few years
Eh, in technology, when I bought it it was cutting edge, the latest one, but now, it's already showing its age,
mhm
But it's still useful to me, I need to have the very last
mhm mhmh
I need something that is useful to me. Eh, that doesn't mean that
If we analyse it, the times are not to be in the vanguard but to somehow survive, right? that's how things are
Yes, even, what I am doing is, I am studying now to, to be able, to be able when I finish studying to find a job and get paid enough
mhm
enough to keep in the vanguard, without, without worries
mhm
Without, eh
yes, is New York,
Well my name is Claudia. Ah, sorry. With whom do I have the pleasure?
yes is New York. What Claudia?
Yes, my name is Claudia.
Where are you from?
Ah look I'm from Mexico City, and where are you from?
Eh, I'm from Panama, but from where where where are you calling from?
Ah look I, I'm calling from, the state of Idaho
Oh. You're from the potato.
And where are you at? yes, and where are you from?
In New York. New York.
Oh, look, from the other side. yes, well so
The stat- yes tell me.
yes, listen, what do you think about music? Does it play an important role in your life?
yes? Is that music fills the, How do you say it? The lonely moments of my life. Always when I'm alone that I need to hear I need something to give.
And fill me spiritually. I always choose music and How do you say it? It transmits the, How do I tell you? Information, which I need to continue. You could say that.
Wow, look also for me, well music is something very important because, for example, I like to be cleaning my house and all that and doing for example
and I put the radio on to cheer me up or to finish sooner, faster the truth is I do like music a lot, and, and my favorite music is
Aha.
is the peaceful one, the music that's not so loud em that keeps me for example, um, I don't know with a calm spirit.
Like instrumental.
and something like that, like instrumental, but also for example, sometimes um I put on music for example cumbia, salsa, music because I also like that music to dance to.
Aha.
that's to, for example if I need to hurry faster, for example when I clean the house I put that type of music
Aha and
and woo I hurry faster, than if I put an instrumental one yes, I like it a lot, and what type of music do you like?
yes Okay Well eh, in reality I don't have a preference.
uh um
I like instrumental music, I like jazz music, eh. I like the, I like any type of music but I like
aha
To listen to I like Jazz and I also like instrumental which is almost like repetition.
oh.
And, I myself fill up the part, the spiritual part with my thought, the part of the music that doesn't have, doesn't have words like my thought. I listen to reggeaton I listen to any type of music.
yes aha
Eh, the salsa, the cumbia, I listen to anything I like it. As long as it has a message. And the, and the song that has a message I like much more, understand.
oh um
That just listening to something that it's just noise for the ears, understand, that something that has no message, that doesn't have something
yes
constructive, for example, there's music that always talks of eh, of a man than of a woman or a woman than of a man that the feelings failed, broken feeling, broken heart
aha
that I'm going to cry, that I'm not going to cry. That, that type of music doesn't attract me to much for the sense of reason of, sense of reason that
that instead of cheering you up, it depresses you.
yes, it gets you, yes true, I don't like that type of music either is bad normally the music, for example, there's country music which is from my country
and it talks a lot of that type - sincerely I get to listen to it but is not really my favorite, really almost the same like you say, instead of cheering me up it gets me sad and, and no, then I like happy music a lot, the music
that wakes up a good spirit, the music that has a good rhythm to dance if it's the time to dance
Aha.
The music that keeps me in a good mood and, and for example in the house now I listen, to children's music now because my son is now almost two years old then he also likes the music and I also put children's music
Children. How nice.
And I also like it, and I'm singing it, the music that I remember the songs that my mom used to sing to me when I was little and I sing them to my son and then
there's always music in my house, and then, we can live maybe without the television but, without the radio honestly, like I don't think I could live so much.
Aha. Likewise I likewise get
Because yes, yes, I use the radio a lot
yes, me too, the radio, I depend a lot on the radio almost that, I'm always listening to the radio, in the car, in the house, I'm always listening to music.
Aha.
And I like to feel it because it really cheers me up, it cheers me up, it cheers me up and when it cheers me up, it makes me faster, it accelerates me, like you say.
yes yes.
And I also learn from it because, I tell you, there are music songs that have a message and it's an important message for us, for me
yes. yes. yes is true, look that's true, honestly I think that the music plays a very important role and even for example um, for example there's folklore music, music from other countries
Aha.
that sometimes, for example, you don't understand it too much, but for example, you see that the people are dancing and they are playing this folklore music and that
The truth is, even if you don't understand it, you feel, oh, well, you feel a peace so great and it starts to get your attention because people is dancing
And so, i think that it, the music can help you, most of the times, to unite other cultures and other countries.
And you're watching how people is enjoying it, you even want to participate, you want to be there and dance if you can, uh, i don't know, i mean, i think that music is very, is very good actually
Sure, like everything, there is music that's, i feel that it's destructive, like there are a lot of people that have a lot of satanic music, so, the music is... well, i personally avoid that, right?
Right, yes
But i think that music, just as it can help you, it can destroy you, because that kind of music leads you to a lot of drugs, vices, i don't know
And other kinds of music, it kinda helps you get away or forget about that sort of thing and vices, or what do i know, what do you think about that?
Right, yeah, no, yes, you're right. There is music that really, uh, help you, it touches you, it washes your brain effectively, your conscious
Right
and transmits, it transmits to you, uh, negative ideas and thoughts
Yes
That without you knowing, it's there and there comes a time when you can't, uh, how do you say it?, toss it out in the air
Yes
Without knowing that, that really, it's a whole feeling of destruction, it goes inside you. But after you have gotten it, well, about, about the
Yes
The music, for example, there are lots of people who, when they were children, the family told them "oh, you're dumb, you're stubborn, you don't understand"
Yes
And that remains in your [sub] conscious, that they really think they're worthless
Yes, it's true
Uh, their, their, their, uh, [sub] conscious, not their conscious, but themselves, unconsciously think they can't give, uh, much, they can't give much
yes, yes it's true.
Well, this remains in- The music plays the same role. A song can play the same role as far as, certain information can be received and stored
yes.
without you realizing it, there comes a time that you eh, don't explore, eh, make it digente, you do it you throw it out
That yes.
And unfortunately it results in, in a catastrophe well hell that in eh mm he takes to a destructive level, for you or other people, understand
Yes, yes it's true.  Yes, because for example, and notice that he, the type, depending on the type of music that you listen to, eh, you start to dress, you start to behave.
You start to to style your hair, your appearance starts to reflect it
Ah.
I have realized that, for example, in Mexico, if you listen, for example, rock emm Mexican rock um Um, yes, rock in Spanish, and such, usually are pants eh jeans that fit really tight to your body with fonders and
Aha, Spanish rock.
And other type of clothes.  If, for example, you listen to dark music, satanic music, music like that, you wear black, you wear black eye makeup, and you wear your hair long if you are a man and
and you are like really mysterious, always and if it's, for example, you like salsa, you dress with, I don't know, with colorful shirts if you're a man or woman and
Aha.
And, I mean, like many times people can tell the type of music you listen to by the way you dress or how you behave.
Then, I think that the, the music plays and important role in your life. And it can help to, to improve your life
to have it, I don't know, more peaceful mm. Have more coexistence with the people or distance yourself from people, to be a loner, to be, I don't know, like very mysterious
and to destroy you many times. So then I think that, I think music plays a very important role. More, in the young people, nowadays that, that the type of music sometimes
yes.
Um is not very suitable and there comes a time when they start to listen to another type of dark music and in a month they've already changed, all their life
so, in a very short time
Yes
so, i think that music is very important, very, very important. what do you think
yes, because, like you say, music is a, music is a universal language
Uh huh
So, the same, the same song gives you a message, whether it's positive or negative, but
yes
Uh, if it's going to be handed to another person it's like a, me telling you that you're not worthy or you are worthy, or get up
Yes
Uh, rejuvenate, you're going to, you're going to be alright or if not, everything's over, die. You know, there are some things
Yes, yes, it's true, yes, because
And, uh
Yes, because i also realized that people, um, for example, young, uh, old people, well, of all ages, that listen to their music
uh, there comes a time when, for example, if the artist stands in every concert, they also stand at all times. Um, if, for example, they
Right
Uh, sometimes the kind of music you listen to, thy say that the drugs, uh, you're not going to
Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! How are you?
Hi, how are you?
Fine thank you, fine. This is Vicente and I am speaknig from New York
I am Luisa from Miami, Florida
From where?
Miami
from Miami, oh, Cuban?
What?
if you are from Cuba, originally from Cuba
Me Cuban? no
well, Miami, that's the first thing that comes to my mind, that you may be from Cuba
No, no, I am not Cuban. I am Colombian
Oh, Colombian, aha. Well, I am from Panama
From Panama, oh, we are near
yes, Panama was originally a part of Colombia
and how long have you been here?
Oh, I've been here, I've been here for about thirty years now
Thirty years! wow, a long time
yes, yes, yes I've been here for a long time. Ahmm I came from Panama, to study. It's called high school here but
in Panama it's called Second Cycle
Oh, I see
to High School, ok. And, well, here I went to school here as well. But we should be talkning about, what? music?
About music, yes
Oh, yes. I wonder how is music nowadays, but I heard recently that Reggae-ton comes from Panama. I don't know if it's right or no
I don't know. I don't know, but I heard it comes from Dominican Republic
What?
The Reggae-ton was born in Dominican Republic, that's what I heard. I'm not sure
Well, I heard Panama, I heard it in the Latim music TV and I know it was Reggae-ton. But I don't know
And this is what we know, right? I thought , I thought it was Dominican also
Aha
Because, because it has a lot of Reggae, that's from the island of Jamaica
yes
And Reggae-ton is like a combination of Rap, Sepa, eh Latin Rap and things like this, eh
yes, yes
But I heard that this and that, they showed it, I was watching something there. But the thing is that nowadays music
I don't really like Rap and all that. But the influence of Rap, eh, specially among young people, eh, what can I say?
Because I heard some, not here, in New York. Before the only Latin you could find in New York were Dominican and Puerto-Rican
now in New York there are from all over, from Peru, from Argentina, from Ecuador, Salvador. There are a lot of Ecuadorean here, a lot of what I call 'Incas'
from Peru. There are so many here in New York, right? and Mexican, Mexican music is, looks like Rap they go: 'lalalu, lalalu' they talk, you know what I mean?
But no, look you are talking to a Spanish, a Sapnish, right? from Spain. And in all the clubs
yes.
In all the clubs in Spain, Eh, eh, the reggeaton.
Yes, now that, that music Is very popular everywhere, here too the only thing you hear, Reggaeton, Reggaeton even in the Clubs
That are only of well, I mean
aha
Anglo-American I mean let's call them "Bad Gringos" Is that they are people that only that always put Hip Hop music only and no Latin music, they are putting Reggaeton
And everything, is very normal. Everybody dances to it.
yes, yes, yes, is the Music from Miami, the same as in Spain but the thing that one day, I was here in, ah. So then we have a China Town here in New York Right
Aha, yes
There were no Chinese in China Town and today today I said. Hey that's Rap. I didn't understand the word but the way they were
talking Chinese in the background music Right
Aha
I knew immediately that it was Rap. You understand?
yes.
What happens is that you were in and I said: Listen that's Rap.
Robin Chinese
And Chinese yes, the Chinese guy told me that yes. Exactly. I imagine that that Rap is in all the crap in all the world, in all parts. Because, what can I tell you
But, still, I love the Boleros, for me from the Latin Music, I like the boleros more than anything else. No, but Boleros are
soft, Understand? Love songs and things like that.
Sure and to dance or something, What music do you like?
and to, to listen to also, to listen to also.  The Bolero is more for listening.
No, no, I asked what kind of music do you like to dance to?
To dance to,
yes.
well to dance, I like American music
American
yes, yes, because it depends, Salsa is good too.  Because I put on the, the CD
Aha, but you don't
Huh?
but you don't like the Latin rhythms.  Like: Merengue,
Ahhh
Salsa, Bachata
Merengue, no.  Merengue is a bit too fast for me.  yes, the Merengue, the Dominicans, the Dominicans have two passions: Merengue and Baseball
yes, for Dominicans, Merengue and Baseball are the, their passion.  But Merengue is a little to fast for me, I don't know.
I find it a little bit too fast.  But I like old rock and roll, to dance.
Oh.
Like, like, disco, something like this.
And have you listened to Vallenato?
You know?  No, I listen to music in Spanish too, but, but to dance when I go to the disco, something like this.  You see it, nothing else.
That the disco music. How is it, this was very disco, eh, dancing, you know.  Any time.  Well, seventies, eighties, the disco.
and, yeah.  Music to dance.  It had a rhythm.  No, Latin music also has a lot a lot of rhythm, but I like this more.  But Merengue, ahhh
Sure.
A bit too fast.  I like to listen to the-
And no.
Latino, Latino songs too.  No but hey.  What I can tell you, music has changed a lot, eh.
Sure, yes.
The future, the future of music I can tell you, I don't know, I don't know what comes.  No, if it will b- music, or if it will be the Banda all the time, I don't know
you KNOW like Rap Rap.  They speak more than sing, you know?  Eh, it's speaking more than singing.  I don't know if this is he future or not.
But you like, what?  Latin music.  For you, for you, what, what do you like about it?
The music
I like all Latin music.  I love it.  Salsa, Merengue, Rettaeton, Vallenato, The Colombian Vallenato.  I like it a lot.
aha
Eh, What more?  Well I'm explaining to you that my Vallenato is Colombian.  I don't know if you know what that is?
uhhm, And how long have you been here in the United States, in the United States?
It will be two years.
Ah?
It's almost!  No, two years, I came here two years ago.
Only two years.
Yes, just two years.
Hmm
I'm new around her.
Ah?
I'm new around here.
Aha, yes, yes And in, in. For not going to Miami, there are so many well there are so many Latins in Miami that you will think that the Latins dominate
dominate the United States.
No.
Well No.
No, I know is not like that, because I used to  live in North Carolina before
Aha, Oh!
Then, yes. I know that the Latins don't dominate the world.
Okay.
See, they don't dominate the United States, but you do find many Latins here.
in New York, yes the Cubans and all those, I have a brother, that lives in Orlando.
yes in New York I, was also living like three months.
Aha,
And when I, when I was little, I would come a lot, would go a lot to New York.
You, you
Then, I know it.
You lived in New York, you said?
Three months, I was in New York. And before when I was younger, my mom would always bring me to New York. That we would stay three months, we would return to Colombia.
We would come here on a trip.
To which part of New York, would you come, where?
To Queens sometimes I would go to Queens Queens or sometimes I would go to Manhattan
Ah Manhattan, yes, because I live in Manhattan. I live in Manhattan, but you are from, When was the last time that you came to
New York?
To New York it's been like? Three years.
It's been like three years.
yes.
yes, yes. well, well it's still the , almost the same. Well, now we see already that there's a lot of Latin accent, like you say Right?
And Latin in all parts of the world.
yes,yes, yes.
And, there's influence, because here, there's a lot of the things they put, eh the things that are written,everything is in Spanish and in English, but I tell the Latins that look : When you come here
Make sure to learn English understand? And I say that, you are already, look that nowhere
Sure.
No, don't talk nonsense that you don't speak. No, talk and learn English because when you return to your country When I go back to Panama one thing I find is that,
all the richest people, and the people with most influence in my country speak English.
yes.
Only rich ones
Sure, is very important. if one has in their hand, the possibility of learning another language. The possibility of growing as a person, you have to take it.
yes, yes
Obviously, if you live in an English speaking country, you must learn to speak in English, no matter how many Latins you find around you
And not only, well, one thing, one important thing I can say in my life, when I left Panama I learned a lot more about my country
More about my country outside than when I was insdie
Aha
I'll tell you what, I learned more about mu country when I was outside than when I was inside. When you are inside,
aha
you, you, how is it? they feed you with politics. And falls, your country, loves you, and the, but when you go out, maybe you learn to observe
To observe and to think more, understand? About your country, the things that, you know, what happens and what does not happen, and things like this
And you can compare it to other countries when you are outside. Because in the Latin countries, the poorest people are fed with politics to eat
Sure
They tell them, they tell them that the United States are to blame for everything in the world, eh, and that makes me laugh
Because I tell them, I say, ah, ah, to me, seventy percent of your problem is internal. Thirty percent external
You know what I mean? Because they think that all the problems
yes
The problems of their country, are due to the United States. So,this is the policy of the rich and the middle class, tell the people
most of the people there. And they put the blame ob the United States, for everything. For instance, if you go out and observe your country
you will see that seventy percent of the problems are internal problems. And the other, thirty percent have an external cause
Ah. you know what I mean?
yes, yes
But you can tell them, you can just tell them because they won't believe you, specially the poorest. The poorest are fed politics
all, all, yes ,yes. And that's why Panama lives out of the most rich and powerful. They are all citizen, American citizen
yes
yes. Remember that in many Latin countries you can have two, what you call it? two citizenships. You can be a citizen of, Colombia if you are from Colombia you will always be a Colombian, right?
yes
You can go back to Colombia and vote, tomorrow if you fell like.
Sure
You will be a Colombian, even if you come here, and you become an American citizen, right?
You will keep your citizenship
yes
your, your, your what you call it?
Colombian citizenship
for all your life, understand?
yes, sir
It's the same in Panama. Understand? but I tell you, I see that all of the richest people and more powerful
in Latin America, and not only LatinAmerica but Europe and the rest of the world as well. I have travelled, I have travelled the world. All the rich and powerful people speak English
In addition to their natural language, you know what I mean? If I go to Egypt
yes
if I go to Germany, right? they speak German, but the most powerful, the richest they speak English as well. The international language of the richest is English
And most of the people don't speak it. When you see, business things, contracts and all that, written, between one country and one other
It's always written in English. If Argentina is about to, to do a contract, right? with Japan, what do you think
Hello Jose.
How is it going, Manuel, I'm in Orlando Florida.
How are you, I'm in New York.
Fine, eh, sorry, where?
In New York.
Ah, hi Jose, nice to meet you.
Likewise
Eh, well, so I hear you. You talk first.
oh, em. I think that on one hand, is good, sure that there's a system of handling, I don't know of controlling eh, what the
the kids can watch, or the type of movie or material that, they are making for a type of um, of particular audience, but
yes
eh, if we are talking about kids also part of the responsibility is also of, of the parent
Correct. Well, look that in that we fully agree. Eh, I think that those classifications are indeed necessary.
Aha
But but definitely, the most important and definite part, falls on the parents.
Hm mm
Because they are the ones who should be aware of what their kids are doing,
Hm mm
and, more or less according to their, their maturity, because well
Hm mm
no all the kids at twelve or fourteen are the same, the decide what they can and can't see.
Hmmm
This, I agree with.
And you, hmmm
Now, they ask, they asked something like this, eh, what was the question, they said the moral question or I don't know.
I don't remember, the PG, blah blah, I don't remember the classifications well.
yes, if they agree with that there should be a, a chip or something
Ah, yes yes, thanks I remember the
the chip that they're putting in the television
This
so the parents can control
this, great, this is really effective.  In fact all the cable companies now
Hmmmm
are offering this, this helps and I think it's really important.
I think it's like a po- aha.
But we come back to the same thing, if the parents don't use this, well we win nothing.
Hmmm
We don't win anything, so, aside from the class-
yes
from the same classification, that's a help to a parent, they also need to be aware of what to do, or better, whoever's watching the kid, and decide himself if it's appropriate or not.
Sure, but on the channel, uh, Univision, forty one, there, em, they had a report on this, of the games the games
Ah
kids' games, how they made Nintendo, or like Playstation
But we're referring to games, the video games, yes.
that, video games have categories too, and that
It's this.
sometimes the parents let them, because the kids want the game that's the most
No, and, and they don't know the contents.
Hmm
But in reality the topic of today should include this part that I think it's the most problematic for today.  The video games, more than television itself
Hmmmm
All those that are, all the, that's coming now with video games is incredible, and one or the other, well most adults, well I don't know about you, but
Hmmm
most adults, we don't even know what it's about.
Exactly.
And, all the contents that are sometimes so violent and so
Hmmm
racist, too.
Hmm
The internet too, they're also using the internet a lot, since they're little, and sometimes the parents don't supervise them.
yes yes This, I remember that they came out with the, ah, with a protection when the Internet came out at the beginning, so the parents would buy
a system to be able to control the access that the young kids have to, to certain Internet pages. And
yes
And I don't know if it's more like a business, or or, or, if its' really a system to be able to prevent, eh, eh
that type of content.
Well I know that -AOL, which is where I have the subscription, has a very effective filters program,
Hm mm
and, at the time of registering, of opening an account for, for a kid, they ask the age, and if is
Hm
under twelve, has
Hm mm
certain filters, and is oh until fifteen others, and then the adults.
Hm mm You have kids then.
No.
Oh, you don't have, okay.
No, but I've been aware of that, and nieces and nephews, and I've been close to them.
Hm mm
And so I know what it's about, and I've opened accounts there There, well, once again we go to the same thing, the parents, well,
Hm
eh, the parents are definitely the ones that play the determinant role there.
yes hm mm
About cinema, that was the initial question, well honestly I find the qualifications very clear and
Hm hm hm
the way they are, then it's up to every theater who they let in and who not. The control is effective
yes
But there is a problem. Many eh, youngsters, kids and youngsters, have access to the DVDs
Hm mm
yes, they don't need to go to he cinema to watch certain movies
Hm mm
You know, the advanced world is confused to the extreme, and the supervision is definitely the parents duty
yes
unfortunately they are not doing it
Yes, but maybe, em ,the system could also help when they do, how is it in spanish?,
eh, some programs, like that program with Janet Jackson in that show,
Yes
she sung and showed a breast on the TV, that was pre-recorded
yes
and shows also. Maybe that would help a little to set a, a classification of what kind of
show or movie also
of
that, inlfuence
yes yes yes, that is also right
Aha
It's easier t do it when they are prerecorded that if they are live
yes, right
But, definitely, what you just said, education, education and more education
Hmmm
Now, about the contents themselves, despite classification, what do you think? About what we are seeing, or what is being shown.
On TV, let's say
Well, on TV they are showing much more than they showed before
It takes a lot, yes
And, I don't know, children are learning more explicit things that, that when I was a kid
yes, absolutely. That is another part, eh, or another subject of, of
E-
another part of this subject that can be touched, and there
Hm
the government does have to act, the contents,
Hm mm
have definitely changed too much
Hm mm
No, in fact, I've sometimes sat down to watch the cart-, the cartoons kids watch nowadays and was stupefied. I didn't watch that
yes
The, the cartoons I watched were very, very innocent
Hmm, Innocent. It's not
Now, in cartoons and
Hmm
TV or internet, you only see violence, you see incredible things
yes, more aggressiveness
A lot of aggressiveness, even racism, insults, and it's supposedly geared towards kids from six or seven
Hmm
They're going to grow up seeing that as normal
Yes. That's transferred to the attitude later, to behaviors in school, uh, yes. They've made studies about that. And there's, there's a connection between what they see and what they do sometimes
yes
Sometimes, in
No, the point is that, the point is that I read, I don't remember where, that a singer, not so famous, I don't know, that underground music
Hmm
in a show, he gouged his eye out, I don't know, and after that, one of the fans went home and did the same thing
hmm
I mean, they follow
Hmm
or they have their idols and they really see them as Gods.
hm mm
It's incredible.
That mm, also has, that, a , a little complicated, problem, in general, because there's also like no supervision, sometimes, the parents, there's no, um
knowledge of what they are listening to, I don't know I don't want, don't want to just blame the singer in that case, right. Because I think that
a teenager or something like that, has a lot, eh, has a low self esteem, well, that too, it's partly influential what is
yes
what's happening also in the house, or or in the type of advice that kid is getting. Or not getting
Is true, is true. yes, is that, it all leads to the same, the parents are decisive, and many times they leave their child's education in the hands of could be, the television, I don't know.
Hm mm And the control, how much, how much television they can watch or not watch.
And especially the quality. Because yes, the television, and especially in this country, is very rich, there's a lot to see.
For hm, hm. yes
There are plenty of channels, and there are some very good ones, and very entertaining. I for example, well I'm happy watching channels like Natural Geographic or the History Channel
Hm mm Hm, hm mm
Eh, in all these travel channels,
yes, hm mm
that are very good, the documentaries, or kids, if the parent sits down with him to watch it, and to explain what he knows, the kid will feel very entertained and fascinated watching those adventures with real animals.
Hm mm, hm, mm.
But no, they put them to watch the same cartoons as always, and they think that's the only thing there is.
Sure
That
No, uh, it's getting list, that, also, that contact, that relationship here, i believe more in the United States than anywhere else.
Yeah, believe it or not, that's gonna have a world wide influence, and they
with all this stress, with all this, it's all
uh, all those shows about, about, aimed for children, the massive ones, they are in the whole world.
Yes, uh, there is little attention, i think, at home. But it's, it's trending, uh, it's, it's getting harder to keep that relationship
with, with the, with the children at home
Exactly, exactly, and the movies, it's the same. In fact, i was reading that there is a crisis now in Hollywood, the box offices aren't responding, well, they don't know what's happening
Well, i, i think the answer is simple
Uh um
That they're starting to [they need to] show something else, because yeah, we are tired from watching the same thing. All those
Yes
Adventure movies, and fantasies that don't ultimately transmit anything, they don't teach anything
Yeah, of course
We have to, we have to search for more educational contents
Right
That's it, from there
They lack a lot of education, even though they say they're educating the, uh, uh, father with, with the, with that kind of
of codes, like PG-13 or etc, they
Hi
Hi, how are you?, nice to meet you. Luisa, from Miami, Florida
Ho, what's up?, Paulo speaking here from Philadelphia
How are you?
What's up, how are you doing?, fine?
Well, very well
Where are you from?
Colombian
Oh, colombian. Yesterday i spoke to a Colombian boy, or the day before, i can't remember. Yeah, what a coincidence. Uh, well, did you understand something about the subject for today, about the movies?
Well, i tried
I didn't understand a thing, a lot. The truth is i have no idea, the only thing i think is good is that they're blocking
uh, the violent programs for the kids, nothing else, that's the only thing i understood, after that, the rest of the acronyms i have no idea what they're about, do you?
As far as i understood, it was the specification of the movies, when they say PG, PG fourteen it means that they can't be seen if they're not older than fourteen, and if they are violent or what do i know. But that's true, i didn't
Uh
i don't understand a thing
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, very well, no, no, not like, the truth is i have no idea about that, so
Of course
Well, also
But we should talk about something similar, what kind of movies do you like to watch?
What kind of movies?, see, i like the Argentinian movies very much, the, well, from all Latin America, all of them, i like adventure movies
the war ones I don't like at all. What else? Everything that has to do with, I like a lot the ones that have to do with travel you see? Or
Or the characters that are traveling around the world. Like that I can see some scenery. I like those movies a lot. So well. And you?
For me horror movies.
The horror movies? No
Yes, and the comedies also, the funny ones. I like them a lot, yes.
Ah really. Look at that.
The ones I like the least are the action ones, ah, one gets too bored there watching unrealistic things and things like that. No, I don't like them.
Yes, no no. I only like adventure ones, of travel.And I like a lot I tell you, well the Latin American ones I like a bunch.
No, nothing. But, ah, is more than anything because I like to watch the problems and the
The Latin American ones
scenery, but is more than anything for that, eh, just for that. So well, every time that
Mm.
rent, try to rent when I rent something like that where there's something of traveling.
And the Latin American ones from what country have you seen? Only the ones from Argentina or from another area?
I saw some Brazilians, I saw one Colombia that, now I don't remember the name.
Maria, full of grace.
That one is good, I saw it.
Aha.
Look, did you like it?
I loved it.
And it's, is it similar to reality?
A lot, yes, that's the reality, yes
Yes?
It's just that girl, i mean that bitch, this young lady reflects poor people, they are the people from Colombia that live in poor areas
that have a very hard time to survive, do you understand me?, like the people from the streets
Yes, right
That's, that's it. More or less, like people from the streets
Is it hard to live in Colombia?, is that how they showed the movie?
No, it's not so, it's not, that's why I'm telling you
It's not so, sure, that's the kind
What they reflect there is the poor class, the lowesr class.
The lower class, the marginal
Exactly
Oh, right, oh, oh, oh, well
But
Well, i saw that one, and then i saw another that i can't remember what's it called, that this... worked there, this model, Maria?, uh, I'm asking my wife
this model, what's her name?, she's colombian, right?, the movie we say
Oh
That was there with this boy that, with Diego Torres, do you know him, Diego Torres?, yes
Oh, Angie, Angie Cepeda, right?
Ah, the one singing? Angie Cepeda, there he is. A film we watched with her.
Oh, Pantaleon and the
Pantaleon and don't know what. It was good that one, I enjoyed it.
I didn't watch it, but I watched the trailer on a Peruvian channel.
Yes, it's a good one. Pantaleon and I can't remember what else. Really good, like from a story. Very good,  I liked that film very much. It's the only two I watched.
Yes.
And and later I've not watched much more, I don't remember the the names very much. Er ah Well, later I watched that one, motorcycle diary, that one that's the story of. Yes, did you see it? Yes.
Which one?
That one about Che Guevara, from when he just did the trip from Argentina to don't know where, to Mexico. Motorcycle diary.
Oh, no no. Never
That a Grammy won the song, the musical theme won a a Grammy, didn't it? Or an oscar, I can't remember, an important prize. So I watched it.
And and well, I don't know, a lot. And now I don't remember all the titles but I've seen a lot. And then from Spain I also watched a lot, too.
I
No, I'm all day watching films.
I watched a film I really liked which was based on a real story from the Dominican Republic. It's called In the time of the butterflies.
In the time
with Salma Hayek.
Oh really?
Yes, have you never seen it?
Ah. No, I'll take note right now. In the time of the butterflies.
From the butterflies, with Salma Hayek.  It's a really great film.  It talks about something that happened in the Dominican Republic.
Aha.
And a rebellion that happened there against the president and shows a lot of things.  Really, really, really good.
In the time of butterflies.  Well, I will rent it.  Really good for the date.  Aha, so good.  And what's the temperature there now?
Ah.  Right now they said that it was going to drop to forty nine, at night.  More like at nine, it starts to drop to, they said, like fifty or forty nine.
Aha, oh.
But it's not as cold as in the north.
No, yes.  Well, here it's been pretty good, eh.
What temperature is it now?
No, now it's forty something.  Let's see how many What temperature does it say in the machine, Maria?  You don't know what the temperature is?  Yes, there.  It's forty som-
But in Fahrenheit.  We're talking about centigrade.  Thirty something, ah, yes, One or two degrees centigrade.  Yes, thirty something.
But for us that's little.  In the winter it gets pretty
Ah, good.
good.
And how long have you lived there?
Only a year.  No, a very short time. You?
It will be, it will be two years on the twenty first.
Two years?
Yes.
Ah, not a lot of time either.
No, it's not much
So, well
But, well
Yeah, a year, so, well, are you working?
It's usual. I was studying, i just finished high school
Right
And now I'm in, i'm going to college, but not until February
Oh, that's good, that's good. I'm working here. I'm working in cleaning now, in cleaning
Right
And well, i was working as, i was working in the construction and nothing, because i
And in the, and what you're working in now, isn't it hard?
At cleaning?
Yes, no, i mean. But the thing is, my mom was working with a thing called, that were the recently build apartments, that they had to clean them before they handed them to the people that was going to live there
Right
So, my mom came home very tired. She told me: "that blows", because she had to remove the concrete from the walls and everything the... left
Uh
the painters and all that, isn't it like that?
No, no, no, no. The truth is that the job i now is very, very easy. No, not at all, it's offices
Oh
Offices, so it's really easy. No, i have to do the
Ah, good.
the vacuum cleaner there,  mm and a bathroom, the desks and nothing more, because all that. Everything is clean, everyday you have to do the same time.
Is even kind of boring, but is very very peaceful.
Listen, and you how, I'm sorry to be so indiscreet, how old are you?
How old am I?
Yes.
Thirty three.
Thirty three, oh okay.
Yes. And I was working in a job like the one you were describing, like that, cleaning construction stuff and all that. No, that is
a killer. Killer, terrible. I was removing cement and all those things.
Yes.
It was terrible, I would get home exhausted, but well. Well, it paid well, so at that moment until I found this job which is easier I was working in that.
Aha, oh really how good. And are you working in anything right now?
No, at this moment, no.
Vacations.
Vacations.
How nice. Beach?
Beach? No well with this cold, what beach.
Is too cool right?
Yes, it's too cool. Too much to go to the beach. One goes and freezes.
Yes.  Sure, sure, sure, of course.  And what's there to do here aside from, there's a lot who go to the beach, what's there to do there in Miami?
In Miami, hmm, there's a lot of things, there's museums, there's parks, there's
Sure, that's good, eh.
there are clubs, the best are the clubs.
The, Aha.
at night, on the weekends.  There are really big malls on the side of the bay and there are many things to do, many.
How nice.  No, here in winter it's really boring.  Here winter is terrible.  It's to eat and drink beers.
Yes.
And watch TV and eat and watch the TV.  You always put on some kilos here in winter, because there's nothing to do.  It's not nice to go out, like
we don't go out any more than necessary, you know?
Yes.
So, no, not the same at all.  I would really like to go to Miami, the truth is we're going to see if we can.
Really, oh.
I would really like to go to Miami.  We'll see if my wife and I can have an
You should
escape.  Yes, yes, yes yes,
And it's really pretty, it's really beautiful.
Yes, yes.  No, here it's nice too, it has it's good parts, it's nice parts, but
Yes.  Is it small or big, what's it like?
No, it's big here.  Philadelphia is really big.  Huge.  What happens is that there's a terrible climate because in summer it's incredibly hot, but so hot that you can't go out
And in the winter, it has extreme temperatures, and during the winter there's a cold... with continuous below-zero temperatures and it's not good at all. The only good thing is that it has a beautiful spring
And a very pronounced autumn too, very nice. But winter and summer are very pronounced and ugly things, i mean, mostly the summer, the summer is terrible.
the summer here is terrible, you can't even, if you don't have air conditioning, a good equipment in your home
Uh huh
you're in for a bad time for sure, yes, yes, yes, it's very important to have good air conditioning
But is there humidity or not?
Yes, horrible, heavy, super heavy, yes, yes, yes, i mean, it makes me remember Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires is like that too, all concrete, heat, humidity all day, crushing, that you have to be with
with the fan on, the fan all day in your face because you can't do anything. But well, it goes away, you live it, it's nice anyway. I'm telling you, it has its charm
I'd like more to be in Miami, to tell the truth. Yeah, we're from an Argentinian city where there is
Yes
beaches and, well, nothing, we just miss that a little, the sea and all that, we miss it a lot.
But, you know what it's not good about Miami?, that you earn more, you earn little, and everything is very expensive
You earn little there?
Do you understand me?, you earn little
Yes?
Hello. My name is Celiana.
Good evening, my name is Nancy.
How is it going Nancy? How are you?
Fine, thanks. Celiana, where are you from?
From Ah, from Argentina and now I live in Boston and now I'm in Miami.
Oh, I'm from Colombia and I live in New York.
Ah, how nice.
Good no
And in what part of New York?
I'm in Manhattan.
Ah, how nice. I like it a lot. I like it to go visit. I don't know if to live.
Mm. Suddenly visiting, is nice. One already.
What?
Like for a visit, one lives here because of necessity.
Sure, okay. yes, It's true.
that today's topic is housing.
yes. I just honestly don't understand when they say eh that is a
Uh uh.
what does it mean?
imagine the benefits, ugly, the guarantees there are of buying or renting something I imagine, no, I don't know because I understood about the bubble.
Ah, I also never understand when they talk to me. And the truth that a lot of
yes.
the topic I'm not, not too aware because I came to live here for a few years, to work. I'm not thinking of living here, so I'm not even planning on buying so I'm not aware, I don't know if you are aware.
yes I'm a little bit aware of that but at the moment because I'm renting I rent an apartment
yes.
but all of a sudden one does have to think in that, instead of paying rent you will buy to get something for yourself. Because you will paying something that's yours.
Sure.
yes. But, as far ah, let's say the finances it becomes hard because if one rents an apartment you don't pay the water, and at least here you don't pay the heat
Sure yes.
If I get a house I have to pay the water, the light, the heat. Absolutely everything.
Sure.
My insurance and all of it then.
Sure.
It would be, it would be the best. But who do you rent from?
Would you live here? Are you going to stay to live here in the United States or is just for a short time?
yes, No I am staying
Sure, then you would have to see what's the best for you, right?
yes the possibility of looking and saying well what are the benefits and
Sure.
because you see a lot of housing of duplex for two families.
yes, your family
yes, then you don´t know why suddenly find a bad, a bad neighbor
Of course.
And the situation get complicated.
And with so many Hollywood movies about neighbors, you don´t feel like.
yes, no, you don´t know that
You get scared.
then you don´t think about buying there.
How?
Are you going to stay here for a while?
Of course I am renting a place An if, by now I have a three years contract. my idea is not to stay here.
Uh, uh.
Then that is what I am going to do.
yes. yes.
But But no, but if you want to stay here to live like in any other place in the world, to me is that if you can is convenient to buy
yes.
And pay like if you were renting.
yes, and you have something for you, for your children.
Of course like a credit and paying a loan and all that stuff yes, it is okay because tomorrow you will have your own house.
yes. yes that is true.
And
Is that girl the location and all.
sure the problem is that one has to be very sure of everything because is one time and that's it. The sames as after when once, once is yours
you can buy it and rent it and you rent something else with the same money.
yes, yes that's true. It seems the rents here are very expensive.
yes, in Boston also. They are very expensive.
yes?
yes. I live in a good neighborhood in Boston in a two bedroom with a roommate and we pay one thousand five hundred and sixty.
Mm.
It doesn't have a laundry or anything
Well.
three floors by stairs
yes.
and
I also live on the third floor and there's no elevator well there is a laundry on the first floor but is not from the building.
and in ah. And by what part of Manhattan do you live?
Is in the one hundred twenty fifth.
Ah, that's where one takes the bus to go to the airport.
Uh uh. yes. Before it was really bad around that area but no it has already gotten much better is commercial and there are a lot of remodeled housing.
yes.
yes, everything is much better because before it was really dangerous.
Ah, And you have a little son, did I hear?
Hmm, yes, here he his.  I was giving him little things to eat.  But he's here with his story, eating his things now,
Ah.
yes but the housing, it's true.  And the rents here are expensive too.  Where I am it's cheap.
Ah, how much does it cost, for example, a two bedroom?
I have one of two rooms and I pay seven hundred or six hundred dollars.
Ah, good.
Hmm.  But we say that it's for my baby and ofr me.
Sure.
For just one person the rent is difficult
Sure.  Sure.
like this.  Suddenly they exist one morning to have the, where I go and in my old age and in his youth,
Sure, but this you have to get out of the city and travel a lot, then, to work.
yes.  No we say that here there's a close part that's called New Jersey.  It's pretty.
yes.
And I was looking and yes it's expensive where I looked.
Sure.
But, but yes, I wanted something small.
Sure.
that it's safe and all that. it's expensive.
Right, that's in here like my sister lives in El Doral that's like uh thirty minutes from the beach
Mm.
in Miami. In a neighborhood with a fountain and all that in a in a duplex home. It's really big with a yard
Mm. It must be expensive.
no, ninety thousand.
Wow, no it's not too expensive.
Right, it's much more accessible here, New York, Boston are the most expensive cities in the United States.
The most expensive ones, yea.
But well the salaries are higher too.
yea a bit. Here's it's well not much just the minimum wage. They raised it a little while ago. Eighty five
Right, yea.
Mm. Yes but I
And how long have you lived here in the United States?
Five years.
Ah, a while?
And I've been here for five years.
Ah. Is it cold right now in New York?
it's pretty cold right now. Yea, on Christmas day the twenty fifth it was raining all day.
oh,
Already the temperature is going to go down again.
Ah, okay.
This covered.
Ah.
Because in Boston is also quite cold, right?
yes, yes, is colder than in New York.
yes.
It snows more. But well now I'm in the pool. Today I'm here in Miami is
yes, well.
Another climate one can say. how incredible how the same country is.
And the, yes the climate is totally different.
The climate, the language, the
Oh.
yes, and here only Spanish is spoken.
I uh. That's good. Only one is missing.
yes. yes. Sometimes one needs it, true.
And your sister is thinking of staying to live, yes?
No, no, she doesn't know.
Neither? I'm still doubtful.
yes, for the issue of raising the kids.
yes
Is not that what I also think, some other day, if I'm having new children, I don't know if I would like to raise them here
Well, I'm starting to raise this one here, let's see how that ends
Sure, how old is he?
It's 5 months old
Oh
it's a little baby
Sure he is, and sure, you take care of him any time?
I'm working two days per week
Sure
And well, to help with something, because, it does not survive with two days, It runs out, it gets mad
Sure
problems when they run out of, and then I was paying, Because it  would make me move, because I work in New Jersey and I found a home in New Jersey
Oh
And to get anyway, a babysitter and all that, is so complicated
yes, right?
yes, because you don't know to whom you are leaving him?
Sure, that's complicated and daycare is really expensive
Uff, like $300 per week
yes, here my friends, with kids in Boston, is like $1500 per moth
Mm.
yes, is like something like that. It's really expensive.
Is not enough. It's easier for me to find housing in New Jersey and live there.
Sure.
as if, yes but in reality all this is expensive.
Sure. yes the truth is that is very expensive and one sometimes thinks where do you live better if in Colombia or in Argentina or here, right?
Uh uh. Here there are some guarantees that you don't have over there, work, here you can find, not in Colombia.
Sure.
But everything is that one also has to look because
yes.
you have to think of him. That's why I'm looking at a little house, but a small house. Not a big house.
Sure.
yes.
yes, well. But something is something.
yes, also. yes, yes, because I have to to think of leaving something to him.
Sure, one also thinks that.
Mm.
that leaving a property is something secure
yes, yes, at least one is not going to be thinking about where you will leave your stuff or from here to tomorrow one never knows.
Sure.
yes. yes, in reality I didn't understand what they said about the bubble.
me neither no I tell you, what Spanish was that. To whom are they speaking to,
Bubble?
Mexican, to Puerto Rican, to whom? Because I didn't understand.
To me bubble is like I don't know, the soap makes its, the bubble, something. Or one
Sure.
a car but I don't know if it is
yes, we also use it for the same thing but sometimes we say you live in a bubble like to say that
Something very beautiful, very special there isn't.
sure and that you don't know any other thing but your world, your school, your country club
Mm.
and your relatives, right?
Oh.
That's living in a bubble to us.
For. yes.
No? Because sometimes. Ah, I didn't know this happened in my city, well you, what' wrong? do you live in a Bubble?
Oh.
No, We use it this way but just the same I didn't understand
I didn't understand either, if I return the call that is about the bubble they already didn't stay as such
yes, but the same I think that the topics are so we know what to talk about, there's no need to talk about that the whole time
Um, yeah, because it's not
sometimes, so i start talking and i don't talk, i don't talk about it, right?, because the other day, just the other day i spoke to a girl that lives in Philadelphia, Argentinian incidentally
and she knows [mutual] friends, and we stayed talking about that. And how we work in the same, so we didn't even remember what subject we had to talk about
You know, you started talking, he's Spanish and keep talking on your own. But it's nice because I've met other people
Sure
yeah, different cultures
Yes
Yeah, i
Yeah, super interesting. It's fun to me, and, well you can also make a little money at the same time
Uh huh
Oh
yeah, it was necessary
Of course, it always come in handy
No, nothing, even better
Uh
Yeah, so, right?
Yes
And how long will you be there in Miami?
Yeah, I'm now here with my sister, she has, i have a two years old nephew
Uh huh, so sweet
And now he's called Oliver and now my sister is expecting her second child and that's where it gets complicated.  So my mom is coming
Next week and she'll stay here for a bit.
Hello How is it going?
How is it going this is Paula speaking? What?
eh,
How are you?
Manuel's speaking, I'm in Orlando, Florida. Where are you?
Boston.
eh, in Boston, Massachusetts.
Massachusetts
I believe that
aha
I believe that we've talked once. But well, eh, getting into the matter, getting into the matter, tell me your impressions on today's topic.
yes Today's topic renter or buyer, and look, I think that if you have, enough money, is much better to buy than rent.
yes
It seems to me, no, I think that too much of my money is wasted on renting, that's money you don't get back. in
Correct.
yes, I definitely think, it's more advantageous to buy, the thing is that until last year I was a student. Here in Boston the prices are super expensive, then it's also the lack of possibility to do that.
yes.
No,
aha
I don't know what,
well, no, yes, yes, finish, I'll be right there,
yes, tell me, that's my opinion, if I could buy it, as I said, I don't know how long will I be staying here, I don't know if it'll suit me
what do I know, if I'm to stay here for a long time, sure, but I rather lease it
sure, sure
and you,
Well, I completely agree with you, the truth is that it'd be better to own one and see how can you do it, to capitalize something.
In this case, real state, but the truth is that the, the prices are unaffordable, where I live, well, everyday, I'm sad because I can see that they are inaccessible.
They are charging huge prices for the properties.
Oh yes,
Look, I lived in New York, where, as you said, those are big cities where housing is really expensive, so I was never able to
yes
I thought that it'd be different here, I've been here for a year, for over a year and this is happening again
yes
It's a bubble, as they put it in the entrance, well
that's right.
a bubble, I don't know when it's going to burst but for the moment, this bubble is growing everyday.
so, do you think that it's not okay to buy right now?
No.
because of the bubble.
exactly, prices are so expensive, I don't think that the houses are valued that much.
yes
and any day the bubble can burst and go down, all the prices hit rock bottom and then look that, that the one that bought so expensive, all of a sudden will find himself with,
with the fact that he's losing money.
sure, sure, do you also think that you lose more money than the one you are losing renting.
eh, well renting hurts a lot every month.
I don't know why
But, but is that, but is that, eh, not only by what can happen when the bubble busts, but, How do you do it to give a down payment now?
when you are going to buy a house and they tell you that the cheapest one, it's two hundred, two hundred fifty thousand dollars.
mm
Then you need to have handy at least some twenty thousand, dollars, thirty thousand.
Sure, sure, sure.
So that you don't stay, because that's another thing, there are those, that finance you that part of the initial payment or down payment but that, you'll see later those mortgages because I know people with mortgages
or amortizations of three thousand dollars people that are working, twenty four hours, practically to be able to pay that. oh,
Sure.
people that are not really enjoying it that are living in their basement practically and the house is rented to be able to pay it. Which that doesn't make sense.
Sure, Sure.
Because it's sacrificing yourself too much, the quality of life deteriorates a lot.
No that of the, I had a roommate that she was the owner of the apartment she was young, see, and since her parents helped her.
yes
and what she did was, she had a three bedroom apartment.
True.
So we rented two places, and she was in the third.  And with my rent and that of the other girl, we payed the mortgage.
Ah, good, even, well good the advantage that she had, well also it's that alone, no.
Sure, sure, you don't have
So, but, but, well it's not ideal, and there are more dramatic cases still like I told you, and they're real because they're not so,
so, stuck in.  People who are there definitively, well,
Sure.
go crazy because they can't pay these high mortgages.
yes
So it's when you start to do the account, and see where it comes out, at least in my case, for the moment I have to comply with
yes
keep paying the lease and they we'll see
Sure and I don't have an option either so I don't worry too much.  No, I tell you, it's more, I tell you, living in Boston is so expensive.
yes
that I have to live with a roommate
definitely, and the big cities, New York is the same, I also had a roommate, it was indispensable because,
Sure.
and and well any small one-room apartment, something like that, one thousand dollars.  Really expensive, really expensive, so
Sure if one, one bedroom can be two thousand dollars there.
Exactly in these big cities it's very difficult.  Now that I'm speculating a bit, if you had the option to buy, where would you like to buy here in the United States?
here.
Lets,so lets have a fantasy.
eh,
there in Boston or, or in another place, in another city.
I tell you, I tell you, the question is that Boston is too expensive. Then, with the same money I could buy something smaller. over ther,
with the same money that I buy one bedroom here in another place I have a five room house
That is correct.
Then, that, is the doubt. Eh, but otherwise, I am a biochemist, no, and right now I am doing investigations in Kansas.
Really.
then there are not many places where I can go to do biotechnology. Then it must be here or in California.
ah, look, of course.
And, and the question is that California is the same or even more expensive than here.
yes, yes definitely.
Then, what I would do, is, and I have not a car either, then I would have to buy a house in the outside of Boston,
In the,
and buy a car.
yes in, those states is necessary. necessarily you must have a car.
yes I would need it.
because everything is far. Well you see it, you say something that is true. sometimes you cannot buy where you want but when things are easier and the profession is determinant.
Of course.
yes, that's true, that would have to be there or in California, well something I would point, and has to deal with  today's topic is that the government does so little
to inform and inform in a side to new buyers, at least the ones buying for the first time
yes
and well, to put in rule, as they say, or well, being in touch to the sellers, with more strict laws, because I think the market is to open
yes, in the Massachusetts State, for example
And in the last, the
they help to buy, the ones that want to buy a hose and they make less that $70000 a year
yes, and let's say that information flows and people has a hand, because, where I live, in Florida, it's
yes
I don't have an idea, and I have even look on the internet and I can find the general things of the central government, but here exactly in Florida, I can't find anything
yes
I mean, we are lacking some promulgation, because they must do it, and having specific programs for first time buyers, they must
they must install that, wait, it does not appear, because it must be a help, at least in the first house you buy
Obviously, I totally agree with you, Manuel, you told me, not
yes, Manuel
I agree, and that's impossible, but,from other side, are you Mexican Manuel?
No, Colombian
Colombian, well, I don't know how Colombia is, but in Argentina, also, the apartments in dollars, they are expensive, the same or less than here
Well, yes, in Colombia there was a real state boom and well, it ended in a recession
sure
But it can't compare to the prices here, definitely not. Never
ha
Never, because
But, anyway, buying an apartment there would be difficult right now. At least, there are no credits there, here at least you get thirty year mortgages
If you know you are going to stay here, I don't know which are your intentions, but if you are going to stay long here
It is like somehow the dream of owning your house is reachable. I think that would be almost impossible in Buenos Aires
yes, yes, suer. This is another consideration, because we, almost all of us have one foot here and the other in our origin countries
Sure, yes
So, sometimes you think in the two places, buying there and buying here, to come and go
that would be ideal
yes, and many people make it, actually
I see
Many people do that, they invest there, and also here. I wish I could, I would like it myself
yes
eventually buying here, or buying in
yes
I mean, in any of the southern states, that are warmer, because I run away of New York because of the weather
Oh, wait a minute Manuel, hold on a second, yes, hold on a second
yes
Excuse me
Yes
the food's ready
Oh, that, that
Yes, and, well
No, no,
And how long have you been doing this Manuel, the phone calls?
Uh, i, i think that almost a month, i have done like fifteen calls
Oh, that's a lot, yes, i am doing only one a week
Yes, i have had some luck, because you see, sometimes they call you just four minutes before six, and they leave you there on the phone, and "wait, we'll get you a "
ah, and i hang up, because since i only have my phone, i like to talk nine minus five
To a partner, a partner, and i to, i too, i hang up too then, but then, sometimes i forget to dial back and i stay there without calling, and other times
like today, i dial again and well, i get lucky, lucky, and i get in touch with someone immediately
Sure, sure, excellent, yeah, me too, At first i called until seven, but now since i only have my cellphone, it eats a lot of minutes, because in the end it ends up being like fifteen
Right
So, i want to call for nine minus five, so it's only five minutes
Yeah, yeah we're, you know, yeah I'm like at fifteen
very good, and did you know that if you do five different phones, they
James, New York.
Hello, Hello, Marcela, from North Carolina
Marcela from North Carolina?
Yes.
Marcela, but there are no Argentinians in North Carolina?
There are a few
Really?
yes, yes. There a few.
Wow, in what part of North Carolina?
I'm in Fayetteville.
Oh, it must be over there, because I was there and I was in a few towns there, there were, I hardly saw any Hispanics, much less
eh, Argentinians.
yes. Ah, well, there are many more Hispanics now. How long ago was it that you visited, that you were here?
Oh. Last year.
Ah.
yes.
Well, yes, because comparing it to New York, because you said you were in New York
yes. I'm in New, New York. yes.
Well, and compared to New York, yes, no, there's hardly any Latins but when we got here in eighty seven, there was no one. You could speak in Spanish that the only ones that understood you were the soldiers that had gone to Panama.
But not now, now, there are some.
Ah, yes? By coincidence I'm from Panama.
Ah, look at that.
Look, what a small world, right?
yes, yes.
And what, tell me, do you own or rent?
No, eh, we own.  This
Ah, sure, from eighty seven.  I imagine.
yes, yes, we never thought that we would be able to own a place because we came here to Los Angeles and we are both artist, even though my husband, crazy, musician, had been in the army,
even though now he's not in the army any more.  But
Aha.
we never thought we'd be able to have a house, but, well this house, we rented it, and after the owner put it up for sale
For sale.
and I said, well, what would be need to buy the house?  And we started to look into it and it ended up that we could buy the house, so we bought it.
Really?  How nice, thank God.
yes. yes.  But now it's almost there in this bubble that they're talking about
Aha.
here in North Carolina y es, no, it hasn't finished yet.  Many people who have moved here.
Aha.
This, many people from the north, especially who are coming to North Carolina.
Aha.
In a way, it's sad because it was all green and now, we have each time, less gree
And well, and also
Because, they build and build and they don't stop
Wow
yes
I have being with, well, I don't have the experience of what's really is construction and that because,
it's different to be in a place to replace something
yes
and you keep watching, are they building that new thing? or when they are doing other project, do you understand, right?
Yes
But, the bubble, I don't see it clear
That means that, by artificial ways, people is exited, because there is many immigration, from a place to other and
the value of proprieties increases in some places, goes up and up and does not stop, do you understand?. and then it's a bubble because at any moment
puff, the bubble blows and then the prices go down and then , people looses money and well, let's say, in North California, near San Francisco and you bought a house in
three million dollars
Yes
And once the bubble blows, that hose that you bought at three million dollars, maybe, if you are lucky, you can sell it for a million
Mmm
Do you understand?
And the interest you paid for the house also
Sure. Eh, the places become popular and the prices go up and go up, the go up because the people start to, they don't care, the issue is to live there, and then the people pay whatever
and that, and that creates artificial values that sooner or later
Aha, here
everything goes down, everything normalizes.
yes, here in New York you are not going to have that kind of problem, because it always increases, increase it always increases though there's no, the time I've been here I haven't experienced any type of bubble.
You understand?
yes, yes. Always everything goes up, except after nine eleven that the properties went down a little.
Because always here, it went down, went down, and yes but for the worst because they've gone up terribly.
yes. I know, and we are, we
And right now must be more expensive than ever
We would love to live in, in, in New York, I would love to live in New York, but
yes.
How do we live? What do we do? Ah, you understand? Is, is, very hard.
Mm, but like that I see how you started North Caroline yes is to New York.
And, yes, My husband now works again one one of emergency
Aha.
So maybe he, um, could do some sort of transfer, right? I don't know
Aha, yes
he would have to find a eh, job there.
Aha.
But everything is so expensive, the cost of life is very expensive there
Yes, when, when was the last time you were over here?
Look, the last time i was there was on two thousand?
Uh huh
three, two thousand and three, yes, two thousand three. Because or older son graduated from Tisch, the one in NYU, the Art School
Right
And so, uh, that was the last time
Oh, well, then
But we went there twice a year, more or less, the three years he was in college, because he finished it quickly
Art School, uh, my, right?, school, house of artists then
Yes, yes, yes, yes. The, unfortunately not, we didn't, uh, any veterinarian, any dentist, any profession that could help us a little
Well, maybe if you, uh, if you wanted or need the family then, you still have time, you still have time
I don't think so, i don't
It's not, it's not hard to convince a boy of what, what you really want
Uh, but it's, he's earning, uh, he's a dan-, he's a dancer and he dances with a company called Pilobolus, and it's started that famous art, uh, modern dance
Right, here in New York
And i, yes, well, they, the company is in Connecticut, but they dance in New York every summer for five, six, five, six weeks in that theater named Joyce
Right
Joyce Theater?, and and he earns well, and he travels all around the world.
Right, yes, uh, well, you see?
And it was really well, and the oldest is 23 yo and the youngest is 17 yo, and he is a guitarist
He plays classic, jazz, everything and he will keep that, Is what he loves, what I would have to say?, Go and do something that bores you?
yes, exactly
Meanwhile he is going to college there is no problem
At least you are not worried, because they already built their life and now you are resting in North Carolina, even if there is not much to do there
Yes, that's the only thing I would like. Being in New York and going to the theater, I'm an actor and I produce, I work here but
Here, also
it's far, far from everything
And you see, because you have a house there and she
yes, and we can't complain, but it's boring sometimes
To much and well, I lived, I lived, but
Mmm
yes, to see
yes, and where do you work?
I'm
Hello?
And I had some accounts there in cloth
Mmm
But then I stayed, a day, next to them and then I stayed other day to return quiet
so, you entered and then left
then
Hello? What?
So no, no, eh.
Is, are you talking to me on a cellular?
yes.
Ah, yes, because every now and then, I lose you
yes, eh, is a, is a cellular I'm talking from.
yes.
Although, ah no, I'm not home, that's what happens. You are talking to me here and so
Uh um. Ah, well, yes, every now and then, I lose you.
Are you talking from a cellular?
No, no, I'm talking on my house phone.
Um, what do we talk about of all, eh, at least of the, the, yes, is it necessary that you have your house? It feels like realizing
yes, the truth yes. We have something.
Aha.
yes, if something happens, we have something.
yes, and then one feels better, for example there's already uh
A, a place.
Not just the fact that I imagine that the difference between renting, to being an owner is really, is big.
And yes because, eh, the only thing is that when you rent and something breaks, eh, you call someone and they fix it.
And yes and
In exchange, as an owner, if something breaks, you have to fix it or you have to pay
You have to exactly.
and you fix it, so there you start
yes, but since you have insurance, that this is your, eh, you know
ah, ah, yes yes yes yes yes.
That, it's not, the day when you want to really go to New York, you're going to sell this, and take the money and bring it there and buy a little apartment or a house.
yes, well, I'll buy a place.
You don't have to study, yes, a place exactly, uh.
A place, because there things are worth a lot of money, I can't imagine myself
yes.  But you don't believe, if you look you really have the opp-, every now and then there's a good opportunity.
No, this is true, this is true, and yes and
yes.  For example, I had the opportunity to get an apartment and eh, it's now worth three times what I payed for it
Uh, you were really lucky.  Fantastic.
Yes so, this was only in two years.
Uh, what a short time.
Yes, the person, in a year and something, in went up twice, and now it's three times more expensive.
Ah.
And yes, the bubble didn't break, like you say.  That I don't think, because here the value never goes down.
yes, it only goes up.
Here things have always been raising, I have never seen them going down
in what part of New York do you live in?
Eh, I am where Manhattan ends, at the very end of Manhattan. more to the north of
Oh, yes, yes
But the district is named
Uhum
And it's an area populated by Jewish and is quiet and clean, so
yes, yes, then properties rise
eh, peop- people who used to live there were older people who wanted, really closed apartments
Uhum
And I got to know it, and they told me, well we want this much but if you pat that much it's yours
Because they have a house and had no need for an apartment
Um. It had to be
Aha. Beut the feeling of owning is different
You were lucky
of owning and renting, you understand?
yes
Uhum
Besides, when you rent you are always, ah, at the expense of what the owner may want. If tomorrow he decides he wants the apartment, that's it!
Yes, right
At most they give you a month, three months, or whatever to move, you don't have an option, you have to go.
Uh-huh, yes, he, eh, and it's a
Hello?
Hello?
Is this Jorge? Who am I talking to?
Oh, My name is Blanca, I´m from Phoenix Arizona.
Oh, How are you? happy holidays
Oh, thank you, The same for you.
None
Mhm, Mhm. The weather is great.
Very good, I was born in Argentina
Mhm
Your accent sounds like you're from Colombia. Am i right?
Okay, yes, I´m from Colombia
oh What part of Colombia?
None
Oh, very good, yes, I know that place, It is Medellin they play more tango than Argentina.
Argentina Okay.
It is beautiful, Medellin is beautiful.
okay, Gardel died there.
I was there a few years ago.
Yes Garden died there right?
Yes, yes.  It's a really beautiful city.
Aha.
Well, the topic of today is housing.  They want us to talk about housing.  And I've never been to Phoenix, Arizona.
No.
Never, still.  No, no, no, no.  I've almost been to a place nearby to visit, that's called Scottsdale.
Scottsdale, aha, it's a city close to here.
Yes but, but after I couldn't go.  How far is it from Scottsdale to Phoenix, if you
Maybe a half hour.
That's it?
yes, no, it's right next to here, it's a city here
Close, yeah.
next to, to, to Phoenix
They say that Scottsdale is really pretty
Hmm, yes.
Yeah.  Well, so the housing in Phoenix, eh, how do you see it, Blanca.  Is it expensive to rent in Phoenix, Arizona?
Okay, ah, a year ago I came here to move to this state.  I lived in Boston, in Massachusetts,
Today in the east, on the east coast.
on the east cost.  So I moved and everything seemed so expensive that we decided to move here this year.
Look at that, look at that.
But without more or less everything went for the clouds.  A house that a year ago was worth one hundred thousand dollars is not worth two hundred and forty, fifty thousand dollars.
One hundred thousand dollars more.
Ah sure because you and your family are trying to ah, are trying or have bought, that's why.
yes, we bought.
Or are you trying to buy? Ah.
We already bought, already bought but ah Look, there's a huge difference between the states here, right?
It's incredible.
Because we had a house in Boston that what's worth five hundred sixty thousand dollars.
Ah, and you have ah
For that, we sold it for that amount.
That's good, very good
So, so No, but is is they are houses, they are old houses, old houses from many years ago and houses that have not been fixed but
they are very expensive. Housing over there is very expensive and what  you find a house here for, even though it's expensive again, eh the acquisition is more
more easy. The acquiring power here for the families to buy a  house is bigger. There are more possibilities in this state, at least,
from what I know that in Massachusetts.
Sure. Well, but then you bought a house for approximately one hundred forty thousand, you said.
No, no. We looked into it and it would costs us one hundred forty six thousand a year ago. In August it was a year. And we came here in May
and it already cost two hundred twenty three thousand dollars.
Eh. Two hundred what?
Two hundred twenty three thousand.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, From May to August.
From august to may
Oh, I see,
Then
And did they bought it?
Well, yes, because then, what do we do?, Do we keep paying rent to another one?
It has no sense
No, it has no sense, the
Well, but they kept their good profit
And, what I pay to someone else I can pay it better for me
Exactly
My rent, my own convenience
That, when you can do something like that is marvelous, that's really nice, it's perfect. Now you can see in Phoenix, the rents, How much can it be, for example?
in a really safe zone in Phoenix, Arizona, like an apartment, one bedroom
Like 800 pesos, 600, depends on the place
Depends, okay, exactly, well
Now, I'm renting, at this moment, I'm renting, I'm renting, because I will get my house now in May, more or less
Oh,
In fact my house is not even built
Oh, your house is on construction
mmm
oh is it under construction now or are they going to build it?
No, they are already building it.
Oh, how nice. But already in a couple of months you're moving into your own house.
Yes, and at this moment I pay for a house, and it's a new  house and it's a very good area and the house has three bedrooms, a living room, its
dining room, its kitchen and a little yard and a double garage. I pay two hundred dollars for the house.
Oh, but that's very good. If you go rent,
Mm.
that here in Los Angeles ah, oh mother, please
Ah. Yes.
for no, that I think that for that it would maybe cost four times more or something like that here in Lost Angeles
Mm, aha.
because California is very expensive.
California is like Massachusetts. My cousin lives in California. She bought an apartment, a townhouse with two small rooms for three hundred twenty thousand dollars.
In what area of California?
And already, and already used. She lives in Arcadia.
Ah, yes, yes, yes. As a matter of fact I spent the weekend, the night of the twenty fourth with some, a family, friends of mine from Ecuador in Arcadia. And look that, I don't know, Arcadia is
very big apparently, but the area I was in is very beautiful. Very pretty. Have you ever been in Arcadia, Blanca? Arcadia is pretty, is a residential area.
Very pretty, it's very peaceful but California is very expensive. I don't know. Oh look. Is very expensive, you're right. I don't know, it makes me
think, maybe I'm mistaken, is the climate perhaps, is one of those things. Eh, I don't know if that has anything to do with it but the
climate you have to see that here in California. You know that, well, if you like it, maybe you don't like it,
you know that we have a very beautiful climate here in California right?
Hm Hm.
Very I mean the climate are not, are not extremes like you know in Massachusetts
How I know it here in Phoenix.
Exactly, do you realize? Then it could be that I'm mistaken, but perhaps no. How is it?
No, because Florida, Florida is very humid. The climate in Florida is very unpleasant. But the houses there are better, the cost is also cheaper.
You can find a good apartment with a pool and that's six hundred dollars. And in some nice places,
Sure.
so I sometimes don't understand.
I also don't understand too well. What makes me think is the climate here, the closeness to the ocean we don't have those extremes in climate as big as you guys have in Arizona,
in Massachusetts or in Florida but it's a climate usually very beautiful the whole year in California. That's what makes me think, I don't know, don't know, don't know.
Hm. True.
But there are people that like, there's a taste for everybody, you know. right? Eh, is like everything, eh There are people that for example don't like
eh this totally this type of climate. There are people that like eh the four seasons, isn't it true? There are people that like the cold, like we say
the autumn, the winter, the spring, and the summer. And you in Massachusetts and in Arizona the four seasons exist more than in California.
yes.
For example you in Massachusetts the four season exist right?
yes
They are almost very differentiated right?
MM.
But in Arizona the seasons of the year aren't very different, no?
Aha.
Isn't it true?
yes, this is true.
Um, in Arizona you have basically, how can I say?  A lot of heat and a lot of cold, don't you?
No, no, right now it's never cold but I thi-
No?  It's not cold?  When, when is the hottest part of the year in Phoenix?
Hmm, July, August, September.
From July, let's say, until when is the hot period, good
September more or less.
Three months basically
Basically.
it's a really hard time in Arizona.
Really hard, haha.  It's only three months.
It's basically hot, and it's dry heat?
It's dry.  Yes, there's no humidity.
Dry, there's no humidity.
At all.
It's a heat that, my god, well, at least, at least it's dry.
yes.
And you go, inside your house, start the Conditioned Air and well, you can live with that, right?. Is not that heat that
moist that gets you cold in Arizona, right?
Mmm
Hi, this is Leo
Hello, my name is Blanca, where are you from?
Oh, hi Blanca, I'm from Washington, DC, how are you?
Oh nice, I'm in Arizona, in Phoenix
Oh, Phoenix, Arizona, that's nice
Oh, yes
And well, how are the real state prices there in Phoenix?
Oh, it's better than those northern places
Hey, I tell you, because there is a well, they called a bubble in English, pretty big
yes
And sure, we bought this house where my wife an I live, in this house
Yes
And we bought it two years ago, exactly, figure that out, we bought it the December 28th in 2003, And we bought it in
yes
$130000
Sure
And we just refinance it, in this May and the price is $260000, figure that out
Okay, I tell you, here is similar, but it's positive, At least the same as there, Look, I tell you my story, I
I lived in Massachusetts
Oh really?
Here houses are in the skies
Sure, and well, I was working in Massachusetts. I was many time working there in Massachusetts
And we had a house and the selling value was $560000
Oh, figure that out
And we moved here because it was cheaper to buy a state, right?
Sure
The last year, we came in August and we checked some houses and they seemed pretty, and they were going to be finished in this time, the new year and all that, and the begging of this year we moved here and we went to check the houses
And from $146000 they were now $223000
Figure that out, wow
Mmm
Suddenly, like that
Suddenly, yes
Wow
And then, I think that real state is fine, but I also think we are entering in that
boom of the bubble
Exactly, the bubble is like a cycle, it happens some other time in this country, mmm
ye
In the 90s the house prices were low, but they are now climbing, I think that in some years it would drop again, it's like a cycle
It goes down and up
Yes
Yes, Listen Blanca and where are you from originally? You sound like from Colombia. Ah from, Colombia, yes I knew.
From Colombia. Aha. I'm from Colombia.
Ah, from from what part? from Bogota?
I'm from Colombia. Ah? From Medellin.
Medellin, imagine that. Ah I,
Where are you from?
I'm originally from Venezuela.
From Venezuela?
Yes, mm, from Caracas.
Aha.
Mm, yes, yes. This
It seems to me ah, anyways, here within the means of possibilities and according to the capacity of each one I
I think that is preferable to buy your house, even if it's an apartment.
Listen of course, yes. Better than renting, you mean. Sure, because imagine, you renting is throwing the money in the trash.
But Okay, look for example what has happened to us. If we were the ones that rented, we wouldn't have gotten any sort of gain from our property.
But since we've thought of buying property and we have the capacity, at least the capacity of indebtedness, even though sometimes you don't have it but you get into debt.
Sure.
buy your house and there you have one way or another a gain.
Sure, a very good investment.
Mm.
Yes, this is a wonder. When we bought this house, we bought it without a deposit, without putting down a deposit. I mean, we didn't put absolutely nothing
Zero down payment
Zero, zero deposit. What saved us is that my wife and I have this very good credit
Yes
So we got a mortgage to a, let's say, reasonable rate. It wasn't the best one, but it was much better than many other mortgages
That's another story
Oh yes
Sometimes, sometimes banks do abuse
Sure
According to the status of the person, his capacity of indebtedness and all that stuff. I've had to do it. As a matter of fact I am working right now
Mhm
in a mortgage company. I am a loan officer
Oh, yes, aha, figure
So I, I know that sometimes banks do abuse. Sometimes they abuse on the conditions and requirements. And when people can't fulfill all the requirements they still get the cerdit, but the rate is so high
Sure, very expensive. It's ridiculous
That's why there is so much crisis here now, in Arizona there are many people buying houses, but there are also many people in
foreclosure. The houses, many houses are in foreclosure. People is selling, refinancing because they are indebted to the neck
Oh because they, they can't pay, right?
because they can't pay, because the rate is so high, because their legal status mm determine some requirements they don't fulfill, then they get
enormous rates
Uh, imagine all that.
There are many things.
Well, look we bought this house that we have right now, we bought it in a foreclosure, mm. The lady that lived here She was already very old. She and her husband moved here
Yes.
many many years ago. He built the house. I tell you, eh he built it in the year forty six. He built it himself.
Oh, my God.
Yes, then, well, he built it, they lived here, here they raised their kids and they all, moved. The man died many years ago, like ten years ago
and the lady was already like eighty years old, imagine, she couldn't maintain the house anymore, and then
Yes.
unfortunately the bank took it from her. What I don't understand is
Aha.
why was she still paying that house. If, if her own husband built it in the year forty, imagine.
So long ago, how strange.
It was already so that Sure, so that the house would be completely paid off don't you think?
Yes, thirty years. In the seven- from the forty to the seventy it should've been paid off.
Sure. Suppose that they refinanced it, here her and suppose that the house had been completely paid off for the years ninety, but can you imagine, it still wasn't paid off. I think that they cheated her.
Ah, what a shame, hm.
We never got to meet the lady. But that was the story the bank told us.
Hm
Yes, well. We bought the house and as they say in English this is a
Yes.
Exactly, yes, even if we've fixed it, like, I wouldn't even have this kitchen cabinet, at all.
Yes, yes.
Or a washing machine, or a fridge.  Like, we had to all put it in ourselves.
Hmm.
Hmm, yes.
We had to organize it. But sometimes it's worth it because it's better to have your money invested in something.
Sure.  Yes, of course, I'll tell you, look.  We also had a lot of credit card debt.  And the first time that we refinanced, well
Yes.
look, all the debt was, like, we totally eliminated it.  And not only this, the student loan debts as well.
Yes.
This debt
Oh, yeah.
Was also eliminated, so that like
This, we did this with my husband.  Eh, the house, he, paid off his house completely, the one in Boston.
Aha.
He totally paid it off and eliminated all the debt, and here we are, well, buying another and moving ahead, no?
Ah, believe me, you have them as investments.
Hmm.
Ah, hey, that's great.
Oh no, no, as an investment, right?, this will be our first home. We sold the one in Boston and we are buying another here
Oh, ok, now i understand, that's, ok, ok, it's fine
uh huh, yes, yes
Hey, one more thing, look, here were we live, we have a two bedrooms house, I'm sorry, two bedrooms and an attic
yes
it doesn't have, uh, basement, that's the only thing, it's a house without a basement, but it has a good acre of terrain
Yes
how much does a house like that cost there, in that area of Phoenix?
Oh, how much?, a house of two bedrooms and an acre, maybe about a hundred and eighty, two thousand pesos
Oh, ok, yes, it will always be a little cheaper there than here in this area
here i, ours, we bought our home with three bedrooms, it's two floors. Uh, so it's three bedrooms, two living rooms, a kkitchen
uh, an additional dining room and uh, a yard. The hose is almost an acre, it's not much, it's not a full acre, and
Uh huh
And it costed us two hundred and forty six thousand dollars, and they still haven't finished building it for us
Oh, can you imagine, i mean, a new home, can you imagine, oh, OK
Right, yes
Uh huh, i mean, compared to the prices over here, that's not so bad
No, no, not so bad. Compared with the prices of Massachusetts, look, a rent for a home like that, like the one I'm living on right now, there in Massachusetts,
costs two thousand dollars, two thousand and five hundred dollars, and here i pay eight hundred, for a house of three bedrooms, a new house of three bedrooms
with a yard, with a living room, with a dining room, with a kitchen, new, all new
Tell me something, those eight hundred pesos you're telling me about, what's that?, rent or mortgage?
No, rent, it's just that I'm renting at this moment
Oh, because you're renting, because you're still, lets say in
That they haven't given me my house yet
Oh ok. Hey eight hundred dollars
That they're building it for me. Right
Eight hundred dollars
Uh, obviously. Without, without, without power, without water, it would be around one thousand and two hundred with all the
Sure, all the expenses you have to do
Uh huh
Hey, well, look at that. We lived in little apartment- an apartment, but that was horrifying, because it was a little apartment, uh, the living-room and the dining room together, a little kitchen there like
four by five meters for example, i mean, a really small thing
I know, i know the houses of
Right
of the part
Well, do you know how much we payed for that apartment?
Um
Six hundred dollars for rent a month, can you imagine. And we are paying one thousand and two hundred a month of mortgage here
But you're in a comfortable part
Of course, yes, yes, of course, i mean, no, uh, well there's no comparison between
Mhm
between being in a, let's say, rented house or being in a
Eh, Lurdes from New York
Miriam again,
Hello, Miriam how are you
Eh, fine and you?
Fine fine, thank God, here eh, the weather has warmed up a little, so everybody is very happy.
Ah, I think you passed the cold on to us then
Really? Ah I'm sorry.
Yes, everything is cool. Yes
Well Miriam, tell me. What do you think about, about that of breaking up with your partner
I think it depends on how long you've been with that person,
Hm
and, how much you love him. Because I recently have, I have a boyfriend, that we had been together years
How many?
Three.
Three, ah, three
Three years. And like two months ago- like some three months ago, I told him, that well no, that no, no, we didn't go out anymore, I already felt I tell him, I already feel old, I tell him, we have no kids, you don't take me out,
I never see you. You come home from work too late and, I was getting angry with the relationship. Yes so then, I told him that, that no, I wanted to break up, and and
and we left, because we lived together. So then I left to my parent's house.
Hm mm
And, later like within a month, he started calling me, that, that to try again, and well. The truth is I missed him the same too.
Hmm
Like the ex- but I tried to bear it.
Sure, sure
And yes, it was pretty difficult, I don't think that I could do it again.  Without being one hundred percent sure that
Sure, sure
that, I didn't want to be with him, but, um, now I'm sorry hmm, I think now that I should have had more patience with him.
Hmmm, hmmm
To give him an opportunity to take me out a bit more, and to be a bit more
To get, to- to fall in love with you again, no.
Yes, and, and then his work is something that, he works in construction, so
Aye, yes
it's difficult for him to come every day, to go out, or it's really really heavy his work.
Sure sure
So I tried to understand it, but a moment came when he came back at nine, ten at night, and I'm really tired, there's something to eat, and
and like, eh, it was a really routine life.  And, we already had a routine, aha.
Really routine, yes, yes yes
And do, this, but no, now, he' he's giving a little bit on his part, and the same for me,
Hmmm
So it depends.
Wow.  Well, now with this, I will tell you that for me breaking up with a partner was always difficult.
Hm mm
Eh, I think that, that when you are young, you don't see I mean young, I mean, you are, I don't know, in high-school or
I mean, when you are starting to meet people, then it is not so hard because you prefer freedom to the compromise of a couple
But then, when you, specially if you have been living with that person, the compromise, the responsibilities, well
it somehow becomes much more difficult, everything in the house, reminds you of that person, eh, your, the daily routine you have
Yes
whatever you do, if you used to share them with that person, then they remind you of that person
Very much, yes, and restaurants specially
So, sure, sure, you can't go anywhere without having a thought for that person, with you all the time, right? And then, while anniversaries keep passing, the first year
yes
everything, every anniversary, every little thing reminds you of that person, the anniversary of whatever, when we nought a
a tree together, I don't know, every little thing reminds you of that person, right?
Aga yes
So I think that the rupture is much more difficult the more history you share with that person, right?
Of my own experience I can tell you that, that when I broke off with my husband, on my first marriage
it was very difficult
Hm mm
We kept working together. So I could not avoid seeing him from time to time
Oh, that, that is true
and so
yes that's even harder, true
Sure
because, you have to keep seeing that person.
Exactly. And, and well one, one tries to be cordial, not trying to be a you understand me, a person that, that, that mixes the
what is happening to you with work, because then that's also unprofessional. But then trying- you know holding it in because, um, in my case it was that I imagined because everyone around me
knew what was happening. That in, in some places it was, was true. And that everybody, was paying attention to see what, how they act
so and so, when they are together, one near the other. Right because then since we were kind of a well known couple at work, well then
eh the whole break up was more or more like public
Hm mm
So, well the fact that there were third parties paying attention or that knew that, were part of the problem, so then that made it so
that the break up well was a little more uncomfortable, because it wasn't just eh, well nothing, what happened to one or the other, but also
how the people around one interacted right.
Yes, yes yes I understand. Yes I can imagine that it must be very hard.
Yes yes, but well thank God well well, those things happen sometimes, I think that, the most important thing is to see those
those moments as an opportunity to grow as a person right. Eh, is easier said than done, but
Yes, no, but for example my dad.
Aha.
With my first boyfriend, he was, very very jealous. And, with the second this guy had really, he had really won him over. He loved him, yes, he loved him.
Really?
And then when I broke up with him, well like I was going to leave to the university, and, and, we were going to be in different states, very far, we were not going to be able to see each other
Hmmm
so I told him, that it was better that, that
Hmm
that we should break up.  And he took it, he didn't want it but he respected the decision, and he understood that it wasn't going to work.
Sure sure
These long distance relationships.
Sure
And this, but this summer was pretty uncomfortable.  My dad is, always told us, for example he said, that he invited him to dinner or
Aye
or what do I know, sure, he invited him, until I had to say, dad, look, this is pretty uncomfortable for me.
Sure sure
Because I'm trying to forget it, yes, I love him, I love him but it, it wasn't going to work.
Sure sure
One, one of the two would finally say, you know what, I want to be with you, or I don't want to be with you, or could be tempted by another person
Sure sure
in the, in the area.  Because you know, when you're at university, or surrounded by people your age, you're you're always meeting different people.
Sure, sure, absolu-, sure.
And, and at the age of eighteen you don't want anything more with your first boyfriend, or the second.
Exactly, exactly.
You, you what to know what's out there, and
Sure, life is like a buffet, if you fill your plate in the first
hm mm
of the fist thing they teach  you, later when things come
No, not what there's more of.
exactly, exactly.
Yes, and that's why, for example, I right now well, with my boyfriend I'm more than good. Right now, he's already talking of, of marriage and all that.
Wow
But I'm a little scared.
well
No, I wouldn't want to right now.
You have to talk about, have to talk about what it is you expect from him, what it is he expects from you.
Because eh, at the hour of truth. As much as one says, whatever, a problem one gets divorced one gets married with the idea that, that you're getting married for the rest of your life right.
And, and of what
Hm mm
and, and And if one thinks that no, because when we get married, he's going to change, or she is going to change, and things will be different. Look, that doesn't happen.
But our parents, want grandchildren.
Things are the same as when
That I say that his parents already want a grandchild.
What? Really?
Yes
what, what he doesn't have any grandchildren?
Oh, they have enough grandchildren, but there's no male grandchild, that carries the family name.
Ah, well, so they can wait. There's no rush
And, and the, and it's funny because, Monday his dad came. Mm well, his parents came, they came to visit from New York
Aha
and they are here in Florida. And, the man is telling us that they're thinking of coming to live here, that ah, the houses are nicer, and
that the weather and all, all, all that
Hm mm
Then, he tells me, to, to let him know. When we are going to get married, so he can start saving. Yes, but I tell him, for what, I tell him, if we are fine like this. We go out whenever we want,
I mean, the ring and signing a paper is not going to change anything, how we are right now.
Hm mm
He says, no he tells me, is that I already want a grandchild he says
Ah
He tells me since his brother, he tells me, didn't point, didn't point well with, with the
Ah, that what he has are girls.
one, the the brother of, of , of my boyfriend
Aha
just had his first child.
Aha, ah, okay, okay
And they didn't want to know, what it was going to be, so then they made it a surprise and at the end it came out a girl.
A girl, aha
Aha, and, and is just them two who can carry the name.
Sure, sure.
So now on the brother's side, they are not going to have any more kids for a while.
Sure, sure.
But my boyfriend, I tell him look, don't even think about it I say. Because I don't want any kids. Is so nice I tell him, to get home and say what do you want to do now. Want to go to this disco or the other.
sure
And you don't have to, don't have to think who's going to take care of the kid, we ran out of milk, we have to go buy diapers, I tell him all this.
Listen that sounds like the conversations that my husband and I have, lately, because we have an eight month old baby,
Aha
And is like that. Since since the baby was born, we have gone out alone, I think that, if we have, we've gone out three times is too much, and like that just to
the movies, or to eat, and running home because the only think we could think about was the kid. So
Yes, and and I no, no. Right now I wouldn't have the mind nor the patience still I tell him, I still have
Hm mm
a lot of drinks to have and a lot of discos to go to I tell him. For me to be able to have a kid.
Eh, is what you have left to do you will have a frustration, and And you will always have the desire and you will always blame the kid.
that look, because of you I wasn't able to these things I dreamed of doing. Or travel, or whatever it was, or study, I mean
Hi
Good evening, and happy holidays
Same to you
yes, thank you, thank you
To whom am I speaking?
Uh, my name is Marco, I'm in Philadelphia, and you?
I'm Maria Ines, I'm in Philadelphia too
Ah
What's up? Where are you from?
Well, everything's well. Excuse me?
Where are you from?
Eh, I grew up in, uh, Paraguay
Paraguay. We're neighbors, I'm from Argentina.
Ah, okay. Okay, let's see, a little, uhm, couples and
Couples breaking up, we got an ugly subject
Yes. Out of all the options. I have to say I only have one experience of
yes, and what was it like?
Uh, let's see, a little, eh, classic story, my first girlfriend, we were stupid, and we just did it, just like that
Em, ah, i imagine it's definitively, some couples have it easier breaking up than others. One thing I realize, well, I'm in a relationship now
it would be, uh, we live together. She has a son who's five now. But we are together since he was 1 year old

yes, I think that it happens to everybody, I mean, not the same to everybody, but to a lot of people
who, who have eh
he figures out how she should be, and then tries to accommodate the person who is his partner to that image, and nobody is
Anyway, it seems that when a person shows a, a personal feature, eh, it is not, it is not something unique of that person, but something that
oh, and well, I like her, I love her very much, but I don't know, I can't think of a little stupid thing that the person thinks she has to bear
that she, just, just, she cuts her nails, yes right, you never see people cutting their nails in the movies
just happy faces, in the movie, they kiss and the end, after that comes the part
Right. No, no, people don't cut their nails. They don't cut their hair. Eh, they don't
Right?
How you call it? Ah, they never put on, of course. Because
No. No, no way
that, that would mean that they are not the size sixty ? sixty, eh, right. That's it
Ninety, sixty, ninety
eh, it's something that, I mean, I think, I knew many people
yes
I had a lot of boy and girlfriends
yes
who had a partner
MHm
and after some time they break off
yes.
And the big drama is, I knew it in some cases, the friend first, after eh, the other friend, when they started going out,
yes.
eh, or vice versa, knowing the friend, and after, you're friends with both.
Sure.
They then break up.
Hmm.
And no, you're practically, for example, if I knew him first, they he had a girlfriend, the girlfriend, and they break up,
yes.
I have the moral obligation to hate her and only talk to him.  That, of course, I'm not, not not like this.  I keep talking to her,
Well ok.
as much, as much as I talk to him, but I don't tell him that I talk to her.
Ah, look.  For this, because, because it's complicated.  Because, I know cases that aren't like this.
And, eh, I think, yes this is true, there are cases that aren't quite like this,
What's complicated is to take, I don't know, your birthday, you have a party, which of the two do you invite?
for example, a- Aha
Aha, there it's complicated.
Eh, this yes and no.  The worst is that now he has another girlfriend.  Ah no.
Ah.
This yeah, and and now I invite the other.  But, no, ah, it's really, really
You come, but you come alone, How do you do it?
yes, exactly, exactly. Is,
Is true, that's happened to me. But, well, I invite everybody, and I tell them who's going to go, then they can come or not. I try to do that. Because, if not, is
very complicated.
yes, it can become
I say, come, but your ex girlfriend will be with her husband. If you like it, fine, And if not, well, one day we'll go have some coffee.
In which case, the classic, the classic, eh, what a man would do, in that case, the typical male,
yes.
has to go look for the best looking woman that he can find. And, eh, go to parties with, with that one
with, talking, of course, of how happy you are, and of the,
And perhaps you just met her two days ago.
yes, yes, exactly, yes is, yes, is that they meet like that, in so much time. Eh,
yes, it seems that, that the Paraguayans are similar to the Argentinians, in that sense, eh.
yes, yes no, yes no, it's worse.
Look.
Eh, yes no, is worse. Eh, is, they are, they are, they are like that.
Very sexist.
Eh, one thing, one thing I know, that they are very, very in Paraguay, very sexist.
Look.
Eh, the woman, in addition to what I had said, has to clean, eh, cook, and of course, raise eh, raise the kids,
Mm
em, beside that, yes, ah, the, aha, yes, she speaks, and has ideas also. That is very,
Those, conflict.
eh, that is, in, in Paraguay, yes.
Ah, look, no, no. Then, in Argentina we are a little bit more moderate, I think.
The worst, is yes, I can imagine, no, I can imagine that yes.
There's a hint, eh, there's a hint of sexism, but I think is not as strong.
In Paraguay, for example, my parents, both, are Paraguayans, eh, they are doctors.
yes.
Eh, that specialized here in the United Stated, which was where I happened. Em, they, both are doctors, he, of course, had the private practice over there in, in Paraguay. And all
yes.
in, excellent. President of the Paraguayan Association or Urology, and the President of the Paraguayan Association of Doctors, of everything But, she, ah, at home.
Look, and she was also a doctor? Is she a doctor also?
We had, she's a doctor also. Eh, dad had two Mercedes, plus the American truck, plus the other. But mom, the minibus. Eh, he doesn't lend her the car, eh,
And it never occurred to her to buy a car?
No, because she didn't have
She doesn't work, right.
no, she didn't have the private practice, or anything like that, Then, eh, basically, she just stayed with that.
Ah.
At the end, eh, I came to the United States to study,
yes.
eh, she, being a doctor, represented Paraguay in the United Nations, eh, and she came, she would come to New York every year, and one year that she came to New York, she came by to visit me,
yes.
and the night before I was going to take her to the airport to go back to Paraguay, she tells me, You know? I think I'm going to stay.
Ah
The day before the flight.
And she stayed?
And, she stayed.
She just stayed?
She, now, has, now, she returned to her practice, here in the state, in, eh here in Philadelphia,
Look.
eh, she was working for the Association of Puerto Ricans on the March, for a while. Eh, then, she, now is working in another hospital, Eh, but she's returned to working here, and, she goes over there.
Look, and but, they as a couple, did they separate?
They separated, eh, but, dad didn't find out until much later. I'm not, don't even remember well if they notified him that she wasn't going to be in the airport,
But, how hard Right? Because, of the situation the limit that your mom had face because of the issue of sexism. Right? Because,
Eh, yes definitely- But, one thing I remember, mom was working for, also, for eh, what? in, ah, the eh, in the health ministry.
yes.
Eh, that was her in the, in the Ministry for Women.
Ah,
Eh, and one of the things I remember, she did a lot of work with, did a lot of work with the, eh, international organizations of, of, of development and that.
yes.
Eh, one, I remember when she told me that machismo is perpetuated by women.
And, that can be true.
For example, the mother is the one that educates the children and the way that she behaves with their father or the father with her,
well, children take notice.
yes.
So, basically, women decide on that, if we want to avoid machismo.
yes, it's so hard. But that's true, eh.
But it is hard.
When we are little, you know what they give them, I don't know if it's genetic or not but they play with dolls.
Mhm.
and boys play with little cars, or, I don't know if it is that way because we are conditioning them to play that way
yes, that's right, that's genetic. That's for example, like when I'm in, I, eh, in computer science.
yes.
I'm the, eh, computers, computers and this and that, em, I remember that we had a lot of articles talking about the lack of women in that field.
in the computing areas,
yes.
So, I think that, basically, the percentage of women working in the computer area is really low.
I see.
And I've also heard people complaining that the games, that all toys are for boys, that there are no toys for girls and
But, looking it in other way?, Who?
Hello, Jorge, from New York
Hi, Jorge, This is Nicky
Hi, Nicky, How are you doing?
Hi, what do you think about the question?
Well, it's a hot topic, you could say, right?
yes
I think that definitively, well, it's something really common this time
yes
and what do you think about it
Well, it's really hard to brake, I don't know, I think that depends in the person, like
you see your couple, I think that it's an investing in time, and well, for me, I had to brake with
someone and I always see the positive, and I think that that person is good and I want to be his friend, and as always, a common topic
Many men don't want to be just friends
Sure
And well, for me, it has been long, and sometimes, braking up, I do it. And there is always a time where you don't communicate, but
And I always communicate as a friend. Because I think that I invested time, and I know well his family and I want that family and love and all that
Sure, well, in my case, it has been a long time ago since my last brake up, and I practically don't know what is braking up, right?. with someone, I have
Yes
15 years with my wife, right?
Wow, that's nice
yes. So, well, we've been here for fifteen years, between us, we've broken up, we've gotten back together, we've had fights, we've made up the next day. But,
yes.
that hadn't happened, this type of break up like, the, the, in fact, the, the one mentioned in the question, right? As you just said, well, there are many people out there, definitely, in that sense, I mean, why can't they find their real match, or
or why aren't they ready, right? Or, I don't know.
yes.
Or they don't feel the need. Many times, one, oh, you get to, you become so independent that, sometimes, you feel uncomfortable about having someone by your side, I imagine, right?
yes, yes, I, I believe so. There's always people, men and women, that don't want to have a long relationship. But, this changes with age, I believe, and, by person.
More than by the age, by the person, I believe that in t hat sense, I'm, what happens here is that there are so many different types of persons, cultures, different
am, people from different countries, am,
yes.
in that sense, well, they have traditions, right? different. So, many times, that influences them to, suddenly, the person that you feel is right for you, well, after a while you realize that it's not like that because that person doesn't share your traditions, always, what do I know? your favorite foods, right? your tastes.
yes.
or your traditions, what do I know? Mm, your religion or stuff, simple stuff, right? Simple basic stuff.
yes, yes.
So, you end up being too different. Where are you from?
I, I'm Dominican, and you?
Oh, from Ecuador.
Oh, you know what? I realize, with this research, that they are bringing people together, I mean, they are linking people from South America or the ones from the Caribbean. I mean, I've never spoken with someone from the Caribbean.
And, I guess that people from South America haven't gotten a chance to speak to someone from South America, I don't know.
Well, no, and, I have, I've spoken with someone from Argentina.
I guess. Oh yes?
And, the other time, I don't remember, but I think it was someone from Peru, that I talked with
Ah
Yeah, well, it all depends, but in that sense. I mean, what I, uhm, for example, in this subject, I agree more with getting paired up with a woman, definitively. Because it's more
yes
it's easier talking about that. No? but there was one that
yes, that's true. I also think that it depends on, on, as you said, on the culture, it depends on, on how you were raised up. I, my
my parents raised me, in the Dominican style, but also in the 19th century's style
I see
I mean, they told me, never, never, I mean never, let me go out to meet, to find love, let's say, when I was a young girl. They told me, no, no, no, you get married first, and then you
fall in love. And, I, oh
And you, do you agree with that?
No, no, but I have brothers that, yes, they got married and then knew each other. That's why I was so
But, are they still married, have they had a long marriage?
yes? yes, yes. I have, I have a sister who's been married for 25 years, and a brother, 30 years already, and both, it was their first experience with love. They were very young, I mean, they had like 19 years
Wow
And, just like that, they later got to know their husband or wife, and they're still together. I think that's, that's fine. But I, didn't, didn't
didn't understand that tradition. But that's why it varies, no? But at the same time, it's difficult. I think people
Sure
When you last too much, I think everyone, when they're adults, have had relationships where, where they think, ay, that relationship lasted too long, lasted 2 years more than what we thought
And, is because they don't want to hurt, such person, or they think, or have hopes, maybe that person is for me, but I don't know, let's see.
Aha, aha, Mm, no, I don't believe that too much.
Eh, Really?
I, rather, what I think is that, definitely, you have to break that myth right? that, um, before getting married, or before living with someone, you can't I don't know? be with your partner or, or you can't
have any sort of relation. I think that the important thing is that you experiment all that before getting married.
yes, I agree.
Because from there, from the first day of being married, you realize a lot of things that you ignored.
yes.
I don't know, how your partner sleeps, how he wakes up, eh,
yes, they're the little things that
sure, how she cooks, what habits she has, if she's neat, if she's disorganized, ah
yes, yes
they are so many things Right? that, all of a sudden you were, you saw that person so pretty, when you went out as boyfriend and girlfriend, that you  would go to the movies holding hands.
yes.
And later, when you get married, the next day, you see, ah, a woman without any makeup that, ah, you get scared, or I don't know? anything Right?
yes, yes, yes
Or, in the same way, the wife. Right? I mean, she sees, the man, fixed up, all nice, but who knows, maybe, the guy is used to taking a bath every three, four days right? Is like that.
yes, many stop taking care of themselves. That why it varies.
Sure. Sure. But, in that sense, like I tell you, I mean, um, is, for me, in my years before. As a young guy, it was
easy, you could say, it was, it wasn't too simple breaking up. Right? Because, it's always a relationship. You get used to that person Right? especially, get used to having a relationship
yes, yes
One person at a, at a time
yes
But it's hard to break up with someone just like that, no? But here, I see people who break up with you, go to the next person the next day, then break up with that one
yes
and the next day, the next guy on the list, no?
Yes, that surprised me in this country. When I was in college, I saw people who broke up and were all friends
hmm
american, and they broke up. Then, they went out with, with their best friend's girlfriend, something like that. And I was   like How? and I also think that
it depends, but, in some Hispanic culture, co- for me, for dominicans, and for other hispanic people, when you're with someone, you know her, like, little by little
Sure
Seeing the whole family. And that makes the difference, I think, but that I see as investing time
Sure
And it's also key, in getting to  know your girlfriend or boyfriend, so that person will get along OK with your family
Well, it's that, he's a boyfriend, believe it or not, despite what they say, many people say, and I agree with that
I'm married with my wife, not with the family. But anyways, the inf-, the family has a huge influence
yes, yes
Because, yes, what do I know? if you don't get along with your wife's family, she's going to feel bad. Or, just the same, if she doesn't get along with her husband's family, he'll feel bad because they can't go to visit, or what, I go and you stay home. I mean, it's
yes
if you take your partner, you carry, not the burden of his or her family, but the responsibility of, of keeping the party in peace, no?
yes, yes. Or, I know when I, When I was in love, I always noticed the, the way my boyfriend treated his mother or his sister. Because, is you marry that person, yes,
yes see, I, I think, is the same way he is going to treat his wife. Or if, if the person is a woman, I have friends who say the same thing. They truly
see and study how their girlfriends treat their sisters, their dads, because, that was, that was our first experience, Right?, with, with men or women, they are our mentors.
Of course. Of course.
Because of that, it changes, changes. A trick for me, I am married, and my husband and me, we always say that we are in love. No, we don´t say we are married, and so, still we are not going to , I don´t know, to think,
no, we are not, not going to neglect too much, lets go to, go out, the cinema, or whatever, have a date, or a date,
Aha.
and so.
No, that is good, that is good. However, like I tell you, so,sometimes you are not careful about it. Right?
yes.
So, it becomes a routine, you are neglected, but, yes it is good, hmm. In that sense, to go out of monotony. Because,
yes.
there is the base of, maybe, you are fine, and continue fine, how was the topic, breaks. Right? Definitively.
yes.
It is so, so simple to, to do easy things and, and well. Then, that way, that way all goes well. Right?
yes, it is true. But, also, I know is different with each couple. Because life goes by. Right?, and if they have children, You know? it is more difficult to do it.
Because, life, gets more complex, more busy. It is more difficult. yes, like if you were, only boyfriends.
yes, I know, no, sure it is. I think that with th, with, when you have children, the, the situation is like more, more complicated. But, at the same time, it is
like a more, besides more complicated, it is more responsibility. Right? And it, like, suddenly, like that you are more tied to that person. Right?
yes. yes.
In my case we have a girl and we will have a baby the first week of January.
Wow,That´s nice congratulations.
OK thank you, it is more responsibility right? It is like the illusion that we will have another child at home.
that attaches me to my wife, right?
of couse.
I definitely get more attach, right?
that is great.
I have seen many friends who believe they have found the ideal partner but no.
yes.
how are you?
Hello, yes this is Jorge, I am talking from Los Angeles, California
hi, how are you?, Jorge my name is Adrian and I live in Toronto, Ontario, Canada
who am I talking to? oh, fine, fine Adrian, Adrian what has Spanish to do in your life? where do you come from? what's your..? how you call it?
background
your background, your origin, I didn't want to use English
mm, I was born in Buenos Aires, eh, Argentina, I lived until four years ago in Buenos Aires, Argentina
oh my goodness
that's why I have the 'porteño' accent
where in Buenos Aires? from what district of Buenos Aires?
eh, I was born in Villa de Boto, no, really
very good, yes, I am, I ,I am from Buenos  Aires as well
from what part?
well I am from Buenos Aires, I was born and mm, basically I was born and raised in La Nuz west, in a, in a place, a city called Valentina Alcina
have you vere heard that?
yes, yes, yes, yes, of, of
see, what a coincidence, I don't, I don't usually talk to people from Argentina, you are like the third one, well anyway, how is it in Ontario?
eh, cold yes
very cold, right? what's the temperature there?
eh, no, today it was about two Celsius, positive, so
my God well
it was, it was pretty hot, it should be cold but the snow is melting. It rained today, the whole day, so there's still a bit of snow, I'm looking over there
so, it's amazing, you've been in Canada for four years?
I've been here since four years ago, yes
very good, very good, I've been in the United States for eighteen years, very good, well, today's subject is why do people
break up, I don't know with whom
oh, they want us to be philosophers,
I don't know who is conjugating the verbs but this people is breaking
no, you are wrong, yes, yes, oh, what happens is that, this is what happens, this is what happens
I mean get a dictionary or something,
no, why do couples break up, okay, oh, well, I don't know what to say, couple stuff has no rules, basically, isn't it?
I believe that all break ups are
oh, break ups
are, yes, break ups are wrong because they are never good or easy, otherwise people wouldn't break up, right? I guess but
exactly, exactly
if everything is going on well, they wouldn't break up
exactly, exactly, exactly, exactly, well what happens is that, oh, there can be, there are lots of reasons why, a person, you know
you know, decides to break up with someone, the only thing that I can say is that those types of relationships are quite hard, oh
did you, did you leave Argentina four years, five years ago? Have you seen that
mm yes
And Well, the social situation in Argentina has changed a lot, when you left it, it has change a lot
when, I left Argentina, in march of 1986, well, we didn't even had a divorce law
divorce didn't existed and I think it started just like 14, 15 years ago, more or less
I think that was for
a thing, yes
I think that was for the time of Alfonsino
exactly, but when you left, people was divorcing a lot
Something like that, because people got married in Montevideo, in Paraguay and there was a parallel system, further than the formal, right?
really Argentinian, a parallel system, there was a song that way: let's get marry in Mexico or Paraguay
yes, I know about that, but
it was the tradition, in those times, before the existence of divorce
yes, but listed to me, there is people, that, let's say,
In Argentina, they got married in Paraguay, Uruguay, or Mexico, like you can choose and well, that marriage wasn't legal for Argentinian laws
Yes, do you remember that, Am I right about I'm saying?
yes, but I think that there also was
I mean, for Argentinian laws, that marriage didn't existed
Mmm, no, that's not my area
not my field
No
yes, but do you understand me?, I mean, many people was interested in getting married that way, but for many other people, they weren't interested in that
they were married, do you understand? but for the law, the laws, they were living, they were concubines, do you understand what I'm saying?
mm
oh but, mm basically, well apparently the laws of divorce, they were approved in Argentina and people is much more free now, to to get a divorce
to end their relationship, one of my cousins came here, I have one cousin who came to visit from Buenos Aires and you must've seen it, it hasn't been long since you arrived in Canada, but they say that the situation in
the economical situation in Argentina is so hard that basically, people now don't even get married, do you understand what I'm saying? oh
they have a partner, and so on, and so on, they have a certain percentage of people marrying but it's not a
because of the money
because of the, the cost, of what that costs, no? it's too expensive to get married so people, oh, they just decide and I'm telling you
oh, to me, I never, it's my idea I might be a dreamer but I'm a bit liberal and to me, oh, I will never get married in a civil registry, to me, that doesn't mean anything, do you understand what I'm saying?
oh, sure, it's not a guarantee, right?
it's not a guarantee, do you understand? To me, going to the civil registry or marrying in a church, is not a guarantee, there's no guarantee, it's not a guarantee to
no, that's no, that doesn't mean anything, the important thing is the respect that the couple has with each other, no? If they get along, the members of the couple
and the respect, no? If there's respect, that's that's everything,a signed paper is not going to guarantee or change anything, that's what I think, no?
it might be different for, it's different for some women, it makes them feel, oh
safer,
safer, isn't it? I don't know, I don't think that way. Do you think?
if he has, it has, it has lots of symbolism oh, to me, it's more about tradition and it's natural and a social issue and
exactly
oh, what do I know!
yes, that's it, yes, that's it, basically, it's a tradition.
the, one, it was one, yes, one difference that, that you wouldn't get between the cassette inserted in the head of an Argentinian
woman and an average Canadian woman, let's say, the average Argentinian wants to get married, the church and the wedding party, and has all that stuff in her head, and the Canadian one is somehow more concerned on the engagement ring
and the size of the stone, oh yes
the Canadian?
eh, they, they pay more attention on that, no, no, seriously let me say
that is not true, because it's the same in the United States
eh, but the cultural difference is big, the, the, they do care more about that than the party, the event itself
they do value that but like, like, somehow it is lighter because it's something quick and so
yes, yes, yes
and they marry at noon, have lunch at four o'clock and at eight o'clock everybody goes home and that's it
right
but the, the stone, since she will wear it all her life in the finger
right? it is true, it is true, so, that is what you have observed in the Canadian society, well that's a, that's what
happens, let me say, it is similar to what happens here, in the United States and
no, and not, not long ago I talked to an Argentinian friend of mine here, and he said, thanks god we didn't born here and had to marry in this country
we saved a lot in the ring
what? pardon, what is it your friend said?
I was saying that my friend he said  than god we didn't marru in this country, we saved a lot in diamonds, sure
in Canada, yes, yes but that is rel- you know everything is relative, isn't it? it depends on the person, Argentinians do care about that as well, don't they?
the ring, not so much, right?
yes, but, yes but no, it's not so, uh, no, there isn't a tradition of, it's, the size of the rock and
the rock
the, not long ago, a few months ago, a Canadian boy that works here with me got married, and, i, every time i had the chance i asked him
uh, about the rock thing and the size of the rock and the
..
he, the, with that, using the subject in my favor, that "look, it's just that I'm here and i'm a new comer" and i don't know what else
exactly
and, "explain me about the rock and the, the, the number"
Hello?
Hello?
Hello.
Eh, how are you?
Fine, and you?  I'm Alicia.
Alicia.
yes.
Hello and, where are you?
In Atlanta, Georgia, and you?
Oh well, I'm in New York.
Ah, New York, how nice.  And how did that strike go?
Sorry?
How was the strike, the transportation strike?
yes, yes, last week was a little bit difficult.
I imagine.
Like, but I didn't have that many problems because, well, I, I don't work very far from where I live, and my friend took me in her
Ah.
car to work.
Ah, that's good.
One time I had to go to Manhattan and I walked.
Ah.
And was, so, I last, from the place I work in Manhattan I last about forty five minutes walking. It was far but not
Wow, of course.
not so far, so, not like miles and miles.
No, yes, of course. Wow, how interesting, yes.
But yes. We are happy. I think that we are, we all are happy that the strike ended.
That is logical. That is logical.
And where are you from?
I am from Chile.
Ah, from Chile. What part of Chile are you from?
From Santiago, but I lived in Santiago, Concepcion and in a town called Los Andes.
Look, I lived in Chile for two years.
Right?
yes, in Chile, in Santiago. I
Wow. Of course.
I was living in Nuñoa and after that in Providencia.
Ah wow.
I was teaching English there.
How fun. In fact I know that place. I have relatives in Providencia now. How fun. And where are you from?
Well, I was born here in New York. My family is from Cuba.
Ay ay ay. Ay, Cuba, okay, perfect.
My Dad's Cuban.
Ah.
Well, my Spanish is the the the Cuban kind and
Sure.
studying Spanish here and being in Chile and all that.
Sure, from all around.
I'm a mix.
Sure, but a New Yorker in the end.
yes, I am.
Sure, for example I in fact lived in Chile  until I was eleven years old and after I returned. For example, I came back during high school.
I was there two years and also I returned the year two years back I was in Chile the whole year so that's like
And you have family there, family?
I try to go and come back and all that. yes, yes. It's that my father is over there, my mother's here, one of those
Ah, yes.
it's like, like today's theme.
Sure, no. I don't understand the theme very well that yes that yes Is it difficult to break up with your partner? Or rather, it's a like a dumb question well.
It's right, or you know, is it going to be easy ah, yes, yes
It's just a a stupid question. yes, I believe that it's hard to end a relationship.
Sure.
Even if the relation doesn't go too well, it is difficult anyway
And it's true, as a matter of fact I, eh
Unless, unless you really don't care. I mean, if you are with the other just due to boredom, then it may not be so difficult
Well, I was talking to a friend of mine, she, she called me by Christmas, eh, she called me and she had a boyfriend
they had been together for four years, and they lived together and everything, and it was the kind of relation that you knew that, I mean, as a matter of fact I only knew from it last year
Mh
Ehm and I could feel, on both of them, that it looked bad, yes, you could feel some
Mh
it was obvious, let's say, they were somehow different. He was kind of immature
Mhm
and she,  I don't know, you could notice a strange attitude, but anyway, they broke off in December, I mean last December, one month ago. And she is suffering and it is incredible because
even herself recognizes that he was not meant for her and that she doesn't know how thy could last so long, but she suffers anyway because she can't get used to it
yes. I, I think that sometimes difficult relations are even more difficult to finish because there are many, I mean, in an easy relation
yes?
Things are not going on fine and when you finish you don't feel so bad because the feeling was not so big. I mean, I was once with someone
and we did get along but there was not much passion and when we broke off it was not so hard
Oh, sure, Oh, yes, that's true
I mean, it's hard after all, I mean it was also difficult afterwards
Sure
And you missed him, but it was not that much suffering like other times
Mhm.
I do believe that that was the reason why we had such a good relationship but it was never so
Passionate.
But I do believe that sometimes, that type of relationship is hard, when you are always talking about those things, it's hard to end it because you
Oh, it's the same feeling. You get addicted to the emotion, that's right.
Sure, you are too involved, you are too involved with that feelings.
That's right. It's true, that's so true, it's like they say, that love and hate are two sides of the same coin, yes.
Sure, yes. I believe, I believe that when one
Like I said, it was too emotional.
mh, when you, when you are in love, it's like, you don't care, you can be so mad, you can get so mad with the person you love, even more than with any other person.
And it's also funny that oh, it's hard to break up with someone, or if they break up with you, I mean, I've been through that, obviously, twice and
in a way, I rather let them break up with me because it was a two year relationship, a bit longer
Mh.
but in the sixth month, it was like I was tired of him but he was like, no, I love you, I adore you, that's why
so, I felt a bit, we would say in chile, it became a pain in the ass. I mean, I felt
Mh.
pity, me
Mh.
I felt sorry for him.
yes.
So i went on with the guy for another year and a half
Oh, yes
I felt sorry after that
Sure
And i really saw him once a week only because i was going to college full-time at that time and working part-time
Uh
So, i was still busy. So i kinda didn't pay much attention to him, but i was still like, the last six months i was like
Oh, i want to get rid of this person, but it was so terrible, because he kinda
Sure
every time he had the feeling i was going away, he sort of felt despaired, so i kinda, it was very stressful to me to know that i could cause such pain to someone else
Oh
that, like i told myself, you know, i, uh, it's better to get kicked myself than the other
Oh, that's hard, it also happened to me once
yes, yes
when i was very young, i was very young, i was like fourteen when we started and fifteen when we broke up but
Yeah
likewise, like he was like too close to me, like always with me and very
sure
romantic, i mean a boy, really a boy, but still
Sure
and I wasn't too interested in him but
yes.
I had never had a boyfriend nor anything and I felt
Sure, the opportunity, let's say.
I felt like guilty, like leaving him and breaking his heart like I was
yes
guilty. I couldn't, couldn't, couldn't and I knew as you say I knew. After like a month of being together I knew that
Sure. Sure, like, what mess have I gotten myself into, yes.
but, well, after that experience like I realized that you have to end things more, more
yes, is true.
soon because I stayed with him like a year
Sure, from pure pity.
and at that age a year is like too much time.
yes, is true, well is everything in life already. Is like, the pure truth. No, but in fact it hurts the same when they leave you, they leave you but
I think both ways are hard, I mean
but I
that they leave you, one feels so bad, I mean one is like And I have friends, I have a friend that she just recently ended with a
with a boyfriend that they had already been together years and years. And he left her and she had like no idea no idea, like she didn't know.
She didn't know.
I mean no
I mean, what happens, did he stopped loving her, let's say?
He started to think things for the future, and decided  that even if he really loved her, for the
Mmm
future, it wasn't going to work, like
as a couple
They had been together a few years, and he felt that he didn't wanted to spent your future with her, and decided to end it because he didn't
Oh
He didn't wanted to marry her, I mean
Sure, and after 4 years you start to think, well, where is this relationship going?, I mean
Sure, and I think that that as, and he also was really worried, I mean, sometimes
And
That happens most to guys that to women, that
Mmm
And things start getting more serious, and
Sure
And people gets nerveous
Sure, it's hard, and that book that was presented a few time ago. He is no that into you, I was checking, and one of the things this book says, I mean, what this book does is like
He is not that into you was really popular in a season, last year, I think
I don't know it, No, I don't know it
But, hello?, No, It's a book that a dude wrote because the reason, the book, I mean, women are always complaining about how bad is her boyfriend
that the boyfriend, that the boyfriend the other but in reality, according to him, the boyfriend is bad and this and the other because he simply
he's not that into you, I mean, he's not in love with you. Because probably this guy, if it's that he, if a crazy is really in love with a woman is
is one hundred percent, I mean,
Mm.
he gives you flowers, tells you he wants to marry you, he calls you on the phone every day blah blah blah, because that's how men are when they are really in love like that
Sure. Well, I think that men and women like when they really are
Then
in love like they behave like that. But I think that many times is one person in the relation who's like that and the other a little more distant.
yes,
I mean, is like hard that both people are so like that, like so romantic, like
Sure.
Basically is one person, one, I mean, either the man or the woman that
Yes.
that is so
One hundred percent.
Sure, and the, and the other is like more distant. Maybe interested just the same, but a little more like
Mm.
distant, is like hard to have that intensity in both people.
yes yes, I've heard of that. Is true, or sometimes that, when the people are together for so long like there are changes, like for a year
he is more than her and the next year she is more than him, then
Sure
It's like a little dance that exist
I think that there is some kind of imbalance, I mean, there has to be a little of difference because there are many people
It's like you have to be hunting a little and it's like
Married
sire, like a hunter and
the prey let's say, right?
Mmm, Like some kind of game, I mean, it's not do it on purpose
Hello!
Hello!
yes, good evening, my name is George from New York. Whom am I speaking with?
Hello, I'm Alfredo, also from New York
Ah, how are you?
Pardon, I didn't understand your name what's your name?
George, George
George okay
George
Very good,
yes, How is it going?
You live where? You live in Manhattan?
yes, of course
okay
in Handen yes, Where do you live?
yes, also.
ah, good
let's go to the
Then, What do you think of today's topic?
eh, I've seen better topics. I've seen better topics but
on the topic
it's what you, ah, do you have a partner?
I've had three casual partners, right now I've been
ah, yes
Right, I've had quite a bit of experience on the topic, hmm
ah, yes
yes
and, eh, eh, and how long were you with her?
hmm, like eleven years.  I spent like eleven years with my third partner.
Ah, quite a bit, yes, I think that as time passes, like, the longer the relationship the higher is the level, I say
and stronger I say, No?
More than
Or, Do you think it's the same?  Do you think that, as we say, a relationship that lasts many years
yes
lasts more.  When did it end?
hmm
you see that it's proportional to the length of the relationship, or, No?
For the length of the relationship.
yes
Well
Oh no
no, I don't know I think that any relationship, whenever it ends, it's always always the same, I think that well, more than a year or two
I think that it's always the same.  Isn't it?  Really, well, what I think is that the routine is really rough, it's really rough, a lot of times you don't
you sacrifice yourself for your kids and there are some relationships that are really tormented, no?
yes, sure, Do you have kids?
so yes, I have kids.  I had kids in all three relationships and well, really well, I never stopped to look at, at how good
yes, well, there can be confrontations, I'm also a son of separated parents, no?
aha
And well, my parent's separation never really affected me.
yeah
that my kids well don't, don't suffer much but I prefer any way, sure, that they don't come out affected, right?
yeah
But I see many couples, I see that years and years and they're, ugh! a torment, I say no, I think that
it's a situation for the kids.  A, a couple that doesn't love each other, a couple that can't live together and put up with each other, no?  no more, no more than
yes, that what they've shown.
to not
this is, they've proved that it's more damaging.
yes, yes I think it's more damaging, I think that a separation sometimes is better
it's more
so well, this, this is my case and my philosophy, no?
Yeah
At least
and the other relationships?  Like eleven years.  You have three relationships.  Yes, eleven and this and, how long did the other two last?
No, one lasted about six years.  Really I, the six years yeah, why not.  I don't give it more.
yeah yeah
yes.  I don't know but, but the truth is that a pers- that after six year's it's so that, I don't know
yeah
Like there's no flavor in it.  Yes, and
Well, and what other things did they ask us?  Now they asked us that, another question was if with age one changes, the, the
the pain, let's say, what do you think?
I think that I think it's not so much age, but suddenly the stability, suddenly the economic situation and and the human situation.  Right?
yes,
Because for example many couples who have never separated and last twenty years and in many cases, and where the woman has never worked
This is a, a traumatic situation
Sure
yes, a person who's never left the house who's always been submitted, let's say to the labors of the house
Sure, it's
it's
invested everything in being house mothers.  like
Exactly.  So I, for example, I always, the relationships I've had, I always, I don't demand them, but I've always permitted them to have their jobs.
Always, always. Yes, that they have their independence, that, that they depend absolutely on themselves, right?
yes
that, that is my criterion, because I think, you know, I am not good for having a woman in the house
yes
That's it, You get home, just figure, you get home tired of working and so, the woman all day long doing so, busy and suddenly she wants
she wants you to attend her already, right?
mhm
And, and then, as I heard the other day, someone called to a radio station to apologize to her wife because
she had gone mad, because he had arrived tired and she wanted to go out
And no, that's not it, what?, repeat that
So, of course, what?
I didn't understand that last part
Oh, well, someone who called to apologize to his wife because the day before he had arrived late from work, he had arrived tired, the women don't work
and the woman had asked him to go out, and he told her: No I'm very tired, I can't, I don't want to go out I'm very tired
So it's a difficult situation, right? Because it's two, two completely different situations, right?
yes, of course
Because one is out and gets home tired, he wants to arrive to rest. The other one is home all day long, she is bored and wants to
Wants to go out, wants to do something, of course
Exactly. So, I always prefer the partner to work. She has to work, she has to be occupied with something
And have your partners been American?
No, no, never, no
Yeah yeah
This is another situation.  I think that he will have an American partner, good, but he's already talked enough and what is your
Well, look, I
your experience or point of view.
my point of view is that I think that it makes a difference, I think I could be wrong, but I think that with time relationships become cemented.
So, a relationships, let's say a year long one, is like falling one meter.
yes
A ten year relationships is a much stronger fall.
hmm
in my opinion.  Because I think that with time you even, let's say that being in love and the difficult thing is this part
yes
I think that if you get, for example a pet, I don't know if you've had pets that dies, but
hmm
when you live with a dog for ten years and
hmm
and it goes, like this I'm making like a, it's not like when a person dies but, love dies, and this is like a, a loss.
No, I understand, always
I find that the more time and the more you get used to someone, the stronger it is,
hmm well I think that if it's a break- well let's say that a moment comes to one or the other, one of the two gets to this point, no?
Uh huh
Uh, suddenly that one, because suddenly, when things are coming, they look like, like they don't, well suddenly people have to prepare, and suddenly it's because of lack of preparation from the people, right?
But, yes, obviously, obviously
That's, that's a good point
Obviously, with age, the habits, there are many things, it's obviously not easy, yeah
There are many factors, but we agree that a, a, a, a fact, uh, that's, they call it nail, i didn't think about that
what
Yes
sometimes i find it true, uh
Yes
that it's so suddenly, and, and
Yes,
It's the same in death, when
Yes, the, death
It dies, when it was already know that it was cancer and it was known that
Exactly, you say yeah, i was expecting that, yes
that was suffering, sure, it's very different to a son dying in an accident
Yeah, exactly, or like a pet, right?, or the worst cases that
yes
I mean, there are people that get affected, uh, enormously, enormously, because they love them so much, right?, yeah, i don't know, i think that
Well, I don't know, really
You say that when things end, they are bad
yes, I think that many things that when they don't work anymore, you should not stand that, I don't know, many fights, It's like there is not
there is not, there is not anything
I mean, I think that they might be
There is not
that they agree, because I know that there are times that they both realize that is not working
Mmm
But I think that there are also cases, where someone really stays
yes
more affected that the other one, I mean
yes, yes, I think that most of the time, right?, it's really weird to coincide both of them
yes
I think that almost every time one of them is more affected that the other one
I think that might be a huge factor, right?
yes
It must be really easy to be on the side that it's rejecting, not the rejected, right?
yes, I think that it's not easy, and there is many things around, right?, economical situation, children
loneliness, and finding a moment because it didn't had friends, all because it was completely dedicated to the relationship, right?
Mmm
as they say: "To start over again", it's not easy, it's really not
yes, and in the holiday season, that must have been a little
Ah, no
hard. No? why
yes, it's, it's, yes, sure
because
you have
well, I don't know how old the kids are, but
the
how do you do those things you do when Santa Claus has that kind of problems, I don't know
yes, yes, that's hard, it's running to one place, running to another
yes, yes, that excuse is, is good
I've had to do it sometimes, well, I go there I think he disagrees with it
yes
I know, I always, I feel that, someone feels offended, or someone is going to be angry always, to tell the truth
yes, you can't be in three places at the same time
yes, no, that's true, that's very true
You don't distribute it, you divide it. But, hey, I say, with the, the, the thing with your family, let's say current, I mean
yes
What they are, I also meant. They, are like splitting up, right?
hmm
How do they treat an, an issue like Christmas?  Like, do the kids realize that this is happening?  or
are they hiding it or did they tell them, or, how are they dealing with this?
well I'm really in this trance where, that I still don't
Yeah
no, let's say no, no, there are differences, there's a very big difference
yes
let's say it's talked about,
Yeah
yes, really yes, but it's very difficult.  Sure, obviously,
This is the difficult part, yes
But, it's really difficult, it happened to me many years ago between the first and the second relationship, it was really difficult
yes
it was really difficult, well above all, well, there are different attitudes of the people.  No?  Involved in this issue.
yes
so well, yes it's, it's not easy but I think that, in truth, like I say, I say, I told her
Hello
James, New York
Hello, my name is Miriam, from Toronto.
Miriam from Toronto, how are you?
Fine, and what's your name?
I'm James, from here from New York.
Oh, Hi James how are you?
Fine
How nice And eh, the break up of couples And, and well tell me what, what is your experience when breaking up with a person. Do you feel very bad?
How, how, how has it happened?
Well, thank, eh, thank God that eh, I got a woman today, because really the topic with a man is like it's more I wanted eh
this, this day that I got it, I said well I would've liked to have gotten a woman to see from a woman's point of view what it is that
that she has in mind, what she really thinks,
I mean, okay tell me.
really for me, I find it easy to break up with a person, as long as I've been with her a short time, and, I see that the relationship is not going to get anywhere, anywhere, instead of
prolonging it, well I like, I like then, to evaluate it and like that well, here, we are not going to get anywhere, mm
let's, let's keep a friendship better, that have her, string her along because of pity, or for any other convenience, or with another reason, another reason that
that that, could be a reason, or could be a motive to, to, to, prolong the relationship a little bit more. I think that if,
at first you see the person you realize what you want, and what the other person, you realize what really
expect from her, the other doesn't have it, you don't find it in that person Or the same, the same chemistry with, with that person well, I think that you realize that
you can decide if it drags on the matter
Hm mm
I think we will be better as friends
okay
you must respect yourself and decide which person you should be the one for you.
you know there is always an explanation about things
in your experience have you had many broke ups and you evaluate people?
I like to evaluate the person because they can always be different.
okay
often they broke up with me some other times I broke up the relationship
okay
sometimes you break uo with the person but
you better not be together when it does not matter.
you usually always and up missing  the person.
is it always?
we always miss the person.
Oh yeah, whenever the person is miss, you know, you get together with someone, then there are memories, moments together, and stuff.
you provided that the person is not always there when you really miss him/her.That´s when you realize what you want in your life.
for example my last relationship
was a little long with a girl.
Hm mm
The problem with this girl is that she was too, flirtatious.
Aha
And, also, the problem also that eh, yes flirtatious. So she was always flirting with all the guys. And she was also very pretty.
Aha
Then, we always had a lot And she always would go out by here by there, And, she was very dishonest.
Oh, but did you notice that before getting into the relationship?
No, not before getting into it no. During the relationship I realized it, I broke it off,
Aha
I broke it off and for, for missing her and all that, she called me, and she tells me, no I'm going to change, you know that I don't know what,
She changed for a moment, but then again, it went back to the same, and there was always this question that she was going to change. I always gave her an opportunity to
Oh, but, yes, the flirtatious person, doesn't mean that, that they cheat on you, but that they are like that, they have a happy nature. Or is
No, no
that apart from being a flirt, she was cheating on you.
No no, a flirt yes, she went out with guys, and would tell me that no.
Oh well, that's wrong, that's already wrong.
She would tell me that no, that that it wasn't like that, that, and then I would realize it because I would see her, I would see her I found her several times.
Oh no that's wrong, that's wrong, yes
And she would still tell me no, that it's a lie, that we only went to the movies and nothing else, that I don't know what,
Ah no
But after I found, I found out that if they really had left for a few says, and they had
thinking love, then
Oh, that's a shame, Why there are women like that, so
Well, there are loves like those
dishonest
Love like those, so
Yeah
Oh, I broke up with her, that's why I told you, I told to myself, she said, no, I will change again, and I said, no, no to this
it's a vicious circle
Mmm
You will never change
Yes
You will nave change, and it's not good for me, so  I closed the door, I missed here, sure, the
I missed to listen to her voice listen, some places, anything, but you really realized that is not for you, is not what you want for your life, a woman that is behind
A woman you have to behind her. Looking who she calls, who she does not call, who is by the house or who is not by the house, so, that is not for me
Yes, that's really sad, sure, sure, because you have to feel safe with your couple
yes, then you close it and I closed the door for her, and then, she, you realize that you can miss her
Mmm
Bur missing and being in love with that person does not meean, that you had evaluated inside you what was what you really expected from a couple relation, of a relationship
Or from a marriage, what is you want to have in your life, I had, I
Uh huh
I guess you don't want to go after a man that's unfaithful to you, or that, or that looks for relationships in other places, or that
uh, is always teaching [telling] others, the other girls, that he is always available
Right, right
You know
Yeah
And that's what she always taught [told], that she was available, that she was
Oh, that's a shame, well, and you got involved emotionally pretty much, i mean, you didn't like her because of her looks, or because of her, but you got emotionally involved, you took her
to, to love, i mean, to have a very special love and
Yes, yes, of course. But like i was saying, you
right
first of all, you can't love a person without loving yourself, if you, if your relationship is destroying you
Uh
right?, physically, emotionally
Uh huh
uh, you have to step aside form it. Because you, uh, you have to call [love] to be able to love
Well, well, it's OK
to love yourself to be able to love
Yeah, it's ok, you're strong, because there's people that fall , right?, into a circle, that they can't get out of
oh
Like you say, if they don't love themselves, if they don't have respect, self esteem, and
Yeah
and they let themselves be manipulated in this way.  They let themselves be emotionally exploited. Yeah, and it's really sad.  But now nice, how nice that you
yes
know what you want and and for you, therefore, it's not hard to decide if someone
No, while anyway, you respect yourself, your own self and you say look, this is good for me, this isn't good for me.
Hmmm
We'll suppose that I'm a woman.  And suddenly I find myself with a man that no man wants possession of me, and wants to have, eh
to control my time, to know who calls me, of my privacy, and I have this emotional abuse, who abuses me emotionally,
or physically.  You have to respect yourself, and say, oh this isn't good for me.
Hmmm, hmmm
You know, I'm going to get away from this relationship.  Even though this person, gives you some physical benefit, emotional, financially, you know, you have to respect yourself, and say I don't need this,
let me get out of this relationship.
Wow, well I'm happy, you're great, yeah.
And and so
how great.
um, I think that we've dri-, how do you say, gone off topic a bit,
No, because the question is, Is it easy to break up, something like that, and does age influence or not.
Oh, well, the, age, related to the age, I'm thirty, and, yesterday I turned thirty eight
Oh, happy birthday.
Thank you
The little hump, in Peru we say, the hum-, we'll get the little hump down the next day
Yeah
Oh, how cool
Yeah, but I don't feel, I don't feel, how do you say, like an old man, and I don't- and I feel like younger now
You're young, son, you're still young
Ah
And then you, in you life, you told me you've had many, but in your relationships are, because I don't know, I don't understand
I don't know, look. I'm 40 years old, and in my rel- in my whole life I've had four relationships. But I've never broken up with anyone. They've broken up with me. Because I get like very
yes
I get very attached to the person
Where are you from?
Sometimes, I'm from Peru
oh, yes?
And then it's like, sometimes I tell myself, it's not good for me, I don't like him, but
Where did you say you lived?
Toronto
Toronto, Canada
yeah, yeah
Ah, then you
Ah, that's why I tell you, I don't know if, but yes, when there's a break up is very sad, even though the relationship wasn't working, I stay sad.
are
For years.
are you with someone now?
yes, the father of my kids.
yes, it's going
And also I tell you it's just been recently that we've reconciled, after being separated two years
is it going well with him now?
More or less, but there's nothing perfect I say also there's no perfection, you have to put up with the person, don't you think, but we ourselves are not perfect.
Depends. where you married to him?
No, I've never been married to him.
Okay
But I always wait for many years, and
you waited to see how it worked out?
yes, because since, my son is five years old and since six years ago, I I have never been with anybody, only with him, understand, but he, it seems he has had
Hm mm
Like I tell you, I I don't break up with the person, the people break up with me. I'm very cowardly to break up a relationship. And well, I'm glad that you have that
Well eh, eh, I tell you, is a matter of self-respect. It's a matter of, self respect and loving yourself, like that well, I love, I love myself.
Sure, sure
And I think that to be crying or to be in this or to be sad or thinking, I had better
But not me, no, I don't know, I don't know, perhaps for the man is easier to find someone. Because I've been alone understand. The relationship that I have with my kids' dad is more apart, than together.
And I've been able to find another person
yes I hear you
well
hello
yes
ah, Silvia here, how are you?
ah, very good
how nice, what a crazy topic, right? the couples, ah, I already imagine that yes
eh, yes, true
they are, it doesn't matter how old they are to you, it has by experience the same as mine well, hard to break up but I say for other couples it would be ah, easy eh
depending of the circumstances, right?
eh yes, I mean, for some people is definitely easier, for others harder
mm, but I'm talking about, ah couples well, that have been together already a long time I've seen couples that have never gotten married and they still get along well
some that have, they have been married for fifty years and separate after such a long time, and I don't understand a lot of times why, why they continue to be friends,
aha, and then they keep on seeing the kids and anyways they keep on seeing each other, I mean, the only thing that, that happens is that
yes, daily
that they don't live in the same house right but, eh, they still see each other daily
yes,
yes
but, its' a ah, a topic that I don't know much about because my, my marriage failed after twenty years, but no, I got married too young
eighteen years ago and
Uh
Yeah, after twenty years my eyes opened up a little, i didn't know anything, well
Right
i didn't, i didn't know a, i didn't, everything was secret at home, what was important to know wasn't known, i mean, that
Right
there was people that drank, there were alcoholics, there were drugs and i didn't know any of that, and when it came out with, my husband had all of that
Oh
and i was going to change him and my family didn't want to, and that argument was, i, i got mad ans said,  i will stay there to prove that yes, this man can change
right?, that he was going to change, right?
Right, and he never changed
No, no, no, i realized that much later, but more than anything i wanted to protect the kids, i had, i had two girls and i said no
i will protect my family against this
Right
so that no other man will bother me and no other man will come to take my children because i have heard that a lot, the
in my parent's conversations, that the children were abused one way or the other
i mean, the reason
uh, so i said, well i won't stay like this, so since then i haven't had any partner, I'm alone, just me, my girls grew up a lot, they're twenty six, twenty five years old and
now i do want to search for a partner, right?, that a, a man that can, at least, uh, do some of the things that you do when you're old
take vacations, go out for dinner and to, to leave that subject of the children, but it's hard to find someone that have children that aren't
adult or that aren't problematic, right?
Yes, yes, some of them are Emilio's
i have, yeah, I'm telling you, i'm forty four years old and i'm not worried, but yeah, it would
but married again, uh, i can't imagine
yes
because when you're getting old, you have your ways and your, uh, the habits are, you can't change them and if they don't fit, let's see, i don't know
Uh huh
But, mom and dad were married until my father died and it was fifty one years so, and i think they were very happy, i saw them very happy, but
According to my mom, she didn't know him
uh, yeah, they spent a while, fifty years
Yeah, and where are you from?, no, I'm sorry, it's that
yeah, uh, i'm, well, I'm Mexican
Oh, yes, me too
yeah, you don't sound like a mexican, you sound more like, i don't know
Yeah, because i hear a lot of Colombian people, a lot of, uh, Puerto Ricans live here, in Indiana, where i live and it's a suburb in Chicago
Right
and a lot of Hispanic people from all kinds of places come here, and when i talk to them i get their, uh
you get their tone
the accent, everything, right
yeah, yeah, uh, no, here
uh huh
I mean, i live in Texas, so, well, i think most of them are
Oh, a Mexican of course
They're mexican, yes, so
I was raised in Laredo, Texas, until i was seventeen years old to
in Laredo
so, our granny, uh, forced us to learn the language, but she was tough, oh my god, i was very little, my granny made an effort for us to watch it daily so we would
learn
right
to be able to read, write and speak it perfectly, according to her, because it was going to do a lot of good for us, well yeah, it turns out that i get 25 dollars more in my job
per hour because i speak the language
Because you're bilingual, yes
Oh yes
What's up, in fact it helps a lot, uh, i, with my kids, well, the oldest, my littler girl is six years old
um
but uh, she doesn't want to speak spanish, i mean
oh yes
it's very hard
Right now I'm trying
it's very hard
the same thing happens with my grand children, they don't want to, they don't think it's important, or that, i don't know, the same i though when i was little, that
it was a, bother because, who, who was I going to talk to?  Aside from my grandmother, because my mom talked with us in English and my friends also
but she, thank God that she forced us
yes yes well yes it's the, it's what happens, like, here it's more that, that I hear force my daughter to
hmm
she doesn't want to, but one time when she went to visit her grandparents over in Mexico
aha
there, and she was skating, no battling that
aha yeah
that they didn't understand her and then, I told her, there the grandparents don't speak Spanish, I said, they don't speak English
hmm
you, you have to speak
hmm this yes but no, with this topic about the couples, unfortunately I don't know anything
well
no, hmm
I know very little of, well, I say, I also have been married, like for ten years almost
ah well yes, you have to know something, no?
and this, well, this is how it all goes, like, this
hmm
well anyway, for what I've seen, like, yes there are good things and bad things
hmm, hmm
like that how he says I mean, for some people it is very easy
mm
I imagine that, from what I've seen is that, a, once you break up with the first, the second, the third, the fourth already is
is much more easy, right?
mm
I mean, it's already like changing shoes
ah that's true
practically
that I do agree with because, of many friends that I have I've seen them keep on after a, eh, they already have the experience of leaving their, have to
see a criteria they want and when, when that criteria is not satisfied, whatever it was, ah, out, they already say
that they can't anymore
yes and I think that once, once they realize that the person let's say it's independent
mm
is when it's made easier
that's true, because
mm
I've seen my friends that suffer, with the same and, since I didn't let go of my husband for nothing, and every time that he would tell me
well let's try again, and I never said no
mm
it was always yes but, I think it has to do a lot with religion, because if one is devoted and since God always teaches that one should
Specially if you're catholic, any religion says you must do an effort, well, so the family that does an effort should stay together, but
but it can also harm the kids, because i mean, now they want to name the, the decease that kids have
they want to call it a decease, that they are children from a divorced family
Right
on the screen, uh, the TV
Yeah
i only saw pieces, there was a lady saying that yes, she was affected pretty bad because every time she thinks about marrying she can't
she can't, uh, do it, just because she has
that's true
she's very afraid that the same will happen to her, and she wants to have children but at the same time she doesn't want to have them outside the marriage, well, there's a
number of problems that she has done herself, but she's suffered because her dad left her mom twice and he left them
in very bad shape financially
yes
but when she wanted to do a, her, well, her dad's, communicate to him later on, it wasn't the same, so, she felt distant, but that's an example of many that
well, if the person is strong, she can overcome it, and maybe with help from a psychiatrist or maybe a group or, maybe the very person itself can do, uh
and overcome that problem, right?, because, incidentally, a  lot of things happen to a lot of children and they can
yes
uh, move on
Right, yes, well, and even though, well, many times, well they blame the
uh, the parents, well, yes
to, to the parents, yes, I mean
all the parents, are to blame for everything
yes I mean, I mean be it good, be it bad, well, easier the bad
aha
that's what always happens, that they blame the parents and well since the parents got divorces well
that's true mm
is that's why is that you already
a crutch
aha that's why we are, we are
mm
how we are, because the parents have, have divorced
is true but, mm, ah, a lot of combinations for having ten years because although I, I stayed married twenty years we were not ah, together, it was a constant separation because
ah I, I couldn't put up with it I would say look, if you are going to drink here leave already
aha
if you are going to take, like that, of friends and
ah
behave like that leave already
yes
then, he was out of the marriage more than what he was in.
more than
I'm only married on paper
uh huh
and, well
no well, at least I, I that's why I've always said I mean, no
mm hmm
uh, when I got married he was what, twenty seven years old? So well I said
oh, yea
I mean I'd already done all I wanted to do, I mean I already knew
more yea,
I'd already, I'd already se- seen and done a lot
yea
uh, a- before before it went bad,
mm hmm it's more my ma- my husband, my ex-husband always deals with me, he always says he wants to be friends, he always wants to get along well with me, he says, you're the only family I have, I said
ah, but I don't understand anything about being friends, no, but if he wants us to be able to talk in a civil way, well I can understand that
uh huh
but when he needs help I'm the one he asks, and I told him, and the friends you've had all your life? Where are they?
friends when times were good, they were
yea, no, yea it doesn't stop but that's how life turns out, so
yea
uh, you learn but I wouldn't recommend to anyone that they get married young because you're still getting to know yourself and you realize
Hello?
Hello?
Who's speaking?
How are you? My name is Adrian.
How are you? My name is Mara Ines. Eh, I'm in Philadelphia.
In Toronto, Canada. And you, what part of Buenos Aires?
Ah. No, from Mar del Plata.
Ah, almost, almost
You, from the city of Buenos Aires, no? yes?
yes.
Ah full yes, well. What do we do? Do we talk about today's topic? The boyfriends and girlfriends.  The courtships
Eh, I don't know. I'm  a little off the market, eh
yes, in reality me too. But well.
Is that
Except for the memories, I can't give an opinion, I can't give an opinion of how it is nowadays or anything, so and if not, tell me about Canada. How is it? Very cold?
Eh, it is, in reality, it is like too hot. It must be like in zero Celsius at this moment and all the snow we had melted.
Eh?
The little snow there was and, and for this time, in Toronto is like I don't know, but five or six degrees above normal.
Look.
It should be colder than
Also here last year at this time the weather was getting very cold as well as in Canada.
the cold is tremendous
yes the cold is tremendous about seven degrees Celsius below zero
still not cold, it is fine
it's cold, snow ice.
when it is ten degrees is too cold.
It was too cold.
yes the nose
Si. It was too cold to those who have you been there before.
For four years, this will be my fifth winter
Compared to Buenos Aires you must be better prepared me for the cold.
yes there is no point of comparison
At least we have wind, when I came here I wanted to kill myself it was so cold.
I had to buy new clothes
The street suerter of John B
Neither the knit caps ran Grandma's worked it was so cold
Is there a street call Juan B. Justo in Mar de plata?
Juan B. Justo
Where are the factories of sweaters?
it is not good because they are terrible and ugly.
but.
but the people go. It is like a tradition for tourists to go there.
my grandfather actually lived many years in silver sea.( Mar de plata)
Look.
h no, the image of my old woman and my other grandmother taking me
goos price
to buy sweaters putting me on the street horrifying Juan B. just
Yes, a few years ago was better, but these last ten years anything, everything is made in China.
here are some who do not. there are some that are very good, but, well few. They are also in the center, no need for Juan B.Where  are you?
Yes, is it work?
Why? I wanted to leave Buenos Aires, I wanted to go to Australia
Um.
Finish living a sort of holiday visiting friends here in toronto
Look
Um, Everything went bad.
I would never come back. Did you stay?
No, I did not stay but the trip was to take a desition
OK
to stay or not to stay.
Yes, Of course.
not bad in Buenos Aires not anything like that.
In Buenos Aires
the first two years in Buenos Aires was better than  here.
of course, yes, I have several acquaintances in Canada I do not even remember the cities, My brother is an engineer agronomist.
Some of my classmates went to Canada
there are many Argentines here, where else is in montreal.
I think it's Montreal.
In Montreal
one of my friends married a girl from there and took her to Argentina.
they could not stand the cold.
in Montreal is much colder than here.
okay
there are places much worse.
Ottawa, I almost go to Ottawa in a moment.
Ottawa is a very beautiful city
yes
yes there are many cities like that in Canada.
I looked up in the internet when I went to Ottawa.
okay
the pictures of the city were very beautiful.
What Ottawa has is a small town, about 300 000 people
Oh, look that
No matter if it is the capital, the capital, federal capital of
Weird, right?, in Canada
From Canada, but the way the government works here is really different from the Argentinian Government, with the Independence of the regions, it's big
Oh
And Ottawa is half from, half in Ontario which is the State where Toronto is and Half in Montreal, which is the region where Quebec is
Oh
The Quebec state, which is half way both cities
And, in purpuse, maybe
No, not exactly, is not causality that it is right there, but it's a city where I was sometimes for work, is really nice, has a, it's a rural city, if you like
Oh, the
It would be like Mar del Plata, Mar del Plata must be bigger than Ottawa
Yes, it's true, it has 600 000 people, the double
That's why, that's why I said
Sure
The concept of a capital for Argentinians should be huge
Sure, and well, you look for photos on the internet, and I went there at the moment they offered me the job that I already accept it and well
And I came here, kid of sad because I found nicer Canada than the United Sates, but I had already said yes her and I needed to change, but
I really liked, but It seemed huge when I look the photos
. No, the downtown in Ottawa is five blocks by five blocks, eh I think so
Sure, it's small
There is the Parliament which is very beautiful, eh, the Rideu Canal, which freezes, at this moment it must be frozen and, ah, it's, how you call it? it's
the slogan of, eh ,ah, the largest ice skating rink in the world
Figure, natural yes
You, you can skate to your office, eh
If you want to. Some people do it, for sure
No, no, yes, It's like this, that's it. If you ever think of going to Montreal you must speak both English and french
Oh oh
It is the bilingual city par excellence
Oh, look. It would have been a disaster. My English is fine, but french, hardly three words. Oh yes
Eh, besides, I am not sure whether it's french or just something similar
And the, eh, is very divided, right? Really, the relationship between french speakers and English speakers is very bad, right?
There is a traditional, uh, resentment, I don't know. No, no, actually I don't know what the hell do the people from Quebec complain about, but
mm, they are always with the independence claim. That
Oh, yes, I haerd about that. I heard something about that they will do elections to see if they can become independent
eh, there was, there was a referendum, there were two referendum
yes they want to become independent
the last one was ten years ago. Not long ago was the tenth anniversary of it. And, mm, actually I don't know what they think, I don't know why they do it, I mean, what is it that they want
Sure
Like that, like, like outsider that I am I'm very interested in the topic em, more than anything because the Quebec are Latins and
yes.
And, and they are more similar to us. They scream and drink wine and they fight and good luck
Look. And the others don't. The ones from Montreal are more tranquil like the Americans, able.
No, no, No, no. Those are the ones from Montreal, those are the Quebec
Ah, no, ah, I'm dizzy, ah.
Eh, the ones from here are, supposedly they have a, a British background
Sure.
of austerity, and loyalty and the, development but
Look at that.
Mm. I don't know what. In, in, in Ottawa what you have is the, the Ottawa employer is the federal government, eighty percent of the jobs
are for the federal government and the, the requirement is the
Sure.
eh, bilingual. But, like, like that, as well.
Both yes, look at that. Look at that, look at that. How incredible.
In, in, this side, from, from the Ontario side is English
yes
eh, if you speak both languages you can find work just for that, if you want.
Ah, look.
And, but, but, English is predominant and, the opposite if you go to Montreal.
Sure, and, let's say, in those places, if you speak one of them you are alright, I mean, you can get a job, everything
In a way, yes, you will survive
Sure, and do you speak French as well?
No, I understand some words. No, no, I can't have a conversation in French
Oh. In French. But then understanding it is not that difficult
Oh
yes, uh, I don't know what accent they have there. I mean in France, I listened to the people and understood what they were talking about, don't ask me to repeat the conversation, but more or less I knew what they were talking about, I don't know. It hase many words thet you
mmm. I don't know. It is quite affected
Not there. They don't have any accent
I don't know if it is because of the accent, but it is complicated, it's , it's like Spanish, with the A and E nad
Sure, no. Speaking it is very difficult
Eh, and verb conjugations, and the accents
yes, speaking is very difficult, already. I tries to study at a time, then I quitted, but
I'm Alfredo and I'm talking to you from New York
hello I'm Marcela in North Carolina
hi Marcela
How's it going?
well pretty well, here in
how can you hear in the city
yea I can hear the sirens
in New York
it's pretty normal for here so like dating
dating couples, well I've been married now for a long time
ha, but but that must not be very fun then
so no, I don't have a good record of dating
and, and no yea like it's an exclusive relationship so
yea, yes yes yes, yea
mm yea, he
we've been together for thirty years
you've been together for thirty for years?
yea, thirty years
wow, so internet dating didn't exist for you two
no it wasn't around, no, no, no, no it wasn't around, no even the DC were around
the what?
the -CD's
ah sure, no
and the personal computers didn't exist, nothing existed
yes listen, and where are you from originally?
I'm Argentinian and you?
I'm Chilean
mm, we're neighbors
look
you've been here long
eh well I've never lived in Chile,  I left during the coup
mm
eh and lived in Europe, Mexico, in Honduras
ah
and, I've been here in New York like ten years
um, so you were, born in Chile but
no, I was born in the United States but went to live to Chile
your parents are Chileans
my parents are Chileans
mm
they were studying there, and so I went to live in Chile, my dad worked with agrarian reform, with Allende's government
hmm yeah and after what happened happened
and obviously we had to, yes, but, well here, now I'm in New York I'm looking for work, I just moved here because I finished school there in Wisconsin and I returned about three months ago
um
so
so you're not married
yes, in reality I'm married
ah
but, no, I separated from my wife about three years ago
hmm
and and we're still married because I'm waiting for them to give her the papers
hmm, sure
to be American, I'm giving her residence and this is why we have to separate it seems
yes, yes, this takes time
yes, um
yes no, I met my husband at school, at university
wow, in what university
and, eh well, it's a theater academy but during the uears he was a graduate, in Los Angeles
hmm
and after these ten years we got married but to celebrate the ten year anniversary
sure
so in total they're thirty years
okay, I already understand
legally they're twenty
they're twenty but look I was with my wife, I was six years
um ha
from there I got married and it lasted two years only and now it's been three years since that happened, look I believe that
look at that
the important thing is the relationship, not the paper
yes no that's true, that's true, now that of meeting people on the internet
yes
it could be that it has to do with the different generations but to me that seems like something very strange
Why so strange?
I don't know, it seems strange perhaps because I'm a very visual person
yes
you understand me, I mean I can't imagine eh, how it would be to meet a person and form a friendship with someone even develop some sort of affection, but it's an affection based on what? based on, on letters only
well no, and you are not limited to that because that's one way, but there are places where one puts pictures, and looks for specific people, you put there
a sort of, of what I like, what are
oh no, yes of course, that's a kind of dating
and that, and that is a big part of dating that they are doing now on line and they ask you many things about personality to search for compatibility, that's what they say they add
yes, yes, look you know what I would like to do but just to have fun only of course just like to act crazy, but what I would like try
mm
just to see how it is, is that of speed dating
yes sure
where people go to like a restaurant or something and then you sit with someone for I don't know two minutes, three minutes, I don't know a very short time
five minutes, five minutes, yes yes
and then they ring a bell or something, I don't know, and then you move to the other table and talk with the other person
yes I think that's interesting, because you know looking in their eyes, and being there, talking a little seeing if there's a connection or not
yes, yes
I, I understand what you are saying through the computer like no
I think that would be fascinating to do that only as a form of experiment, to see how
safe
what?
what happens is that you have to be careful, be careful that there are some that when one decides it's supposed to be a complete date there are some that are like that, there are some
to
I mean that no, is not like at the hour you are going to tell him well I'm going home already or whatever like you have five or ten minutes to say yes yes or no
but that you decide like you are not committed to do things
yes
necessarily specific, but to eat, you have dinner and all
sure
so
yes
yes, it could be interesting, I
but is that they are interesting things, but is strange, I don't know, because we have so many people and so many communication mediums and however, it's obvious that the majority of people feel alone
yes, is true and, and is hard sometimes finding, you're lucky that you haven't had that problem sometimes I, for example after being eight years with my wife
um ha
after that I had to start with, dates again and that was like strange, one already eight years that hasn't play the game let's say is
yes,yes
different then yes, it's been interesting, I I always, at least I've seen on the internet many of those sites, I'm not participating in any but I've seen them
um ah
inclusive there are casual encounters, that one can see, that are very fun to read on craigs list
mm, mm no
I don't know if you've seen them very entertaining the one yesterday was about a couple, she's five months pregnant they were looking for one or two participants, to
make love in front of those other people
oh yes, no, that's an old story
not necessarily with contact and I said, someone has to answer also, is that imagine a pregnant woman seeing her having sex with her type, I mean
oh God, what a thing
perhaps, you have to see the New York, if you are going to do it, it's very entertaining you go to craigslist dot com New York and casual encounters read them that they are very good
let's see, I'm going to go because is that I like to read funny things like that
it's called casual encounter in English
but, yes, really, I don;t know, we have two children, one is 23 yo and the other one 17 yo
So, and they use the internet
No, no, they make like the old times, meeting people in the school, or
yes
where they live maybe, I don't know, I think that the majority, well, maybe I;m wrong, but I think that the majority of people
first they try to meet someone trough friends, trough where they work, school, church
Oh, I see, and when they can't
And when they are desperate, they sign up
it's a good theory, but I don't agree, I think that the younger people now realizes that internet is considered distinct, I think, the tool
that can look for compatibility, without having to go out, to bars, in New York, for example, where you met people is in bars
yes
well, if it's in work, or with a friend, but it might be a really close circle, many people here, does not make that many social activity in the week, at least there is not much time, people is short in time
so, people must met in a gym, or a bar
yes, that's true
it's like, finding a needle in a haystack
yes, yes
and when you can, well, I'm someone that likes the cinema, so, you make a quick online search
and you get the pictures of, maybe, 15 candidates
sure
they send a little mail saying, and suddenly the same on their side, their instinct works and I think it might be, if someone is desperate, or nor
Look, it's logical, the truth is
it doesn't have much to do with what can be your partner or not, you know?, because it doesn't
Yeah, right?, you save time from all those dudes and girls that you're wasting time on
i can tell something that i, no, what i can say from the start is that i have seen a lot of pictures in those websites
Um, right
And people, it's not necessary like those people of more desperate appearance
Um
There's people that's very, very pretty, gorgeous, in those websites, so it doesn't add up, i can't believe they have no other way of doing it, i think that, it can also be fun like that
maybe it's the new, it's the new wave
I think it's the new wave, interesting, a little bit of adrenaline
Yes
a little exhibitionism sometimes, uh, when... it depends on the pictures they put, and maybe, i don't know
Yeah, the thing is that when you meet with this person and that the picture and the person match
and it's very different, that photo is from fifteen years ago
Because you imagine, it turns out you're meeting one of these girls like that, completely hot and you open the door and it's a parrot, that would be horrible
it must be, right?
but, what are you gonna do about it, right?
No, i think it's something...
Uh, and another thing, how do you know that these people...?, sure, that the person there, live, it could also be lying to you, no, but you think how do you know that what they're putting there is what they like, what they are, what they do?, it's true
well, you find out, i think that if you get there and the person is very different than the picture, you have a problem of trust on that person from the start, besides you may not like it
yes, um ha
but after this, I mean, I think that if you lie, as you get to know the person one realizes it and
um ha yes
yes, I think that
me thank God that I don't have to worry about that
you don't have, don't have to worry about that I think that I'm already getting there, well, no, not yet, I'm thirty three years old
ah, young
some day I will be one of those desperate ones that puts, that puts the thing on the internet
no, I'm fifty years old, so I'm on the other side of the wall already
um ha
and that would be very easy, imagine that I don't know what at this age one separates or becomes widowed or and who knows and, and one finds himself alone and
Hello
Hello, how are you?
Very well, what's your name?
George George
George? I'm Diana from New York
from New York
Diana from Philadelphia, but I'm calling from San Francisco
aha, like, like in the
because I came here for the holly days because my brother lives here
in San Francisco?
yes in California
but you live, where?
in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
oh, Philadelphia, what's your name?
Diana
Diana, how are you Diana, where are you from?
Paraguay
oh well, pleased to meet you, Colombian
oh my pleasure
so and what do you think about the subject?
the topic was the courtship
the courtships
yes
and how have you been?
are you married or?
yes I've been married
yes
yes of course, and you?
What? no, no I have a boyfriend, since a year ago
ah well, then you know sick of the topic
a little, a little, I don't know, I don't know much about the courtship through the internet
because it's fresh no, no, you haven't had, nor have you met anyone that has boyfriend by the internet
no, not many I do remember when I was, now I'm twenty six years old, but when I was like fifteen years old, eh I was
yes
there was a, a guy that lived in Spain
yes
that we talked a lot by chat, and every day, but it wasn't a courtship, it was someone with whom I talked to a lot basically
yes, a friendship
exactly, but
but not, not a courtship
What?, what other question did they ask about relationships?
I don't know, i don't remember what, the initial question was about relationships, the last one was about the internet, but i don't know about the beginning
Beginning
What were the questions
i don't, i don't know either, i'm, i'm, i think I'm happy with this relationship, but i came here to California to visit my brother who's ten years older
oh, well, yeah
He's thirty six
Yes
And he doesn't have a girlfriend
Yes
He broke up with his girlfriend like six months ago
yes
And so he's living the life of a, how do you say it?, a bachelor
a bachelor
Very much like a bachelor, i mean i don't, i don't know much, i don't like it very much that he's like that
Why not?
No, because he goes to the bar, he meets a girl one night and then it's over
it's over
And there's nothing there, it's over, he met someone like that, last night he met someone and he mentioned something, i didn't go with him
Yes
but he mentioned to me that he new someone and he laughed, so, he didn't tell me many details
yes
but basically in the environment of the bar is like, eh, I don't know, it seems like you can really get into the life of the game, more or less
not take the relationship between a man and a woman seriously
yes, and what do you think is the best way, because a dance is a good start
yes?
well I think so, what happens, well someone take like a rumba, and well, that night you decide who you want to dance with and, bye bye, the next day it's forgotten, no?
yes, aha
but, at least in my case, I meet someone dancing and I'm interested, I try to keep it going to eh, turn into something more, no?
but it's a good
how did you meet your, your woman?
what did you say?
how, how did you meet your wife?
well, I've had three up until now, yes
three wives, yes, that's good
and I'm booking, because I'm in the process of another, another separation now, the first was, the first was from school
ah yeah  yeah, a young love
um so, yes
in secondary, high school
yes, exactly, and, second
how nice, how nice, this is a dream, I have a boyfriend, I had a boyfriend
yes
who was my first love and
hmm
and I don't know, he was really young, I was really young
yes
and things didn't work, but until now I think that it would be nice for things to work one day
of course yes
by chance or something like that, to come back to this first love
yes, there are people who, I know cases of people who after they've been married, they've separated and met their first love again
yes
yes, and there have been these kinds of cases when one takes its course and finally comes back in a few years
aha
like if the things work, but good, the second I don't know, I don't remember if it was a ca- a sister of a friend where I worked
went out with m-
hm, yeah through a friend
yes, we played a lot on the weekends and the third was, after a breakup in a trip to another city, and working in the company I met someone
on a trip

ah yes you called and
San Francisco, yes I called

yes, yes, yes, yes, I called eh that when one is traveling you have another perspective of the world and sometimes, yes
oh traveling is very, very good
you think?
sure, at a cultural level, at an experience level, is very good
eh
yes you liked it. is the first time that you travel there or
no, no, no I travel a lot, a lot, sometimes I think that I travel too much, I tend
yes
that I tend to like to get out of my routine environment, and totally leave to another country or
yes and, for vacation or for work?

yes
so is kind of, the hours are not as rigid
um okay and you've gone to New York

ah yes um
I'm always traveling
sure, no my family lives here yes
and who else of the boyfriends or courtships

but at this age I eh, of the courtships
yes
I'm very conservative
Why?
in the sense in comparison with my brother that I was saying that he is always partying in parties
yes
I'm more the
you're more stable
very stable, very stable, I don't know if it's because of the age or something like that, but
yes, and when is the most?, what's the longest it's lasted?
courtship
with the same person,yes
ah, you know that honestly, a year is like my limit after, I had a boyfriend for like three years, I had a girlfriend like for three years but after the first year
yes, it's like already
we would break up, go back, it lasted like three years the
the courtship
the turbulence, for two years we were more less between this and this, and it wasn't stable
yes yes,
but it seemed to me that after a year, now I'm about to celebrate a year with, with
like, that you're getting to the limit,
to the limit, seriously, this is why I
seriously
yes
it's the limit, the limit, um
it's the limit is six years six years is quite a lot, married
yes six years, yes but not in a formal relationship
do you have kids?
yes, sure, but at six years, I'm not, I threw in the towel
aha yes, I, I travel, I go to another country
yes yes yes at six years
I travel more, I meet more people, but no, no, I love Ivan a lot, his name's Ivan
yes sure, well no, he seems like an interesting person
Hello?
Hello, good evening, my name is Carolina.
Good evening, my name is Marcela. I live in Carolina, North Carolina
Eh, you don't say. I live in New York.
Where are you from? Hello?
From Peru.
Ah, I'm Argentinian.
Look, how nice. From Buenos Aires?
Eh, yes.
Ah, how
But I've been living in the United States since I was nine.
Ah, and very from Buenos Aires.
So I'm more American than Argentinian, perhaps but the accent has never gone away
Yes, sure, yes, eh, My daughter worked with Argentinians and she has all of their accents.
Ah, yes, my son, both my sons are bilingual. And my oldest son, he was in New York because he went to -N-Y-U
And he worked in a restaurant, La Palapa
Um. Yes.
and, there everybody that worked in the kitchen was was from Mexico and then, for a while ah, he spoke Spanish with the little accent
Mexican, it was very amusing
But always the accent, it seems unreal, right?
yes, yes.  Yes, this also happened to me, if I go with someone from this site or the other site and, I talk with them for a little bit, after a while it sticks.
Are there many, ah, Latinos there?
Well, when we came in eighty seven no, but now yes, now there are many many, it's surprising
And where, and from what place?
And the majority are from Mexico
Oh, yeah, yeah.
yes.  The, the same story everywhere,
How nice.  Aha yeah, go-
Yes.
the topic
Well, we have to talk about dates and courtships, I don't know if I can have an opinion because I've been married for thirty years
Yeah, aha, ah, what
Ah, so no
Oh, sure, so you don't know, but you always hear, no?
Yes, yes
For example, he, I'm not partial to internet dating, because I have the idea of how the people I talk to
they say that, eh
Yes.
oh the internet, justifiably, through Fisher, I've meet people from various different places.
Hmm.
And they themselves have told me that when they go into their transformation, you can go into what you want, but it's really something else. Uh, a boy from Arizona told me that
he told me that, at least i know better, and he says, that the problem is they're liars and he tell me that when they say they are blonde or
you go and see it's a tall, small, skinny, fat blonde that work, but he says that all he has gotten so far
isn't worth it and after that i met another Dominican that also told me there was, through the internet, he told me you can get a lot of women
Because they want to date you and all that. But they're all, he tells me that they all tell lies, just, uh
Well, look, uh, i thought about that, and i just asked, uh, my son, uh, my oldest son, that is here for the party, i asked him, you
would you do, you, uh, would you go in one of those companies to find someone over the internet?, he told me no, never ever, and, uh because i
curious as i ame, the only thing that intrigues me, but that, and i would like to do it only for curiosity, right?, not to, not to go out
with anybody behind my husband's back, but just out of curiosity, that thing they do where people goes and
sits in a table with someone else?, for two or three or seven minutes, a, a very short time and then they ring a bell and you, you move to another table
And you talk to someone else for a very short period and then based on those, uh, short conversations
Yeah
uh, you write in a paper if you're interested, who are you interested in, and if the other person is also interested, then the company or
the group that, that, handles that, uh, connects you
Uh huh
But it's curious to me that in such a short time
Right?, you can
people can, and maybe yes, right?, maybe yes because it's on a more instinctive level, uh, and not so intellectualized, you see?, that
I look sometimes, right, because i say, i have a niece that told me, no, aunt, i meet them on the internet, i dated a guy
And i told her, uh, how can you do that?, it could be a sick person, a maniac or a
Oh, yes, you don't know who you find, because people can tell you anything
Yes, and well, sometimes i see it, yeah, a bit difficult, but after relationships... later on i think that long relationships also aren't, uh, without the internet, the ones that are long also
It's never anything... just yesterday i was talking to a lady that told me she was in a relationship for ten years and she broke up with her boyfriend because he came to the United States
she was also coming to the United States and she was with another one for ten years, and here she met one and married after ten months
And now she's been married for five years and she's happy, and i
Oh, look at that
and she was in a relationship for ten years with each one of them
Um
Unbelievable, right?, i mean, that life is like that, you never know
You never know, yeah, and no, uh, you always hear about people that lived together for a long time and later on they get married and they
and they don't, they don't last, it doesn't last
Exactly, yes
Something happens, and, me and my husband, we're the exception, i have heard a lot of people like that. We had been living together for ten years to, and to celebrate our tenth anniversary, we got married
Oh, look that's very nice
And, so, it's been twenty years from that, so we're at thirty years total
Uh
We don't count since it was legal, we count from the beginning
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
But, we're the exception
Yeah, of course, yes
of what, for what i have seen, right?, about people that have lived together for a long time, and then they get married and bam, everything falls apart
i, with someone, uh, i and other very conservative friends, and so i got married
Uh huh
marriage didn't work out and i didn't last five years married, but i had two children, but no, i have never married again
But incidentally, i got back to Peru and i found the boyfriend i had when i was young
Oh, look at that
He told me he had gotten married, and that he wasn't happy, he was separated, that he was about to get divorced, and he told me "i realize now it's because i always loved you"
Oh
And, uh
So romantic
It was like i was in, in a fairy tale, right?, but usually, he had a position as a military, he was very well established there but i had my life here
And i couldn't leave my children, that they practically were born here, and so, going there is
Sure, it's very complicated
Sure, right?, and life
It's different when you have children, because children come first
Also, and so i told him, he proposed to me, right?, to marry and rebuild our lives and everything, and i told him no, i couldn't, that my children were first
That i would never leave my children, so he told me "look, i take my hat of to you because not many women put their children ahead", and really
i dedicated myself to my two children completely and i live for them, well, i lived for them both, but my son just passed away, uh, six months ago, and I'm completely torn apart
but i dedicated my self to both of them, i have been, well mother and father to both of them, even though i never stop seeing them, right?
Uh huh
Mm, he wasn't a good husband but he was a good father and then
Mm.
eh, and like that,
I understand because I also have two kids and I eh, he works, my husband works, right? And, but the one who pushes, who knits, who drives, who
the one who does everything is me and thank God that they are both doing well. The oldest, he graduated from -N-Y-U he did it in three years.
Eh, he is, is, a modern dance dancer
Tremendous
and dances for a very famous group in that profession, that is called Pilobus
Aha.
and, he travels all over the world. And, that is
Oh.
that's too much for an artist because I'm also an actress and I direct and my husband is a musician, so as a family of artist, we know that
Oh
is hard making money and to live from what you do.
Mm.
You always need to have another job. And now the youngest is a guitar player, he plays
Okay.
plays classical guitar, jazz, well, everything, and he's going to go the university that's what I wanted, they can be artists if they want, but they have to go to the university
that's the only thing but
Tell me, mm
yes, it should be like that. And honestly yes eh, I hope and pray that they find good girls, right? When the moment comes.
Yes.
But
Yes, both of them are boys
Yes, they are both boys,
I had a, a boy and a girl.
Ah. Good, you always have the girl, because the boys always leave
Mm.
eh belong to the girl right? the boys belong to the mother more than the father. The girls belong to the father, but then when they grow up and get married, the boys go
with, to their wife's house
Ah, of the women yes.
You understand? However the girls bring their husband and their family to, to their house.
Sure.
And then, there there I lost a little
Well
but yes, I don't know what
I have six brothers and they all pull for their wives, none for the mother and when they were little, well sure, they were close to my mom
but married, everything for their wife.
Yes.
Everything for the wife, sure, is incredible.
Yes, that's how it is, so I try to cook special things, when they come to the parties things that like that they always say ah, that mom I want to go to mom's house so that
she can cook this or that. I have to have something to
Sure.
drag them to my house, but although they are are quite homebodies, but let's see what happens in the, in the future, they are still young.
Mm. Ah, sure, yes.
Yes, but well. I don't know, this of, of the internet and the dates, I never thought, being a person of my generation, I'm fifty years old, so, I lived in
in the seventies, when everything was accepted and I done, this
Hello?
Hello? yes, my name is Eliana, who is it?
Hello Eliana, this is Manuel. I am in Orlando, Florida, where are you?
Oh. Right now I am in Miami, Florida, but I am living in Boston
Oh, yes, and how are you?
Fine
Well, getting into matter, I listen, you start, what do you think about it?
Look, I really don't know, I don't know what are the regulation, eh mm, about women or anything like that. I arrived here in the United States only eleven months ago
And no, actually I didn't ask
yes. Eh, but no, no, haven't you heard antything? some friend talking about it?
No, act- no , no. I have no problem working here, I don't feel any discrimination. I don't feel any difference between men and women. Or anything like that, what do you think?
Well, I've been here longer. I have been here already eight years and the truth is that I think that in this country you really have some rights granted, unlike many others
Obviously
Oh, that's right, yes.
There are a lot of regulations for that purpose, I know it because I have seen it, let's say, in the media, or one
single complaint from a woman calling the police and they go immediately
yes
That's how it is. And there are many orders of separation after those calls, many, many of the orders come after
What? No, sorry
Eh, I think so. But, about emotional abuse, well, I don't agree there, and I think it is in both directions
although men have traditionally been allowed to do this, man has traditionally employed more of the force to abuse his partner, the woman in turn has
ah, ah emotionally abused, and verbally abused, that is very typical. So then when, when there are situations of emotional abuse, it seems that it isn't men or women, in general
I don't know what you think in that regard.
yes, it could be, but, but are there laws against emotional abuse towards women?
Eh, no, but here in the, intro-, in the introduction they spoke about this. Of the, that, the opinion of emotional abuse. That if you believe that women are sufficiently protected in this regard
But I don't know if there are, if there are specific laws that protect, or signal this, but if there aren't any, and if you believe them, it seems to me that you can't say just
men emotionally abusing women, it also happens in reverse
yes, it seems like that to me as well, that this is very exaggerated like to have it as law, or, or something like that. It seems to me that already, I don't know
if they can talk about abuse or not, right? it depends on the individual and couples. And there are even couples who like to be abused
the
to be verbally abused.
Oh, yes. The, the human psychology, humans, you know are complex. It is complex to the point that in many cultures, well, the matter of abuse is eh
things a man does against a woman they see like a symbol of manhood, no?
yes, exactly that very thing
And if, and if it's missing, then it puts in doubt like, something about the man's manhood. It's a very complex thing, but, but
the eh, the emo-
yes, at what would be the limit of, of whether this is abuse or, or is not abuse. It seems to me that this is when
here in this country it seems to me that it is barbaric that all of the laws regarding abuse and everything that you say, that it's true that a woman can call and right away there is
a policeman taking care of it and all of that, but on the other hand, you can go to the other extreme, right? It seems to me in some cases
yes, yes, yes, and suddenly if you have the opportunity to speak about it here with people, many men give you, they give, many are very afraid
Act in front of, lets say, uh, conflicting situations with your partner about it, because in the case of a call from the woman, it will always be the man's fault, and no matter how much he says it was something
mutual
yes
lets say, struggling or something like that, against, against the strongest... now look, there's another, there's another law that has been created and i think it's very good, yeah
it's that, uh, that happened against the immigrants, so, you know it's very common, well, for people to get hooked up here, get married
and specially with the, with getting the, uh, the regulation in mind, the papers, so there were, there were frequent cases of abuse
physical, emotional, blackmail from the partner against that immigrant, so, of course she was terrified to talk because she knew she would be deported
Of course
And the o-, the other partner would, uh, it abused her more by making her believe that, right?, well, there's a law that protects them, and
and the more police calls, lets say, if there's more, after that she can make the decision of separating and continue the legalization process on her own, without that partner
Oh
That law exists and it is, i think, yes, i think that's a very good one
Sure, yes, yes, yes. Yes, i think that here, as a women, i, i feel more protected. But yeah, i feel, i feel more protected regarding any of those problems, that's very good
But sometimes i feel that, uh, in this country, the regulations are going to the other side, and well, you never know, the thing is you never know where the limit is, it's like in
maybe in Latin American, there are none of those laws in our countries, and, and so there are much more people that hit and abuse their women
Yes
and here they go to the other side, in which you can't act, you can't say or do what you feel from fear of
going to jail, right?
Exactly, exactly, and, and, well, another, another very important factor is the children, when there are, and it's that, uh, those women always abused behind that
that costume, lets say, the one of, of the abuse well, from fear of losing their children or that something will happen to them, or well, them being taken away
I mean, that's also common here
Sure, also
When, when homes are very controversial the system, the state, decides to take them away
yes, it's true, isn't it? You loose for, sometimes you. It's true, it's very difficult, everything is very difficult
It is complicated, already
But
Its is complicated
yes
Eh, but I also think that, as is usually said, behind every abuser is a woman who lets him abuse her, right?
yes, also
That's, that's right. Once I saw in a X movie, a woman approaches and complains, ans she says, in brief,
I mean the person, I think it was a therapist. Eh, anyaway, look I've been fifteen years in a bad, into a relation where I was
eh, I have been abused for fifteen years, and I answer 'so? what is the problem? right? what is the problem?' I have been abused for fifteen years, 'yes, and, what is the problem?'
You'd better say that you have been fifteen years allowing him to abuse you
Sure
This is what often, they don't realize. Because at the very first hit, at the very first abuse you have to act, immediately. You can't allow that
Sure, just like that. The problem is that
So they often denounce that they have been abused for five years. Please!
yes, yes. But it is also true, that abuses do happen much more in Latin countries than, than, well I don't know, than in the other countries, right? because in, in
yes
the Arabic countries to say so
Oh, no way, no way
directly of course
It is cultural and terrible
It is still
and laws
It is completely accepted
yes, and laws, eh, that support men completely. Look, the movies that have made about the subject don't lie
Sure
about, about women who have married to, to men from these countries and suddenly decide to take the children and take them to their countries
And there is nothing the woman can do because that was the decision of the man, of the father
Absolutely, the true is that this is the reason, right? sometimes we are here arguing and so, about laws about this and that, but there  are countries that are
terribly much behind, rght?
Well I, no eh, it's incredible because of the way you have to dress. Not all of them. In many it is, because under many regime they can't even show their face
yes, that's incredible. And they can't vote, can they?
That is a full constraint, they can't talk to nobody in the street and even less to a stranger
Sure, and if they want to talk they may be kll- their husband can kill them
Just figure, it's like in industry, I used to live in New York. In New York at a time I was taking English lessons at a college
and when I got out, you know, about nine o'clock in the night you are starving and tired. Everybody was running to the lift. because it was in a fifth floor
and, well, we were going down in the lift, you know, all squashed because there were many of us and there was this girl, a Muslim girl and
Sure
always went do-, used the stairs. And you know why he did it?
Because ma-
And also, and it was a girl, a young and quite beautiful girl, she wore the attire. She only showed the hands and the face
all the rest in a black tunic and the hair covered. Because she couldn't be brushed by any man, and inside an elevator you can't help brushing each other, right?
Oh, yes, sure, so
figure, to the point that she couldn't use the elevator. Unless, she, she was alone, right? Alone in an empty elevator
yes, that's absolutely crazy, it's something that we, right? we just can't understand that kind of cultures, right? How
can they think this way?
And, and the most funny is that she told a friend, a friend of mine, yes, she told my friend she was happy like that
I mean, it is a barbarous question, but they are, they are grown up and educated for that
Sure, yes, right. How funny, right? and where are you from?
From Colombia
Oh, I see
You are Argentinean, aren't you?
yes
Oh, well, yes
With this imperative way of talking, right? and using the 'vos'?
No but, you know, the region where, where I come from we do use the 'vos'
Oh, really? I see
And well, in general, you try to speak as everyone else, but if we all use " vos"
Sure
"Vos"  and "usted", right
Sure, and it's hard for me to use that on the phone and they are trying to study the Hispanic language
And now that we are here, I speak, in my way, right?
yes, but really nice, You are all always conserving that and I think it's unique, it's really valid
yes, there is people noticing that
Well because, it's fair that inside those linguistic variations is where the beauty of our language is
Excuse me, what did you said?
Hello
Hi, Maria Inez speaking here
Hi Hi Alicia speaking.
Hi Alicia, Where are you from?
I am originally from Chile but ah, I'm living in
Where?
Atlanta, Georgia, in the South.

Ha, Ha Philadelphia, at the University
In yes, in Penn University
yes, where this study is, it seems no,
yes, yes, yes, I casually work at the university but well, nothing to do with the study, I work in the part of biology, nothing to do with it.
What ah, or, that's intersting, biology, wow
yes tell, tell me, and what do you think of today's topic?
that's terrible, eh,
Horrible no, I don't know apart I don't know anything about the laws of the United States, I don't know.
yes yes, sure.
So I don't have the slightest idea, I know it's terrible that there is violence and that well it must be everywhere, but
Of Sure, everywhere against women and, and for men too, am
um
In general, but, sure, the problem is that maybe, the terrible thing is that there's abuse within the marriages and that's the worst thing of all of it.
yes, the domestic violence, not inside the houses, well the State can't get involved in that and
That's what I was saying to some people, that domestic violence between lesbians is much worse than domestic violence among heterosexual couples, lets say
yes, it is.
yes, and sometimes, they make quite a drama and they hit and abuse each other and sometimes,
Oh that's terrible.
They even shoot each other, I was talking to a policeman here in Atlanta  that
yes
what's his name, that if it's a woman against a woman, that would be
Look, woman against woman, that's weird, I wouldn't have imagined really, I really wouldn't have imagine it was that way
Sure.
Look, that's terrible.
No.
And there are laws in Chile, there's something because in Argentina, I don't know the name of the subject, that's the truth.
I, I think so but for example, it's not really that useful neither it is in Chile, all my personal experiences and certain problems that I've had and the people I've met that has had those problems and it has never
it was never resolved, so.
It's like the police doesn't get involved in this things, no
Sure, they don't and let me tell you this, oh, it's even more dramatic to talk to the police that the violent event per se
yes
I mean, it really is, I mean, the cops, they have no empathy, they make you feel ashamed of what has happened to you and really, I mean, to me, the most traumatic thing was to have to talk to the cops, so
yes
yes so
Look
It woul have been better to forget about it
yes well but the problem is over
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is
Oh, no, well now you are alright
yes, sure, sure. In this aspect, here, to me, I don't know of nobody to whom something has happened here,
well, I knew a girl in Argentina, it was something strange, I mean when I met her the problem was already over, she had a boyfriend, but she was a girl
aha
very young, she was twenty-two or twenty-one, she was younger than me, and I was young by that time
oh, yes
And I remember that she was a very beautiful girl, from a regular family, they had money enough, everything normal.
Sure
I mean, she looked like a goddess, and she had a boyfriend who hit her
Oh, my
And he stayed for about one year with that boy. And he hit her, and then he regretted it, and then she cried and returned with him
oh, that's terrible
And while she explained it to me, I stared at her and told her, I can't believe it, because you can imagine it in a marriage
Sure, or from a stranger, someone you don't know, a , a rapist let's say,
Sure, yes, something like this, yes
But that someone wants, eh, how you call it? that someone wants to be with someone like this, that's the funny thing
A girl wit ha strong temper, she was not a girl of the submissive kind
True
With all the personality, and however, no, I mean I think nobody should be exposed to something like this, meeting a madman and
I don't know, or a madwoman in the case of lesbians I don't know
how incredible. Sure, that's true. But listen, it's strange that, I mean not even, it's strange that a girl like this one, with temper and so, let him hit her
yes, besides the girl could have had any boyfriend she wanted, because as I told you she was a precious girl, very beautiful
mm
Right? and she explained it to me, and I just stared at her and told her 'I just can't believe it'
wow, how incredible, that, that, maybe, maybe, often when people is abused by parents or things like this, they end up with this kind of people
yes, that's terrible also
Another interesting thing I have heard, I mean actually I've had some pretty funny friends in my life I guess, and I had a girlfriend who was into the so called sadomasochism
No
you, you know what I mean, right?
yes, yes, yes
Sure. Yes, she is into that lifestyle, and they go out to clubs and stuff and she told me
that she had met about, two women let's say, who were ah, who were, who had ended up with a husband, I don't know, an abuser husband, and now they were in rehabilitation
yes
But she got into that, how you call it? sadomasochism because in the sadomasochism sexual game they could get over and psychologically overcome of havinf been
Ah,
physically abused by men like that.
Like a shame, let's say.
Sure something like that, something, something very strange, yes.
wow
Like, sure, like playing a role like that
yes
sexual, but without real violence but violence, like an act I mean like a, a
yes like, yes it's like a limited violence, let's say.
sure all yes could, um fanatic of everything psychological.
Look
That had caused, so I found everything very interesting.
It's interesting I, that catches my attention a lot all that topic of sadomasochism, I can't, well if you are not in it you can't understand it.
yes Of course
Look that sometimes there are documentaries like that about those type of things and I watch them and say, but how, but well and yes, is for but good
Sure, yes is  true.
I think that if it's consensual by both parties, I wouldn't do it, but it's okay, I don't know.
It's true, Sure, sure, is
I mean it's worse when a person abuses another person without consent, no, I don't know
sure that you see all that world, of sadomasochism the most important thing is not causing actual harm, but all that's perceived as harm is like, is not real harm, I mean, it's all a question, but what happens is that I worked with this girl that,
he was in the lifestyle
yes
so then, and on top of that she was one of these types of, of people who talked all day about everything. So then I was already almost an expert, simply knowing this
hm, that
but it was like, interesting
Awesome, awesome. Listen, was this all here in the United States or over in Chile as well?
Pardon?
You knew these people here in the United States, or over in Chile?
Ah, yes, yes, here in the United States. In Chile, forget it, or they may exist, but they are inside the closet, you could say
Of course, yes, I believe they must be everywhere, but what happens is if you are not looking for them,
Of course
eh, or I mean, if you know someone who is in the lifestyle
mm.
it's like, you don't, you don't get to, but they must be everywhere, I would imagine, they have to be.
Of course, for example, two years ago I was in Concepcion, which is a very small city in Chile, the south of Chile
yes, yes, yes,
of course, you find yourself, but it's very surprising the number of, of, punks and of, of, goth people. And homosexuals living in Concepcion, in other words there is a complete alternative world, it's like, it's unbelievable, it's like the society
Look
eh, in this city it's super open, it's like, very interesting and I would have never imagined it
Look, it's very interesting, it's very interesting, very interesting and I, I saw on television there was a program over in Argentina where they did, like, investigations on this type of, that is, about these groups inside the cities with different customs, and they also did one about the goths
Sure
And they were people, well that was in Buenos Aires, but I guess it must be the same in every city and it was really a huge group of people who have a
Sure
I mean, like their own life style, they live at night and dress in black, Gothic I think
Sure, sure, and they go to clubs and listen to that 'da, da, ,da' music, I don't know
Yes, I would be a little scared to enter one of those, and well, I guess they are inoffensive, if you don't meddle they won't do anything to you
Sure
but their aspect is a little scary, it scares me
yes, I've started to hear about people who go to the, what you call it? the dentist, to put on fangs, with surgery
To look like real vampires
No
I swear, I swear
that's terrific, figure
Incredible
And there are also the vampire clubs, I don't know what they actually do there and what are their habits but I know they exist
Sure, sure, they swear they are vampires
human mind is really extraordinary
yes that's right, if it gets bored it invents whatever
just like that
and in Buen- in Argentina, where did you live in Argentina?
I used to live in Mar del Plata
Mar del Plata, I see, you are the second one, I met some people from Mar del Plata via Internet, we talked to them that way
Look, look, it's a small city, we know each other, OK it's big but we still know each other quite a lot, it's like a big town
I mean, I don't think that you know some Martin who works in a 'call centre', I mean I doubt it, but
No, well, I know several guys named Martin, but I don't know
Oh, sure, I guess so. It's just that, I can't recall his surname, but he did work in a 'call centre', yes. And I used to talk to him, but then he became idiot and we didn't talk any more
See, just like usually happens with the Internet
Sure, yes it's true, it's funny
everything starts fine, but then they start acting silly
yes sure, and you are an idiot and so, I don't know
I am from Mar del Plata, Mar del Plata is nice, so, where were you from? Chile?
yes, they sent me pictures, it's very nice I liked it a lot
It is nice already, yes, did you notice that the America's Summit was in Mar del Plata? I wonder if you heard
it arrived at three, right
Bush was there
I had no idea
yes, yes, yes it was in Mar del Plata
Wow
About one month ago, in November
wow, wow
yes, yes I went to Mar del Plata little time before, for a visit and well, they were preparing the whole city because all the presidents of America were going there, I guess you president must have been there also
oh, sure
yes, yes, yes
oh, sure, sure
he was, all of them were, they meet every I don't know how many years, all the presidents of America meet to talk about their
Sure, to promote the American imperialism
things, of course. Well, and they were all aginst Bush and so
Oh, I can imagine.
it was quite interesting seeing it
Listen, I think if I had been you, I would have regretted not being there, it would have been funny
yes, I was there just before that, but I came back two days before all the presidents arrived, precisely
ah, I see, so you saw the preparations somehow
I saw, yes of course, I saw how they were putting the safety fences, my parents lived right there, two blocks away from where Bush was to stay
so they were given, they had to give them two credentials in order to get in and out of their house, because otherwise they couldn't
oh, wow, no, that's ridiculous
And nobody could visit them without a credential, it was quite a matter
that's ridiculous
if they had to walk the dog, they needed the cerdential because they could be stopped at any moment to check if they were, I don't know, terrorists or whatever
Sure, yes, sure, today
Funny
The same, ridiculous, but also interesting, I've never being in something like that

Eh, in reality I live in Philadelphia, but now I'm in,
Ah, me too.

yes.
Eh, but I'm calling you from San Francisco, because my, my brother lives here. so, I came here
Ah, for vacations.
to visit him, yes. For two, three weeks.
Aha. And how is it over there? I have some friends, now, that went over there.
yes. To San Francisco?
yes, is it good?
It's raining, raining every day.
Is it nice? Don't tell me. Pitty my friends, they wen- on vacation, and it's raining.
yes. yes. It's all grey. But it isn't, it's cold in Philladelphia, right?
yes, but not that much. Er, winter is coming super quiet, it's coming very mild.
ah, that's lucky.
yes, yes, yes. Not so much, there's no snow at all. It's good.
a-ha.
It's really good. So, well, I don't know about that subject, which, which is scheduled for today, in fact I know nothing.
Neither do I, I was about to tell you the same, that this is the second time I get this subject, and
It's really bad.
no, no, I've not much to say either. What I said last time, is that I think there's a lot of abuse, when it comes to women,
erm, it is often psychological abuse, it isn't always physical.
Oh really?
yes, I feel sometimes, er, women can find themselves like trapped in a relationship or something like that, and it is due to being afraid of leaving the relationship that they stay and
accepts many things that, most probably, shouldn't.
Sure, sure, sure.
But, as for the physical thing, because the questions they asked are, erm, in regards to the, the American government,
mmh, yes, yes.
and the law, I think it is quite good, as far as I know. I don't know anyone who found themselves in a situation,
mm
yes, have being hit, or, sure
yes
Sure, sure, sure, so, well, I really can make an statement in the subject, because I've never met someone in that problem
And well, I really don't have idea, so, I can make an statement in that subject
So do I
So, let's keep talking about San Francisco, tell me, is it nice there?
Oh, yes, is really nice, I love this city, yes
yes, I see
My brother has lived here a few years. So, I often come here to visit him, and we get along, we are 10 years appart
yes, 10 years
10 years, I see
I'm 26 years, he is 36 years old
Oh, well, that's nice
So, he takes me out for dinner, because this city is pretty expensive
Oh, more expensive?, More expensive than Philadelphia, yes
yes, than Philadelphia yes,
I see
But, there are many places for eating, and really good
More Beautiful
Em, places to get to know, and this.
Aha, good, great.  There there's a really big gay neighborhood, No?
yes, there, but, Philadelphia,
They told me, I didn't have any idea, they told me that one of the neighborhoods
yes, there's one, a street that's called Castro.
Ah.  Aha.
And, over these streets and this zone, it would be like the gayborhood of Philadelphia.
Aha.
But, sometimes I think that Philadelphia has a, a bigger community than San Francisco
Ah, yes?
that, yes sometimes I think so.  Here, the attitude that, that everyone is really liberal and all of society is liberal.
And there's a very big and stable community of, of homosexuals, eh, men and women but, but it's not as, eh, I don't know, I think, em,
sometimes in Philadelphia, I think that they're more militant, more or less,
Ah, aha.
that, they have their zone, and this zone is really closed, really well defined, yeah.  Here it's more open, everyone is pretty open, eh, they experience a lot, or
like a more general liberal attitude, yes
ah, how nice.  This is good.
yes, yes, yes.
This is really great, look at that.  Well, now we have to go meet
yes.  And,
some day, to San Francisco
How long have you been living in Philadelphia?
No, just one year
One year. Oh, so little
this is my first year, and you?
Five years
Oh yes, and have you returned to Paraguay?
yes, yes. My dad lives in Paraguay, in Asuncion, and I often visit him
Mhm
I go there every year. Only on holidays, but this time I came here to San Francisco, to visit my brother.
Sure
I am, I am like the ambassador of my family, I go from one country to another, visiting my relatives, or my
Oh, that is who you miss the most
yes
Eh?
Well, eh, I don't know, my mom lives in Philadelphia
Sure, yes, yes. Oh, really? Ah
And I know she misses it. But, I think she has more limitations at her job, and
Ah. You have more freedom to handle it,
yes, more, yes
The times, that's nice, that's nice, we went to Argentina, last month, I think that last month and well, visiting
To friends, relatives, eating meat
Oh, nice
that you really miss here, right?
Now, I'm about to go to a restaurant where they cook the cheese steak here in Philadelphia
yes
Authentic, because they used the bread from Philadelphia
Oh really?
Do you know it?
yes, I know it, yes, yes
And well, they use that bread and they cook in the same way, let's see, like in Philadelphia and all that, but here
Why?
because it's
Don't you like it
really greasy, it's really heavy, really heavy
That's really heavy, really heavy
And I like meat, but is not that nice, either, is half baked meat
Did you see, I was hoping other thing, I will keep trying and each house, until I find the best
yes
But, so far no
Regarding the meat, i found the Mixto [or 'Mixed'] restaurant, or, that's very tasty
Oh, yes, in Phil, here. Uh, they told me about a restaurant, i  once walked outside it's door
Yes, they have a dish on the menu, that's the Argentinian roast, but i don't think they use argentinian meat
Well, but it's good, it's good, well, i think it's tasty. Oh, well
Yeah, i thought sou, with chimichurri. A little salty, yes
Oh, very good, oh, I'll stop by, yeah, they told me something about, about that restaurant, like that, about Latin American foods, and that, that it was very, very tasty, that it was good
yeah, it's very tasty
Well, so, well
And, are you married?
Yes, I'm married
Right
Yes, yes, and my wife is expecting a baby here
Oh, that, that's nice, huh, congratulations
Well, thank you.
Yes
Are you married or not?
No, no
Uh huh
No, no, i have a boyfriend that
Well
that no, I can't say that, that there's no complaint of abuse of any kind.  But, a year ago, we were celebrating.  And he's American, eh, of descent
Russian descent
Ah.
B-but he's, he's American.
yes.  Look.
yes.  He's tall
How strange.  No?
yes.  It's interesting.
Interesting, yes.
yes, different.
And, good.  How's the relationship going, well?
All goo, all good.  I think that yes, he's ten years older than I am too, like my brother.  And,
Hmm.
so, he has a ten year old daughter, and sometimes I think that we're at different parts of our, so, in different places in life, or something like that,
Oh.
but aside, eh, aside from all this, everything's good.
Everything's good.
I think so, I think so.
And how did you get along eh, with the daughter?
Eh, I met her once.
Oh, no, he lives here with him
Once, no, no, he's like, with, with the
Oh
no, with the daughter's mom, he doesn't, he doesn't have a good relationship with ther
Uh um, Oh
So, actually, it has, it has been hard for him to have like stable meetings, or scheduled, with the daughter
Oh, poor, po-, that's wrong
Do you have another daughter or?
What?
uh,do you have another son or is that the first son you're expecting?
it's the only one, that i know
I see, yes
So, no, this is going to be the first
The first, oh, yeah, and do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
No, we don't know anything, no, no, no, no, no, i think that's going to be a
the, a surprise
Yes, um, y that's going to be a surprise, like
Right
like the old times
And is your wife Argentinian too?
yes, Argentinian, also.
Ah, okay.
yes, yes, yes. So, he's working here in, in, in Penn. So, yes.
Ah, really?
Eh, well, and here we are. The baby arrived by surprise, but well.
Ah, yes. Arrived by surprise.
Will be welcomed.
Came mm, sure.
So, well. And, I hope he brings a, a bread under his little arm, as we say. That he comes with, with, with fortune.
What does that mean? With good luck, with fortune, with good luck.
And, good luck, and all those things, it means, that he comes with a bread under the arm.
Aha. Supposedly, well, in, in, Mexico, they also say, that the child or a newborn brings a lot of luck, that, that everything will change after the child comes, that work will improve and,
and all.
Really?
yes.
Ah, ah, you haven't mentioned anything. And not in Paraguay?
I don't know, don't know if there are any sayings that I know.
No. Aha. Aha. And how are things there in Paraguay? Is it nice? I don't know anything about Paraguay, I have no idea.
And, it's good.
I have no idea how it is.
Uh, the economy is always kind of unstable
Yes
And so, i think, i think there is a lot of trouble and that, because, because of the lack of money and that, there's a lot of poverty
Oh, sure
and now it's starting, the last time i went, i think it was more dangerous
Oh
the, the capitol was very dangerous
Oh
Th people don't go out at, at night, or if they do, it has to be with
A lot of poverty, sure, sure, you have to be very careful
Yes
Oh
Before, it wasn't like that before, when i lived there, i could go out anytime, and it wasn't, it wasn't dangerous at, to the point that
that they, right?, they're going to ki-
Of not going straight from, right
yes, they're going to be there with, with a gun or something like that. That didn't, you never heard of that, but now, another thing that's new too is kidnapping, something that was never heard of in Paraguay, the kidnapping of
Oh, we had that in Argentina
Is there a lot of that in Argentina?
No, it's calmed down now, it's calmed down, but, did you saw that, for a while in Argentina, the dollar was one on one?
Right
It was one dollar per peso, well.  And after there was an economic disaster, and
Good evening, my name is Marco
Yeah, good evening, i am Gloria from here, from California
Hi Gloria, uh, i am in Philadelphia
Oh, nice to meet you
oh, nice to meet you, uh, lets see, the subject, i didn't exactly understand what it was talking about, uh,
against the violence, lets say, well, against one, as a woman
Yes, yes, but, uh, you were asking about the opinion of, something, he said something about the law
i mean, the laws that protect, lets say, when you as a woman are being assaulted, lets say at home
Yes
and, uh, when there's domestic violence
Yes
So, well, here in California there are laws, yeah, there laws that help a lot with that, because when you're a woman, you're assaulted both physically and verbally, or psychologically
Yeah, with
uh, there's a lot of help here from the government, lets say, uh, for us women, when there's domestic violence at home, right?
yes, i know very well, my mother is a doctor, i know, i grew up i Paraguay, and she worked in the Health Ministry, in the office, the Secretariat for the Women
uh, she represented Paraguay in the United Nations and always, uh, very, she was very involved in programs to help, particularly that, in Paraguay and the whole world
Um, the hardest part is that any of this is very emotional, so, and with everything that has to do, whether it's emotional or
among the family, or married people, or there is another category, where it is, it's self-justified in some way
uh huh
um, no, no, i don't, i don't know, yeah, i think it's hard when uh, a person doesn't want help or give their opinion about other families and some people
ehh for example when I, where, when I grew up my dad used a belt
hmm
when we were bad, when we did something we shouldn't do, he punished us this way
hmm
and openly and this was normal and it was they way things were done
hmm
ehh, today for example, my, I have a five year old creature and more than when he was smaller, I hit him a little bit on his backside with my hand
oh, oh, a bit on his tail sometimes
hmm
ehh, no more than this, and once he could communicate, once he could talk with us, we didn't punish him physically since he's been three, not including before
ahh yes true it's up, but for example a person who's only used to this can think it's the way that they punished me as a creature
hmm
and they can believe that something barbarous and terrible but no, it was my dad who wasn't a bad man, it's just the way that he did it
hmm
and in some places they do things differently eh and when it has to do, when you have to accuse the other, eh, the woman always enters into a difficult position
hmm
em
in my opinion I think well, I don't know, if it's sometimes masochistic or I don't know, but sometimes verbal aggression hurts more
that the
no this is the wa- this is just the problem, it's more mental
aha, that is something that you don´t forget when you are a grown up woman
eh the body is not, no, not only that but that she gets hurt and that changes her way of seeing things, the way she feel things em
hmm
is not is is worse, is a lot worse eh that that is, definitively I know that my my mother she is here in the United States and my father is still in Paraguay
eh they are separated since, they talk well and because of that there was never a physical abuse problem eh she says that it was more mental
eh that was the way and that was in Paraguay being there the things are different, she is used to the way things are here
hmm
it was not I don´t know, she did not justified herself
hmm
and
I know many women too who are being physically abused and don´t, don´t notify it to any
no
lets say to someone who could support them or to the law because sometimes there is the immigration situation and they are afraid of being deported and all that stuff
yes
and then that leads to continue being attacked and sometimes they even are killed, right?
many times, many times even when you ask them directly if she was hurt without him hearing she does not want to get him into trouble eh, she does not want to
she doesn´t want to or maybe think that she is going to be punished by him if she tells that
hmm
and then when he know it or something of that she eh cannot accuse him and without that accusation
hmm
nobody can do anything, nor the police, the family, nobody can do anything
there in my country, where I come from, they say they can't, I don't know about laws but they say they can't intervene because that are couple affairs, right?
yes
so that's the reason for the suicides and so, and in a home, when there is domestic violence, children have it in mind
right
if my parents were like this, I will be the same
exactly, exactly
aha, my dad hit my mom, so I will do the same when I grow up, or even have a worse behaviour
it is not ne-, not necessarily, ah, sometimes after seeing that, eh, they do exactly the opposite, eh, they hate swimming in a swimmers family,
a son of doctors who can't, eh, stand seeing blood, and can't, eh, and hates hospitals, eh, not always will he follow the parents
right, there are cases, I have known such cases
it's more like
I lived with a person who, who since his parents hit him he wanted to do the same
yes, that is, that is nor very possible
so, he thinks my mom was hit because she surely liked it, so all women should be the same
it is possible, eh, because it depends on who you are with, if you are with people who don't think that way when you are not home
the people in school, the people wherever you go, the way these people think, eh, his behaviour will reflect that
his thoughts will reflect that also
mhm
but it is hard
the thing is that right now I think that I am not in those domestic violence cases but in my opinion is that now there are more and women are heard more
yes
there are women associations here
no no no and that is the, in in general the women have the same rights than men if for some reason is not like that
she is not receiving or is not having all the rights of a man she should simply raise her hand and tell it and that is going to be fixed
hmm
but the thing is that many time they don´t do it
because of fear or I don´t know
eh of eh because of fear,for any reason, there is help, is not that, is not that there is not
eh she can or not eh it can´t and after that if she didn´t say something is because something is happening to her Is she going to say that it was her fault?
hmm
eh because she didn´t say nothing, ah, are you going to blame her? if she killed, it is it is difficult, then it is not defined, it is eh complicated
yes but the thing is that we are still living in the past  century lets say it so hits and all that stuff are still a custom  and
when, while there are persons that because you love them or who is going to financially support me if he goes to jail maybe that is in their minds I suppose
because of that they don´t report them, right? or don´t ask for help and that becomes a routine that thing of being beaten I met a lady that when her husband didn´t beat her she didn´t
felt happy and she cried and cried all the day because she was used to be beaten
yes
and then eh I think that it becomes a routine is like a hobby
yes everything has to do with it everything has to do with what you are used to
aha
oh, and it's
I believe that violence and all of that it's becoming more common in places as Latin America because where I come from
most of the men had at least once gotten drunk and they become aggressive and
no, no, for example
and even if they are not like that, they do it when they are drunk
for example, they use it to punish their children, oh, yes, one, for example, they use their belts to hit their children, oh, they have boundaries too, it's not like
they do it to hurt the child but to make them feel some pain so that they don't behave in a wrong way, I mean, you hit them once or twice but
to do it again, you are causing some damage
my name's Ramon from Los Angeles
ehh I'm Rafael from Vancouver, Canada
ah very good okay, yes, nice to meet you ahhh
yes nice to meet you
this is a very interesting call for me
hmm
because it's the first time I've had a conversation with a person, after the what do I know, twenty five calls, ahh no, now I'm close to a restaurant
because this call needs to be, ehh, out of the, my house telephone
correct
ah this yes I'm really happy now that you've connected with me
ehh from where, like you live in Los Angeles
I'm from, I live in Los Angeles, I live here
but where did you come from?  What city, what country do you come from?
from Los Angeles, I'm Chicano
ahh, you were born, you're Chicano
yeah yes yes I was born here in Los Angeles, and you?
you were born in Los Ageles ahh good, I"m from, ehh, I've lived here in Canada for fifteen years, I come from Argentina
oh from Argentina, very good, ah only the topic is domestic violence
hmm
and here ironically I work in, and I'm a mediator and I work in the superior course of the county of Los Angeles and sometimes I'm a mediator
In problems of violence against women?
of cases of cases of domestic violence ah
ah you you eh have participation as a mediator
ah I am the mediator, I am a neutral
hmm
and and try I try to build consensus between parties ah in in instead of a judge´s decision and the person could receive a
a restriction order ah temporal
aha like
so ah
and there are many and there are many cases of violence I, so I imagine that
ah after the mind yes ah that is a as I work here in this area about three or four months and the papers of the
The United States in this area is very very bad ah in relationship with my part of the situation of how domestic violence is that the people that want to
ah the most are men but there are some ah there are some women is the same but it is like the with the person wants to call the other person, one person wants to call the person and
and the other person does not want it anymore and wants eh like to
aha
and a spy while
hmm
ah social things and like a million of people here in this country do this ah
hmm
eh that behavior
hmm
yes this is really bad here in the United States ahh and
but very, let's say the proportion is growing or is shrinking
ahh I think that it's a level that isn't growing but it's like, this statistic is ten years old, I think that there isn't
there aren't statistics this year but typically they think that a million people are like, ahh, bothering a person
hmm
here so, you know, it's part of the problem of society and since half of the marriages here in this country ahh
end in divorce
half end in divorce
yes yes, half of the marriages have a divorce
but, but speaking in general or in some communities?
in general in the United States
but the Latino community is the same, or, greater or less
I, ehh, I don't know, I'm sure that this statistic but generally it's ahh
seventy per cent
yes fifty percent and
aha
and what's the situation in Canada on this topic
well I, I'm not very, eh, up to date on the numbers
aha
but I think it must be around there
oh yes oh
yes yes more or less, could be a little less but not much less, no, there is not
aha
there is not such a big difference between one place and the other about this aspect
aha
because maybe in some other aspects we could talk about there may be a difference, but in this aspect, as far as I know, no
ehh I am about forty percent, he is dealing fifty percent
oh
in that aspect there is a si-, there is a similarity, I mean a similarity with, with what we are here
talking about probability
aha
that, that is afterwards, I don't know, we should also see another thing, about what happens if inside that fifty percent
aha
how much ehhh violence does the divorce provoke, understand?
yes yes yes
I don't know, I don't handle those numbers because it is a thing that, well, is eh eh eh,I have never had violence problems
eh on one side in the personal
yes
but I'm not sure, because I would notice, well you must notice
but, you can compare Argentina and Canada and the laws, are almost the same, right?
well
to protect the women
no, no, no, no, here in Canada there is a lot more protection for women
yes, in
a lot more, I don't know if at this time the United States laws are the same, but here
yes
I mean, here man is guilty until proving the opposite
yes
I don't know how is in the United States
well, here in California is like, well, if there is a suspect and the man is acting as one, well
violent action, the police investigates, but there is a lot more legislation for women, and that's fine for me but
yes, also here in this state, if someone, you know, like a violent case, they must go to
a class of anger management
yes
for a whole year each week
each week
each week they must assist to those lessons
and they have to make, let's say, a reeducation
yes, reeducation to
And I would not say reeducate, of reeducating
or teaching, any, that
But, a curiosity, a question I've being wondering, excuse me, a curiosity, the current time percentage you were born in Los Angeles, isn't it true?
yes, yes
And were your grandparents from Los Angeles or did they also emigrated
they are immigrants, my grandparents after Mexican revolution they came to Los Angeles
And well, so, they are many generations
yes, yes, yes
And you are talking about, what revolution?
In Mexico, Mexico
in 1910
and well that's near to 1917
and yes 17, oh no
yes, 17
because
it's near Russian revolution
near the Russian revolution there was the Mexican revolution, I was confused because I had some Mexican friends and well
yes
And well, we sometimes chat and well, that would be a commentary, more like curios, because like they didn't had the chance
So far to talk about a person born from the grandparents
oh
eh that they were already living in California, usually
yes
it was people of the first generation or who had been living fro few years, whether in those southern states
or, yes, yes, in that county, in that county of Los Angeles, a very strange one compared to the country because
in a sense, because
like fifty percent of people here were born in another country
oh, fifty percent were born in another country, aha aha, and
yes, yes, yes, and in some other places like New York City, Miami, and maybe Chicago, ahh, and maybe one or two more
big cities, it is similar but it is, it is, like
oh
compared to the other big cities in the country, the percentage is very big
very big, now, one question, do you live in the very city of Los Angeles?
yes, yes
now, violence there is bigger, it is bigger usually than in other smaller cities. How is the environment there?
specifically in Los Angeles or in the county
I mean compared to the very city
aha
compared to a county that belongs to the big Los Angeles, right?
yes, yes, well, here it is like, mm, like two or three centuries back, the information in the news is that crime is decreasing in Los Angeles
ah the crime is decreasing, aha
yes it's decreasing I can't say ah specifically the statistics but ah the police in this city of Los Angeles was saying that crime is at
is more less than like two three years ago, so is better here
ah now ah is better, a question a question that at this moment comes to mind but I read two days ago an article
that is about the problem there is with the immigration there from Mexico, what do you think of the wall they want to erect between the border of the United States
Hi. Lurdes from New York.
Rodrigo from New York.
yes hi Rodrigo. Have you ever been in a jury?
No, never. And you?
Never? yes, yes, I was one time eh, they called me for service but they didn't pick me eh and the other time they called me for a civil case
and I was serving like ten days for a dispute of eh a renter with the owner of the building where he was living.
Ah, I was never so but I think that sometimes that is too much
eh eh I understand you perfectly because the truth is that the time that we spent waiting to be picked was more than the time we had to serve, right?
But what happened is that you wanted to participate?
No what happens is that if you don't participate, they arrest you. Because by law you have to serve.
yes that is true.
It's not an option, no?
Uh uh, whether you want to or not.
I I think that it's important, the problem is that the system well is not one that is like so to speak very eh
Democratic?
no no no that the whole system of picking the jurors is so and so slow.
yes.
And takes up so much time that then well of course anyone loses interest in serving, right?
Just the fact that I tell you that you have to have to go to jury duty is a waste of time.
Exactly. Exactly.
But well what you're talking about doing
And if the system were a bit more, faster, no, that the that the that the selection was a process that were less tedious, I think it'd be a lot easier for people
to participate, right?
I don't know, and yea.
I think the other thing would be for example the civil case that I had I mean the end at the end of the jury
I gave the same amount of money to both parts. And yea they cancelled the lawsuit and the counter-lawsuit, right?
what's the problem, what were they fighting about, what was the dispute
Because well apparently the the the person who was renting the apartment
Yea
uh, was, wasn't happy with the apartment's conditions. Because on the first floor there was a pizzeria
Mm.
and uh the the way that it was built the apartment well it had concrete floors and that meant that in the winter the apartment was really cold and in
summer it was really hot and but the way that they argued both sides
Uh huh.
to the jury it seemed like the lawsuit was frivolous, you know?
Right, but the good thing is that he won
And so
both sides won, both sides came to an agreement.
yes but both sides won but both sides lost because they both had to pay but the amount of money that it was it was the same so
at the end it all cancelled itself out, it ended up as zero. And that was like the way for the jury to say that your case didn't have any merit.
Shut up and go to your homes. That was like for years ago, and then last year they called me but they didn't pick me to participate. And, and the thing is that
many of the civil lawsuits that happen in this country are very very frivolous that, what they do is waste your time
Waste time
time. Time that costs money to sustain in the judicial system, well, for some of these cases that have no actual merit,
it's, uh, it's a shame, right?
Sure, lets see, sure
Because then the, the cases that are worth it and the frivolous cases get mixed up and you can't
The ones that really need the
well
justice, they can't get it in time. And the other things you said, like they are meaningless, they're just there taking space
Right
I don't, like i told you, i have never been called and i hope they never call me either. I don't
really
i wouldn't like to take part in that, right, because i don't have time to lose and this is very, that's all very... right?, so i wish i don't have to take part in it
Sure, sure
like you say, if you get called
or
You have to go
Look, with, there was a girl serving with me in the juries, that they sent the Marshall, the police, to find her at home
Uh huh
Because it was the third time that they had called to participate, to serve on the jury and didn't want to serve. So
The first time and the third time you go to jail.
the third's time the charm, exactly. But look, you already know that tomorrow it will arrive by mail
yes.
your first your first eh, order of if you go to a jury because whomever doesn't like the case be careful what you wish for.
Don't say this.
Eh.
What?
But look I think that again if the system was if they would fix the system so it wouldn't be eh so it would be a little more
I think it makes sense because at the end the jurors, the ones that trying to guarantee that there are people like us, right?
That are the ones evaluating the cases, that there's interest created of seeing what touches one to the other, do you understand me?
Of course it's true.
he doesn't want what, baby. Sh
Is it your kid?
yes.
Uh uh. Is it a boy or no?
it's a boy yes.
Ah.
He's nine months old.
Ah, little. I'm talking on the cellular because I'm in the train.
Oh, really?, from the street
yes, yes
Oh, okay
I hope that is not cut also
That if not, if they don't realize
I don't remember, are those 12 minutes?
There are 12 minutes, yes
Yes, we're missing like 5
Diego my love, please don't cry, this, what happen so many times with juries is that there is something that
I mean, sometimes, in the example, there are technical things of science, for example, not everyone understands
No
And then, for example at the OJ Simpson trial, there was evidence against him, scientific evidence of DNA and all that
it was conclusive, and that man was guilty
yes
bit, because of the people that were in the jury where people that not necessarily knew the science of what was being explained
and then, anything they said, that evidence wasn't valid, because the DNA is something that
is 100% different for each person, I mean, some Technic that you might not understand, and they make the result to be
not necessarily good and the people in a jury, are persons that are not researchers and not necessarily have
a well, a background in science,  and anyway, I don't know if the thing is know clearer, it won't because, well
No, that's true, Hello?
Pardon? Oh, look, the call
yes
Hello?
I will stick here to talk right my first call, this is my very first one
Oh, ok, ok, oh, is this your first call?
yes, and yours?
Oh, I've already made ten or eleven
really?
Yes, he is very
So
because you get to know a lot of people, and sometimes you may get the same person so you can somehow continue the converstaions. Uh uh, are you still there?
I hope it doesn't cut off
Oh, ok, the, hello?, hello Roberto? Hello? baby say hello
Hello
Hi, good afternoon, this is Micky
Hello, good afternoo, Micky. My name is Juan
Hello Juan
Hoe are you?
very well, and you?
Fine too, I'm in San Antonio, Texas. Where are you?
oh, I have never, in this I have never talked to someone in Texas, I am in Florida
oh, see, we are not that far awy
yes, not so far away
no, aha
no, and what do you think about the subject for today? justice and all that?
yes I have a question, in this case, the system of Justice based in
yes
Does this jury system exist outside the United States? This is my question, do you know it?
I think so
I think it exists in some
I know, I know that in my country
aha
I don't know what country you come from
From Mexico
ah, no, I don't know the laws in Mexico, I'm a lawyer and I know that
aha
it exists in, I'm Dominican
aha
and
And so there you have it
yes
ah, there there are juries, a OK so
yes
so you can make a comparison between how well it functions in your country if it functions
yes, yes it's the same, a bit the same, an but they've never called me, only on time and for me it's something I take seriously, since I'm the first
citizen in my family and well, and as a lawyer I think that it's something important, each person, it's like a civil duty to help the system even if, sure, I think that
in my country and here in the United States the justice system is never perfect
aha
and but it's my part to contribute a little bit, no.
yes
but, I, I know that they asked me I went and they quickly told me that they didn't need me because many times, they don't want lawyers on juries
aha
and I would happily like to help but no
that was, that was in your country or here
that was no here
ah listen
here in the United States
but you think well I think it's a system that works in a very ideal way, very adequate for some matters, but the question is If
given that system, does it work the same way in Dominican Republican than here?
yes,
Is it just as efficient and effective?
yes same as over there, or same as here the system works this way, I mean that they get a jury, each defendant deserves or has the right to a jury
for any crime in that, well although it can be in that the, well a serious crime of kind of serious the conviction can be more than a year
before that's if it's a crime very
aha
small or I mean if a youth steals a candy from a store or something like that, or something that it's worth more than five hundred dollars that type of crime no he goes to jail but
he goes for a few months, and no that youth wouldn't have
aha, no
if for, but for others even hitting someone in a party, they have the right because sometimes hitting someone if that person gets sick
in the mind eh they deserve a jury, and it depends no because in my country and here
aha
normally is a jury of twelve, of twelve people and they try to get someone of well people from different environments  so that they don't have their own prejudice
but that's where the problem is, no because is for example if it's let's say if it's a case in extreme cases let's say if a case like
Yes, a girl was raped
yes
most of the people will feel really angry against the defendant and even though
yes
it's possible he's innocent, and that's why there's a process here and there in the United States, but it's very hard
Yes
Even in the, what makes the system imperfect is that many times everybody finds about what goes in the newspaper
Yes
and we use, we use the internet a lot, and always, and that's why, because of the technology we are more aware of what's happening
Right
and the system here is made not to include, if there is something in that same example, if a girl was raped and it was on the news
in all the country, in television, in the radio, in the web, it's very hard to find someone that didn't, in the law they say that it wasn't stained
Right
for all that and they go
if you already have a previous opinion on that
sure, sure, that's very hard, because they try
right, that
what's in that example, they move the case, let's say, if this case is in Texas, they say "no, too many people is involved, angry"
"there have been protests and we'll move this to California, but even there, they know about it, it's hard nowadays right?
yes
But I'm talking too much, what do you think?
right, well, it's that you know more about it, that's why i started with a question
Right
right?, because i thought that, i think that in many cases the system itself doesn't work if it's not supported on a cultural matter of the population
And, like you said
Yes
if a population is easily vulnerable
Yes
to the influence of the media, well, the system itself suddenly can't be very closed because of the media influence, right?
Yes, yes
So, that's part of the, of the precaution that must exist, right?, so the first thing i thought is that if the system really works, the system itself
yes
right, that for what it's worth, it's a democratic system, of democratic representation of the justice, but it has its logic, but it's, it can be one of the
yes
of the limits, right?, that it can have
Sure, sure, in many cases, yes
in the century, but at the same time, like you said, there is no perfect system and sometimes the authoritarian one deciding judge system like
the way he "salomonically" thinks
Yes
Well, like in the case of Mexico, it's very prone to corruption
Yes, yes
No
sure, sure
because in Mexico's case, there is great corruption in the justice systems,
Sure
so, the judges always tend to, in very, in very important cases, to make decisions that go against what the very people thinks justice is
Yes, my country is the same, yes
Right?
like in this country, the corruption is
Right
i think there's a lot of that, but it's, i don't know, the cover up for corruption is the money, but in many cases, famous cases like the
uh, it's been over teen years, that a football athlete, OJ Simpson, was charged of murdering his wife, right?, and he
Right, right
He had a whole lot of money, and usually everybody thinks he was guilty
exactly
he killed his wife
Exactly
but yes, and that, that case shows there is a lot of imperfection, he had a lot of money, he had millions
right
in his, in his case and that's why, i think that had a lot of influence, and since he was famous, a lot of people felt sorry for him
yes
But at the same time part of the system is that one hundred percent of the jury has to have a  very pure certainly
of the guilt let's say of that guy of -OJ Simpson in that case
and there in, pardon in this case it was because of a technical issue, no
yes it was because they had doubts, they had yes
not exactly
they have to be one hundred percent I mean when they privately vote, the jury, if a person has a doubt, already it doesn't
yes
doesn't come out, but in that case the technical thing was that they thought well since since the glove didn't fit
aha aha
they had doubts that perhaps it wasn't him, I think it was two men in the way that they killed it was very serious, they lifted a man, they took off his head, but
ah
they had doubts and that technically as an attorney I understand that if they had even an iota of doubt they can't find him guilty, also because the police made mistakes
the cops
yes
they stepped on the blood, took out the blood, they found that man's blood in the car, but since they damaged all that, technically
yes yes
it can be used
exactly, there it was an excess
in that
that was really an excess, right
yes
from the jury
yes
I guess that in most cases they have some doubts
yes
I think, no
yes, yes
that there's always a small percentage of doubt in all cases, right
yes, that's right, that's why laws exist
but in this case, money helped so that the doubt
yes
would decide the outcome and not
yes, yes, yes, that's right, yes
I'm still talking about this example, but the fact is that the system, as you say, is not perfect
no
but it still works a bit better than other systems that are authoritarian, lets call them that way, authoritarian, no
yes yes
where a judge decides, right
yes, I agree because, I don't remember myself but my parents told me that in my country, they don't have the history of Mexico of course, all countries are corrupted by the history here shows that democracy in their country
It's wider, it's older, and well, my parents suffered a lot in my country when there was no democracy, there was a dictator and that's why i can only
compare it to when there really was no jury, there was nothing like that, that system from the fifties
Right
and, uh, and before, and well, i can thank the system for that, but it also has flaws, for example, in this country there still are, for example, if there is
there have been many cases where, lets say, of murdering someone, he says "no, i didn't kill the guy"
but you can't understand him well because he doesn't speak English very well, he's Hispanic
Right, right
Many times uh, in the jury, now and in the past, the lawyers pick people from the jury that aren't hispanic, and the court has been finding little by little that it isn't
it isn't, it's unfair, because they have to find people in the jury that can understand the man's situation
Yes
He's saying that he wasn't in that place and like that, many other go to jail that are innocent too
Right, like now in the Simpson case
Yes
somehow the system, the crime and justice problem, well, it obeys many complex circumstances
yes
I, sometimes i think about the case of Simpson, maybe he was guilty
yes
and the system declares him, uh, not guilty, and what we could expect is that the guy would behave, i guess
right
right, i mean, yeah, maybe he is guilty
oh well
but, in some other cases, the same system has declared innocent a guy that he's going to kill, rape or do some other things.
yes, yes, yes, unfortunately
so
Hello, good afternoon
Hello I'm Arthur, I'm calling from New York
Hello I'm Mayra and I'm talking from Texas
Hello Mayra, fine, fine, fine Mayra. Listen where are you from originally, from Texas?
how are you? Hello from Mexico City but right now I'm in Texas in fact I live in Philadelphia, but I'm on vacation in San Antonio
ah look from the D.F. very good, very good, I, I lived in the D.F. a while
where?, ah really, how long?
I was living in the D.F. like three years three years, two years eighty five, eighty six and then from ninety seven til nine eight
alright, and what did you think? yes?
aha, no well I like it. The only problem is the safety
yes, well that is- that's the only problem because the pollution that they had before has been fixed a lot
ah really? to
I feel that it's not as bad as in the eighties. In the eighties it was quite bad
yes I remember, and well and others - traffic yes that does, still exist for the
yes listen, and where are you from?
I'm Chilean
ah, okay, and now
well, then the topic, the topic is of, let's say eh, the topic of the day is eh the jurors right? Have you ever gotten to be a juror, no
yes no, no, no, no and I don't think I'll get to because I'm not an American citizen
ah yes is true, I think that you have to be a citizen
yes, have you had to?
I had to once, I had to once, what happens is that I'm also American. I was born in Wisconsin
okay
I hold the double nationality then yes one time I had to, they called me to, to do jury duty and well it was quite boring all that honestly, it was a lot of waiting, wasting time and at the end look that I got a case that I was interested in, I was interested in being one of the jurors
ah, okay
I said well to see how it is, but they didn't pick me, they didn't pick me but in a way, I remember, I don't even know why they told me thank you very much
only one the attorneys they have the right, for example, like fifty people arrive
aha
and then they call them one by one and they ask them, well first they give you a paper a form and you fill out the whole form and they see it and they can ask you questions and they start eliminating
any of the two attorneys can, let's say, eliminate a juror and
listen and on what basis do they eliminate, only if they think is a good idea or not? or how is it?
yes, no, there's no rule, let's say, there's no rule that limits it because, I mean they can eliminate them because is black, they can eliminate him because is
eh, husband of an, of an official, or because they answered a certain way on the forms, is that in the forms they ask you all types of things
okay
like for example
okay
what, what do you think of the death penalty, things about, I mean, they can ask you a thousand things and basically what they want to see is which is the jury that would be most advantageous to them
okay mm
then eh, a district attorney can want, for example, someone who's related to a cop, a wife, eh, a mother of a cop when for example, an attorney for the defense would never! want that
yes, well yes
and like that, and when it's for example a woman that was beaten and they are accusing a man, eh, I say that the prosecutor will want for the jury to be women
well yes
and those kind of things right? I mean, it's the thing of seeing, trying to decide trying to think how a jury a person in the jury will think. Well and what do you think of the jury system in general?
the system, now that you are telling me, for example, I was going to ask you how you think it works because it seems that you can I mean, you can practically change the, the, the way a trial will proceed depending of the jury you choose
because, for example, I've seen, in the last scandalous trials that there were of the CEOs of various companies
yes
two that were identical and the, the men had done exactly the same thing but one chose for the trial to take place in a in a county and the other chose in New York
yes, mm okay, yes
and one they gave him, one came out innocent and the other was found guilty and with a sentence of I don't know how many years and it really just was, I mean, they were analyzing it in the Economist which is the magazine that I see
and they were saying that yes, that the only real difference was that the lawyers of one were sharper and chose in other words the right place and the right jury
and well it made me think, like that of, listen then it just depends on what attorney you have and that's it, I mean, it seems- mm?
well in a large part in a large part that's how the justice system is here. Eh, it's justified by calling it an adversary system adversary or I don't know how it's called
and the idea is that they are competing like a tennis match or a football game okay?
mm
one team and the other, and the prosecutor team against the defense and the idea is that, well, that each one, I mean
it's supposed that in, in, in general is going to come out good but I don't think that the system is designed so that there's never a mistake, and that, that you are completely right and the example is: one single jury, one single person
can decide that, that no and the whole trial has to be done again, because one person says that no
yes
and that person of course that could've been eliminated by someone from the other lawyer and there's a lot, a lot that happens I believe randomly is that it can't be controlled, and that is part of the system
but generally it's supposed to work. I think that's the idea
well yes, I suppose that is the idea.  But it happens that, well, he also does well because lawyers charge you and charge you and why at times
you have to pay what they say, no?  I mean, if it will make the difference between being guilty or innocent, better to pay whatever
ah, this is true, and the most important, for example, I have a friend who was stopped because, well, I don't know, he was speeding, and he had drunk a little bit of alcohol and here you don't know how strict they are here
aha
with drinking and driving, they're exaggerated
yes, a lot
eh, yes, a big tragedy, imagine!  They arrested him and everything, imagine what this costs, because it's like five thousand dollars in fines
but after you're up, and they've left you suspended without a license, and it stays on your record after
wow
the insurance costs you an eye because insuring the car is a hug- a huge problem, but aside from this, there will be costs and all this, he's paying I think almost five thousand dollars
to get a better lawyer.  And with a better lawyer in the case of driving drunk
hmm
eh, it really works
oh yeah?  hmm, well, hmm
pretty well, like, I hope a little bit, so, yes, I think that in the cases, let's say, well, in all the cases look at the case of O.J. Simpson you can also see that
there are also many people who say that the jury system didn't work
yes, yes
and because he had such a good lawyer who was Johnny, and sure, and they elected, and the place where they did it and  number of blacks that they had on the jury, etcetera, people say that
this was an injustice, I don't know, I think that sometimes you don't know, and the job is only a way to try to guess
hmm
and, and we can't know if, if he is or is not guilty
listen, and compared to the Chilean system, for instance, how is the Chilean? is it like all the other where you are only judged by the judge alone and he is the one who
decides and pronounce the penalty?
oh, look I am not very, very, eh I don't know that well the Chilean system because I never lived in Chile
oh, OK
so I can't tell you, but I don't remember how it was in Mexico, although I lived in Mexico I don't know how the system is there either
it's like this, it's just like this, you don't even have- trials are not open in general, everything is acrrief out with audiences only
aha
and there is no jury, you just declare in front of the judge, and the judge is the one to pass at the end, to decide whether you are innocent or guilty
and he pronounces the penalty, and that's it but I have seen that you can appeal everything
sure
so even if you are declared guilty you can spend the next years appealing and there is no difference, you just have to keep paying your attorneys to keep doing the paperwork, it's quite funny
well, I think it's the same everywhere, eh, where you can appeal, I think you can appeal in most of the places
but what do you think about it? who is best to take the decision? someone who studied laws and who is professionally paid to hear and understand laws and determine guilt?
or do you think its better a system where an average citizen is part of a group who takes the decision?
I think, I don't know what is better honestly, I think that if I have, I mean thinking about it as if I had the resources, it would be more convenient using a jury
I mean, the one in which citizens pay because then I can actually decide what is going to happen, and otherwise then I would resort to the system which I find more fair where a judge is the one who knows and
the cases will be presented to only him, and he will take the decision
I think
but, that is what we use in Mexico and I don't know how well it works, anyway you can convince the judge to say whatever you want
or you can buy it sometimes, that's the problem, and it's just one person
mm, yes, it's easier that way, it's cheaper, I guess, than to buy the whole jury.
sure, and well I don't know, if you know, and I mean, if you know a person and he's going to be on the jury, I mean, they've picked him to be part of one, to have contact with them will be difficult
now, I think you might, it's just an idea but, for example, professional jurors
that would be a great idea, they would know about it because I think they are malleable, I mean
I mean, you take
a jury of normal citizens and well, you just have to control the news media, you can make everybody have an opinion
I see, and with that you can influence the jury's decision, there's no problem.
that's what I think, so, I believe that, sure, that's what happens when you have a very specific way of interpreting the law, no, I mean, just like a lawyer
mm mm
and oh, to have, I mean, to pass a test, with certain questions so that you have, oh, so that you are deemed capable and logical
mm
to know about statistics, to understand, for example, to clearly or scientifically understand what DNA is, the different kinds of isotopes, the tests, to know more about this than the average citizen.
lots more
yes, yes, yes, yes
and take it from there but also, if there is an anonymous group of people, to have lets say four hundred or five hundred paid people in that group, I mean, it would be like any other job.
and they are going to be picked, not by the lawyers, I mean, to change the system a bit
mm
just a bit so that instead of picking a normal person, I mean, they would pick someone that went to school to be part of a jury
Tamara

Very good Well I just returned yesterday
ah,
And I'm super sad
Happy New Year
yes I'm super sad because I wanted to stay
Oh, and what part of Mexico are you from? from DF?
From DF, mm
mm
And that's why
And is it nice?
yes, it really is
And is your boyfriend from Mexico also?
No, he's Gringo that's the problem
Oh,
a problem
Well he doesn't need a visa to go to Mexico
Well yes, But well anyway
And would you marry him, or is it too soon
Well like I don't have much of a desire to get married, in general
aha
I mean like yes, I want I feel very good with him, and I want to be with him for a long time
yes,
But, I mean like with that it's already enough
how, how old are you?
twenty five and you?
ah, I'm twenty nine
alright,
yes,
yes, but no, for now honestly no,
Well, you have time
yes, you have, are you married?
what?
are you married?
yes, yes, I married an Argentinian
Okay
Eh, I met, I mean I lived in Israel ten years
aha
And I met there in Israel
alright
And we got married now, last year but well, we've been together for seven years but, we got married to get the visa
aye, how nice
Because, yes because he had a biologist's visa, he's a biologist
okay
And he could be here for three years so nothing, like, well, we got married and he gave it to me too
That's great
And so, so we're hear until he renews it, and the moment that it's renewed I'm going to be much better.  But, but I'm happy, I'm working in a hospital
for animals, so
ah, how great, aye, how cool
yes, in New York there's the biggest hospital
aha
Biggest veterinary hospital, but well, we won't go to New York
Well, Boston is good,
yes, it's cold is the only
yes, pretty much
yes,
here too, eh, so
And you liked the move from Mexico to New York?
yes and no
why not?
Because, ah, well is that, I don't know, like everything stresses that is
yes, because there's too much competition
aha There's a lot of competition, There are a lot of people
yes
And although there's a lot of people where I come from
yes
here is like more hip the public transportation and not so much being in the car and like that
yes
You feel more and besides, I don't know well in Mexico is my whole family, all my friends
But, how's the music scene in Mexico?I mean, I know they come out with good bands but the question is, how many of them start and don't make it?
The problem in Mexico is that everything is super centralized dude,
Sure
I mean there are only two group that stick And there's only one singer that
sure
that they support
yes,
I mean there's only one thing And well here, there is more support but the competition is much more fierce
Sure
and then the truth I see it the same. There in Mexico I know many people in the medium which that helps me a lot
and you have contact? contacts like to record and producers and all those things
Well, I produce my own stuff, so I know many people there
Mm
And now, that I'm about to print my first record
Oh, really nice
Then, yes, I mean, I'm doing that alone, all of that
yes
But I do know many people in the media that can help me
But, it's alternative pop, like Thalia
No, it's more alternative
Oh, nice
yes, no
well,
yes, yes. I would send you a website, for you to listen, and then you can give me your opinion
yes, I would love that, it would be nice, and can I write you back?
yes, yes
If you send me the page
yes, I can send you an email
yes, Nice
with a link and the page, then you can check that and you can write me back
Cool, cool
Ah, well, how nice that I met you dude,
yes, now yes, perhaps we are In, when we are there in New York perhaps we'll go see you when you play
aha, you come here a lot?
No, no, really I've never gone, ah, I've only been here nine months
And, okay
And in March, last year And well, I was taking exams
okay
And those things, I never had time to travel But I want to
ah, well, you should take a trip
yes I want to visit New York everybody tells me that it's beautiful And well eh,
yes, it's fun
But I also have to travel to DF, I have a friend, a very good friend of mine eh, Argentinian that lives over there
there are a lot of Argentinians right now, it's incredible
yes, and many actors
A lot of them emigrated aha
She, she, her boyfriend is an actor
okay
And she says there are a lot of Argentinian actors.
yes, it's incredible the amount of Argentinians that are in the DF
yes
Impressive
There were even soap operas with main actors in the soap operas that were Argentinean
yes, yes, They're a bit better looking than the
They change their accent
They're better looking than the Mexicans So they stay
No, they Mexicans are good looking too
But, well in general the Argentinians are better looking
But don't you hate the Argentinians a bit?
how?
Are you not a bit mad at the Argentinians?
Well some Mexians eh What happens is that I think that like they are taking many jobs from the Mexicans And the Mexicans well it's not like we're doing so well, to tell the truth
yes Sure
So some people are bothered bt I studied in a school where there were so many Argentinians Over there in Mexico, aha
what?
I mean like all my life I've been with, I have had Argentinian friends
Sure
Like that, I feel that
And you never, and they never bothered you
Well no eh,
that's good, because I've heard many jokes of Mexicans, I mean in Mexico Jokes about Argentinians
Oh sure, I do know that, I do know that.
And it's pretty weird because I used to travel to Brazil a lot and I never had any problems, no  one in Brazil did anything to me because of my Argentinian origin but when I went to live to Israel.
Everybody hated the Argentinians.
In Israel too
yes, well, not all the Israelis, no, the Hispanics, Hispanics hated the Argentinians, I couldn't understand why.
Hey
yes, I never had any problems in Brazil, nobody said anything to me
And there are a lot of Hispanics in Israel
yes, a lot, there were many from Mexico, what happens is that sometimes it's like a trend, but sometimes there are this youth movements
And they all go to live there
mhm
The Jews in Mexico have a lot of money so, I don't know, the ones
Okay but in general, the Hispanic Jews well
yes, yes, yes of course, they also go live there, they are immigrants and those people, I  mean I'm an immigrant too, its like they have a different ideology
Hey but you, being a Jew, if you go to Israel you can
oh,
Work and do all kinds of things, right?
yes, yes, we the Jews, we have ah, it's like a law, I mean, Israel has the Law of Return, which means that all Jews can go back to
Israel and apply for citizenship, oh,
Oh wow
So, it's really cool, because when when you start at the 19 and you don't have any money, I left when I was 19 years old, and I didn't had any money
But that support you and they pay you University for three years
And you studied there?
Well, yes, they help you, yes
Wow
And so, it was really good for me
it's really cool
But, well, that depends on people, I for example, wasn't around Latins that much, but between Latins is a lot of hate
I see
there was a lot of hate, with Argentina
Hi, Good day
Hi
Hi, Good afternoon, my name is Carolina
Hi, My name is Miriam
Oh, how are you Miriam?
How are you?, and where are, where are you calling from?
From New York
From New York, okay, I'm in Toronto, Canada
Oh, that's nice
Yes
Mmm
And, about the question, the topic, well
Justice
What's your opinion, miss, about justice
Well, as they say, here in Canada, in Justice, I imagine that in Canada
it's the same, They find a jury of 10, 14 people to select a case, and then you are called, from the area
Yes,
from the circlair office, and you have to go, I have been called like
Oh wow
two times, two chances, but when you get there, they have to select, I remember some opportunity, Am I hearing some noise back there or is it?
Sorry?
the, what was, did you hear a noise behind you?
yes, yes, it's my son who's fighting with the other.
Ah, yeah yeah
Yeah, big son.  Oh.
yes, em, so what they do here is the select the jury, to be able to qualify.  So for example the time when I went, I was working in an insurance company.
So I, I wasn't qualified.
Aha.  And why would an insurance company not be qualified?
Well sure, because like, since I worked for an insurance company, it wasn't good to choose me, because I already have
let's say, I know a lot about a person, how treating us and what we say in the case, i worked for insurance of, of houses.  So, for example, if
someone lived in a house, and I went there, well we always had to
Aha
try to tie up and try to
yes yeah
eh, it wouldn't clean the case.
Aha, aha
So if one already had a compromise, some profession that hid something, then they took you out.
Oh, I see, I see Oh
yes for example, also, the other opportunity, the second time I was working for a nursing company.  And they didn't accept me either.
Oh neither you have your
Mm no, I mean, it depends on what work you do, to qualify for insurance.
Oh, oh, I see
For me, for the jury.
For the jury, aha wow
and, the truth is, I'm going to tell you, I wouldn't want to be part of a jury, that's the truth, oh, it's a bit hard.
Mm, I think so
They are made up of fourteen people, so, they all have to reach a decision, I'd rather don't. As of now, I have a problem with
um, the court because my son was murdered.
Oh mam, I'm so sorry.
Yes, oh, it had just turned six months and you know, that if they catch the guy who did it, they'll sentence him but if they don't, they don't.
But, they've destroyed my life.
Sure, I can see that.
they've destroyed the life of my whole family, I think I will  never be the same person again, they've completely changed my life.
Oh
And that bastard, he's a drug addict, he's nineteen years old.
Aha, aha
so, um, he apparently tried to rob my son and oh, my son refused and so, he
That's even worse
he had a gun and he ended his life in a second.
Oh no, that's so horrible! So, do you, in your personal experience, believe that there's no justice?
I don't think so because, you know, I've worked as a translator too, for the courts.
Aha.
and one of my friends used to work at children's court
Yeah
And one of my friends, she had to witness a sad case in which the husband took a girl from her mother, but the father, he was a white cop and she was Hispanic.
So, he had a lot of influence, eh
Oh
He had lots of money, he would use his influences so that she'd look like trash.
Oh
So, just imagine, she, her seven year old girl, was taken from her, they took her.
But, in, in the United States, I've heard that this happens a lot, you see, I'm going to tell you something, in Canada, we do have things like that happening but they hide them
It's a bit more democratic, still.
Eh, hm mm
But, the Canadian system is getting corrupted.
Mm
However, if a newspaper finds out about it, oh yes, or if they know that a judge had favored someone.
Oh sure, yes.
But
There's no justice, no, I  mean, the truth is that, I say, my son is going to rest in peace when the man that killed him is trialed, no
Just imagine, I
Ah yes
as a mother, the only thing I ask for is justice.  I ask for the Lord to make justice.
And
And that this scoundrel, that they end his life, that they kill him, no.  That he pays for
That he pays, sure
that he pays from year to year no.
Sure, because
Uh, and another thing that they have here, imagine, that justice is this, that this was a boy who wasn't more than nineteen years old.  My son already was twenty four.
Oh, a young boy.
So yes, and you know that, this guy
So
imagine that they give him twenty five years.  So imagine, when he gets out, he will get out at forty five.
Sure
He's still a young man, no.
And, and,
And he will get out and return to doing the same, who knows.  Because you know
And will get out to screw for the time he was isolated.
because they say that there, in the prison is makes you worse, no.
yes well imagine, no, they don't give rehabilitation.
Exactly, and no.  After is he behaves well,
There against
I think he can get out in seventeen years.
I can imagine
And I say, and get out in seventeen years for what, to go out and kill someone else.
Aha oh
No, to finish, because don't you see that they are raised with that hate inside, no. And who knows how it is really. I don't know.
What a shame, right, yes.
I only ask for justice. I hope although he already confessed that yes, that he killed  him. But he comes, that guy comes from a family of killers,
his brother is another killer.
Ah really
the father is a drug addict, the mother is
He has to be human, I mean, right
his I mean, that, it's really a family unfortunately of
You have to, what a shame that one crossed his path and no, God God doesn't punish
imagine. Imagine if
And was he your only son ma'am?
my only son, because I have a daughter too.
Ah, what a shame.
But, you know that for me to have my son I suffered so much,
Aha
because I had many problems, and I always said that he, no, oh, my child and, and the truth, I loved him so much that everyone told me that I gave to much love to my son,
Oh, no.
Because he was all to me. And besides the child was very lovely.
Hm
He was a boy but, imagine, he told me, I got divorced when my son was three, and I never married again
Aha
And I have lived only for my children, I never brought a man to my house, and nothing.
Aha
And I have worked, I gave them the best well, I always took them to Catholic schools and tried to gave them the best no. And then, so, but my son was a very lovely child, a very good one.
He was with a girl around six years, they want to marry, but them two were at college. Imagine that the girl was completely destroyed.
Also, of course, what a shame.
Eh, her family loved so much my son. So may lives my son has touched. Well everybody tell me that he was an angel, because the truth as he was my son, and the way he is remembered, it is
incredible, no. Then
I am sorry, Madam.
oh, imagine, you don´t know.
The only thing that could, the only I could tell you is to take refuge in God. At knowing him, you are going to
And, and, I pray a lot, I ask so much to God
so much, so much
I tell you he knows why he did it, to take my son in that way. In a, imagine. And well, so, what am I going to do, but until know I cannot believe my son is death, I tell you.
Oh God
It is but
my, how sad, how sad
It's very hard, very hard, and, yesterday was six months that they took him away from me.
Six months, aha
and to me it seems that well, it just happened yesterday. Because people say with time it passes, it will never pass.
No, never, never
For me that is
Sure
vivid, vivid
Yes, how do you call it, you
I always remember the moment in which they came to give me the news, and today
my God, how horrible, how horrible
and yes, I mean that, I don't wish that on anyone.
No, definitely.
But there I go, you know, praying, and how it says like the
Do you go to church ma'am?
yes, I go to church, I
Sure, find refuge there and you will see that
Hm mm
you will find comfort reading the bible, is very
yes, I think that only for believing so much in God and for having faith in God is why I'm alive.  Because I, my first moment was
I imagine
when I wanted to died together with my son.  And I'll tell you that now, before I said, aye, I don't want to die.  Now I say, yes, my God, I've given my life to the Lord.
And I say, Lord, save me to go to find my son, because I think that my son is calling for me
Yeah
because I always live with the thought of him, in my person.
Yeah, sure, sure.  What a shame, my God, my God.
And you know, no, but on the other hand I also think about my daughter
yeah
Poor thing I say, what will become of my daughter.
She's younger?
yes, my daughter, well, she's already twenty two.  But she's studying at college, she's a girl
But you have to be strong for her, because, because imagine your daughter, losing her brother, and then if you don't get better,
hmm
she'll lose her mom too, this would be really hard for her.  She will only fail if you
yes well
if you weaken
hmm
because now she's in college you say, she needs to be strong
Hmmm
To move forward in their studies
Yeah, well
Otherwise she, she would fall into perdition, who know's, the pain would be too hard for her
Uh huh, yes
Yeah, so, you know, get strong
Uh huh
grow stronger and, and keep getting shelter in God and
Oh yes
and that everything goes, to help her, to help her in her pain
Uh huh
It's an irreparable pain. To me, an irreparable mistake, never, no one will ever
Uh huh
No one will ever be able to replace that, but, can you imagine
Oh
That's a shame lady, so, what do you think?, what, you say there's no human justice, god's justice, do you think it exists?
Well, God's justice, i think so, because they say that sooner or later
Right, uh huh
Uh, right?, uh, God, like they say, God squeezes but doesn't suffocate, right?, so i think that some day, well, if not human justice, well, it will have
because that's what's a shame, right?, all the bureaucracy there is, and, and when the judges sell themselves, imagine that
Different
and I already tell you that, how they took from my friend, her daughter and
Yeah
and imagine, and she who's a good woman. The man is rotten, who has even abused but with him, with the power of money, forget it.
The power of money is more powerful than anything.
It's true, it's true. Yes
yes
Honestly, I stopped believing in the human justice a long time ago.
Oh me too
I've also sought refuge in God.
Oh
Because already you see too much injustice, too much corruption. In, in I'm from Peru. And in
