Yes
I donÂ´t think such a thing called perfection could exist.
Yes. I agree
Now if we are going to talk about perfection we are talking basically okay the perfection at a human level does not exist.
Yes
None
The jury system, right.
The jury system is something I honestly donÂ´t know much about.
No. There was no appropriation.
Yes
No, really, I don't know Nicky, the only thing I know is that sometimes I have heard there are people that do that work
Yes
Those are who choose the members of the jury right. I donÂ´t know if I have. That was what I heard
Yes, I agree with the system, even if democracy is not perfect.
I think things and systems like that,as i am an idealist, always hope to try to improve
Of course.
And it has problems, and I do think that there have been many innocent people who have gone to jail, the same way that there have been criminals
Who have been found innocent in the jury system. I would love to do my duty, but I do know it's not perfect
Sure
The man crimed for looking
He works harvesting grape
Yes
He is being accused of killing somebody and he hardly speaks English and he wants to say that he was not in such place
He won't accept jury members who are grape harvesters, he won't accept people from the country of the man, he won't accept
People or men who work as farmers in general, while the other side will look for people who work as farmers, right? Because the will understand
The job, if he says no I was working for twelve hours and one says how is that possible
Yes
He can explain well I understand. Life is hard in that month ? And that is the problem, because often the two attorneys fight about it
What happens is that it ends up being a jury of people who have no prejudice
Such place often are fond juries in which no member is from
None
That can be a prejudice. Yes, I have seen times when the accused is a Hispanic.
The state attorney will try to pick people for the jury who are not hispanic, although he knows that is illegal
Because it's a prejudice but this practice does happen, and that is unfair too because you'd like to choose people who can understand
In general, without prejudices, but can understand in general, how does that person work, and they can be what they call objective, although I don't think that is possible
Things like this
You are right.
Someone that doesn't know about it. For example, the man you say grows grapes.
Yes
How is one expected to be on a jury if you don't know the issue. For example, this man and I don't know anything about growing grapes.
You are so right.
Yes but at the same time that's the system they have, they'd tell the judge that you are a perfect candidate to be on that jury because they want people that
Handle both sides and they are going to explain the issue in a basic way so that anyone can understand it, they know we don't know everything about the world, right? they would want to have people than can't be
Impressed that they can understand the issue. You;d be perfect for it because you've got no prejudice, you're not a spy, and no one in your family has that same job.
And then you could see both sides of the story. I understand both sides. unfortunately, it's a burden that I, as a lawyer, have to carry because I have to pay attention to both sides of an argument.
That's why you are a lawyer, that's your job but it's so interesting, as I tell Nickey, it's the first time, he had never had a chance
Yes,
He speaks to people when I get this calls, maybe it's the same people with different professions but no
Yes
I had never spoken to a lawyer
Yes
The subject is interesting.
Do you think that for example, the system, most of the time, do you have a similar system in your country Argentina?
Is it a fair system?
Well
When someone is found guilty I'm sure that's part of justice or is it something like, I've seen that in this country, sometimes money influences the decisions.
Of course, of course, it does affect, and in Argentina
Yes, good night, this is Patricia, who am I talking to?
Good night, this is Nancy. Patricia, how are you?
Where are you from, where do you live?
I'm from Colombia and I live in New York
I see, I'm from Panama and I live in Delaware.
None
What do you think about the justice system, Nancy?
I don't really agree with it. They make mistakes, and they create more injustice
They should really stick to the justice is blind quote
None
But, apparently, obviously, if you have money, you get the chance to have better legal representation unlike if you are poor.
If you don't have money to pay for a lawyer.
Exactly, you better say goodbye, you forget about the issue.
If you get a public defender it's not going to be the same
You notice this from what is shown in television, the proof of that is that ninety per cent of people that are in jail, at leas in this country,
They are, minorities, people of color or Hispanics.
Yes, that's right
Sure,
They say it isn't that way, it's
Hey don't have money to hire an expensive lawyer
Yes
Have you ever been on a jury, either here or in Colombia
No I haven't been. Never.
None
Never and I would not Aguirre because, judging someone and someone you really don't know, and you try to know it
In the time the trial last.
Re-write
None
No
Yes
We have seen for example in the last Michel Jackson case
None
None of the juries was like him
No
None is like him
Sure, and they took the decision, that supposedly
Exactly, for
It was the right one
I thought that was political; the same happened with OJ Simpson when he killed a woman in California.
The same was, innocent
Exactly, everyone knew he was guilty.
He didn't commit anything,
And well, for political pressure, social pressure, the man is now free.
Yes, because, money,
When they found him guilty in the civil triat that her parents brought against him.
Yes.
How is it that in one trial you're innocent, and in the other you'll be guilty of the same crime.
Yes, either you're guilty or innocent at the same time
Exactly, so it's not the fact of guilt or innocence, but his trail taught us that the card called, How do they say it in Spanish?
Reasonable doubt.
That the
Where, where the only thing the lawyers have to say, and they don't have to demonstrate that their clients are innocent, they only have to plant it in
The minds of the jurors,
That
Reasonable doubt and that's it.
He's ready to get out
Everything was ready.
Yes
How many people are getting out now who are innocent with these new DNA tests
Yes
The ADN have now realized that many people that have been put to jail are innocent.  They have killed many who are innocent.
I served a jury when I lived in Florida.
But
To me, it was an exhausting experience, it left my nerves very altered, and I am not a nervous person
Yes
It was about a guy, the police had made a raid in the house where he was at that moment
None
Because he sold stone
Precious stones?
He sold drugs
None
The police did that raid and he was there at that moment, he didn'y live there
It was a coincidence
SO, NOT COINCIDENCE, THEY MADE THEM ENTER THE BATHROOM ONE BY ONE TO SEARCH ON THEM, TO SEE IF THEY HAD ANY WEAPONS OR DRUGS
And when they finished searching they found a piece of rock beside his shoe
None
Beside, not inside. There had been other people before him
None
That had been searched on, so there was no relevant evidence that it belonged to him, that it came out of his shoe. Because nobody had actually seen it
We let him go free
None
We knew he was guilty
Yes when there's something illicit and one stays,
Exactly, when there's smoke there's fire.
Is as guilty as
But that there were no concrete proofs and also because you hear a lot about police abuse that they do and undo whatever they want.
Yes because is terrible
We let the guy go free, we acquitted him.
Yes
They were only going to put him in jail, not execute him.
Look for me too
Yes they were going to punish
They were just going to take his freedom away. They weren't going to sentence him to life.
His guilt
Nor anything drastic like that.
None
It wasn't going to be the first time that this guy would be in jail, neither, he wasn't a saint.
He had two previous records.
Look girl, I'm going to tell you that after making that mistake of freeing that man. When they let us leave, I sat in the first seat I found and sat and cried like a cry baby.
It was the stress of thinking that the well-being of another person was in my hands.
Without knowing the family of this person
Exactly.
Who went
Without knowing the circumstances, so I also started to think, well, if this man doesn't care about his personal circumstances, because they are important to me.
None
I really feel this kind of person that I am not going to judge anyone, or scold anyone
Yes but
Without
Sure,
And it's a really big responsibility that you imagine if they call you a Judge. Like in the crime of the wife of OJ Simpson. Can you imagine this?
I imagine you would tear your hair out every day.
You go crazy.
None
Exactly, because then there are twelve people who have a ment- a different mentality, who have all come from different cribs. And in their houses they were taught different things
They have to get to a mutual agreement.
To have everyone make the same decision, no
Exactly and I understand them because the future of another human being is in your hands it's huge.
You don't know from here to tomorrow if someone is guilty, in reality, yes.
This is huge and you don't know what tomorrow will bring.
Because you don't know.
All the things the children might have thought about.
You sometimes feel that you are there and,
No, but I did, yes, I believe that in a jury, oh a jury would be more convenient than just having a judge decide.
Yes
No.
Yes.
With a jury, those people are not in your same economic, social or education circumstances but they have to convince the twelve of them.
You have a chance if you can convince one.
Exactly. Specially if you know you are innocent.
None
But you can't prove it.
Yes, That's the problem. I think that when you are there, looking at the person, you can see it in their eyes.
Other days.
Yes, you'd notice it, isn't it?
You can't, I don't know honey, well I just know that the guy that we had to trial
Look at that person
He was a first-level criminal. He couldn't hide it even if he wore a bag over his head. No matter how you'd dress him, he'd still look like a gangster.
You could see that he was guilty
None
But it's
She had a terrible face, but That day she was saved
Yes, but, who know more now?
A no girl, that's karma, you see
Yes, they become more grumpy
If you keep that, sooner or later bad things will happen
Yes, they say justice goes, but it arrives
Celestial justice
Justice, yes
I LIKE TO SEE FORENSIC MEDICINE
Yes
And they were broadcasting a show about a wife, her husband was sentenced for killing his mother in law and raping his nephew
He raped the eight year old nephew
Yes
At the end, 7 years later, the wife didn't give up because she knew her husband was innocent.
The women was able to get another trial
Other trial
Because DNA was more advanced
Yes
And the kid changed her opinion, admitting it wasn't her uncle.
Oh, God
Seven years of rotting in jail, knowing you haven't done a thing.
I can just imagine the bad things they'd do to you in jail
Exactly. That for example in this country, which doesn't happen in our countries, in this country, if they wrongly convict you and later a jury finds there was a mistake made
And the evidence is in your favor, they'll pay you for all of those years that you wrongfully spent in jail.
None
In our country, they don't worry about that.
They tell you see you later, get out.
Yes, exactly, if they even do that right.
Yes yea that happens a lot
But I do believe juries are a good idea.
Yes, some day it'll be my turn, I think about someone's family.
You know how they choose you to be on a jury.
No
When you vote?
Hello?
Hello, Aurelio
How are you? Manuel, I'm in Orlando, Florida.
Oh. How are you? I'm from Washington, DC
Mister Aurelio? Let's get into it
What's your name, again?
Manuel
Nice to meet you, Manuel.
Nice to meet you.
They have never picked me for a jury because I'm not yet an American citizen.
Correct.
They have already picked my wife and a lot of my friends several times.
Right.
The cases that they have dealt with is absurd.
These people are spending money in such absurd cases.
True.
A horrible thing
So much paraphernalia.
Exactly, yes. Is too much, is too much, yes. No yes. Have they picked you as
No, look I coincide with you. The exact same thing happened to me, they summoned me once, but I'm still not a citizen. So automatically
It was disabled to accept.
Sure.
That was in New York, because I lived in New York a few years.  Never again. Regarding what I think of the system,
I would say that it's good. But, I didn't know the truth, as you just finished telling me, is that there was, that they were, em
Doing all these paraphernalia for very silly cases.
Sure.
I thought that it was only for cases of homicides, or more serious cases.
No, the last case that my wife was called for was about a guy
This British that gave the finger there to a woman in traffic.
None
Imagine. yes, man. The woman took him to court, and they sentenced him. He had to pay a fine of
For an obscene gesture.
Exactly,
How can it be? And all of us paying for that? is that, look, what has been said, is a system that's already created
I talk about the justice system.
Sure.
That it includes many things, not only the, the, the part of the prosecutors, the judges, also the jails. So then, they need people so they can continue, well, living that way.
Sure.
There I would fully agree with you. It's incredible they are taking so much of our taxes, when a judge can perfectly have the preparation is obvious and logical.
To decide that in half an hour.
Sure. Without so much bother, like they say in your homelands, I would imagine that you are Colombian, judging by the accent.
Yes, yes.
Exactly, without so much, so much mehollo, man. Because, look, the, the first thing they'll spend forever doing, like, take three hours to select the jury, one of them being my wife, they chose her finally
Yes.
After the judge took about six hours deliberating. If it's one thing, if it's the other, that I just don't know, I don't know that, that maybe yes the man did it intentionally
What is an obscene gesture depends on the type of personality over here and there. They concluded that the guy was guilty of it
They fined him, they put him in jail for two days and a five thousand dollar fine.
Incredible. That was happening
I was left in shock. I said it can't be these people
Incredible. We run into each other often.
What do you think, what's your take?
That case was very relevant in ninety four.
OJ Simpson, yes
That seems to me to be a case that deserved that type of thing. Do you understand what I mean? Because it supposedly was relevant because the guy was famous. But,
Yeah
The guy
Yes it is very controversial
Exactly, including homicides. You know what I mean? Yeah, it's necessary that there be some sort of deep scrutiny. Something where they carefully evaluate all of the perspectives and everything that had happened. Yes, that was deserving of that kind of thing.
But, listen something like this
Even though, there like, I am also fully aware of the jury's conscience, in serious cases even though here, by what I've seen
It's very marked by the race factor. Don't you think?
Sure, of course.
Marked by the race factor.
Yes.  Although they say no, they always deny it.
No, they'll never recognize it.
No, they deny it but up to when already nobody dares to say anything, no, yes, it's true, look, they found him guilty because he's black.
No.
None
Nobody dares to say that. But, you see the things that happen on the television. You hear the national radio and those types of things.
You can clearly see, there is still racism. Many decisions are made at the racist level.
Yes back to the -OJ Simpson case, the race factor counted a lot, because the majority of the jurors, appeared to be black.
He was acquitted, found not guilty.
Exactly.
When to everybody it was more than evident this man's guilt.
Sure. I remember all the eviden
No because if it wasn't him, who? Why did the investigation stop? Why don't they continue investigating?
Exactly.
Until finding the guilty one
No, the guilty person was never found, is something
No, and things stopped there. I mean that, they, implied, they also concluded that he was guilty. But, they found him no
Yes
So there was a also a racial factor there. but in the other sense, they favoured their race
Of course, sure
That's very complicated.  It implies costs
Loss of money, for those who result, somehow, hidden
Sure, figure
Because the companies won't always compensate for that. And what they recognize isn't much I think
Yes, it's nothing, at all. A work mate was three days out of the job because of, of the so called jury duty.
None
They were really supportive with her
They treated her like if
Almost any company does, because they are not obliged to it
Yes. In this case and another case,
Not so absurd, but it wasn't worthy after all. It was a drugs affair. A guy they caught with drugs and many other things.
They were deciding whether he was guilty or not. It lasted for three days, figure.
None
You know, shit happens. I think that people drown in a glass of water. This is what I think in these small cases.
Miguel, what do you do in this country?
I am a journalist
Good
Yes
I am an opera singer.
Yes. I like opera and attended the Metropolitan.
I see.
And I saw, I saw Pavarotti singing some times
Oh, that's great. You saw him?
Yes, but he was still active in 1999
Right, before he retired
Retired.  Congratulations, but are you a professional singer?
Yes, yes, of course, yes. I
Really? and you live in Washington?
Yes, I used to live here in Washington, and I am working in a music school, I give classes there, and sing when I get hired to do so. I've just arrived from Italy two weeks ago
Really? How good. Wow, congratulations! I think it's a very nice profession
It is nice already, but also stressing
Yes, and I guess you also to, to take good care of your throat
Well not, you have to look after all yourself, not only the throat, you have to watch your diet, do exercise all the time
OK
Yes, it's something global. It's not only the throat.
Yes
I sometimes see some singers who do a lot of excesses. They just cover their throat and drink some beverages, but never exercise.
None
No, let themselves do stupid things. It's stupid, trying to take care of the throat without doing exercise.
Sure.
You open your mouth and you put the cake, you, all the time. Exactly, yes. and how long have you been in this country?
Well, it's going to be nine years.
Imagine.
I was in New York for a while, but unfortunately I couldn't with the climate, it's cold, And I even loved the city.
None
The weather, no, it wasn't great for me, I had allergy problems and things, that degenerated into asthma
So, it was when the doctor, the specialist told me that I needed to find a warmer climate, and I came here to Florida, where my brother lives.
How nice
I have been here for a year.
You're in Orlando?
In Orlando, yes.
Talking about the justice system again in this country in each state, each city, each country has its different things manages in a different way
Yes, it's true
Yes.
It's so much that they even have extradition between states, No?
Exactly, yes.
That this, it seems unusual, coming from a South American country, but
Exactly, did you know that they just, something that just happened to my singing teacher, it's a whole thing that, that they just put here, it's new, it's in the city right now, in Washington
You can't drive without an earpiece
Yes
Cell phone, I think it's a very good thing
It's very good, yes?
I think it's a very good think, it turns out that my teacher, he got caught. He was on a traffic light and he was talking on the phone, they caught him. It turns out the man forgot his wallet, he didn't even have his license
None
Those things that happen, and when...
Yes
Exactly, that, when something bad is gonna happen to you, it all happens at once. Well, the man was taken to jail and everything, six hours
And they had to contact someone to know that, because the problem is, he's called Russel
Homonyms
He's more or less a common man, there's also a Russel in the same area.
None
That has more than two
Hello
Hello, Rodrigo's speaking! From,
From where?
From New York.
From New York.  How are you Don Rodrigo?  This is Chong speaking from Toronto, Canada.
Okay
And how is the weather there in New York?
The climate?
None
Quite cold.
Yes.
Yes, it is cold and that is normal. Yesterday we had a rain storm with hail.
How nice. Also here in Toronto it's good it's normal, there's a lot of snow and a lot very cold but that's how the season is of
Of Christmas, of December and January Right?
It's always like that.
Yes. And I've heard that New York is very nice during Christmas
Lot of people come to the big apple
None
But when one has been living here a long time, one already gets bored.
I know new york and chicago and several other US cities
Before there was more crime, more danger, but now they say it's better. Is it true or?
Yes, it has improved a little, but you're never a hundred percent safe
Right
On the streets, there's always some danger. It also depends on the sector where you live.
Right, and where in New York do you live?, do you live in Manhattan or?
In Manhattan
Right
Yes, do you know Manhattan?
I have heard on the radio and on TV that Manhattan is the best place in New York.
But they say that, for example, there are places in Manhattan that if you go further than, upper, the two
We'll wait for you.
Brown [the Bronx] is part of Manhattan, right?
No
The places up from Manhattan, are they safe?
Upper Manhattan
Excuse me?
Upper Manhattan
Right
Yes
They say there isn't as safe as the lower part
Yes, is true. In all parts it has its pros and its cons and sometimes one can be in the safest place, but when something is going to happen, is going to happen regardless.
Yes.
Yes, Listen and are you Colombian?
No, I'm Canadian but Mexican on my mother's side.
Your mom is Mexican and your dad is Canadian.
Yes
Have you lived all your life in Canada?
None
None
Well, sure. Speaking of crime, Canada is much safer. In Mexico there are a lot of kidnappings and a lot of theft.
It's been four or five years that I don't go to Mexico and they say the situation is worse now. There's a lot of delinquency.
Since the people don't have to work and want to make money, then what happens is that the important people on television
That is related to show business they kidnap them,
None
They kidnap them. Then they charge a ransom for them
Yes
Yes.
Just one thing happened to me. Where are you from?
Chile.
From Chile.  Do you know Mexico city?
Yes, the federal district.
Yes
Yes, I know
Yes, they stole my wallet there, one time I was in a truck, I didn't realize, I didn't realize until I was off the truck
And you didn't realize it.
No, I had it in my bag and in the backpack and I had the wallet inside, but when I got down the truck
The opened the backpack
I see
And they removed it without noticing myself
You didn't even noticed
No
YES, IT'S DANGEROUS, PEOPLE IS SUCH A THEFT
Yes
Yes
I used to carry my birth certificate and documents with me but not any more
Other documents with me, that I lost, so now, If I'm traveling or not, I don't carry anything with me
Just the passport
Not event he passport. If I carry the passport, for example- i'm traveling, I leave it in the Hotel locked; I don't carry it with me.
I just bring the credit card and that's id, it's easy, if you lost it, or you get mugged, you just call by telephone.
They deactivate it
None
And did they take a lot from your wallet?
No, It was the documents that caused me more problems.
Yes, when they take the documents, everything's more difficult
Yes
Yes, you haven't come to Mexico for a long time.
Sorry?
You haven't come to Mexico for a long time.
Yes, and also in Acapulco. And I also, this time that I left Toronto I was driving passing through the United States getting to Acapulco.
Yeah.
And where I traveled, more in the cities of the United States and
I was driving from Toronto to Acapulco I was also driving from Toronto to Washington, to Vancouver, and no, I've never had any of this
Any danger
No, I've been living here in the United States for two years. And thank God I've never had any problem either, but I have friends who have.
They had it.  They attacked one friend, then punched him and he died.  In Queens.  After leaving a party.  To rob him.
None
Yes, but not to me, I've been lucky. These things happen at dawn at night when it's really late, only there
You're exposed and something like this happens.
Or leaving the clubs. This is almost
Yes.
I hardly go to bars and this things, maybe that's why I haven't had any problems
If you go to discos or clubs where a crowd gathers
None
And people drink. They drink one cup and another one, and afterwards, the problems start.
Yes
That's why I am always scared of that. But I think it is dangerous all over, also in Canada, Chile, Mexico, the UNited States, all over
It depends
Yes it depends, Well we had, we used to have, I wonder if you heard that in the news, in Toronto there were a lot murders
We are having problems with guns now
No
In the United States there are more guns than anywhere else right ?
Yes
In Canada we haven't had that problem but the use of guns is growing and crime as well
Are there a lot of people in Canada? I know many Chileans who live in Canada.
Yes. No, I don't know may Chileans. Well, in Toronto and in Montreal and Vancouver there are may Latin American people.
Of course there are a lot of people from El Salvador, and many Salvadoreans here in Canada.
How do they manage with the language? Because there one half speak English and the other half speak French, right?
Yes, in Quebec they speak almost only french, and in all the other places almost only english, and in Quebec
They don't want to speak or know anything about English. Well that's their problem, because they are trying to educate their children only in English
It's the kids that loose if they don't learn english. And in this world where English is the business language, and they speaking only french
They are afraid that the French language is going to die and that's why they
They want to teach English
Right
Do you speak English and french?
I don't speak french
She studies and goes to a school where they teach her just, half a day in English and half a day in french. So she know how to speak English, French and Spanish.
It's multilingual
None
That's good for the children, the more languages you speak the better, but sometimes it's a pressure too
Learn very fast. While they're very little
Yes, yes, that's part of, but well, that's good because that helps them, in their opportunities for life.
Yes, that's true
Yes
Is your wife also from, from Mexico?
Yeah, she's Mexican I'm no longer with her
She's the Mexican
Yes, Mexican one hundred percent.
None
She was born there in Mexico, I met her there. She lives in Toronto with my daughter and I came here to visit. I live in Vancouver.
You are, and where are you, in Toronto or in Vancouver?
Yes right now I'm in Toronto, I came for Christmas.
The holiday
For the holiday, but I had returned to Vancouver that Monday
Yes. Have you already made a lot of these calls, How many calls do you have? Several.
I have maybe twelve or thirteen.
How many do we have to make, twenty-five
Twenty five
This already the second one.
Yes
Yes, I started yesterday.
You just started
What's the period of time that one can take to make these twenty five calls? Are they fast?
I was busy, I couldn't call every day.
Okay But does one have to wait til they call you or one has to call?
No one has, one can call the toll free number And that, that's what I always do, I call the toll free number because I'm very busy to we waiting that
They call me
What's the number to call?
I don't remember but they have it in the information email that they sent us.
Okay, It's in the e-mail, some one has to call then to let them know when you want them to call you?
No, you can call whenever you want to make a call.
If I want to make the call I call myself?
Yes, to the number one eight sixteen eight sixty six something, it's there in the information.
Yes it must be in the email. No, I didn't study it well.
Yes, yes, study. It's what I always do, I call the number and I don't have to wait.
You cant make the calls? In a week?
No, one per day, no more.
No, for this, one per day?
Yes
What can you do, seven calls a week?
None
Every day
Yes, it's
Every day you can make a call
Yes
I though you only had to wait.
None
Until someone called you.
This is what I always do. I always call and say okay when they connect me, and that's good.
Well
Good evening, Patricia's speaking. Whom am I speaking with?
Hello, good evening, Ingrid from Philadelphia.
Hello Ingrid, What country are you from?
From Guatemala.
And are you in Philadelphia?
Yes. What country are you from?
I'm from Panama and I'm here in Delaware.
None
Next to you.
We are near.
What can you tell me about, since you are in quite a big city with a crime rate quite high?
Yes, here more than anything the news personally I've been here almost two and a half years
None
And never by the grace of God nothing has happened to us.
None
No.
Do you feel safe where you live?
Well now I have like a month, a year of living here and I feel really safe, in other words that I can walk in the street peacefully
Yes, me too.
When I moved to Philadelphia I got home at 5 pm.
I see
I didn't feel safe.
The neighborhood where I live is very, very quiet. The city is relatively calm. The only thing is that from time to time in what we call
The city's center, Downtown
None
From time to time, things get wild, but that's once every five years. You hear about shootings and things like that, but generally they don't talk about us on the news
None
In my country, crime is very high because of unemployment.
I can imagine. I guess it's the same as Guatemala.
The same must happen in Guatemala, exactly
Just like in Guatemala. Every time I, I mean, I don't even feel like going to Guatemala, I can tell you that. I don't feel like going because
Not me. I don't go that far.
I'm scared
I don't go that far
None
You simply have to be smart and know where you can go, and where you shouldn't go, andwhat time can you be out if you're in a foreign city
Yes, I don't know if it's the same in Panama, but my mom tells me
No?
That she goes in the public transport
None
Do not ride with a gun
Yes it has been known that in panama
Gentlemen here.
The thieves have gotten into buses and robbed everyone
They take away the money and the clocks
There was a time
None
There was a time when Noriega had the power.
None
Thieves used to break in the high-class restaurant
Yes.
And left people without clothes wrapped in the cloth of the tables in the restaurant
Yes
Because they even took the clothes.
It is very dangerous because you can get killed by a nonsense.
Then the youth of today gives me the impression that they are not afraid of anything.
The youth of today is not afraid of anything or anyone.
Yes
They have no respect for God. Do not fear the police, or the repercussions of their actions.
Yes
I think that if you kill someone
None
You should deserve the death penalty.
Sometimes it seems a bit exaggerated but as they say
Eye for an eye.
An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
No, eye for an eye, exactly.
Yes
Especially crimes against minors
Sure
These should be automatically eliminated and taken out of society because they simply don't belong in society.
Yes, exactly, I don't believe in those who repent or this because
Or don't want to belong, no, no, not that they will repent.
If they have the heart to do something bad, it's very difficult they can
Yes, if you give them another opportunity, they will return and do it.
Sure
Instead of spending so much money on war I would like to see,
None
They train more police in the areas that need it to maintain order, to keep the family safe.
To keep children so they are not a bad example for children. For example, gangs.
Yes, and perhaps also invest a bit more in education and the
Education, exactly.
To people because lack of education is what also unfortunately throws people who are less educated, they are the ones who get into the
These acts of violence and robbery and
I've suffered in Panama,two robbery attacks,I was struggling.
None
This was in Panama, thank God it hasn't happened here, no one has stolen anything from me
None
The simple fact that they came to attack me, I felt violated
Of course, of course.
You see?
For me, just once.
And what it did to me, it made me very angry
Yes
Not fear. It made me angry.
No, once in Guatemala, it was about twelve years maybe, I remember that it was your life on public transport
The rear door was open, and I had my gold chains.
None
I don't know why I was carrying them.
None
Damaged the one thing that I felt was something, they didn't hurt me,
It tore.
, well one of them had burst and when I went to see it was a few kids who were eight years old at most
That's what I'm saying.
And neither
If there were more after school programs
Sure.
That the kids, for example, the dads and the moms who have to work, that kids, instead of being in the street, had more after school educational programs
None
To teach them something
Sure.
Police go to the schools. No, they need a stronger presence
Yes. Exactly.
Because they're going to do what they're going to do
Exactly, like they already start from
Well, we have to do what we have to do to protect ourselves.
Sure.
And to me there's nothing that makes me angrier
Exactly. And that
That upsets me.
At least in Guatemala that is more than their gold chain. It cost fifty dollars, just to say an amount.
So that someone comes
They come and they sell it for five dollars.
Imagine.
Is not even that they are going to sell it for a good amount but that they are going to give it away.
And also the people who lend themselves to buy those stolen articles.
Exactly, because because. Crime has two faces
Sure.
I also think that these hot shot executives
None
You see on television that steal millions of dollars
None
Those shouldn't be put in a minimum security jail. Those should be put with the rest of the killers
Of course.
With the rest of the rapists and drug addicts, put them there.
In other words everybody the same. Everything the same but for for the same reason for
Exactly.
They have so much power
Thief is the one that steals a toaster just the same as the one that steals five million dollars.
Sure.
A thief is a thief.
Exactly, but like this how these people can buy
And everybody should be together. That's the system
The other employees
That's another fifty dollars
Sure
The crime is a crime, that you break the law it doesn't matter how or how much you break the law. You should be treated the same
As all the other criminals that did the same thing.
Exactly.
The same with these Catholic Priests that molest kids.
The same, exactly.
Those they should put with the rest of the
I mean that is
They know so they pay.
Sure
Their crime.
At the same time they commit the crime, the church is also committing it by covering it up
Exactly
Because they should pay is that more because one trusts the church with the eyes closed.
A child rapist is a child rapist whether he has a cassock or not.
Sure. And especially those people who are
That's like the toaster and the five millions. Exactly. They are people that you
Trust so much
It is trust because they know your most intimate secrets.
Exactly, sometimes not even fathers of family know everything like these people
None
I'm not like that but there are people that I mean stick their hands in the fire for a priest, they give them their kids
Without any question
Yes.
For these people to abuse like that they should pay
That's already ignorance. That's already ignorance.
Sure.
I agree that they should put them with the rest of the ones that have committed the same crime put all of them in the same jail.
Yes, exactly.
I bet you like that.
Exactly.
The Next time, if there is a next time, they'll think twice.
Yes. And another thing is when minors commit horrible crimes.
Of adults, exactly.
I mean there shouldn't be that because he's a minor and going to be judged differently
No, if you're a minor and commit an adult crime, well, you should be tried as an adult
Exactly
Because if you had an adult mind to form a concept
None
Then you must also have the mind of an adult to accept
Right
Your
None
Your punishment
Imagine that if when young, if they do such terrible thing when they're young, when they're adults, they'll be worse
Imagine when they're twenty one.
None
They're gangsters.
Right, and if they don't get punished, there's the example for other young ones like this one who did this terrible thing and didn't get punished, so I'll do it and what are they gonna do to me?
Exactly. Well, I'm gonna do the same, exactly
Exactly
And there are a lot of kids that know that with that excuse, since they are less than seventeen years, they know that the law protects them in some states
None
That they only send them, they first send them to a rehab camp
None
And second when they turn eighteen they close those criminal files
None
That if at twenty they commit a crime is not known because those files have been sealed.
Sure
It doesn't show that there's recidivism.
He can come, kill someone and and then continue with a normal life.
Exactly.
That is not fair
He turns eighteen here nothing happened
None
Here something did happen
None
I get the impression that the majority of the states are changing that and already if you are a minor
Yes. and commit an adult crime yes, they will sentence as a. Yes, I already see that is changing a lot.
Yes that's good.
Exactly. And so others see that the law doesn't protect them for being a minor
Sure, in changing the law is like that.
You see it in Philadelphia.
Changing the law is like that.  You're not simply punishing the ones who already did it; but you are also instilling more fear in the ones that are thinking about doing it.
They're giving them a warning. Exactly. Now if you want to go crazy and do something, well it will come to this.
You'll pay. Yeah.
You'll pay, because you know the repercussions of your actions and what they will be, and if I go crazy, I will wait that they find me as a crazy person
Hello
Hi. Good evening.
Hello, how are you? My name is Juan
My name is Carmen and I live in Miami. Where are you?
I am in San Antonio, Texas
Oh, Texas, pleased to meet you,yes
Yes, how do you do?
How do you do? Fine, thank you very much.
Working, washing the dishes
, I just got home eh, I'm free already, and then I thought I would have the last bite when suddenly you called AND I thought
None
If I have finished I answer, otherwise I just wait until later
Yes, right, that's alright Carmen, it's fine, I am very pleased to meet you, specially with this subject
What are you studying?
I don't study any longer, I would like to study again, but no
You study any more, sure
Maybe, next year. Are you studying?
That's great. And how is San Antonio for..? No, no, I am already an old lady. I am working
None
No I already studied all I had to study.
I didn't finish studying since some years ago
I see
Listen, I have, I have heard a lot aboiut crimes in Miami, how about that? is it true?
Yes well there is crime I mean sometimes when I listen to the news I think that there are other cities that have bigger problems
None
But I think no city, no matter how small, is free of crime.
None
Because there are all sort of crimes
I GET THE IMPRESSION THAT MOST OF THE MURDERS ARE RELATED TO
Related to drug affairs. Drugs, right? the cartels, the mafia, right? all that
I think that can be very related in some cities, there may be a very close link
Yes.
Just look ,I've been surprised lately because, at least of the little I know about the news
I see a lot of family violence.
That's important, see
Yes,the husband kills the
Yes
Sons and the wife who, for instance this morning I heard that two women appeared dead
None
They were daughter-in-law and mother in law
None
I mean that it seems one of them killed the other and then committed suicide. and it seems that it all was because of family problems, of nature, related to domestic violence
None
That really shocks me a lot. It particularly shocks me a lot because I think the basis of everything a lot of the time is loneliness, similar to how the kids are raised.
The lack of afection
Yes
Many things, right
Yes, it probably has a lot to do with the way in which the person is educated about domestic violence. They are people who, I imagine don't have a good education in dealing with the issues, right?
Yes
So then they hit each other, they hurt each other, they scream at each other and they have no rational way of getting through the problems, right
They hit the first time if one of the two people
Yes, it could be that
Doesn't solve the problem that increases
Exactly, look that here that also happens, here in San Antonio
None
The majority of the violent crimes are related to this that you say, the domestic violence.
Yes
AND ALSO WITH THE DRUGS
None
Both yes that does happen here,
Are you so close to the Mexican border?
Hundred fifty miles
That's close, right
Yes. Very close.
I won't say that you have a great influence there because probably it will be controlled like the cartels in my country, Colombia.
None
Have used all those countries in Central America and the Caribbean and South America
None
None
Pass the drug
Exactly, one way or another everybody has been affected
Yes, yes, exactly. That's what I was going to say. They are entrance doors, they are very important distribution centers of drugs, the problems between cartels, competition
Where there is a bad done business
Between them, the kind of vendettas they have among them
Yes
You can't imagine what happens if you are outside it. They fight for a shipment, rob each other, and kill each other.
You can imagine, but you never, never
So
Never realize how much violence is used, because when
None
When they give the order to kill somebody or do it is like they do it, if they were taking revenge on the person they kill
Yes exactly, they are being billed accounts
Impressing
They have their language, their language that tells for example when the person is being killing because he betrayed someone then they have a way to left a clue to show the reason of the murder, they donÂ´t have codes
Yes
No for example I donÂ´t know, they kill them and cut their tongues
Or the hands or the fingers or
Then that is a sign,
Or they kill all the family or the closest relatives, and left him alive, or the tie them. I don't know how many things they do
Yes, there's always a message, right?
Yes.
In the San Antonio case that is what more happens
None
That kind of crime must happen everywhere right?
Yes
Is nothing more than the drug which is,as bigger the city
And many
It is important the place and the fights
Yes and many young people gets involved in that kind of violence
In
Of crimes
Yes you already know that
Yes, many young people
Yes is the young people, no
That's the worst. No.
Yes almost, always are the young people
Yes, look, sorry to interrupt you, in Colombia there was a time when
And
Those people that were into the drug businesses in one way or another. What people would say is that
Forty years old was already an old age
None
For the people that were involved in those businesses
Yes
Because in one way or another he who didn't end up in jail could be considered up to a certain point lucky
None
Ended up in the cemetery
Yes, and many say I'd rather live ten good years than fifty bad ones
Yes
Look in our countries.  There aren't many jobs.  This is the only way that young people see how to make a living.
Alternatives
A good income, no, exactly, which obviously, you know, you don't usually think about when you are young
None
You live the moment many fall into it because they can't think on the long term
Sure
It is not all the short term, and also what we said a while ago, in education it is very important, in school
They don't teach you how to make long term decisions.
Right
They are the most important at that moment and you react at the moment. It has no comparison parameters
There is a saying, some are born under a lucky star and some are born seeing stars
None
Actually being born in unfavorable economic and social circumstances
It is true to a certain point, but while there are people who get over it I can't understudy why others choose the other way thinking they will solve their problems this way
None
When actually money won't solve every problem
None
Because they can get money, but the education they didn't get that they will never have
No, never
They will never have
Exactly
They won't have even when they have the pockets full of money
Yes listen and what do you think about the other thing they were asking us, do you feel safe in your community?
Yes, I think that well I've been living here in Miami a year
None
Anyways always anywhere I've lived I've been, I've been cautious.
Yes
I've taken precautions that can help one.
To avoid certain dangers
Yes exactly look that
The same in a shopping center
None
Em that's why maybe, I feel a little safer, because if I can't do it I prefer
Also is by areas, right, not because you live in Miami everything is one way, but rather that the area where you live also has its peculiarities
Exactly and the neighborhood where I'm living now is a neighborhood where the people know each other a lot then
No
That also helps, no
None
The neighbor knows if
Is a Latin neighborhood
Yes the neighborhood is Latin
None
I've only lived here for a month, but I used to live in a more diverse neighborhood.
Multiple nationalities and cultures
None
Afro Americans,we even had some cops for neighbors, so it helped
Very quiet
And another area where I lived, my very first neighbor was a cop
None
You feel really quiet, here where I live now I don't have any cop near, I don't have cop neighbors but, but the
Hello
Hello yes this is
Yes. How are you? I'm Marcos, I'm in Philadelphia
Oh very god Marcos, I'm Jorge, I'm talking from Los Angeles, California, and if you hear a strange noise it's because I'm calling from a public phone
Interesting
From the street
Okay
Why I'm at the side of a pretty busy street
None
How are you? Marcos you said, no?
Yes
How are you Marcos?
Very good, happy new year
Same to you Marco, I always ask
Thanks
I'm originally from Argentina, and you?
I grew up in Paraguay
Asuncion what a coincidence
In Asuncion exactly
Of course I know Asuncion, Paraguay. Yes, but believe me that haven't spoken with someone from Paraguay for a long time. nice to meet you, today's topic is
Nice to meet you. I think that it's crime
Crime yes, they've asked us many questions about crime, basically it's
How do you feel about where you live relating to crime?
When I say that I think about the crime in the area where I live,
Yes
Well, I'm in Los Angeles, Have you ever been to Los Angeles?
Yes no, no
In California? Never
No, I have a brother who is in San Francisco who says that Los Angeles is enormous.
Yes
Difficult to know the city because it' big
San Francisco has more characteristics
Basically a big thing scattered everywhere
Yes
It's really spread out, like this is what it has, for this it's so big
None
Basically we're talking about crime in there area where I live, basically I live in Hollywood
None
The area where I live is generally a safe area. There's always something that can happen every now and then
I calculate that it's basically like this everywhere, no
None
Like many places in general that is a sure,you have to know too that you have to take care of yourself, you must know where are you going, it is true, where do you walk
Of course to know where do not walk
Exactly And how is that, how are you are you in the?
Yes I think it is the same in all places
Are you in the city of Philadelphia?
I'm from Philadelphia but I'm in central downtown.
From Philadelphia. I have never been in Philadelphia. How, in general, do you see it there?
It is a beautiful city, but it has to do a little,a population that in general, I am not sure how to say it in Spanish or Afro-American
To do not say anyways to sound racist and nothing like that
No, I understand
There is a big there is a big yes, there are a big amount of blacks in the city
Oh is that basically most of the population?
I think that in the center of the city you donÂ´t notice so much but there are certain places of the city like the south and the west
That is very pure
And how do you see crime rate in the area where you live? Because you are in the downtown basically in the center
Yes
Not so far to the south from here begins a problem with the black race but in this section of the city there is not any problem
So there are not many problems. My sister lived here near that place, but an incident never happened. Everything was great and perfect.
There is another section of the city more to the west that lets say is more turbulent.
For my information, what is the area of that city? Because maybe in the future I will go to visit Philadelphia, I've never been there, so I'd like to know, tell me what are the areas
Yes
You should be more careful, for instance.
There is a part, basically the west side of the city, the downtown is beside the river Schuylkill River
And
What river is it?
The Schuylkill, it's an ancient Indian name, it's written
None
None
Oh, I see.
Schuylkill, the river, on the west side of the Schuylkill, for the first, I'm thinking about the name of the streets, from thirty to sixty-nine more or less
You will notice it is a tunnel, to the road, and you continue until you get out of that section before you, you slow down too much
OK
None
You said from street thirty to street sixty-nine int he west side of the city.
Right
That's the area in which you should be really careful.
And it's pretty close to downtown, which covers a few blocks--maybe ten blocks wide, the corridor
None
But apart from that, there is no problem. Unfortunately I have no way to avoid the part of the city where there are more crimes
Let's say the two more dangerous places, there is the west section, where the are people, black race people and there is, to the
East of the city south I think they call it north, but I donÂ´t know how they call it north because if you look at the map is more to the south in reality
None
That section is more Puerto Rican and  central American that part is  equivalent, basically I know some of that section
Because I speak Spanish, my parents are doctors
How good.
And my mother worked with the Puerto Rican association. In march she worked in the hospital section. In the clinic they had
I know of the neighborhood where she worked.
Yes
It is safer for her to be cared for by this woman who's a doctor than another person who isn't.
I UNDERSTAND
They take care of her but that em I donÂ´t remember anything else
It is okay in general.
I NEVER WAS A VICTIM OF CRIME
Better
I was in an accident where a drunken man crossed on the red light, about
I understand.Well I went
Besides that nothing
Basically I can say victim when I was in Buenos Aires. You have been in Buenos Aires right?
Yes, many times.
It's an experience I would recommend to nobody
None
By that time I was working of course and we basically were paid monthly
Pretty ugly. I got over already but I had just gotten off the
Yes
The bus, we call a collective in Argentina,
Yes
And
Yes, in Paraguay it's called a micro
In Asuncion it's called a micro.
Yes
It left me like six or seven blocks away, and it was late, about nine thirty at night, I was walking and suddenly
I was walking and basically I noticed nothing
None
I see somebody behind me, aiming at me with a gun.
None
Just figure, it was, it was terrible, in few words it was a very
Yes
A very traumatic situation, I mean, they took
Yes
I was working, I had two jobs, they stole everything from me and all I said was take it all, just leave me alone
Sure, sue
Was a very traumatic experience
Yes, I think that's a good word to describe it.
I was in shock for a couple of days, and , around that time I was living with my parents and I didn't want to do anything, I was very confused, I didn't want to talk to people, it was a terrible experience but thank God
Yes
The most important thing is, money comes and goes, but the most important thing is
You can't buy
Exactly
Yes
Hello!
Hello!
Hello,How are you?
Hello, this is Chris speaking.

From Mexico, like all Texans, like they say
Sorry
Like the majority of Texans
None
There are a lot here, in this area.
Yes, there are a lot. Texas. They're from Mexico. And you where are you from?
I'm from Argentina, but I'm in Philadelphia now, studying
What do you study?
I work in human reproduction.
No
I'm doing a post-doctorate in the Universtiy of Pennsylvania
Right
So I was in Houston just withe plane, once when I went to Mexico
None
I went to Mexico several times
Yes
I like it.
What towns do you know?
I know the south, mostly Chiapas, Yucatan
Yes
Up, in the north i know Monterrey
Monterrey
I was there with some friends, but no, where are you from, the DF?
From Cuernavaca, do you know Cuernavaca?
Where is that?
It's like an hour away from the DF
Yes
Yes, it's a little city
Yes
That if you look on the map, can't even see it
Sure, I think that it's under the influence of the DF, because the DF is huge, right?
No, excuse?
I say the DF is really big
YES, AND ALSO REALLY DANGEROUS
Yes, no
Yes
I hear that but I don't know if it's like that. In the DF there are many snappiness, right?
Yes, the weather is, specially this one
Sure
In the city
There are so many people
Yes, I have been there only twice, only trough, right?, no more
Sure
And besides weather, there is pollution. And you see on the news that people are stealing.
Corruption
Sure
Etc.
And have you been a long time in Houston?
Yes, I been living here for 8 years.
Eight years, I see
Yes
And, are you thinking of staying or returning to Mexico?
Well, not right now, I have no plan
Do you have family?
I don't think, to stay here, for a long time
No, neither do I.  I would like to return to Argentina at some point
Yes
That's my plan from less than a year ago
Yes
I have to work a little less than a year. I keep the hope of returning
None
Things are not that easy in our countries.
Yes, it's difficult
It's difficult, Latin America
Yes
How many calls have you made?
This is the first call.
Don't tell me.
Yes. I used contact patterns. I called, but I couldn't locate the other person and you are the first person that I'm
I'm at twenty one
Well how nice.
I'll be finished with four more
Yes
Let's see what happens
Yes
But the truth is, aside from what they pay you it's been pretty good. Because I've spoken with many people and in truth, I've liked it a lot.
Yes
I've met several people, like this. So I've found out how certain things and other places are like.
Yes. What topics did you talk about?
Many times we talked about the topic of the day. This one I didn't hear well what it was
None
But
The topic is
On
Yes ahead.
None
Yes
But people that don't, they want to go directly to the theme of the day, and we have to get to this point, right?
Yes.
For
But
For them, it's the same because they are here for linguistic studies.
Yes.
If we talk of theme, or in other words, given theme, if not for that we don't know what to talk about
Yes
In general, what's the temperature there like now?
Pardon me?
Is it cold there, more or less?
Right now, no. It's a little, not cold but not very hot.
None
That's strange, because last year it was very cold. And now it's not. In Christmas it was a little warm.
You, very hot
Not that much, but more or less
Ah, I see. Here in Pennsylvania, it's very cold.
I would imagine it must be snowing, no?
Yes, not today, but today it's very nice because it's sitting at around five degrees
None
A couple of weeks ago, we had less than eighteen degrees
None
I assure you that's cold
I can imagine
And more than anything, i mean, I'm not used to it, i come from Buenos Aires, that's, pretty warm
In this season it's neither cold or hot
Well, it's summer now in Buenos Aires, because it's
Yes
It's the Southern Hemisphere
None
But in winter, the coldest it gets, is one degree below zero
When does winter begin?
The winter, in Argentina it starts around June
Look at that, i didn't know that, i thought it was like, like in Mexico
No, it's the opposite
Like here too
It's like to the other side of the world, the same with Australia
Right
We're the south
Yes
The south of Argentina is really ugly
Yes
Yes Patagonia. Have you heard of it?
No, I don't know. What's Patagonia?
Patagonia is in the southern part of the large country of Argentina.
Yes.
Basically, and Patagonia, there's the most southern part, Boreal goes almost to the border of Antarctica.
None
It's very cold there. And so, these zones can have very low, low temperatures. But not, not the rest of the country.
And it is pretty or how is it?
ARGENTINA IS REALLY PRETTY, YES. IT'S AS PRETTY AS IT IS BIG, YOU HAVE THREE CLIMATES. LIKE, IN THE SOUTH IT'S REALLY, WITH SNOW
Mountains
Yes
The North is pretty tropical, and in the middle it's temperate. So you can choose
Where are you from, the South? The North?
I'm from the middle, where it's temperate
How nice. No?
Yes, but sometimes I would like to be a little closer to the mountains. Because Buenos Aires is on the coast, so we don't reach the mountains.
But what do you know about Argentina?
From Argentina, not a lot, I would like to go one day, but for economic reasons, I haven't been able to.
Sure. And what do you do?
I study
A study, in Houston.
Yes, I study in Houston at the university. I study economy.
None
I am on my last semester.
How nice.
To fin-yes.
How nice. And do you think you'll work for a while in the United States?
Yes, I think I'll stay here, but I'd like to go someplace else.
Sure.
Yes, I've been very bored.
What percentage of the population there in Houston is Latina?
There is much diversity.
None
There's a big percentage.
None
The good thing about Houston is that you meet people from all over the world.  There's a lot of variety.
Sure
Later you realize. Especially when you go to the Universities, Right?
Sure, a lot of variety
Yes
Sure. Yes, I can imagine
They are not like other states and other cities, people of the white race, Right?
Sure
Less Hispanics.
Less Hispanics.
Asians
I know California
Yes
Some and there's also a bunch of Hispanics.
Yes
I think, Texas and California must be the others
Yes, there are many more--Chicano, American, Mexican.
Terrible!
Yes
An incredible amount, some day it was, once it was Mexican territory, so!
Yes
Many have stayed there. They are, are Americans, because they were born in America, but one hears them, or them and they are Mexicans.
SORRY TO INTERRUPT
Yes
No, don't they disqualify the call if you don't talk about the topic?
I've been audited and they accepted stay calm
Okay.
No
I was kind of worried, but maybe not
I wanted to talk about it but others didn't.
None
Then, when you are in the page and check your status
Yes
You enter your password and you can place the states, and then, he says how many weeks you have done, and if they are valid or no
Okay
And I haven't been rejected one
You have talked about other topic besides today's one, right?
Yes, there have been days where I talked and others where I didn't
Yes
Don't worry when you have to talk with the other person
Then,
Yes, you should try
Yes
Do you like Football?
Yes
Play!
I like it.
Do you play there in Houston?
I've been playing for a year. Because it's with the school and a lot of tests, etc.
Sure
I don't have much time. I got on a team, since last year and we're in a tournament.
It was fun.
Sure
And to you?
None
You like it?
Yes, I love it. I love to see it and I love to play it, but no, I'm looking for a team here to play with.
None
Because the one I found here was full, so they didn't need players
Hello, who's speaking?
Manuel speaking, I'm in Orlando, Florida. With whom am I speaking?
Pablo is in Philadelphia.
What's up Pablo?  How are you?
What's up? A pleasure. Everything ok?
Everything's good, everything's good over here
Is it nice there in Florida
Sorry.
Is it nice in Florida.
Pretty
That's good,
He end of the year was spectacular and well, everything's good, the weather's really good
Here the contrary, cold, rain
Yes, I have family and friends there, in the north, New York all this and I know how it is.
Yes but it happens
Yes, but it's
It's fine, it's fine
Yes, the seasons are also beautiful
Yes,
Well let's start, tell me your stories first and then I'll tell you
Today's topic is the crime
Yes
I don't know. Here in the zone we were really protected. I live here with my wife
There was many security
Right
The security, the city police officers, we have from here the University of Pennsylvania, we are here in University City
Nice, yes
It was really reinforced, this topic, as many other things
Yes
Never too much, only last year, one rape. It didn't happen again, only once.
The
Nothing more happened. I feel really secure in this zone.
Here in Philadelphia, there are really heavy zones, really ugly
Yes
But, I don't know them well, so I can talk, but, some people commentaries, well, you better not to walk at night, some people think like that
Bad living and they feel insecure
None
And I see the central zone, University city and we are fine
It's fine
We're fine
I live in a safe unit.
Sure
In the whole area there's a lot of protection, in fact I regularly see that these places are patrolled by the
The police in their vehicles
None
They go to the units, look around with relative frequency
Sure,
I see that the community is also, well, it's always really ready to immediately advise or notify any anomaly that they see
Good.
Yes, now it's the same as you say, well, obviously there are areas, well that don't count on as much security
None
But in general it seems that everything works well
Yes,
But there still are very painful facts of
Yes, in general I see it well.
In fact despite the redundancy the news came this week yesterday nothing less
None
Than a person, close to here in another city. A woman actually, lost an eye, because of a stray bullet, on New Years Day, no
New Years eve
Yes, a disaster.
What a disgrace, nobody knows antthing about it, she was at home sitting with her family, when she suddenly felt something in the eye.
The last thing I know is that she has a bullet embedded
No, incredible.
It is quite unusual, even more around here where nothing ever happens, that people start shooting in the New Year, look what things happen nowadays, right?
Something like this also happened here, last year or two years ago, and a girl was killed the same way.
None
A lost bullet
I guess
The father was walking with the girl behind him
Was it also in New Year's day?
No,
It was a regular day, yes
The similarity is for the lost bullet
Yes, yes
Also, nobody knows nothing, nobody remembers nothing because it was a lost bullet, disgrace
Well another subject we can talk about, not because we are living or suffering it, is gangs
None
It's obvious and no one can deny that big cities, specially, have a gangs problem
Yes
Unfortunately that is almost always attributable to minorities
Yes
In many cases children of immigrants
Yes.
There's not a lot of, to note, but I respect that you don't know all the details of all these things
But unfortunately, all of this involves a big decomposition of many houses of many families
Sure
Little kids who swim in the street from when they're really little.
It's a big disaster
And it's, it's logical that they will end up in things, in hands of those who are, of their friends
Sure, Yes
Yes, you know that this is in New York in Los Angeles, in the big cities there's this
In the big cities yes, the truth is in Philadelphia I don't know anything about this gang topic
People who apparently seen like they were, living badly but not in a group, in, in gangs
Believe me that I, at least with my personal security, the fact of walking on the street and all this, I feel really good, really protected
In exchange I don't feel really protected when it comes to cyber crime
None
Believe me that one time they tried to cheat me, or in fact there appeared a charge on my credit card
Yes
You know that
It's also a topic that showed up.
It's better since the problem was resolved in my favor.
It's like they didn't stop enough balls
Yes, we also have a girl friend who something happened to her like this, they took her credit card I don't know how much
Yes, they had invented a charge, but, well
It seems like they're completely mafia
No
Yes, they're completely mafia and there are people who are getting a lot of money from this
Yes Sure
Identity robbers are connected to this situation. Why is there so much identity theft when there is such advanced technology?
More now with all this campaign that started after nine eleven
Yes
And there's much vigilance, but it hasn't stopped with these people because it's not a person, it's bands
They're organizations, no
Yes, international criminal organizations, and if you don't know anything they say or show, they see this organization disrupted by the traffic documents
Nothing ever happens, no
The most I've seen is that they disrupt these bands of pedophiles or who exchange documents child pornography or something that I've seen but
Yes, I avoid this too.
But, but they break up bands dedicated to stealing identity or scamming the internet, I haven't seen
I haven't seen any scams.
We also have to add today's topic because it's also crime.
Sure
It cost money.
How does it look for you, sure, if with respect, and after the topics, yes, it seems that they were exaggerating
In the television, it was positive to see that much
Okay
I thought that the cases played on TV were really positive.
Some people get sick, it really frights them
I agree with you, obviously, it must not be the only topic, Many media seems to do that
Yes
To look and re look for everything with blood in it. I don't think we can reach that extreme, but it's important to keep us informed about things
They are all media that want to hurt you, highlighting the horrible news.
Yes, only that
No. I don't think that kind of press is the best. It's good to be informed about the things that happen in your country and
In general, because you can aisle yourself and you can close you eyes and try to escape from that
Everything that is happening
That is no right and I know some people like that, That never watches TV news and never reads a newspaper
I also think that's ridiculous
None
That's not good.
Sure
Regrettably with so much tragedy, I hope that no
Yes, there are people that close themselves in their
That think got disconnected that's it and solved their problem, no
In their underworld, yes it hurts them, and if they don't want to see it, they directly disconnect. Many people are like that.
Don't read the newpaper. Don't watch tv. That's how life goes for them. They live in their house.
But there are people that don't need it I had a friend that at one time was depressed
And the psychiatrist himself would prohibit her, would advise her not to watch television because if you are not very prepared, if you are not
In those cases, it seems right
There are people that are very sensitive, there are people  that have depression but there are people that are very sensitive and that if the whole day that's happening to them
Oh, no
It hurts them and cannot walk straight
That already seems like a punishment. I can put up with it for half an hour or an hour but
The whole day, that would be a total punishment.
Yes.
It's a torture
Sure
In life, you have to do a little bit of everything
None
And I'm eh one of the eh ah few people that can say that was able to see eh the ah Eiffel Tower and also the Taj Mahal the same day.
No, I am working a little and I am studying a little English, more than anything, the one who is studying is my wife. She is doing her post-doc here in
Yes
Here in Penn University and I'm here with her
Oh nice
It's more than her, and the principal is that she finish her post doctoral, and sometimes
Work a little bit and the time goes by and you?, are you working there?, or Studying?
Sure, I'm here working. I also live in New York
I SEE
Unfortunately, the cold kicked me out and the doctor recommended I find a hotter weather.
None
For my allergy problems and all that, those where terrible
The cold and the weather, it's really
And the cold, it's hard. I had to take that decision and stay in the city I really loved.
Well, it's a really awesome social laboratory.
Social lab
Many things to do, a really nice cultural life
Really nice
I don't complain, the weather is really harmless
Yes
Obviously the city is much small and there are not many things to do
Yes
Good evening.
Hello, my name's Yolanda.
Carlos.
Carols. And where are you calling from Carlos? From Houston, I'm speaking from Fort Worth, Texas
Okay, just next to here.
How are you today, this afternoon, night?
And you?
Very well, thanks, have you been in the study very long?
Yes, I've been in this since October.
Yes, that's when I started, too. What's the topic on crime?
Yes. Sometimes it heats too much, and other times it heats too little.
There in Houston there's a lot of this. Right?
I suppose so. Like, I really, I've been living here for five and a half years
None
Really nothing, I've never had any problem, thank god.
None
I understand that, yes, it seems that in the last few years crime has been pretty stable and if anything perhaps it's gone down.
I've heard that in the last months it's gone down considerably
Yes
And many attribute it to the refugees after the hurricane.
Yes.
None
That's what I've been told. I have relatives that live there in Houston, and in San Antonio and well, here in our area, in
In Dallas Fort Worth too, we get a lot of the people that went through all that, and yes, there are many.
Situations where, the conditions of the stores that there have been more robberies and more
Like having more stealing. That I know, but I don't know about anything else, like slaughters
Have you had, have you had any problem in the past?
Some stores have suffered. How do you say? Burglary
Yes, we're
They have robbed them and,
When i was thirteen
Right
When i lived in Puerto Rico
Right
Someone came up to me and, i had a, i had a golden necklace
Right
They gave me like a, they just, the, the, he grabbed it from my neck
Wow at thirteen years old
Yes, i don't, i don't know, i mean, that's the only, the only experience I've had
Right
For me, always, I think that, having that experience, it prepared me, emotionally I guess
Yes
I don't know if I had something that good.
No
I feel that if at some point someone would try to mug me, I would fight back.
More or less
It will not be the best in the situation.
Yes
I don't know, I feel that I would try to fight back
Yes
In the situation
Yes
None
I think that I understand the situation,  yes it's him
But
Near, maybe, of getting help, or if they have me cornered and maybe, according to the situation, I think, because I
It's hard to say what you would do, in those circumstances. But O would like to fight back, those are my things, and I have worked so hard to get them, to have
I think that maybe for me you should have an idea of
The things you can do about it
Yes
It sounds bad saying it, but there are occassions in which a person deserves to be robbed because
None
Many times, I see women that are walking and they have a big purse, and in that purse, one sees that she has money there.
That she's showing she has money there.
None
That's like an invitation up to a certain point that
Yes. One has to use their head, I say. One has to be wise,
Exactly.
Put away. When I go to a big city and need to walk around, I put my bag under a jacket or I carry it closed to me.
I just carry it, because I've traveled in many countries, and it is something that tourists throw away their
When they bring bags, they are careless, they sit to seat and leave them outside.
The cafes that they have outside, and they leave the bags and packages
People steal computers
Yes
I don't understand if one is going to be in a place, in a shopping center  and has a laptop
None
Why is no one going to leave the laptop in the car completely visible
Yes
Yes, with my job, I constantly have a computer with me unless I know that I'm going to be some place.
If I have to leave it in the car but I always cover it. I always have a shirt or sweater something.
Yes, something to cover it, yes
That is going to cover it
None
No, I never leave anything within sight
Yes
I don't know
Yes, figure, once I bought a car, it was a car that had been converted from gasoline to diesel
The engine
None
And we had troubles with the, how do you say repairs? it damaged often. I lived in Florida by that time. And, I there were,
How can I tell you? There were a lot of car stealing in that area, with all the tourist and everything. And I left my car, it was a Cadillac, in eighty-four or
Yes
Eighty-five. And I left it with the keys in, open, because I wanted it to be robed in order to be paid the insurance, and
They never robed it
It depends a lot on the area where you live.
Yes
I live in the Medical Centre, I work in the Medical Centre, here in Houston
None
And, well, I have never, thank god, I have never had any problem
None
The differences, the same apartment complex where I live now, there have been some robberies in the past
I see
In other apartments I have lived in there have been some robberies.
Yes
I don't know how it's promoted, to rob a car instead of
Yes
I have been lucky and it haven't happened nothing at all, But I never leave something visible in the car
Sure
Always, when I'm walking, I'm 28 years old and I'm a little big and I don't look really friendly
Yes
It won't be so easy, for a thief to rob me
Sure
In comparison. trying to rob a woman or a skinny man, without so
Many muscle, like that
Yes I see.
I think that when  I walk at night,  I always see some people
They are always, well, I have high sight
Yes
I always look people in the eyes
Yes
I think confidence is one of the things that you have to learn.
Yes, this important, yes.
But,
Yes, a woman has to be alert to everything that is around her. If you park in dark places, and
Only, well, you're asking for problems, because
Exactly
You have to be wise in the society that we live in now because it's not very safe.
There are many people who
Yes.
Don't have good thoughts. Yes, are you from Puerto Rico?
Yes.
Oh, very good.  Do you have five and a half years?
Ah, almost six years.
Six years. And do you have family, or you came to Houston from, from pointing to the map, or how did you come to live there.
I came for work. I work in the Medical Center here in Houston.
I had an aunt who was there in the Medical Center. What's it called?
There are many hospitals there, I don't even remember
Exactly.
She was serious and I spent time in Houston with her. She is better
And was it a serious experience? Everything turned out okay. Yes. And you worked in the hospital?
I am enrolled in Medical School studying medicine.
Okay yes, Very good. yes.
And so, you have time to
How did you know about this study?
Sorry.
How did you know about this study?
One of my friends, she told me and I, since I
None
I always talk to her on the telephone and since she, What are you doing? And,
YES VERY INTERESTING
One day she tells me how this person I'm talking to, apparently, she didn't like the opinion of
Yes, hello
Hello, Good Evening
None
Fine, thanks. Who am I speaking with?
My name is Fernanda.
Fernanda, how are you?  With George, from New York.
George.
Yes
From?
Yes what no What are you saying?
Where are you from?
Im Colombian.
You live in New York?
Yes, where are you from?
Me too
You live in New York too?
Yes, in Brooklyn.
Yes, where are you from?
I'm Mexican.
Mexican, well, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
What do you think of today's subject?
I feel that if this works, there's not a lot of crime.  But I think that, where I come from and I think where you come from too, there is.
No?
Relatively.
I've never been in a, thank God, I've never experienced (sic), I've never had a bad experience.
No.
But my sister has, in Mexico.
Yea?
Yea there it's all like that, you
Really? Yes, the doctor.
It's all really dangerous.
Yes, I've been reading books about immigrants, and Mexico's pretty dangerous, right?
Really dangerous. There's so much inequality
Yea.
That people aren't happy.
Yes that's why there's so much crime too.
But, it
BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE SITUATION HERE? WELL, I THINK IT'S ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE HERE. I DON'T KNOW. RIGHT? I MEAN, WHAT'S YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD LIKE? IS YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD SAFE? DO YOU FEEL SAFE?
Where I'm at it's safe.
Can you arrive at any time?
I can arrive at any time. The later it is, the less people there are in the street.
Yes, but, but is safe.
I feel safe. Totally.
And, in the train, or, what do you use, the train, or the bus, or what?
Generally, I'm in the train.
Yes.
And, I walk a lot. But, I feel very safe,  yes I do arrive alone also. I mean, also
Really. How good.
I know the places I go to, the neighborhoods are safe. But, there are very bad areas in New York.
Yes, and what do you think of the parks, of the green areas, where there's
What?
Of the parks or very isolated areas
Well, I don't go to the park, really. I think that there it's more dangerous, right?
You don't go because you think is safer. Right?
I've never thought that a park is safe.
Yes.
I don't think so
Yes, because, well, here, It shocks me a lot, especially the rapes, and murders of, of women by themselves, especially the women that like to go out and run. Right?
To the parks.
None
No matter how safe a city is, I think a park is always unsafe to be there by yourself.
It will depend on the size of the park but if it is a big park then yes.
None
And it's always been known right? that it is unsafe.
I think that yes, because, I think is the opportunity for anyone who wants to do something. Right?
Yes, he goes to a park and waits there.
Yes. But, I don't trust Central Park and, sometimes I pass at ten, eleven at night, that I've passed by
I see people,running in car or something
Do you live in Manhattan?
I don't know how, yes, I live in Manhattan.
None
I live like five minutes, like two minutes from Central Park But, yes, I don't know how people go out to jog.
None
I live by the edge of Manhattan, by the road that and also, I see people late at night alone, walking, running. I don't feel safe.
None
Especially a woman, right? I think doesn't feel safe.
How long have you been living here?
More than five years.
Five
How many do you have?
Okay. Me seven.
Seven years? And what do you do?
I make music.
None
Music.
Yes
Yes, You?
What?
What do you do?
I can't hear you well.
Okay.
That you do what?
What do you do?
I couldn't understand you. What do you do?
I make music.
Music. But what type of music, you dance, you sing, or what?
I produce and compose.
Really? Interesting, I work as a systems engineer, and work with
Pardon? I didn't understand you.
I am a systems engineer and computer programmer.
Okay. Okay.
I work with tax sites on the internet.
Okay.
I'm a designer and a programmer. What kind of music do you do?
Popular music, pop music.
Yes.
Different genres, but everything within pop.
Within pop?
Yes.
That's interesting. Have you recorded or bought it from others?
This, well, both, I did things myself, and I've done things for
Yes?
None
None
Yes, a lot of little things.
Really interesting. Good.
But,
But what?
But getting back to the topic
But coming back to the topic of security,
IN COLOMBIA, YOU NEVER FELT LESS SAFE THAN HERE?
Yes. Obviously it's not with the prevention, for example, that they steal a car. There they steal many cars.
I had to be aware. One of the closed windows, at the stop light, they break the glass and they take your wallet.
None
These kinds of  going around with jewelry. Or fashion. Here, I go with jewelry calmly, there's no problem. And there are people who tell me, be careful in
Certain parts. No?  I don't know, they don't trust much.
None
The truth after a year of two, you feel relaxed, like you don't have this prevention
In Columbia, it depends on the city, no?
None
You don't have, a bank, if you go to a bank, you have to have miles of precautions.
None
Yes, I think they are stealing less here than there. There, someone takes out five to ten million pesos.
That this, here, like a thousand and something dollars, two thousand, three thousand dollars.
None
There are people who follow you from the bank. They follow you and, are willing to kill to steal that money.
None
So, yes, this is true, here you feel more safe. But, really, New York,  for people, there are people from everywhere.
I haven't been witness, really, to anything. But I've heard, for example, people on the train who are sleeping or distracted, they steal the
The suitase, or the
None
The MP3s, or whatever.
None
No, let's say that no one will, like in other countries. But if there is an opportunity, they steal it, right?
Yes.
Knowing about robberies, no? I didn't know about these kinds of things no?
I only know one person who has been robbed here.
Yes, how did they steal from him?
Well, there in the street, in a really empty zone,
And in what part?
In Brooklyn,
Wow.
It was a night and it was raining
Yes.
And they just took his wallet.
They showed a fi-
In Mexico, I know many people who have been robbed, who they've kidnapped, who they've,
None.
This doesn't happen here
The situation in Mexico is worse than in Colombia as far as kidnapping and all those types of things
None
In Colombia, if you have money, you have to be careful. Here that doesn't exist as much.
Yes, it doesn't exits.
Here, I'm more afraid of being robbed by the lawyers, the ones that do administration, of paperwork supervision, when one goes to do a mortgage
I think there's more risk that they rob one,
None
Here there's a lot of fraud. For example, there's a lot of frauds, right? Especially the Latins
Jeez, a lot.
There's a lot of fraud against the Latins in selling products  especially they take advantage of the people with the issue of immigration
Yes.
Yes, I think that here
Here I think that they try to get money from everyone in whichever way.
None
Yes, exactly
I've been amazed, at the insecurity in that sense.
None
What do you think of the insecurity with e-mails through the internet?
I haven't had any experience. I don't know anyone who's had anything happen to them.
Yes. I do receive them, often
You have to know more.
Yes, they come to me every now and then. You're convinced they're coming from the bank
None
None
Someone here from menso, who gives all the data, you also don't see as
There are sites that are so similar you are confident they will be trustworthy.
I think that it's a lot about the person.
Yes, but
If you're with a bank, you know what the bank page is, No?
Yes but, no. If you get a message asking for tour bank password, there are a lot of things.
Yes.
For example, I live in a neighborhood, I, okay, speaking again about security in the, in the area.
But, well, yes.
I live in Harlem.
None
You mention Harlem to a lot of people and a lot of people say, ugh, this is dangerous. Because Harlem, yes, Harlem was very dangerous a few years ago.
None
Very dangerous. But, not today, well, there are people, you see them in the street
It's not dangerous, no. It's a very safe district during the day.
None
The people that dont know or dont live here ,when i tell them that i live in such an area they ask if its unsafe
None
Then, for example,  that's my experience. And, up to now I haven't had any problem. Now, I have known, for example, in the Bronx, some friends, they broke into the apartment.
Some friends that what?
They robbed them in the apartment and they stole their bike, cameras.
There in Harlem?
No, in the Bronx.
That the Bronx is more
Yes, in the Bronx, that happened to some friends. And, it appears that yes there are in several, in several buildings, there are areas where
Apartments, and
Hello.
Hello.
Hello, who's speaking? Maria here.
I'm Leticia.
I cannot believe you. I was so happy, silly Leticia told me
Maria, from
Well, no, hey, I have been calling for three hours, calling and calling.
Really?
Yes, I got mad. they leave me, Paula lifts the tube, calls and gets connected, and me?
Yes?
I was evicted.
I have been waiting for them to connect me for about twenty minutes
Look.
Fifteen at least
What, you press the one again, like that?
Yes, a bunch of times.
I don't have a lot of patience. The second time I press the 1, I hang up and leave.
I stay doing something else. My husband is watching the television. Like that, with the phone there.
Well it was
Until they connected him, I told them to hold it.
I get bored because I don't have a cordless one.
It is not cordless, but I swear that there are moments that I would like to have a microphone.
A hand free.
Yes, or a hands-free or a headphone?
But those are super cheap, I think, for the cellular.
Yes  I'm not talking about the cellular
You're talking about the fixed one.
Though right now I could, because after nine I could
If you call more than once, it doesn't count as a different phone, right?
No
It's not in your best interest.
None
I get on the telephone, when it connects
Do you feel safe in the community?
Yes, the community in Philadelphia
Yes,
The truth is that I think about Philadelphia must be true. The fame that it has, it's not safe.
The other places in the United States.
To other places.
I don't know, at least, from what I see, I don't know if there are other cities that have an urban, well, by there, the most
Big like Los Angeles and all this but
These places should be half
New York, all the biggest ones, because after it seems like cities that don't have a dangerous zone like you see here
That scare you, no?
Yes, and now, here, West Philly, when, now that the students aren't here this week it's a little bit better, but last week, I went to the gym
Yes.
I came back at eight at night
Yes.
I was scared at times and that on the face
Really?
Yesterday someone confronted me, nothing, the kind, look, it was a crazy guy, he wanted to know if I'd seen his cat
Yes, but, seeing how much they scare you for tiny things
Yes, no?
And, what do I know.
Things happen, I don't know if at this height, but West Philly.
Yes and no, they happen after the fifty
Yes.
Yes, after the fifty there's bullets.
Yes from what I know, and, and South Philly when you come from the airport you want to die, also, the places
The area around the zoo too.
Yes, Philadelphia is nice, but Center City is nothing more.
Sure
We won't count the rest.
The field, walking in the field is really nice, and everything's rich
The field, yes, obvious, but don't go there anymore
No, the center and the upper center, at this height let's say
Yes.
Between Market and the South, it's nice
None
Philadelphia isn't that great
No
Now, the more you see
At all
The less you like
Yes, no. But what can you do?
That's what we have to talk about, what can you do? This Penn
Has its advantages.
Yes, it doesn't have its wave, I like the wave of the city too
Yes the center is good, but if you go to the outskirts you want to die.
Yes, it's a topic, after there are the other outskirts, the other outskirts are getting good
Yes, the others are good, but
You go to the bars like type King of Prussia those bars are
Yes, but I already don't know if it's Philadelphia that
Really good. Ramos Mejias, those places, that is not capital
That's not the Capital, Lomos de Samora and Ramos Mejia is not Capital, but
Not Capital, San Isidro, Martinez
Yes, they're the surroundings but I compare that more with
Sure.
With the surroundings nearby here, I don't know
It is put where he works, but really far, Paolia.
How is it there, was it pretty?
Is very pretty. See that it's very pretty.
I saw it on the map the other day. I was looking at the map and, and I saw it, because I had no idea where it was
I have no idea by where
Is would be kind of like northeast, I think from what I saw
None
None
To the west, passing Brindmore, where Marcela and Mario lived,
Is like diagonal
Yes.
It's good there? yes
And they say how nice, it's crazy, things that the nice people, driving nice cars, nothing to do with West Philly
Yes, I imagine, the other truth.
The two faces of Philadelphia
Yes, I swear that we went to our friendsÂ´ placem there in
Yes.
Sure, they live in a condominium that has a pool, like Mario's.
Yes.
Mario's is the same but good, it has a pool.
A jacuzzi
No.
After a place where we spent Christmas
Yes.
It's a living room, but you don't know how nicely decorated.
Like a common
Yes, it doesn't have a barbecue, it's like a
Sure.
A tent
Yes.
It's better than our apartment
Yes, where my friend who lives in Boston has this, yes
Yes.
It's amazing
With a redone kitchen, she has a good, one of those big televisions
And pays the same as you, able
They pay a thousand dollars and they live in two environments in, no, two houses where she's really happy
And because it's smaller she can, no? San Diego is expensive, what I told Mariana, my friend's Dad, she had to go to the suburbs, what they call Paolia there.
Yes.
They pay a thousand for an apartment and according to her it's minimal
None
Yes, no, not even a pool or anything. The only thing they have is parking, but, without a roof or anything.
Sure, what happens is that Davis is a little town
Sure.
It's like living in the suburbs, nothing more than
You're going to live there,in any little town close by, it's another thing.
Yes, obviously, yes.
Believe that where Lucero worked, that's a little town, I don't remember the name
Wilmington
You go there and you're ableo
Yes.
The rent but there goes half
Yes, just like that. yes.
None
What happened is, seeing this, that we said how good
Yes.
Sure, because it's barbaric, but like, what happens is that here to go to a place you can, but you have to travel
And yes, then, after if you come to work at Penn, the parking costs you a ton
Yes, no?
And yes it's for parking
Sure.
It comes to...I don't remember how much it was
Two hundred? No. How much?
If you pay all at one, it is seven hundred dollars.
Seven hundred a year.
A year.  But if you pay by the month, it's another price
None
The deal is if you go, I don't know, when you start the school year, in September, you pay seven hundred mangos
Yes.
None
And it hurts a lot.
Yes, all together.
Yes.
What, do I know, it's like everything if one has been here to stay, you take it as one more expense and what do I know, the last one you save from rent
Yes renting is the minimum but it's a bunch of disadvantages
Yes.
Maybe rent turns out to be the same, but you live in a much better place.
Yes, or maybe a-, it's less, what do I know.
Yes.
What happens is that those things you realize with time, when you end up finding out it's like it's not worth it to move I imagine
It's not long before you leave, what do I know.
The truth is that I don't know, all the same I'm not completely convinced because it bugs me to travel, I don't know
It's hard. On the morning, above all, you have to wake up an hour earlier to get there at the same time you used to arrive
Yes.
The day ends at six here, but you arrive at your house at seven
Yes, it doesn't seem it closes
Yes.
A-, the truth is that
Marcela, every day she had to take the train and then she had to take the
Yes.
Every day of your life, it bothers me already to do it to go to some place in particular
What I hated about Buenos Aires is here is well
Sure
Because, I don't know, maybe you are not so used to it, but I, since, all the university was like train and subway
I lived in a place that is not very well communicated, so I had
Forty-five minutes on 'bondi'
None
It was one single 'bondi', the problem is that it gave many turns, it was not far actually, by car it would take ten minutes
Really?
The car was a good option because you can park anywhere without paying.
Sure
And the Mard del Plata is not that big either,  you do a pair of turns and you find a place to park, for sure
Yes. No, if, to me, that is what I hated there, travelling
Sure, in Buenos Aires of course, when I, the little time I worked in Buenos Aires, I had to catch a train and a 'bondi' every day
Yes.
It was fast, I got there in twenty minutes, but I had to catch the two
Yes
Yes
I could get there in forty-five, but I had to catch two of them.
None
The average was forty-five when everything turned out right
Yes, it was a piquet
Yes, no, The truth is that, it would annoy me travel
I really like that, getting up and 5 minutes later I'm in the faculty walking
Yes I understand
It's really comfortable
No, you are really close
It is really comfortable, but you have to be on that side.
Yes, and it has its advantages and its disadvantages
Yes, you know what?, At night it's really ugly and when you want to go eat out, there, you have like 80 options, here it's
Three or four options, to see the most attractive.
Yes.
Going downtown annoys you, I mean taking the bus to go downtown
Going to eat, only
None
You probably used, it's the Penn Bus
Yes
It's free
Yes
And drives in front of your house
Yes, now Paulo, today took, did you see Lucy?
Yes.
For
That's from Penn also.
Sure to come home, because he went by train and returns by train
Yes
When going he went to take the Lucy coming back
Yes, because that's free, it's really good.
Really good. It's incredible. You save two sixty per day
Hello?
Hello, yes, this is Jorge calling from Los Angeles, California.
How are you? I'm Leticia, I'm calling from Philadelphia.
Philadelphia, and you're originally from Argentina.
Yes.
Me too. How are you Leticia?
You are also Argentinian?
I'm from Argentina also, yes
Oh, but you don't have the Argentinian accent.
It doesn't seem like it because you still haven't talked me for a good while. I think that i have a lot, but what happens is that I have
I left Argentina twenty years ago.
It's been twenty years since you left Argentina?
Exactly.
None
None
Sure.
And I've never returned, I mean eighty six,
But you're from Buenos Aires? Right
Nineteen years. Yes, I'm from Buenos Aires.
Because in any case you have the Argentinian accent but from the interior, not from Buenos Aires.
I don't have an accent of a person from Buenos Aires.
How funny. no.
I was born and raised in Lanuz west.
Look at that.
Do you remember that neighborhood?
Yes.
Valentin Alsina. you do remember?
I admit my arrival here was too long ago.
You haven't been in Philadelphia long?
It's been eight months.
What neighborhood in Buenos Aires are you from?
I am from Villa Ballester.
Yes, i like it.
Also from the urban Con.
Yes. I'm glad, I remember. I lived for a while in Florida
It's very near, yes.
In Florida, I was going to a school there in San Martin avenue yes, sure, sure, how am I not going to remember
Has it been a long time since you returned to Argentina?
Since I left in March of '86 I have never gone back
No.
No, I haven't returned so you have a fresher information about the breakups, That has
That's nice, it's crazy, right? that you haven't returned to Argentina, that's why you don't have the accent
None
You are influenced by Central America
It seems that I stayed in several places South America, in central america for a year, basically in Mexico
None
None
That's why our accent is very mixed.
Yes.
We don't use the fijate.
Did I said fijate?
Yes
I forgot.
That's typical Mexican
Yes.  After a year to get credit from this talk today.
I would like to keep talking to you.
We have to talk about the topic
But, apparently, to get credit. If not, we take the risk of not getting
Yes, you're right
The credit, for this, 12 minutes
Yes, well with respect to couples, lets see I think that, what you suggested in the proposal if it is easier to break up when you are younger, I think so
So
Good.
I think so.
Yes, I suppose.
Because, it looks to me that when you are younger, you donÂ´t have so much ties with the other person, right? and I suppose too that it depends too of the time that you have, that you have with the person, right?
I agree with you, I suppose that ah to break up is never  an easy thing.
No.
No, starting at that
No.
To break up is never an easy thing, but it depends on the situation. Sometimes, there is another solution other than breaking up, right?
Yes, it is logical.
Sometimes in a couple, a person loves the other, but love is not enough.  There are people that love each other
Yes.
But besides everything, they have a lot of things that don't complement that they don't work as a couple
Yes, or they hurt themselves
Exactly
Right? in any other aspect.
If it is possibly better for them to break up in that situation, maybe they could be friends.
When things don't work and that is all.
None
Oh my god. There are subjects we must discuss for twelve minutes.
None
They are looking for a subject
Yes,no?
Yes, yes.
Sometimes I don't even know what to say.
No, have you been taking these calls for a long time? Did you start
This must be the tenth.
This is my fifteenth
None
Sixteen, more or less.
Yes, how did you get involved in this conversation?
I found the information on the computer.
In a website
In website, yes.
A survey website
That's right, what did you say?
In a survey
Something like that, yes
Yes, because I ask everyone, and I'm intrigued about how people finds out
It's when you...
Because we are in Pennsylvania, and I work in the in the University of Pennsylvania, where this study is being done
None
And
Really?,you work in that U...this is the first time, I haven't got that before, You work in the University of Pennsylvania, where this study is being done?
No, no, sorry, I'm not related with this study at all
You work in the University of Pennsylvania?
I work in the University
One of the university's department is making this study
None
Look, yes, it's
The page says its from the University.
It's from the University of Pennsylvania
Sure
Exactly, look, that's interesting
So, that's
None
But then, I'm intrigued how people from other states find out
Yes, it's like
Sure.
You are the fourth Argentinian that I've talked to.
Yes?
I talked with an Argentinian from Vancouver, Canada, with another from Toronto.
None
A girl in Boston and you
You don't remember what she was called? Because I think she's my friend.
Leticia, no
No, I'm Leticia.
No, Leticia no, in Boston it's Tamara.
Tamara?
Tamara in Boston.
Yes, I know her.
Are you sure that it's her?
Yes, I know who she is.
I don't know, she's Tamara, she's just came.
From Israel.
Yes.
Yes, it's her.
Wow, look how small the world is
I know her personally.
Look how nice,  just getting with your partner
Yes.
She's from Israel, and she's working in the area of veterinary.
Yes I know her.
Look how small the world is.
Yes. She's a friend of my friend who lives in Boston.
Perfect. Speaking a little more on the couple.
And how is it in LA, with couples? There's a lot, it's very
Couples in Los Angeles
Yes.
I don't think the city really influences society and culture.
Yes.
California is basically a very liberal state
Sure, it's famous, yes.
You know? It's basically very liberal everywhere in the world, from Canada to the Falkland Islands.
Yes.
What I want to say is that this thing has, where you are apparently has the reputation of being a little more conservative on a lot of things
Yes.
In California, the relationship of a couple can influence the sociocultural aspect
Yes
My cousin from Argentina, that is in
Yes
Visiting
None
He says that people generally does not get married in Argentina
Yes, it's true
I think it is really expensive to live with a marriage.
They make other arrangements as a couple.
Yes, concubinage
Exactly, you know that better because it have been 8 months since you arrived
Sure
And you know more how the Argentinian reality is. I got out of there 19 years ago. Do you understand what I tell you?
Sure
But it's true, isn't it?
Yes, it's true
Because, besides the fact that getting married by law can give the couple more flexibility
Sure
They are not tied to any social norm and all the problems tied with divorce
Yes
If people get along then they live together. I don't, I respect both points of view
It's alright to me.
Yes
I have no problem, but, I don't know, what do you think? from the Argentinean reality? you who came eight months ago
No, yes it's true  there is a great tendency not to get married to just live together and on one side I think it is because of the economical situation on the other side it is
Because of the compromise matter, right?
Right
Otherwise, many people feel somehow tied up to the the other person and have the theory that
Not getting married, they have the faculty of choosing, everyday, that person. While if you get married you have her chosen already.
Although you may regret it, I mean it's harder
You who have just arrived  not getting married these kind of couple realtionship
Are they more common nowadays, right? in the Argentinean society?
Yes
So you can find it among your friends, you know people there who don't marry right?
Yes, or ,many people who just live together for a while, and then get married
That's alright
At that moment, maybe lot of them decide to get married when they have children.
Hello?
My name is Ramon from Los Angeles.
How are you? My name is Maria Ines from Philadelphia, yes
None
And where are you originally?
From Los Angeles, yes.
You were born there, and are you American?
Yes, I'm Chicano

I have been here for a short time, a year or less
A year here in the United States
None
Really nice, the topic is Couple behavior
Yes
What is your opinion?
And I don't know my opinion.  the questions that they made, I think it depends a lot on every couple and every person, I don't think, that it's something about age or
I don't know, I think that
Yes. Do you have a boyfriend now? Or
Yes, I am married.
I'm not married. I have a girlfriend now
And?
For two years.  There's the possibility that there's a future, a marriage, but she lives thirty miles from me.
None
In San Pedro.  I live in Los Angeles and it's difficult to have contact with her because I can visit her three days out of the week.
She cannot visit me here because she has a
Yes.
A problem with her kidneys
She can't travel much.
For this reason. Yes.
None
That's my situation now.
All the same. If you see each other three times a week it's a lot.
And what
No? Ah, yeah.
Now it's enough for the growth of the relationship, I think that we need more
More time.
More contact, more time and
And possibilities of going to San Pedro
She doesn't want to. I'm stuck in the middle and I want something new for me.
And I'm
None
Trying to increase my contacts in the legal world
Sure.
Legal disputes.
None
And that' why, I need, to he here in Los Angeles and, downtown Los Angeles and she's like
In the South of Los Angeles.
It's still part of Los Angeles which is a huge city, yes?
Yes, it's huge, five hundred square miles.
None
So, it's like three or four States in this area.
There are a lot of people who live here.
How many years?
How many?
On the city I think it's three point three million.
None
I think about twelve million.
None
Philadelphia is three million.
Yes. I think that in total they're three or four million but I'm not sure. As big as Los Angeles, I'm sure.
How many years have you been married?
It's going to be three years soon.
Oh, three years.
Yes, January 11
None
Yes, we got married in Argentina, and after a year, we came over here
None
It's been a year that we've been here and we will stay a couple more years.  It's not definite us staying here.
We honestly like it.
Yes
Yes.
What type of work do you do?
And I studied Biology in Argentina.
None
I came here to do what's called the post - doctorate , which is a job in a laboratory for a couple of years.
None
My husband is a photographer but now he is working on whatever he finds.
None
He's working, at this moment he's cleaning offices in the suburbs
None
About an hour from here
What kind of photography is his specialty?
He likes to take artistic the best
None
Landscapes, and yes, I donâ€™t know black and white, that kind of thing
None
He has also taken from socials, like of baptisms, of weddings.
Yes.
Let's say that
Here in Los Angeles, Photography is very popular.
Yes? Like a hobby?
Yes , for example I have an invitation to one in Beverly Hills.
Like to go to photographer exhibit.
And exhibit.
People like his photographs in color.
None
And, perhaps that is like art I can't exactly describe directly
Here in Los Angeles, for the reason of the movie industry also
Ok, sure
It is very popular here for that reason, but I think that in New York city it is more
Yes.
Popular.
I think so. I haven't really seen much here.
None
He didn't speak English well when he arrived.
None
No, he couldn't find work for that photographer, because all asked him to speak English, and he's studying.
Yes
But until next year I figure that he won't be able to find a job.
None
And on the artistic side I haven't seen much. There's a lot of art in Philadelphia, but photography specifically, the truth is no
Yes you have a museum of art
We haven't seen many
That's extraordinary like the Philadelphia Museum of Art
It's beautiful, I went. I went twice and still didn't finish seeing it all. It's enormous.
Yes
It has everything,the famous painters were fron there
Yes
The truth is impressive.
Right
It's very cute. And then there's another one. That's the Rodin Museum, a whole museum, very small with all the work. It's good.
Right
With the movement of expensive art around in various museum, a narrow minded thinker in the art world is cute.
I haven't gone there because, because it hurts a little to spend that much money, but there's opera, there's Ballet and Choirs and Symphonies
Right
There's a lot of cultural mobility
Yes, I worked her in Philadelphia for two years.
None
Two years. I'm a mediator, I work with unions.
None
A union of my work in Philadelphia was to organize a union against
None
Like other syndicates
Competition
Yes, competitions. So, every time they needed workers for another union, but there are like two of them, and I think that I was in Philadelphia like three weeks ago
Did you like it?
Three weeks, yes, I really like it, but
It's not really different from here.
Really different, the weather is not like Philadelphia
The weather is horrible
I really like it in Los Angeles
Horrible. In Los Angeles it's not that cold in winter, right?
Generally no. Now it's a bit cold. The lowest temperature is like, 60, 68
Really nice
But you'd be cold here.
Fresh, No for us is really hot, it must be like 35
Really?
Yes, it's not cold, this winter is really nice, there is no snow nor Ice
I see
Normally, well, I don't know if you have been here in winter, but the path froze. And you start drifting, and you can't walk because it's all ice.
They have to trow sand to the ice to melt and being able to walk some bit
In Argentina, i saw a commercial to travel to Argentina, like 5 days and Buenos Aires is like
Now is really hot
Is it hot in Argentina now?
It's summer right now in Buenos Aires, so it must be in the 80's.
Eighty?
Yes, we should have around 30 degrees, I think that's around eighty six or eighty seven.
None
Fahrenheit degrees. It's pretty hot in Buenos Aires, it's summer.
Yes. Yes. Are you specialized in anything?
None
Are you a doctor or what?
No, im a biologist.
Oh, biologist
Yes biochemistry
None
I studied biology.
None
I'm not from Buenos Aires
Yes, do you work at a university or what?
I'm at the University of Pennsylvania.
Oh.
Here, yes.
That's why you know about this program right, about these calls!
Yes, I met a guy from Argentina too.
Right
He saw the sign at the door. He works in another laboratory away from mine. He let me know
None
Yes
Right
Because it's from Penn, the study. But I don't know nothing, not even the building where they do this.
It's huge, well, it must be like, the one there must be huge
Right, yes, yes, and I have five more calls to conclude this program for me
I think this is number ten, but I think I still have some left to do.
None
I have 10 left.
Yes I need to make those phone calls on ten different phones.
Yes. Have you used the five phones?
Yes, i'm near the market
In a public one?
Yes, in the public one
Oh, do you know how lucky you are that they, they put you through quickly because sometimes it takes long, you see?
Right
But well, I don't like it in the cold, that's the good thing of Los Angeles, here you freeze if you go to a public one.
Yes, you have to talk twelve minutes from a public phone, you end up like a penguin
Yes
You just can't
You are speaking with Ingrid from Philadelphia
How are you Ingrid? My name is Eliana
Hello, what's up? How are you? Where are you speaking from?
From Boston
How nice, and where are you from?
I'm from Argentina, you?
From Argentina,  I'm from Guatemala
Look nice
Yes
I've never been but I want to go to Pical
It Is very pretty. I was there when I was young and I hope to go back.
I would very easily go
No, you know all the places in your country.
Guatemala is really little and to get to the capital it's about twelve hours by bus or an hour and a half by plane, but it's not very accessible to get to
Tell me, what do you do in Philadelphia?
We lived in Maryland and we moved here, my husband is in medical school and I graduated a year ago and now I'm working
Good, great
Yes
How long have you been here in the United States?
For ten years
No, I know one.
What do you do here?
I am doing a post doctorate in genetics
The good it's for some hard for me
No, if everyone thinks that it's difficult, but if someone talks to me about history and it sounds very difficult to me
That depends, my husband is, how do you call the ones that are science oriented, I mean that they like science, I imagine like you, and they have to.
None
That what was your degree in genet-, no it wasn't in genetic and  it was two I had one in bio chemistry and the other one in
In yes, I think that, no cell biology
None
He worked with his foreign mentor that was a genetics specialist
So that
Good and I say I don't know how they can learn so many things but I don't think I he likes it, he likes
Yes, it's like I am dumb when I write. I make many spelling mistakes and I am PhD, but well everyone is also
I can't play the drums
Each one has their talent.
Sure and the topic of the day is is interesting but
But strange I keep on thinking well, really. I don't know what to say because I met my husband when I came here and we started to go out since high school
Then we got married and we have been married five years and five years, so ten years in total.
Wow
And before this well I had for example a relationship since I was  really young that isn't anything well, I got bored
We didn't go out since it was difficult.
Just the contrary to you. I'm thirty, and I have been single for a year. To break up like this seems strange because
Yes
It's difficult to break up because to me it seems like it's always difficult
Yes
To not be, like you're the bad person because tho whom you
I imagine that it doesn't matter the kind of relationship, f you've shared time with someone, I imagine that it's like
I put myself in the position that if I left my husband it would be very
No, I can't imagine how diffiult it would be
Sure
After sharing so many years, it's a life.
Sure even if yes for example you stop loving him or have a problem
None
Same it's the custom to live with him at his side for such a long time.
Sure
If you stop loving, it will hurt
Always, yes, because even if something is really ugly and you way, I donÂ´t love him, I don want to live with this person but itÂ´s that
Up until now it's ten years of my life with memories, with things that we share, with things that
That I alone, doing them without him would feel really, really ugly, really strange
Yes, it's weird, sometimes, even if the subject is better, the other day we had to talk about, women's rights,  I don't know why. I've been here for only a year. there are subjects I don't know anything about
I don't know either, I had to speak about that too, I believe it had to do about abusing women
Yes
I had to talk about it for a while, I mean, I was once happy of not knowing too much about it because I've never been in that situation
Sure
I've never met anyone who is in that situation, it's weird because, there's always someone who's been there and there are lots of people that suffer because of that but
I have to talk about a boy in Los Angeles
Yes
So, he explained to me what was done in cases of domestic violence and stuff like that
Sure
I learned a bit with him.
Yes, it's interesting to talk to someone from another
Yes
Country, sometimes the subject is interesting and you start talking, I got to talk to a girl from Argentina, she was in Philadelphia too
Aha, yes, oh okay
Through friends of friends, we both told each other that we are from Argentina but now live in Boston.
We started to talk about them and they talked about these calls
The mother of one of my friends is also taking part in this and she's from Mexico.
And here name is Olga, I believe, she's older but.
Yes
You have to make twenty-five calls, no? she has already thirty and something. she loves it because she says it's an experience, whether or not they pay you or don't pay you.
What she likes to do is speak with other people
None
But it's a very different experience, in that you speak with someone you don't know, who is very different, from other places, and you that is, it's interesting
If it's truthfully good, that's very interesting. I hope they keep doing it, but it seems to me that, no
To be honest,  I am working here
None
I am obligated to participate in this program.
None
At the same time I like it in itself that you share with one another
Of course, what is it that they want to see?
I'm from Guatemala and you are from Argentina and they are studying here with us.
Yes
We speak Spanish very differently, I mean your accent, the words you use, how you use them
Of course
What we need is to collect more information.
Yes
We later transcribe what is recorded on the computer.
None
I don't know that the those who are in computer science.
Yes
They have their programs but the same for any programs you first have to teach the computer like enter the information.
Sure
And since the internet sometimes has sites where they say you can translate
Sure
First you have to enter information, and this is what they're doing.
How nice, how interesting because
It is interesting.
The next time they will do classes of Guatemalan Spanish, Argentinian Spanish, they'll say
Sure, because you realize that already in Microsoft Word when you want to translate or use Spanish it tells you
Argentinian Spanish, Mexican Spanish and
Sure
In this way they can identify each each Spanish
How nice.
Yes, and there's another project that's called mixing and this involved one hundred and fifty different languages.
None
Also, like, it's payed and it's also for people, example Chinese, who speak Chinese, or Russian, there are rarer languages
Ahhh how nice
Also really interesting
Sure look, no the truth is that this is really interesting, and, is it cold there?
In Philadelphia, there is such a crazy weather, that today for example, I was in 50 and was in lunch hour and it was a nice day
There was no wind
Sure
But, it should be really cold in this time of the year
Yes, here also, still in Boston, there should be
None
Also know that we felt last year cold
Not even for Christmas, because regularly by Christmas you should use a huge jacket and you should be really protected and this time I was wearing
With just a sweater
Did you see that it's always about the weather.  I remember dates and the clothes.
Sure
It's like if I have my birthday in October at the end of October.
None
And it might be hot and sometimes it might be cold
Yes, like that.
When I tell how is the weather on my birthday and I see some photos I'm with shirts and in other with a sweater
Yes, in my case is not worth
I'm from August and it's always hot
Sure
There is always hot, at least in this area
Sure
What I'm scared about now with the weather is that we've had really good weather in comparison to other years and I don't know what will happen here in February if it will get really cold
Sure
Snow sometimes happens with the chances of the seasons
Yes, you always say, will the weather be good? No, it will be worse. Here people are all pessimists
That it will be the worst year, that it will be the worst
No
It still isn't cold because it will be worse in February. This is what everyone says.
And this is funny because I remember that I had a friend at University who would say to you, I took my
Aurelio from Washington D.C.
Manual from Orlando, I think we spoke these past days, I
It's true Manuel, how are you?
Very well, how are you?
How's everything going, is everything fine?
Everything's fine, yes
That's good
Good, let's get to business, I'm listening
I'll tell you something, these subjects they pick here, i don't
Yes
Breaking up with a partner is something difficult man
Yes
Breaking up, in my experience and what I've seen, it's something that is very hard
It's always hard, whether it's only a casual relationship, or a serious relationship
Yes it's still painful.
Sure. There is always going to be something awkward. It is always going to happen. There is always going to be something that makes people uncomfortable. Do you know what I mean?
I have seen in a many cases, right?, co-workers and friends, where, in fact very close friends, that, right now, they are
They're a couple but, a year ago, one of them was living with us and when his partner broke up with him, that was a mess
It was, the man was completely devastated, i mean, hurt
Yes
Depressed and lost weight,that was a horrible thing
Yes.  I think the same that you.  I cannot talk because of much experience.
More stable
None
Yes, obviously I know cases, even close cases. My siblings and it is a very painful situation and sometimes involves all the family. His as much as hers.
Of course
You should not exlude yourself.
None
No, they didn't exactly say that in the introduction, but I do well, and we have an epidemic of divorces
I was reading that here in the United States the, the statistics show that more than a half the couples get divorced
Imagine that
Definitely, people don't know each other or they are very immature.
Yes I think that too, there is like a, exactly, much immaturity and not only that, is like they go into a marriage as lets say, thinking that it is not a
Not a serious issue. It is a thing that they take lightly, and if it works it works and if it does not work well
They go with that mentality, with that predisposition to end quickly the relationship.
Yes, the family therapists themselves and all the people who are linked to that are alarmed
Of course, yes
But on the other side there are people that I have worked with and known people, especially when I lived in New York.
That say that they are not interested in marriage, or that, both men and women
None
I met people that, women that were, professionals, with a very successful career, that, they're not interested in
Yes
That's very respectable, lets say it's like something that has brought us the evolution of social evolution
The woman's access to the job market.
None
I think it's healthy in the way they know each other
Right
The saddest is to watch someone that doesn't know, cases of women that get married for some reason and that they knew that wasn't their destiny
Yes,
They didn't want to be there, or well, having children
None
That's the saddest
A bit pitiful.  You know what else?  I see a lot of examples where I work, the music
Also homosexual relationships
None
When the couples end, I have a lot of friends that are queer
Yes
Look, i mean, like they where heterosexual relationships, it's the same
No, and, exactly, and just at this show, of Dr. MarÃ­a, Ana MarÃ­a Polo, i don't know you have ever seen it sometime in the
Of course I have seen it.
There was a case, like those, where she pointed a case where even a woman filled a divorce because the husband was
He was, excuse the redundancy, he was gay
I see
She said that there are people that take fifty years to recognize.
Figure that out
Or recognize and then--exactly, there are many casuals.
Sure, it's too much
I think that all go for the same thing, when people assume that compromise, it must be serious, maybe it's not the moment, they are not mature
I think that that maturity
Or lack
It's about maturity. I think the same, it's all about maturity, what people ends to do in that moment
It's done without thinking, they are shopping
Exactly
They liked, and they bought it, and that's it, do you understand?
Exactly, and I say that initial attraction is really common, they magnify it and think that in that moment they really like her
It's forever, but they don't sit to see other things and watch
Sure
If really it's the person they would like to be for the rest of the life, they don't
Sure, that's the difference
Yes, because the first stage of being in love is quick and then there are more important things
Yes, are you married Miguel?
Yes
Oh, me too
Yes.
Me too.
I cant talk on my own experience
None
Yes, I've lived other people's stories close
Yes i have been through about five serious relations I had before I got married
And my wife and I, we will soon be six years married. We have just been six years in December.
Honestly
Not that good, we can't complain, not she or me
Yes
I won't say it is the perfect relation, because you know
No, it doesn't exist.
Doesn't exist
No, and whoever says so is lying, that's it, and there are amny who say
Right
So, you know he is lying.
Sure, we can help each other, but I have seen cases, my parents for instance, my parents divorced, it is a horrible story because
REALLY
It's not horrible. My siblings are always there playing. They say you don't have to be together
None
No, I have
That isn't important to us in fact that never should have been important to us as their children
No, and yes, it's true, and there he is
Second, they already see
Got to a point of no return so that....
My sister is already married and my brother has been married three times already
They touch in their relationship with my parents. I told them why didn't you get divorced since you should have been divorced.
Long before us
That really is how to say to them I hit the nail on the head because that's what's happening
Of course, and he didn't see, and
None
They got divorced, and later got together again.  Then they separated again. I just talked to my mom.  Not much is happening.  She called about two hours ago, and was telling me that.
My dad's new girlfriend called her to insult her
No, but they're like kids again
They are, I'm saying, but what that is more
No but, I think that if you have to cut to the chase, and like the family therapists rightly say when a relationship is toxic.
Exactly
That has to be decontaminated, the separation
Sure
If not definite at least temporary
Better for the healthy, certainly, yes, yes yes, and You know? that doesn't only happen between couples you know that also, that can happen in any type of family relation
None
Type of toxic relations exist between brothers and sisters.
None
Between kids and parents, any of those types of relations that exists, of those things
This, no and what you point out is super important, because later if we repeat it to the couple is that also in the heart of the home there is another type of relation
There too
Sure
People living together and you pointed it out they are very strained relations very hard
Exactly, true, and the majority of the people don't realize that then they live in a quarrel, is
Like a gorilla within the same family, and the people don't even know what it is, and that comes from that type of relation, you understand me?
From toxic relations that happen before between the family, happen between a couple, between friends, also sure the friendship is a different issue because the friendship, the people
Cut off a friendship
Yes,
More easily than a romantic relationship or family because
Family, yes.
I think that everything happens on a level in all on a level that happens I had to once end a relationship
Friendship, but it wasn't something from the other world, also, I mean, we met for like, five years, we met in the University
We had an impass, I said this is not going anywhere if we keep this up.
The hypnosis followed, and it had repercussions in anything, it grew and this is not going anywhere
It's better to cut this on the nice side
Yes
I was, I mean
That it's a decision maturated sure
Sure, because figure out if we are trying to keep a live thing that does not exist, that's the same it happens between couples. Do you understand?
Yes
When I moved here, for example, I left a girlfriend, a really serious one that I had in Venezuela
Really?
I had to left her, because I came her with
The
Here, but I wanted to bring her here
None
Do you understand me?
That's other important thing, the circumstances
Exactly, that was it and in this case, it was the circumstance
Honey
Good evening.
Good evening
Hello, my name's Marco
How are you Marco?, my name is George
I'm in Philadelphia, and you?
I almost can't hear you
Sorry, is this better?
Yes
Okay, I'm Marco and I'm in Philadelphia
And I'm Honey and I'm in Florida.
Breaking up depends on how close it was to begin with.
None
I agree that with age it's easier or more difficult.
Depending on the experiences that you had before, I think that, and yes. With the age, it can be that you react more strongly.
That it's more difficult to break up  sometimes for a long time already living in the world and knowing how it works, and practically hoping for something like this to happen
I don't know why because I have my parents who are basically all ages
Yes
And some not for the age but for maturity, I have people who also you see the point of view for the age that you have, well they stay with partners that they shouldn't
Yes.
Because, he is afraid of starting, or getting alone, or anyone they have
Yes
But, in my experience, I was a teenager and it was easier. You know, I'm up and down
As they got older, it's difficult to know new people
Yes, that's definitively true, but, remember also, that teenagers' emotions are not necessarily strong but
At least, more colorful
Exactly
When, you are a teenager, it's, breaking up with the couple you can imagine a teenager talking about wanting to killing themselves
At that age, it was something strong
How?
If I remember right the loves from high school were more healthy, this was going to be for all life
Yes, yes
I want to be with him, and you get so involved and you didn't sit to analyze the pros and the cons of the situtation
Yes
And after you start growing and getting up earlier with bad experiences, you get more realistic and the situation changes, it's not the same
How would it be, the passion of being in high school was really innocent
I remember my friends, I went out with them and they kept the same girlfriend from three years ago, I thought they were all married 2 years ago but none of them were.
It was like a practice
As you get older, you get experience of not having
The same social activities you had in high school
None
That there were much more people of your same age, basically with your same tastes, then you grow up, you go to work, you meet people from different ages
Yeah, you know, I think that age itself is something
Different
Merely mental because, for example, there are people of old age. Fifty or sixty is not very old, but
That feel like a lot less than that, they feel younger, you always remember the father of that classmate, that came out and played football with us
That the way they
They are young at spirit
That are young of spirit, but at the same time there were people that were twenty years old but who were serious and stayed home and didn't go out
It was like an older people, two person can be together in a relationship or
I find people of my own age very immature after hanging out with a few.
I always, i'm always with, i get along fine with older people too, people, people way older but i always got along, i get along fine with people
Younger, for example, i have some friends, I'm thirty years old, i have some friends that are twenty one, twenty two, that i understand the way they think and i get along fine with them
Very
I can barely hear you.
I'm sorry, i get along fine with younger people, almost as much as older people, like people older than me are almost the same in their behavior
Of several relationships, I once had the brilliant idea to date a person much younger than me. I just turned thirty two...
None
I still refuse age, but thirty two
Yes
He was very mature for everything
Yes
In relation with the relationship ideology. there were somethings that made me look at him like okay What era are you from?
None
Because it did not fit with the age
Yes, yes
You know in relation with business he was very mature. but as to the relationships it was like he didnÂ´t understand because I have children
Yes
And then I had one
None
And was a thing, it was like my head could not explain to him. that you are in an age when the parties do't
Are not so important like when you are twenty.
Yes, of course
I was very happy with my relationship, my home, my son, my partner.
None
Where he was, but sometimes I thought that he wanted to be with his friends and explained to him that thing of the age gap, I understand that you are much younger than me
None
There is a part of your life you have to live and that I have lived.
But if you are going to be in this kind of relationship, you must understand that I am not going to be with you because I have a child.
Of course
Look, you are going to have to choose what is most important for you, I mean, or if you are ready to take this type of relationship, or
You need more timei to live your life.
Yes
I found the biggest difference, and leaving that relationship was much more difficult than any other relationship, because it was a matter
I now have so many years, I'm going to begin, go back to meeting people, it's like returning and I'm going to put it like that
If I live with my fiancee with whom I've been with like four years or something, she has a son, eh, I've been with her since her son was just one year old
She was married briefly, and then divorced, I knew her before she had her son,
The difference is large before and after her son.
It's very different, or is it that before you had your life for you
Yes
This difficult to explain with couples
Yes
Jealousy comes in, a series of things come in, what I'm explaining with age it's easier, it's more difficult for everyone the compromises that that you have to
None
Let's see, for me it's difficult to explain that before I became a mother, I could love you and adore you, but the moment that you interfere, with my relationship with my children, or my ability to be a mother to my children
Yes
You are putting me in the position of choosing between one or the other, and I can guarantee you which one I'm going to choose
Yes.
I've had relationships where I've had to leave because of this
There is no animal that you can come near to their young, it's the moment that is most
Fights harder and the moment it can harm you the most
Do you know what I have seen, generally it is about stupid things that could bother my sonÂ´s father
For example, the girl is two, she is naughty the boy is an angel, he is eleven and better son he could not be
The younger one is sent by the enemy because she knows the bible and is very close to me, and knows she needs attention.
And it is a thing I have to explain, I understand it is bothering, but she is a baby. she will grow up and the naughty behavior will be gone little by little.
I don't understand that relationship at all.
You are talking very low and I can barely hear you
Pardon me,  I have a little problem here with my telephone okay.
Hello, my name is Miriam.
Hello, how are you? My name is George, and I live in New York.
Hello
How are you?
Fine, George, thanks.
Good. Where are you calling from?
I live here in Toron
Where?
In Toronto, Canada
In Toronto?
Yes
Really?
Yes
I went over there like six years ago
We're you by here?
Yes In Louisiana
You didn't like it?
I was studying English there for three months, and you only
I see, how nice.
What do you think of today's topic?
I think that when the relationship is really deteriorated, and there's been a lot of lack of respect, the couples break up.
Yes
There's no trust, it's better to break up.
Yes
But it's very hard making that decision, because sometimes the couple is so used to each other, it is very hard getting out of a
None
Of a circle.
Yes
The people get used to it and the person has to be very strong too
None
To make the decision of leaving
Yes.
The age, I think that already, perhaps when the person is younger, is more
Easier.
Easier breaking up, I would already say that. Because younger you have like more friends, you see the future differently, right.
Yes
Like an older person sometimes thinks that already they are not going to find more.
Yes
Its' already the last
And he's right of down
Because you are older, no one will ever trust this person again.
And what do you think, for example, when there are kids?
Kids, this is really difficult.
Yes
It's a mistake because people sometimes stay together who don't have love, just for the kids
Yes
They actually really hurt the kids.
Hey, you know what?
Tell me.
I've finally found someone who agrees with me.
You agree?
Totally
Yes
That is my point of view.
Yes
I always say sacrifice, what sacrifice. I think that it's sacrificing them.
It's them, because they perceive everything, kids aren't stupid at all.
Yes, they are the most affected.
Yeah,  then they suffer
None
If it's a woman who islike her dad who doesn't love her and doesn't respect her.
The cycle,
You repeat
The chain continues.
Yes, do you think that it repeats?
It repeats, many times it repeats. It's really true that the, the
None
None
Yes
Takes the same, or the children of abusers, abuse themselves and others.
Yes
Abused
None
And abuse the other kids. Many pedophiles have been abused themselves.
Yes, in many cases. Yes.
Sure, so this chain continues, to not be that person
None
Ends in therapy, or goes to a church there
None
There are groups that help.
Yes. What has been your particular experience? I don't know if you want to tell me or something.
Yes, my experience in particular
Have you had?
What I said is I'm a coward,
Yes
I almost see a relationship that doesn't have love or anything.
Yes
In the three, I'm forty, but in the three relationships I've had in my life
None
I didn't finish them. But the relationship has been really
Yes
Already empty of this love, and I waited until the person told me, this is where we've come to.
But did you realize?
Yes, I realized, but it was still pretty hard.
Yes
It's strange. And by a mistake you think you, should keep going.
Yes. They're relationships.
Because
That come in relationships with permission, yes.
Sorry?
There are relations that become sickening.
I don't listen to you
I mean sick relations.
It's true.
Yes, they don't get along and have problems every day. I know children from families of these kind, where they don't get along, but I have seen that the kids suffers the most.
Than, children from separate people, right?
Yes.
Do you currently have a partner?
Well, I'm now separated.
Yes
We were married with kids for six years.
Yes, I see
I, now, I'm now going to a church, a lot
Yes
Then, I think that it's becoming me stronger
None
I took the decision that I can't keep being with him, unless he changes
Yes, where are you from?
I'm from Peru
I see
And you
Me, Colombian
I was going to say
Yes
The church I go, there are many Colombians, with the accent
Really? And you live in Toronto
Yes, In Toronto, I live
Do you have an email?
Yes, I have
Or I send you mine, I have some friends going there, soon
None
Can you recommend someone that knows the area and maybe some things to do?
Sure

Yes
I would like to invite them to my church
They are in paperwork, but almost
They are a couple, right?
It's almost out, yes
Nice
They are not there yet, but their approval is realluc lose and then we should keep talking about the brake up, I think that
The topic, that we are going to be hang
Yes, I understand you
It does not matter
That's bad, with all those wasted, I had some friends, but they moved somewhere else
I see
Yes no, really I think that, that we agree on the topic. I think that it's one of the few people with which I've been in agreement.
Tell me about your experience then
Yes, I think No, the same. We're in the same situation. Three times
That's it, now, and are you sepparated?
Yes Exactly the same situation
You're separated And do you have kids?
Yes.
None
I have always said no I think that you should not sacrifice them. That's a tall tale.
None
None
How many kids do you have?
Yes I have five.
Five?
Yes, because, like I've had three, I've had two, two, and one.
Wow
Yes
That's good, but big families are nice.
Yes, they're not different, so yes
There are three in one and three in another.
No, two and two.
There are four?
Two and one.
You have three.
Yes.
Oh, sorry, I heard five.
No. Two, two and one.
Two and one, okay.
None
That's good, that is
Yes
Good, it's a shame what happened, what they couldn't understand
None
Their children are a great comfort, right?
No, yes, and I don't know. In your particular case, you understand yourself with your ex-partners later, or not?
The first two partners, I never saw them again
Yeah
Nothing happened, I didn't have kids
Yeah
Unfortunately, my sonÂ´s dad, I have to see him, all the time. And argue, and fights and all that.
No, thatÂ´s, thatÂ´s really awkward
Then it's enough. But that will have to wait until my son grows up.
Yes
Until my son.
No, I mean, I, relationships have been really
Really what?
They've improved
Improved?
Later, after all the problems, you have a good relationship
Some people can't live together
None
TheyÂ´re, uhmm, pretty incompatible
Yes
I have sister that, she has huge fights with her, with her husband
Yes
But now that they are divorced, they get along better. TheyÂ´re friends
Yes. at least I get along very in the economica area, in the in the responsibilities area, I dnÂ´t, I donÂ´t have much problems, Hm?
None
No, they talk to us, but then I try to get along
Yeah, that
Right?, and how long have you been over there?
That's good, what?
How long have you been there in Toronto?
I can't hear you, I don't know if you
How long have you been in Toronto?
It's, ten years
Ten years?
Ten years
Yes.
I can't find a job that i like. Lately I've been working in
Yes
That finish, because they're just contracts and nothing else, and after that i have to find
Yes
I'm unemployed now
Yes
Some of the jobs are ridiculous and pay little.
What are you gonna do about it?
And so, it's a little tough
Yes
And you, how is it going over there?
No, for me, fine. Since the beginning, like always no, as it happens to all of us, no. But now fine. I'm a, a systems engineer, and I've been with the Internet, and all that.
Things are going well
None
How did you find out about this program?
I also once went on the Internet, looking for work, and I saw it there. I applied,
For one, in what site did you see it?
I think that it was in Cool Joe
Okay, well.
I couldn't say one hundred percent. It was in that or in Joe Cool
How many calls have you made?
I'm just in, I think that it's already the eighth one.
Really?
I should be close to eight or nine.
We are, more or less, the same in that also
And you?
I'm also like by there, everywhere. Yes
Will they pay?
Yes, of course
Are you counting the calls?
Yes you well
Hello.
Yes, hello?
Hello. What's up? My name is Felicidad.
Hello. My name is Blanca and I live in Arizona.
How are you? I live in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Uh-huh. I live in Phoenix in the Mirage
Where are you from?
From Colombia.
From Colombia
Yes.
I'm from Argentina.
Yes. I can tell. In the tone of your voice.
None
None
Yes. The topic was the break up of couples.
Yes. So difficult
I don't know, what do you think?
I think I spoke about the same topic last week.
Neither.
They repeat right
It could be If you want to we can talk about something else
No it's ok. I don't have a problem. I don't have a problem talking about this.
Good.
What do you think about breaking up?
It's always difficult to break up with someone.
Something happens or the person did something to you It's always difficult.
None
I suppose that it has, it's more complicated when you're older than when you're younger. Because things change. No, no.
Go on.
It doesn't seem to me that any moment is easy. For me it never was easy to break up with someone.
Yes, I think the same. No, it's not easy. It's never easy, breaking up with someone. Where there's a long term relationship, because I think there are very volatile relationships.
That are like that.
Yes.
Temporary and not for anything. But I also think that you. It's very difficult and more so if you're young.
Sure.
Right?
None
It's more difficult to do when you're young.
Yes.
It's very difficult. You have to learn, to live, with what happens in life
Yes, I think it gets more complicated when you break off with a couple
When you haven't been with that person too long, or when there are no children to think of,  it will always be easier. It is different when you have
Been married for years, I figure it can get much more complicated
I'll tell you about my own experience. I have been married for five years, and I only stayed with my husband.
Yes
We were boyfriends five months before we got married, but I'd had two long term boyfriends before.
Was my first boyfriend
Yes
And it was very hard for me to break off with him, actually I didn't do it, it was him that broke off with me when coming here and so
It caused me a terrible crisis. But it was because I was very young, very immature
None
I thought he was my one and only love
Sure
Now, with this one I broke off six years ago, before coming here. I was the one that broke the relation, and I think that
It didn't hit me so hard, actually I didn't feel it at all
None
It is because you are already mature, you have the experience, the capability of deciding what is good for your life, what is bad, what benefits you, what doesn't
Although there is love, you think more with the head than with the heart when there is
Sure
Maturity, because when you are young, I almost died with my first boyfriend
Sure, in all ways, everything more passionate than with
More intense, right?
Sure. The first experience helped you manage it.
Yes, for all these things.  They help a lot, they help a lot.
Sure.
This helps a lot. I think that, yes it's difficult to break up. Whatever the circumstance, but there are factors that help it to be more bearable than others.
Yes. I agree with what you say. So in breaking up I don't have. I'm married here four years
Yes you're right. This is easier, when you had an experience when you already know what you want and these things
None
Yes.
Yes.
It makes sense.
It's not that I'm twenty two, I'm speaking from my experience. It can be that for other people, it's not as easy.  It can be that
That the first love was something without feeling that has arrived and then another that fills it more.
Sure.
It will be more difficult for that person.
Sure.
Getting out of this relationship. This also has to be taken into account.
Sure. Sure.
Because there are many things. I think that there are many things. It could be yes, it could be no. It's difficult for a person to get out of a relationship. It depends on so many things.
Sure. And you have been married for four or five years?
It will be five years, yes.
Look, and do you have children?
I have two babies
How nice
I have two babies, a boy that is three years old
None
The girl is one year and a half
What are their names?
Alejandro and Elizabeth
Beautiful names
I have two crazy dwarfs there
None
They are crazy like myself
Do you enjoy being a mother?
I am happy. I am happy of being mother. I was mother very old. I am already thirty-seven years old, so I was mother old already
Yes
I already lived my time
Sure
I went to university, I graduated. I head my time for myself, and afterwards, when I had already graduated and realized myself as a professional, then
Because you don't always realize But at least I have already finished my studying objective
Sure
The first part of it, right? I still have one more part. I decided to have my babies,
Yes. Sure, more or less the same happens to me. I have been married for four years. I am twenty-seven, twenty-six years old
None
I haven't finished studying yet. But I've always thought that as soon as I finish studying I will have a child. And yes, with a station similar to yours, but some time ago
None
So, yes, we will see it
Yes
We will see what happens
I didn't marry before for the same reason, because I thought, marrying implies devoting to the husband, and having children
Sure
Start the arguments because you don't want to have children yet and I feel like I want to live
Sure
I lived, I enjoyed, did my stuff and I formed myself professionally and afterwards, luckily I got married
Yes
I, let me tell you, I as a matter of fact came to this country escaping from marriage, because i came on my own
None
It was a senseless relation, kind of
Sure
You know, I came here, like, running away from it and it turns out that I hadn't even been here for a year when I met my husband. And after a few days, we moved in together, and five months later, we married.
That's very odd
After all those years of relationships, with two previous boyfriends that were my previous relationships
Right
None.
Yes, but you found him and that's it
And that's it.
And
He was the one
Very well
He's keeping them for me here.
No, I got married young and we came here together
None
We kinda started a life together but before marrying, we agreed not to have children. my husband knows that
I want to finsh my career and get a degree.
Yeah
I'd like all of that before if possible. If they come than that's perfect. I love...
None
Children, but yes, I can plan it better.
Sure
None
Look, it's very difficult, believe me, it's very difficult.
Yes,
I have dedicated to my children. I have had the luck but it's very hard when I have wanted to do something at this time but I think about the kids.
How I'm gonna leave them, what i'm leaving, what i'm going to do... a lot of things.
Yes
Very hard
I'm gonna work
No, i don't work
None
I don't work
It is okay.
I'm here at home with my children all the time
Do you like to be with the kids?
Well, at this time, i love to be with them at this age
They're certainly fun
I think that these are the most important years, so I thought, I already worked, I worked until i got pregnant
I said, lets go, and when i was halfway through my first pregnancy, i said i'm not gonna work anymore, my husband told me no
Stop working already, and I went home, stayed, had the kids, and there
I'm still at home, but i want to do something
Sure
I want to study now, like doing a specialty or something, because there's always, like you still miss something
I thought it was over but no, you always want something else.
Yes, of course, and you surely have met at the kindergarten, at school and other stuff, right'
I'm starting to be alright, alone and that, i say, a time where they
Sure
I can work. I'll do something for myself
Sure
Yeah. I [was] very [interested] in the first years, but later on when the went to school and kindergarten
You can dedicate to yourself again a little bit
Yes, and my mom says the same thing,  she stopped working when she had us, i have two more sisters, the three of us
None
My youngest sister was eleven, twelve or thirteen years old and she was like yeah, you're old
That she didn't had to do, because she had nothing else to do since
None

How nice, and where do you live?
Yes,
None
I'm sorry?
Where do you live?
In Manhattan
Manhattan, that's good, so we both live here in New York, and how do you like it, what do you think about receiving phone calls?
Fine
Do you want them to call you and bother you at any time trying to sell you stuff?
Yes
Well, so, what do you think?
It's good
Yes
What do you think?
I think it bothers me, and I don't want them calling me at any time selling me crap I don't want to buy, if I want
I'll go and find it, not you calling me and bothering me
Right
On the internet, do you like to receive offers too?
A little bit, yeah
Yeah, and have you bought something over the internet?

You don't have, don't worry that they can get your private information or
Yes,
You've also bought things by phone when they have called you
No
No, okay, how nice And what else, what do you think because we have to talk a while, and if you are only going to say yes or no without giving your opinion
None
Hello?
Yes,
Hold on a moment?
Yes,
Hello!
Yes,
Hello, how are you?
Yes.  How are you?
My cousin says: what's the topic?

Oh, the spam

Of the spam
None
No, I don't like them too much
Receiving phone calls or selling things

Yes, me too because sometimes they call me they call me when, always when one is
Yes, they ended the call.
Eating
You have to, and they charge the calls
Yes, exactly, so then we covered email, and we covered the telephone.
Yes
And what else
You answer them And then hang up?
I do answer and then I hang up because I don't want.
We are eating, and it bothers me that they are bothering me when I'm eating
And right now they made this call to you
What?
Yes, right now, they called, were you having lunch?
Not yet, I have long around seven in a little bit the starts are just beginning this one
I'm participating in this research, so when I see the number on Caller ID, I pick up
None
So it's a bit different from when I get other calls, and I receive calls at night, mostly when I'm sleeping, and we often go to bed early.
They will call you around nine in the evening.
Yes,
Yes.  It's a bit of a problem.  It's a bid hard.
I don't like to be called at night, because sometimes I'm worried I don't know where are getting my number from.
They exchange numbers with other people and they buy lists. It's kind of dangerous because you have personal information.
That bothers me too, but you've got to be careful with your stuff and don't give too many information over the phone because there are lots of evil people out there
None
How long have you been here from Chile?
About fifteen years
Really, that's good, so, you already are, have you lived in Manhattan your whole life since you first got here?

Hi, good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
Yes, my name is Sean. I'm speaking from Toronto, Canada.
How are you? This is Manuel speaking, I'm in Orlando, Florida.
Orlando, Florida. How is it over there in Orlando?
None
None
Although, at night, in this season it's lower. But, obviously not so much as in the North.
I lived for a few months an hour to the East of Orlando, over ther by where the Kennedy Space Center is.
I'm at about two
Very good.
Near, yes.
Yes.
Yes, there's a very nice beach to the North, right by Kennedy.
Yes, I think it's a nice beach.
Yes,It's like all virgin, well without anything that is Nothing
Yes.
Not shops, no restaurants. Only, virgin land, it's, it's, I think it's the prettiest thing that, that I saw when I was in Florida.
I have been there  well it's that one the one that you I think it's that one very quiet a place that's very quiet.
Yes. One has to pass, near a, near a reserve of the, of
W-we-
For the animals and nature to get to the beach.
It's correct.
Yes.
Good, entering in the material, Sean, I hear, tell me, what are your thoughts?
On what?
About the material, about the topic of the day.
About the topic, I almost didn't notice it, I almost never talk about the topic. They told me that it's only a suggestion, that's all.
What's the topic?
The spams
None
About spams, if you've ever bought something from unwanted emails.
No, i almost always delete them.No? Never, i don't even read them,they almost always have an attachment,and some virus.
That can be, that can damage. No?
Correct-
Yes, have you bought something through spam?
Yes I make many transactions on the internet, but never from span. I'm also really afraid of them.
No.
My account is with AOL. They have a distinct series of optional features.
They come nevertheless, you're not safe. And well, obviously, the mail whose origin I don't know, I erase it.
Right
They ask if there should be a program similar to don't call, i don't know if it exists in Canada, there was a program
You sign up, and after that, they don't call to offer you anything over the phone
Yes, yes.
I have it and I think it's excellent, they should do the same with the e-mails
Yes, it works, it's not a scam itself, they they just gather your phone numbers to request
To request, at the request of everyone that signed up to this... to not receive calls
I couldn't stand the phone call here to my house phone, offering me a series of things I don't need. I was sick of it
I signed up and, of course, they never called me again.
Right, i don't know in Canada
I think that with the spammers, there's a mafia behind that.  There are people who are earning a lot of money
And they don't want to stop it, because, imagine
Yes
It's millions and millions of spam that they drop everyday all around the world, we all get them.
Yeah, can you imagine the traffic, the internet resources that, that they need just to, for spam
Yes
Yes, that's a
And
How do you say?
On the other hand, i think it's also very unfair, to me, that they're making money on your data, with your data, your address, your stuff
You don't perceive any of this. so, they pay us a percentage too, to manage all this personal data.
Yes, for example, I don't know, the United States, ask for your social security number if they want some paperwork from the bank, some paperwork from
From, whatever, wherever it's necessary.
Right. Exactly. Because, it's, there's another more serious case that can be associated with this, this topic, and that's identity theft, that this, here
Every time, more dangerous. Many people have been victims of this identity theft.
Yes
I don't see that they're working, really, many, with respect.
None
You know that they're completely mafia companies, people who are making a lot of money with this.
Yes, I.
Stealing identities, and buying everywhere
Yes, and yes, I think, someone has to be making money, I don't know, there are many people who are assholes, who
Much money, yes.
It's worth it that I'm going to grow a meter if I buy these pills
This are. yes, no one had, to ask, there money, there wasn't
I see that there are still many people who are really deluded, really innocent.
None
How is it possible that they call me, X, an they say, you have just won a cruise, that costs five thousand dollars, it starts
Please, give me all your data, including the name of your card, How will I do this? One moment. It's obvious that no one is going to give me a cruise.
Yes.
And, and there are people that fall for it, because we see it in the news, people that let themselves get scammed.
None
I Honestly don't understand how they can be so gullible.
I have some friends that have some timeshare left.
That is very different, yes, very different.
They give you a vacation, but you have to be in a, for three hours so that
No.
None
That, is very different, because I also have acquaintances in those programs. They pay an annual fee
None
And they are supposed to register for the place they want, they have selected it months before so they take them into account. That is not that
If I decide to go to Mexico today, I can be there in eight days but will not get anything due to the people ahead.
None
Is very different. The truth is that I don't know. You are there in Canada, in what city did you tell me?
I came here for vacation but I live in Vancouver British Columbia.
Really? And, do you have Latin American origin, or do your parents?
Yes, part, half, from my mother.
None
But I grew up, almost, purely here in Canada. But, also there in Mexico, in the -DF, in, and in Acapulco, I lived and studied.
You've been around a lot.
Yeah, and where are you from?
I'm from Colombia. I'm an immigrant. I've been living here for nine years now.
Right
I lived in New York and now, a year ago, here in Orlando
Why, did you, did you, did you find it better there in, in, in Florida than in New York?
I had problems with the weather.
None
I had a lot of problems with the cold, I started getting a severe allergy, that degenerated into asthma, so, well, that's when the doctor advised me to search for a warmer weather
None
I was there for seven, almost eight years until I decided to move here. The weather is an improvement and much better.
No, New York City is unbelievable, i love it, that's, that's why it's the world's capitol, right?
Yeah, i don't know that, i have to know that, I'm very eager to, to see it
It's wonderful, too bad about the weather,
Right
It's an amazing city, there's so much to do, so much to see, the cultural life is intense. I find it amusing.
Specially now, they say that in Christ- in Christmas, New York City Gets more
Yes, and in New York you see people from all over the world, from wherever, and just by using the subway
You're there watching the world resume, you turn to the sides and see people of every colors, of every size and every expression
It's very funny
Yeah, here in Toronto it's almost the same, right?, but not, not so big. There's people from everywhere in Toronto
Yes, i love all of that, the, the diversity
Yes. It can cause trouble if they keep to themselves in a neighborhood.
They don't hear from the outside world. And that's why the new immigrants come here and they don't learn English well, and after that they don't know the resources
Yes
That are there to help them.
Yes, but there are also programs to correct that or, i mean, to assimilate them in some way, not to let yourself get run over, rolled over
Right
I think that you have to preserve your essence.
Yes.
Yes, there are many cultures that prove it.
None
Whatever corner of the world he's at, he's a Jew, but anyway, he assimilates his environment, for what it's worth. The language, the costumes.
In his private being, he's still a Jew
Yes
The world would be really boring
Yes. The problem in France is the other extreme.
No
That they're completely isolated ?
Because, it's terrible that you also see it here sometimes, what they call ghettos. But you know, that's more because of the lack of opportunities, it's because the people is being rejected since they're little.
Right
People getting put into a corner, and, and the governments have done a little bit to end that. So, they're still being exploited heavily.
Yea.
But, it hasn't been so, that they've wanted, it's that they've been obligated to do that,
And because of economic factors or
There are some people who are really racist and that discrimination is really ugly.
Yea. Yes, more than anything
No. It's people, to me it doesn't seem to matter a lot, the color of your skin doesn't matter. More important
The most important is what's inside, your values, the way you see the world, and all that.
Yea, that's the problem, like that with the with hunger, and, and, and the, and poverty
Hello, Aurelio from Washington -DC
Adrian's speaking from Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
Hi, how are you?
Yes. fine, and you?
Very good thanks.
A little cool by Washington
It is cold now. The cold is very pleasant.
Yes, more than pleasant is a little painful but
I can imagine.
Yes
Look, and have you ever bought something by, through this type of marketing?
No, nor do I intend to either.
Pardon?
I don't intend to either, I never did it, nor will I ever do it.
I've received many offers of buy here
To buy Viagra
That's another thing. Buying Viagra.
And
Or enlarge your
Your penis, yes
Big your penis.  Look it returned too much. Every day, I receive, tons of those emails. And
Yes, my wife always tells me, why do they send me this, if I don't have a penis
My wife also tells me the same thing. My female co-worker says the same thing. Why do we have to receive this?
If we don't even have a penis.
To enlarge it, yes.
I have bought things on the internet, but not because they have sent them by, what they call in English spam
I get on the internet and buy things. You understand me?
Yes, in normal things, yes.
Sometimes, you know that another thing, that they send me a lot, mortgage offers.
Yes
Yes, that do your mortgage, what I already do is erase it, I don't pay attention to it. imagine, if one starts paying attention to those things, forge it.
One goes crazy.
No, the problem is that someone buys from them, if not they wouldn't do it, is for sure someone has to buy from them.
You think somebody buys from them? I don't, look, I really don't know anyone who has bought
If not, they would stop doing it. Yes, if not it would be, if not, if not it would be some one hundred thousand, some, I don't know, of how much, of a million
Somebody has to buy from them. They wouldn't waste the time and effort in sending all those emails.
Certainly, you're right, because is true, if not, they wouldn't send them, exactly.
I suppose that it is like, that it's like the illegal drugs, that any other
That
Kind of strange thing. If there is no if nobody bought it the problem wouldn't exist, right
Exactly, you are right, you are right, yes, yes, yes. I'll tell you what, I guess they send millions of that kind of messages, right?
If they send one million and the one percent answer, then we are talking of how much, one thousand?
Yes
Or ten thousand?
Ten thousand
Ten thousand, figure
It's a lot.
Right, a lot, right, you are right
At five dollars each, it is a lot
Listen man, this is incredible. The other day, I don't know, I'm gonna tell you a story, because,something very interesting happened to me.
The other day I got one of those messages. This one to buy something, I don't remember, I think it was a telephone service. But I just got the message
I didn't pat any attention to the message. One month later, I get the telephone bill in my office,
And there is a charge. Twelve dollars, for voice-mail service. So I called and told them, look this and that, you are charging me this service
That we don't have. Yes, that is a service that Aurello ordered on the Internet. I told him no, I haven't ordered anything.
Yes, you did.  Then they started looking for the records they had, and told me, yes, we sent you a message and then you
Ordered, and I said no, I didn't order anything, all I did was deleting the message. when you delete it our computer automatically
Takes your data and charges you for it.
Have it here, and I have never used it, so please I am not going to pay for this. But look, that's how they are doing it. I didn't even
What company is the one that did that?
I didn't open it, I just deleted the message, and their computer automatically takes my data.
No, I don't think so. What happened was that those emails, they are more than spam. It's a scam of some sorts, but
Sure yes it has to be that's why.
The email says, if you don't reply we will activate it
I called and immediately deactivated it because they keep on charging me twelve dollars a month.
They were charging me for a service that I supposedly had signed up for.
Voice mail for my phone, I didn't even own a phone at home.  In my house we don't have a phone, we only have cellphones, my wife and I
This service was being charged to a telephone bill from my job, a voice mail service for my home, I don't even have one!
And I said, no, this is a mistake, please, and they were like yes we are sorry, it's a mistake, we've made a terrible mistake.
We've made a terrible mistake, she told me. So, please, forgive us, this no, you don't have to pay, don't pay and I said, but of course I'm not going to pay
I'm calling so that you take out those charges so that you know that I won't be paying and that's when they did it.
You have the account, imagine if they do this with ten thousand little mistakes of around twelve dollars per month
Exactly, it's a lot of money.
Like the amount is so big,
It's a small amount of money for the the the each transaction
Exactly, yes
That's how they make money, all the telephone companies
Sure, sure.
With minutes and seconds
Yes, two minutes and seconds, men, it sucks,  let me tell you hey, one thing, haven't you, no, haven't they send you things like,
They send them to you and automatically charge you for them?
'm very careful with with that type of thing, and i try to always read everything and
None
Understand if, if contracting some service ask, forty times  I'm a bit bothered with that type of thing.
Or if it's true or not
Yes, and I try to not go about contracting things because always the problem is to unsubscribe, and
Of course.
To have three months free you have to have three months to unsubscrube and spend three months calling.
No, yes.
On the phone to cancel the service.
Exactly, there is always a trick there. Always, they always look for Yes, hear one thing.
No, it's what I
Where do you live?
Toronto.
In Toronto, that's in Canada. I didn't know that people in Canada were involved in this study as well.
You see that they didn't, you see that they didn't get enough people in the United States and started to send mails here as well.
I see, they signed you up by means of email, they sent you an email message?
No, I found it on Craigslist.
Craigslist, yes, that's where I also found it. okay.
It was published in Montreal
None
In Canadian cities too.
That's fine because I got it right there too but in my city, here in Washington
Yes, the
Yes
My wife said, they are not going to pay you anything, and it's all a lie but
None
None
Oh, you see, no, I don't, this is my first time. In fact, I spoke with one of the coordinators, I think that
She told me that she was coordinating this program, I talked to her and she said no. Yes, this is serious.
It's a legal program
I spoke with
She liked it because it was interesting, in fact, I've spoken with so many people from some many different countries and in very different circumstances it's really intersting.
I spoke with a couple of guys from the University of Pennsylvania, that were studying there and they told me that they alwaysdo this, that they did a similar program last year.
They have to tape thousands and thousands of hours and they use the conversations to train voice recognition systems
None
Yes, when you speak on the phone and they ask you to please say what you want to do, say if you want to talk with I don't know what, with turkeys.
None
They need people with different accents, people that speak at different speeds and people talking about different subjects
I can't imagine training the machines.
That's what they told me. That's one of the things they use it for. They have government grants. They have the money to do it.
That's incredible, look
I want to finish this call.
Imagine that. It's been a while since I went into my account to know how it is, because I've been travelling and I haven't had the time
Let's say, get in the computer and see how much time, and how many calls I've made, or something like that, the truth is i haven't done that for a while
I have
I will finish next week, that's for sure
How many are they? It's twenty calls max.
None
Twenty five
Yeah, so i have three more left
You're ready mate?
Yeah, I'm getting close, where were you born?
I am from Caracas, Venezuela
I believe you are the first Venezuelan I've spoken to.
Yes, where are you from, Argentina?
Yes, exactly
Ok yes
It shows, it clearly shows
It shows in your accent, yes, it shows in your accent, accent
Have you been living here long?
Kid's accent.
I was going to say of a Caribbean, I was by there.
Mine yes, of course, is accent
Yes
Inge
Hi, who is this?
Inge
What's up? This is Maria Ines.
Hi, Maria Ines. How are you?
Everything's fine. Where are you from?
I'm from Chile
From Chile, I'm from Argentina, we're neighbors
I thought you were from Argentina, I recognized your voice tone
Does it show that much?
Your accent,to us Chileans it does, and, did you know i was from Chile?
I'm listening to you, when you told me the name, i realized that you surely weren't from Argentina
Sure
No, I didn't know where, now that I'm talking I do
That's so funny
I'm telling you, I know more Chileans now that I'm in the United States than there are in Argentina, where we're so close
Yes
I don't live very close to Chile, but it's hilarious, I met a lot here, where in the United States are you?
I'm in Maryland
In?
Maryland
No
Is the west coast.
Ah, how nice.
The East coast
I'm on the other side, I'm in Philadelphia.
Then we are near.
Coast?
East.
I understood west, yes
At first I said west, but then I corrected myself.
And what state are you in?
No, I'm in Montgomery.
Mongo
In Maryland
No, I don't know much about the geography of the United States. I don't know anything.
Yes, Philadelphia is like four hours from here.
Nearby.
Yes, near
Have you been here in the United States for a long time?
A little over four years, and you?
A year and a bit.
You like it? Are you used to it?
She like to my teach
I really don't want to get used to it that much
Yes.
I came for two or three years,
None
I came for a job.
Perfect.
So, no. You came to stay?
Yes, I have my family here.
None
Yes, my husband and my son.
You'll stay, you have kids here. Americans
One of three years and one of five years.
How nice.
Yes
It's the sweetest age. I have little nephews so I don't have kids yet, but it's the age where they're starting to talk. At three, they're devine.
Yes, they're exquisite. They're the best there is. The topic was
Yes, that subject.
Yes, the subject of
Yes
Of people who speak on the phone offering goods
Yes
That you don't want, yes, have you ever bought any of them, in that situation.
None
Sure.
There were, but I couldn't hang up. They wanted to sell me an insurance or something and I wasn't even  paying attention because I was doing other things.
Yes.
Doing something else and not actually listening? so, I told him yes to everything and then I realized he was about to charge me for it and I was like no no no!
That was the only time it happened by phone, but it's pretty common by email
Everything.
Yes
I can't see the  registered address
Yes,that's bad
Did that happen to you too?
Yes, it happened to me once, I would get all kinds of offers but, in yahoo for example, it has some options in which they can't, no spam
You can register?
Yes.
Of the different things, but is a bother because one wastes time.
Yes
You have to look at the mail and all that.
And also but see, you put the filter, and by there later they filter the messages that you do want to receive
Exactly, yes
Is an issue, and with the mail also
Yes
You open the mailbox in your house and you find a bunch of envelopes. It makes you super happy and it is all advertisements.
Yes, it's a bother.
That
Yes, but
I don't know. In Chile does it also happen, that they send you by mail, by paper and things?
Not by phone. I think that the people in Chile, would not receive those things that too well
Sure.
Let's say they wouldn't have an option
None
Because is bad manners calling you house by phone to offer something
None
Then
No in Argentina they call a lot, they are quite annoying, yes.
How boring.
They call you by cellphones a lot.
None
Promotions of shared times, it's seen in different places around the world too.
Of course.
And they are jerks, they do not let you to say no, yes, she is interested and doesn't hang up, see it, they keep talking and you have to be rude and hang up, becuase
Yes
It is awesome.
They don't let you choose another option.
He is an employee that has to
Not because he likes it, but because it is the job he found
Exactly, yes.
Then I try to be good, see it, but
None
If it happened to me, I would not like all the people treating me badly but it happens.
Yes. yes, yes,I donÂ´t remember to buy something offered to me in that way
I never thought that.
No, I think that
Because they have to offer you something you were looking for, that you are interested in, because if not only by talking on the phone donÂ´t
At last you pay attention and then you look for it in another place, because I like you would be afraid to buy something on the phone.
Sure.
I don't know because I never did it.
Yes.
No
According to the culture of my country, it is an indicator of a bad education that they call your home phone offering you something you did not ask for.
Sure.
I think they shouldn't do this.
Sure, no.
Suddenly you're eating or doing something or you're busy and you have to answer
Yes, you know what happened with the people from the bank, it had just arrived because I'd bought the computer from the internet
None
I was excited, and when you're opening it, you're so excited to see and then the telephone rings. I didn't know who it was for so I'd left it for the answering machine. I saw how you answered it and said no.
This women calls, I want to go and see my computer, funny
Yes.
They're pretty annoying, truly.
Yes, and you haven't bought anything either from
No. They call me less in Argentina. Many of the people there do not have telephone.
What I get is a lot of mail, envelopes, cards.
Another thing
It's annoying.
Yes, that's terrible because it
I don't know how many credit cards are offered to me each day and then denied.
Sure, the worst thing is that they give you different, I mean, every month I get the same things so it's like, I didn't answer the first fifty times.
They send it again
Sure, I, Capital One doesn't even know how to send it to me, the last time they sent me an enveloped, what's this? Nothing, it had the same letter as before and I was like.
They are really creative, yes, they send
To
An envelope with your name handwritten in it.
Really?
The last thing that they sent me was a, it looked like a newspaper ad with information from the, it had to do something with a car
You see all the profits that they are making and their market share and how cheap they are but
It's an ad, it's not really a newspaper article.
Yes, yes, yes.
It's quite funny, the way they try to catch your attention
Why? I think they should do some research before sending it. They must have, but I don't feel like buying them
Me neither.
The things that they sent me, they tried to confuse me
Yes, exactly, it's like
I mean
They are invading my privacy I think you have to handle those things, it's a lot of crap
Yes.
All those things that you receive maybe sometime in your life you're going to buy something
And for sure the day you're going to buy. Surely you already threw it away and you will end up buying from another place because as you were saying, what is the chance that just on that day in which you get the envelope
You're in the mood to buy that, or the need to buy that
Sure.
It's
There's people that read the ads and they think
Sure. Maybe I dont't know, one that wasn't raised here, but there should be someone, I don't have American friends to ask them, but
You were born here. It's like they are more cued up because you got used to it from early on.
Yes.
The truth is that I don't know.
Yes, it could be. What we set up on the phone is a filter now.
That's what they told me.
Yes, that you see on a screen when someone is calling you.
Sure.
If it tells you that the number is hidden, the number is from a company and I don't answer. I let the machine answer.
Sure.
Because it was exasperating
And then they told me that there was an internet page where you can sign up.
Yes, I didn't
Yes, and you put it there so they don't send you, I think, I don't know if it's by mail or phone, but I think that it's by phone,
None
They don't call you
I know that there's this too but
None
I didn't do it.
No, I didn't look for it because it happened to me one time by telephone. I'm also not at home very much, so if
They call me but yes, I know it exists a friend of mine did it.
Yeah, yes.
They drove her crazy and she did it and they only call
It worked?
People want to sell her something and they put it in her bank. the bank has the right to call her.
Sure.
Yes to the rest.
Yes, for example the last time, what bothered me the most is that we have a line with Verizon
Yes.
They called me on the phone, sent me things by mail. They came to my house and rang the bell.
No.
What are they called? I don't remember the name of
Internet?
No. They put the fiber optic.
None
Sure.
Is
With fiber optics, no.
None
I'm not going to change my mind. Please, no.
Are they going to ring the doorbell in your house? It's the last thing I needed, I hadn't heard it yet.
The day before yesterday
None
It was cold outside, I felt very bad for him
Yes, poor guy
He told me what they offer and yes, but no.
The majority of places they go there must not be anyone else
Sure, imagine, poor man going around like that in that way
I don't know
But like you say, they must make money some way, they must make their
And I think so, I imagine so, because if not, it must really be costly to, pay a person to go
Ringing the doorbell I don't know.is brilliant that yes, one feels a little invaded with
Yes.
Lets say this that the bank call me once ina while to ask my opinion about something
I have a complaint. I'm going to call you
Yeah, don't worry, they'll call you
Don't bother, besides they have your number here, your office's
Right
They call me at the office
None
You don't say stop, I'm working, i don't want to tell you if i like the checkbook or not
Yes
It's a plot, yes, it bothers me more or less
Yes
I don't know.
Yes
I don't know
From work, they bother you at work too? Let's say, you get things related to work, that they want to sell you stuff, or things, yes or no?
They come to the lab where I work to offer a service, a product or give free samples
But, it's not heavy
Yeah
No, there is no truth.
It seems that's not a type of massive sale then.
They come once a month.
No, they are desperate.
And they are companies
It gives me the impression.
Good night
I am Manuel, how are you doing
My name is Marcos
Yes it is okay
I am in Philadelphia and you?
How did you say?
I am in Philadelphia.
No, in Miami
In Miami. Hello how are you?
Well, thanks.
Lets see pardon me unfortunately I am in the middle of something didnÂ´t hear exactly which was the topic?
It is about unsolicited emails. Spams
None
None
Lets see it do you use electronic mail
Yes
I imagine you receive spam.
Not so much
No not a lot.
No because I donÂ´t receive too much, very few of them in the past it happened to me with another mail but now I have not authorized anyone
I receive some three or four from discos only
How nice it is, let's see.
None
I use the net a lot
None
I use the computer a lot too and it is a problem, a serious problem, I have ways of dealing with this problem
None
I have for example different filters I use. Which is a way to report that basically that way
That way they throw out the
Yes right?
That's a good system
Yes, a lot of advertisement.
There's simply too much, there's no way of
None
There's no way of stopping because it's not even a question that your address is in the open.
I'll be back in a bit sure eh it's not even a question of that they leave in the open the address of the electronic mail but that they use back
Use programs that are sending electronic mail to random accounts
None
Servers in reality don't send you only mail that is to your address
Your address
None
It sends it because it takes it for granted that perhaps is misspelled
Probably yes no
Then that way and it's received. I receive my name is Marcos I receive electronic mail for Marcia for Emanuel, for Michell
None
That goes to the server that I use
None
None
In putting some sort of like a stamp that cost that there's a cost
For each sent
So that there's a cost for the electronic mail
Yes I understand
I see that would be a good idea but not that it's a cost for sent mail because that's ridiculous.
Is an animal but free is something
And besides, it's not free because you pay for it
No that is precisely the problem
Nobody has free internet, right?
What?
Nobody has free internet since you pay for the monthly service
Not necessarily
You paid the university's tuition in some way you pay it indirectly
Yes indirectly or directly we are  using it from one place to another
Sure the same someone pays it right? is not you, someone pays for you
But, for example with the spam what they do is that specifically because the electronic mail for example if you send
To the other electronic mail or receive you don't pay either way
No
You don't pay if there is a cost even if it's a marginal cost. That is not a thing of a matter of
Let's say for the access to be able to send email you have to pay a dollar a month
When the ones that send the spam arrive to your mailbox is costing you money
And it is costing you money, they are wasting or stealing your it, in which, it becomes a legal matter. Therefore, it can be attacked, meaning, you can
You can fine the person who's sending the spam but the problem now
It doesn't cost you anything to receive that garbage. You don't have to complain.
Pornographic spam that for example there's a basis that is that if your mail gets to a person who's under age
Then, you are breaking the law. In that way they were able to attack that instead of having an explicit spam, with explicit sexual notations
Instead what they do, is send things that don't offend but rather it simply fills up your mailbox with garbage but Is that they do it as if it was that
Is costing you money in which case is a theft. Start attacking that. Also, there's not that much already.
There's still a lot of spam and explicit sex but is not as popular like before for that reason precisely because is a
None
They legally can attack the person
I don't know if they should charge
Yes
None
I always thought that no
I think that if it's free it's better because there are many people who can pay but in other places, no.
Methods of communication and education it seems that
It's not a dollary a month but a cent a month. The objectives is that it's a cost so they can legally
They can persecute those who send spam because they don't need, even if you buy something from spam, that you're seeing.
Yes it's the only one time that you see that for the doubts, yes
Really follow one of the links and then the server will show that a person visited it and that's the only thing they pay for
By hit
Not by visit
They only need you to accidentally go and see
None
Then you'll also see if you go to a place that has a very similar name to another, for example hotmail
None
Yes. It's what you write. for example, I say Hotmail instead of ail
None
I'll go to another site where many people accidentally spelled bad
Show you a lot of explicit photos and but the servers show these as a hit so the person who owns the site where hotmail
Is getting money for this.
Probably.
That's the way it works
None
And the thing is that since it didn't harm you in any way, legally, you can't perceive that from a person who has that
For example in the email even if it's a marginal cost, that is simply a tax to your connection
Of some type but it has to be minimum. Is not that it has a use. The money, for example, the city taxes. They use to
To fix the streets to repair the sidewalks for all that
They say that?
In any case there's a huge need for money but in this case I'm trying to find a way
I am trying to understand and see a way of stopping the spam. It is getting to a point that it is getting worse each time. It keeps mounting.
But it really seems such a serious problem to you
The more
To me it doesn't seem so
I think that more of.
I don't think many people deem it a problem
No
There are some people that work with Hotmail for an institution. But, I think that for most people it just causes them to waste time, and sometimes the time spent is not worth the money.
It really is creating a problem. For example, the isp, the servers, the places of
The traffic goes through the internet
Okay, mm at its height
Fifty percent now is spam
Yes.
Hello
Hello,Honey's speaking
My name is Gloria, here from California
Yes, here in Florida.
When there are promotions on the internet, have you bought something?
Okay I specifically have bought things through the internet, but not for not things that are not requested
None
I don't think that already.  I can't say that either because I think that once I did get one of those strange messages and it was something that I was looking
None
I don't know what was the situation like so
What you hear well is all not truth.
On internet
Yes I do get scared because there's a lot of fraud sometimes, sometimes one thinks that it is safe but is not one hundred percent safe, right?
That all depends if it's a good way of looking.  You go to their webpage that has
None
And verify what the product is. If they are authorized, they have to have their own page
None
My experience up to now? I've never had such a problem, that I've ordered something on the internet
Be quiet my daughter
And has had a problem until now
None
But as for as that they should have some way of being able to stop you know, that one receives in the mail,the
Yes.
Is chronic
None
Yes I agree that there should be something for that
None
The same way one blocks when they call the house and bother you.
It's happened to me that sometimes at night they are calling for promotions that sometimes I go into some pages to see how the promotions.
I already have the call there in night in the house then no
That they get your information and they call you
Yes
Do you have your number registered with the do not call registry?
Yes, I have it but I don't know what happening, because sometimes there's a lot of deviousness on the internet. I am somewhat scared of the internet.
The only think I do suggest is I joined to my bank account and a specific card, just for that. I don't keep a very high balance just in case
You know? no, if they get my card or anything that shouldn't happen happens is easy to cancel and is not the card, from my main checking accounting nor anything like that
None
Which is a measure that I've taken so if anything happens at least I don't have to worry that I have to cancel my checkbook or anything like that
None
I know of another way, which is to have a card in which you only pay a small fund you know, so if anything happens, at least
You know? you don't have to cancel everything, you just cancel that account and that's it, you can report it as stolen, like you do with the visa
Shut up girl! I don't know but I didn't take part in the purchase of it
Some people, it makes your life easier
The internet
So you know sometimes
That's right, isn't it? but I can't afford it
Sorry?
I can't afford to buy things from the Internet and I don't think it's one hundred percent safe.
Well
Maybe they know more and me.
It's the technology has
In my opinion, no
It'will reach a point in which the stores, all of the stores where you buy groceries.
None
They will allow you to buy things online.
None
To look for
They are making your life easier.
None
None
Visa and mastercard they have now a protection system
Yes
That if it's a thing on the internet, if they've had problems with fraud or there's a chance that there's fraud, your card doesn't go through
None
If you pay with your card via the internet, it rejects you.
None
In other words they have also opted for security measures to protect the consumer
That's good, right?
None
None
Because I tried using it on a site and when I called and told them look, my card is declined and I don't understand why
They told me that it was the visa that didn't accept them to get the card
None
I said that is good you know,i knew that something strange was there,and that you know
None
I told them that no, I have no interest in that product, because if visa doesn't want to do business with them, it's because of something
None
Yes they have taken certain precautions, but as far as the garbage that one gets in the mail, there's nothing that annoys me more than that.
Too much, right?
None
None
To block the popups, the little windows.
None
It says that in fifteen minutes you will be able to access the website that you were looking for.
Sometimes I've found six to seven hundred that go straight to the trash because I have it programmed but they always get in.
None
That's the safe side of it.
Have you tried? Do they still send you the same message? To pick it up and send it to, do you have an email account?
No, I haven't tried that
You pick it. It's the latest thing that I've done when they keep sending me the same thing. I've already blocked it. You take the address
And you report it to your provider and they do some research and they go and cancel their account
They pay it, right? They send us spam
Spam is any email that you are getting in your email that you didn't request.
None
If you didn't go to the website and register in their lists, it's something you did not request
Anything that you did not request is considered spam
None
And that's it, about that you know that there are programs to block them.
None
I know hotmail has put up some filters and if they are not in your list of
Friends or address book that you know
None
They will send it to the trash folder
That's fine?
Yes
None
Yahoo still doesn't have it, I believe that if you file a report with the provider they take it and they find out and if they see who is sending out the emails they ask them why they are doing it
None
You know? There have been lots of frauds lots of people are inventing them, yes
That's better, yes
No,
I hope that this company that we have would update more often because even if I block them, they still reach me
They find ways to
None
It's a robbery, a computer goes and takes lots of addresses, for example, they put a very simple thing
For example, everybody with an address that ends in m and everybody that has that
Calm down sweetheart
That's fine, it's weird because they are trying to do their best
Shut up.
To improve the situation as such
None
Is that one also, you understand me? how do I tell you have to protect yourself what gets me mad because I have, I open my mail and there are, I have to clean it for
Fifteen letters that I didn't even ask for nor requested
None
And after I clean all that I come to see what it is they are sending me
Sometimes it comes out like that error because I send it to the trash and later it comes out that many errors, that I don't know what
Even if one wants to protect themselves sometimes the same company I don't know, they are like associated with those companies, I don't know if it's not working for me
Every time I want to block and all that it already sends me the error. And already others get in that cleaner that I don't know what, that I don't know such
Is pure business
How strange
None
Because I know that, with what I have in my account, thank God up to now I haven't had problems, because every time that I've reported the things
They investigate to see where it's coming from
None
But they should have a list for your email, like you have for the phone because already thank God they don't call my house
None
It was Sundays at seven in the morning.
How terrible
An agent calling to sell me something, but if I need services I will call you.
None
We put the phone in the no-call list. As soon as we informed them that our telephone number was in the no-call list, they have to take notice and take you out of their lists.
So I have, in order for my number not to be published, they always do and now I'm even paying for it not to be published.
You have to report it, there's a special list to block the telemarketing calls.
None
And you have to inscribe your number in that list and, it happens because when you have to fill out a request or whatever, that has your phone number in it
That person sells you information
None
Hat happens is that, your number comes up and wherever you put your number in, they have a list with all that information and they sell it, so they earn some money
None
If your number is not registered in the national phone book, they are allowed to call you, but not if you have registered it.
You have a private number does not mean that they don't have access to get it from certain operations.  Do you understand?
None
None
My local office.
None
And I asked them for the eight hundred number in which I could register my phone and it took about three days and they registered it there and I don't get those calls anymore
They had to take my number out because when they now look for your number it doesn't show because it's in the do not call list
None
They can't call you anymore.
That's good, right? Because they have sent me unwanted mail as though I had accepted their proposal.
And if you don't read well and here you have a contract with them
Yes, this what scares me the most about the internet, more when you don't know, you don't have a wide knowledge of the internet so sometimes I prefer
Going to see if it's my family and if there's nothing, I disconnect everything stays there
No
When you don't know a lot, you're the victim of scams
Yes, you have to be careful but like I told you, it makes life easier for example, this
Yes.
Hello
Hello?
Hello, yes what's up, my name is Soledad.
What's up. My name is Mariano. Who are you?
Mariano, are you from Philadelphia?
Yes, I am from Philadelphia.
I'n Soledad in Philadelphia
I can't believe it.
Look at that, how funny. I said this, this is Mariano
She sounds Argentinian
How funny.
How funny, I can't believe it, how are you
Yesterday was the first time I called andbf
Yes
It's a Colombian girl from Phoenix. I say to her, what is your name
I don't know what I said and I'm Soledad. I'm from and she said at the same time, Argentina
Argentina. yes.
She told me pretty bad, and I started to talk about you seeing that there are means, you think that you go with a bad intention
It's what happens to me each time I talk, the same thing. I said two words and they told me you're Argentinian.
We really must have an accent
Yes, I just explained to Laila so she could get on it too.
Also
I told her, it's incredible how aggressive we are. When you listen to people from other countries, there not for us.
Yes
You realize what you do, it's very
Sure
It's really authoritarian, how we talk.
Yes, it must sound bad
Sure, yes. Very, the, it's very
Yes, I think it's strong.
It's amazing.
Besides like that
Sure, yes. It's very strong. How, how, we're talking about what happens to an Argentinian, when I said
How
I said, yes, I'm Soledad, what's your name, you said Mariano, and I, Mariano where are you from, from Philadelphia, I said
Mariano
It has to be Mariano.
Yes, this my call twenty three, so I'm here.
How nice. And you called from different telephones?
Yes, I called from five different ones, so now I always call from the same because I'm in the laboratory and about to go, but
Sure
I make the call from here.
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Dude, how was the moving? Fine?
Fine, it was fine, we did this thing that, I'm telling you, it was exhausting, moving
Terrible
Moving stresses me out. I hate it.
It's horrible, yes
It was really a very [...] experience, i don't know, it was, it was hard, i mean, maybe the, the day of the moving itself
Yes
I was dead because i more or less put all the things from the department, because Martin had to work, and he couldn't help me much, so, i was beaten
Sure, i mean, you were stuffing things in boxes all day long, more or less
Beaten. But anyways, i mean, we did a lot, in an hour and a half, we finished in an hour and a quarter.
Were there a lot of you carrying things up?
There were eight of us.
Oh, very good
That Marcelo came
Yes
No one else.
Right
They came with their partners, we first did, since we were four only, we would go up and down, see, but the stairs, really, kill you.
No it kills you.
They kill you. It's four floors up, four floors down. And later, when the rest came, I said let's do the human stair, which is the best way. Then
Yes
Me and another girl, would take the boxes our of the boxes and once they took out the big furniture, like the bed, and those things
Sure
They took the boxes like that from the apartment up to just to the tip of the first stair. And Marcelo was there and he would take it down one floor.
Then there were two guys that would take those boxes another floor down
Sure, and not three floors, that kills you.
Then sure, you just moved one floor only, up and down, up and down.
Yes
And we did it like that. The truck was the smallest of all and Juan said all this doesn't fit here.
Juan said
Yes
Then we said, how depressing, I don't know. Let's put the most important things first. And Juanm did an engineering job. You do know Juan the Cordobes?
The short one.
Juan The short one, yes, how you call him short, but he's strong, because he lifts weights and all.
Yes
Andhe started accommodating everything in a way that everything fit.
None
It was incredible, it all went in
Incredible
E closed the truck and that was the first part
No, but it's a lot easier when they're a lot, because the truth is
Yes
I, the last time i mean, i suffered moving twice because i, obviously [came] from Buenos Aires
Yes
My parents house where I left the stuff.
Yes
That killed me. And i came here to Philadelphia, i go to a su... i have a sub-lease, where you came to look for me, over there in West Philly
Yes
And also, after a month and a half, we weren't many and I'm telling you I ended up dead.
Yes
Dead. There was Paula, Maria InÃ©s, Paulo and no one else, so we were, i swear i ended up
Sure
The next day, everything was hurting, too.
Right?, it's terrible. the other day, well, i went to pick up Federico at the airport that day
None
The day before i had gone looking for... because they also come to work like that, for three months, his sister, he and her boyfriend, who are also biologists
Right
To do type of an internship, but, but are, are in the career so to speak. Just in third year, so , so they are little.
Sure, sure
We all went to Baltimore the other day.
None
And they helped us, you had a dock where you would pull up the truck, and it was like that near the elevator
Then
You would go by elevator then
Okay, itâ€™s much more comfortable
Is much more, also, it was an hour and fifteen minute, an hour and a half, and we had already gotten everything out of the boxes. They also helped us to dismantle a little, not everything, but everything is almost done.
You are in Philadelphia now right?
Now I'm in Philadelphia, yes yes.
None
Yes, this week I'm here, and now on Sunday I'm already going to Baltimore and Martin is staying what happens is that the papers have to go out.
Sure
It seems that it will be two more weeks that he will have to stay here.
Yes, I called Marin, to see I mean, where he was, how you guys were
Yes today I also got a call from Nati, today I felt so bad in the morning. When we returned we were both super sick,
Yes
With a cold I don't know.
Sure, dead.
With this stress matter, I'm telling you, the body
Yes
I thought it wouldn't work anymore
Yes
This week i almost did nothing.
Yes
We're looking out for it this week and i don't know, we stayed there
Sure
I dont know how Martin goes to work, I was laying there in his house almost everyday
Yeah, you are completely stressed right now.
I couldn't think
You can't wait to be in Baltimore, quiet
Yes, I want us to be there already; he's making me really nervous. The matter of Martin's paperwork
Right
I have to go, I have an orientation next week.
Sure
I have to go there, but we'll see
Yes, no, everything's gonna be fine
I'll have a heart attack if I get any more stressed.
No, logical
What are you guys going to do today?
Us you know that nothing. In reality, no, I think today there's no plan,  pre-meditated, so we are kind of
I just recently talked with Martin
None
Marcelo told us, invite whoever you want here to our house, they have a barbeque.
None
That is not too cold. Martin is going to buy meat, and was going to tell Fede-
Yes
Federico and Laila, would you like to come eat barbeque?
Let me check with Leti to see if
Well.
See, because I know that Leti was also talking with someone to do something, so, of last
If you want to come
Yes, it would be super good.
Okay
Tonight.
Today, yes today at eight thirty, nine, call me or if not call Martin, at the
I'll let you know.
I'll let him know that I told you, and that's it, no problem.
No, yes, super good and, then where are you going to
None
To Baltimore, next week?
I'm leaving this Sunday
On sunday, it's OK
I'm driving there
It's ok
Martin doesn't know, he'll probably have to stay two weeks more here in Philadelphia
Sure
On the weekend, not this next one, but on the twenty, i have to comeback because i have a wedding here, from an American girl
Yes
I'll probably come look for him, lets say, that same weekend
Sure
Don't know, because after the twenty two, I'm starting college
None
I hope he can come here fast
None
I'm a little down because of that
Yes, oh my god
I don't want to be alone.
Yeah, I'm with [...] now, I started looking for tickets to Argentine
How are you going to find it.
No, I don't know.  I mean they are more expensive from here than over there
Yes
In the end, no, I don't know what's beset, if you should buy it from an airline and put up with it even if it's more expensive and to accumulate miles
Yes
Or what do I know, to look for a cheaper price
We always look for the cheapest price.
Yes no
The truth is that we do, it hurts, you feel the pain in the
It was $200 more
To pay that much money and to accumulate miles, how many, I don't know, I don't know, what do I know.
Four tickets and you get one free
Yes, that's also true.
What do I know.
If you think about it, you are actually paying for that one too because two tickets are, two hundred more, two hundred dollars more for a ticket to Argentina.
It's like another ticket, yes.
Six hundred dollars.
Cheap, yes, I now have a credit card that luckily doesn't charge me an annual fee
There's a credit card, no, it's a mile, Marcelo has it.
They give you fifteen thousand miles
That it is supposedly good.
In general, all of them have an annual fee, but this one doesn't.
Look at that.
US Airways gives you fifteen thousand miles, at front.
I see.
With two passengers and more you are
None
It is not bad.
It's okay
I think that I'm going to do it because it's the cheapest option to go to New York, do you always fly from Philadelphia?
No, we've flown out of New York and Philadelphia twice.
None
Twice from Philadelphia, it did to Martin, not to me, the flight got canceled, I mean, if it rains a lot, no, I don't know, it's a bad flight sometimes
We had back luck, it doesn't have to happen but
Yes
Our flight got canceled I don't know why and in New York, the only good thing about it is that it's a direct flight.
Sure
You know you won't lose your baggage or anything.
Sure
The bad thing is that you have to go all the way to New York.
Yes, that's it
Since not long ago, the one Paula took, but since not long ago it was not expensive taking the truck to the airport there
Now it seems like it was fifty round-trip
It is a van, like a shuttle
It's a shuttle that takes to to New York, or halfway, or to the airport.
It's not a bad idea
It's fine, but it is fifty dollars
Sure, but you still save more than one hundred
Sure
Of
If your flight leaves tonight, bear in mind that it is all day long.
You should be leaving by, I don't know, half past ten in the morning from your home
Sure
Because with one thing and the other it is four hours or five hours
Sure
To the airport.  It is not only the distance, but it has to pick the people house by house.
None
There you loose about half an hour, forty-five minutes
Sure, it gets
Or one hour. It takes an extra hour; Then let's suppose you find a little traffic. It becomes four hours, so you have to calculate
If you leave at ten to be there four hours before, you have to leave like at nine in the morning. Between this and that, understand.
Sure, it becomes long.
I don't know. But it's not the end of the world. I've done it.
How much did you pay for the last ticket for example?
Eight hundred
Eight hundred and something.
And something. Eight hundred and something, and it was in November, no it was in December.
I don't know, December should be a thousand and
When are you leaving then?
No, we feel like going in April, what happens is that we still don't
Hi, Lucas, what's up?. My name is Marceliana.
How are you Eliana, where are you from?
From Argentina, you too, right?
That's it, how did you recognize out my accent?
Yeah, you can tell right away.
And are you Portena too?
Yeah, me too
Where are you living?
In Boston
Me too, in
No, it's in.
Happy New Year.
Likewise
Did you go somewhere on vacation?
Yes, i went to Miami was with my brother who live there
That's good, and was it hot?
Yes
None
Obviously a lot more than here
You went into the sea?
No, I got into the pool of my sisterÂ´s house that has hot water
There are sharks this season?
The truth is that I don't know. I didn't get into it. Did you go somewhere?
I was in Spain.
Where did you were?
I was in Madrid. I went to the north of Spain by Portugal
WasnÂ´t it cold?
A little, it was snowing in the Basque Country
Did you know Portugal?
I have known Lisbon, but we were in Portugal now, where there are many churches. I got tired of seeing churches.
Yes
Europe, yes, there are churches more or less, so you have to stand those things
I'm fucked when it is that
Which is today's topic? That thing of buying on the internet, No
By telephone
It is fine
That one called I buy things for my work by phone.
No I get caught sometimes. After seven at night when they begin to call anyone and they offer you things. You don't understand what are they talking about and
You donÂ´t know what to say and, I accept and they send you something
No,
As soon as I arrived to the United States, a friend of mine called talking in a language I didn't quite understand.
And told me that there was something to call within the United States, and if I wanted to join, and I didn't understand a thing,
I didn't get to tell her that no, that we were not interested, and I got a ten dollars bill, the first month, and then since I cancelled after the second month was started they charged that too
The second month. But like this on the Internet, I buy nut. It is not things that
Did you give your card? Did you give anything?
No, they charge you directly.
None
You know there are several companies to call within the United States. It is a company and they, they keep you around until you say OK
Anything to get rid of them
That didn't happen to me.
ThatÂ´s usually when you have a telephone, not a cellphone, and your number is over
None
The cellular is much more private
Sure
Everybody. Terrible
Sure
So
At what time is it? at what time is it?
After five o'clock in the afternoon they start calling and they start talking and you just want to stop them
Sure
Yes I didn't tell them no, I'm not interested, but very clearly, those people immediately
How annoying, wow
Had the sun
No there were some cloudy days but since I was with my sister who was pregnant and she's like resting because we were, she's really fat and everything
Yes
No, happy to stay at home
Needed to give her.
Supposedly a month, but if she's dilated one and a half and is bedridden, the hospital, the girl said bedridden
Yes, they have to give
It is in this county, no one wants to say in case
How's the hospital where he will be born?
It's good, so, I went with her to do the ultrasound, it was the week, I don't remember, thirty six, thirty five and good, everything good, the truth is that it was great
And yes, I also had a lot of vacation
Does she have other kids or is this the first?
No, I have a little nephew. It's more her son than it is my nephew, who's learning more every day, he's two
He was born here in Miami?
No, they were born in Boston, they lived in Boston and he was born one winter day, because it was November here and
None
Sure,
That's good
The parents are in October
And anybody else there in Miami?
My brother also lives there and he worked everyday and at night he would come here every night and we dined together and there was also a friend of mine
He slept with my brother and I slept with my sister and so then we would all see each other. Besides, a new holiday for Christmas holidays for the new year
Friday he would leave earlier to work
Yes, you put for the child.
No, he was in school since we are Jews
I also left
Look
Never.
Hanuka? No, because my mom is going to Buenos Aires with all the candelabra. It was the last day. We won't do it.
Your mom went from Burnos Aires to Miami?
My mom alone will stay two months in Miami to take care of the future son
The mess
To help so she moved forward the ticket to see me two
She's going to visit you in Boston
She doesn't know yet, depends on how everything is with Layla.
Did she bring you something
Yes she brought me a bunch of things,
Yes,
A bunch of things, a book and a bunch of clothes for summer.
It doesn't grab my attention since I'm tired
It's not too cold these days.
Everything was good, I had a great time, it was cold in
And, more or less, that we took the jacket for the cold
None
When it is cold in Madred, we put on an overcoat as to not be as cold.
None
Here if you wear an overcoat and is minus five you are already cold
Sure
It was good, nothing to use it a little for hours or, not like here that you are the whole time with hats and gloves
None.
Walking was good, but we didn't have any sunny days.
Brilliant and where did you stop? do you have friends?
Yes, we have a couple of friends, and then were four days traveling so we stopped in different hotels and on the way back was when we to Madrid, were there four days
At some friend's house And there we spent Christmas and new Year also
Look at that
We were with their doges; who are awesome. The truth that
You know them so to speak?
Yes and one came from Argentina she went to Israel And another I mean And both they took them to Spain and are already there, they adopted a cat also in Israel that they are also taking to Spain
I need to get the Van through. That's why.
Because they were from the street
They call that ahorcada [hanged]
The dogs, yes, they justs got them off the streets, right?  for nobody, but
Sure
I found the Kitty in a dumpster and i gave it to... i wanted to raise her but my partner didn't let me
We gave it to those boys who took it to Madrid
Sure
You can't even touch her
Really? oh, the dogs don't do anything to her
No, they're very pretty, it would be good if they showed the pictures...
No, what's your name? Tamara?
They call me Luca.
Ok, Luca, I'm sure we'll meet in a few months and we'll remember our names and maybe I'll catch you suddenly on Boston
Yeah, I'm going to
We talked for a while
Do you come here some day
No, not really
There's a restaurant- there's a really good one
Yes
Average natural food
Yes, it is in
If you come it is good, they give you food.
I understand, and
Free things, you go there before one o'clock
Sure, yes, I used to, but I gave up with that because I gain. Even without hunger, sometimes I passed without hunger
A friend tells you to try things they have there and then you buy the package and end up with strange things to eat at home.
That's right
Yesterday I eat some chicken rolls
Yes
Yes, it was good
Look
Yes, note it down
Spring
If you are there one of these days get in and we may meet
What do you think of the cold? It's not that cold, right?
It's great.
Yes
Yes, I hope it stays like this for a long time.  This is the first winter I spent here
Sure
You were saying? It's gonna be cold
Yes, not now really, but the snow subject, the snow, i love snow, yes
Yeah, but if it snows you have to be sliding and that, i keep travelling and i don't even know the hour
None
But
Of course
Well, now we have a car, maybe it's going to be a little bit easier with a car
Oh, look at that. Do you plan on going anywhere this weekend?
I do not know is there any good place and I have to work tomorrow.
I have a friend, Juan Luna, an Argentinian, he sent mail. He plans to throw a party at some place for his farewell.
Tomorrow
Yes
Are you Argentinian? thats cool.
Sure, lets see, give me your email
Write it down
Hit it
Alukada
Yes
At [@] Gmail dot com, alukada at [@] gmail dot com
Perfect
None
I barely know that, he must be about to write, he told me
Ok, excellent
It's an idea.
If not, if not, we can do a movie night, i don't know, maybe you come to watch a movie, it's more or less good
Another idea
That's good. If not, we'll meet at
Sure, but I'll call you tomorrow as soon as i find out about the party
None
Hit it
Hi, my name is Eliana, who am i talking to?
Hi, what's up?, My name is Soledad, nice to meet you
Nice to meet you, Soledad, where are you from?
From Philadelphia, right now
And, where were you born?
In Argentina.
I thought so, what are you doing?
Yes, i was gonna say you're Argentinian by your tone, it shows right away
I spoke to Mariano and Leticia that I don't remember who she is but she knows some friends of mine, maybe you know them.
Yes, Sole, we call the girl Sole because she's shorter than i am, the other one
Who, Leti?
The other Sole, do you know Mariano and Leticia?
Yes, Mariano and Leticia
Do you know them?
Yes, i know them, they came to visit me, I'm here in Boston
Look at that
I spoke to another girl from Mar del Plata. She also knew Mariano and Leticia. Do you know her?
The girl from Mar del Plata. what's her name?  I can't remember. Yes, I met her just on Christmas day when we stopped
We ended up eating in the, in the house of some fiends in common, and i met her and her husband
Look at that
Yes.
What are you doing there in Philadelphia?
There I've been living for about four years, Philadelphia, and live, in reality I came with my husband because he works at Penn, he's a biologist
Yes.
I'm studying to be a social worker. In reality, it doesn't have a loot to do with science but
Sure.
Now we're moving with my husband to Baltimore because he's going to work at Johns Hopkins, another university.
Look at that what a pity.
So, and yes, you know how nice, yesterday too, I talked on the phone and it was Mariano.
No.
I say, I can't believe that I'm talking with you Maria, because you see, we're here and it's fifteen blocks, twenty blocks.
Sure and the other day, a friend game, because seeing that if you call with another telephone line they give you fifty dollars more.
Yes, I'm in the house of a friend now
Sure, so she came to my house and I gave her my cell, mine, and in reverse, and they communicated with both of us, so we were there watching ourselves
Talking on the cell phone
Seriously?
Yes.
In the same, in the same room?
Sure, yes.
How funny.
Yes, it is super funny.
What is your name? I already forgot.
If you do Eliana.
Eliana, that's good.
I'm the one that's in Boston that they came in November to Boston to visit me.
I'm going to ask Mariano I'm sure he must know
Yes, February twentieth is the holiday President's Day.
Yes.
I'm going over there.
Ah, good.
We will meet
Yes, I'll be in Baltimore. Yes there's a holiday or something like that but I'm sure that I can drive.  I'm about an hour and a half away,
Really good
And we have all the friends from here, so probably, if we're not too busy I guess we'll come here too, I imagine.
Sure, look I am here with a friend from Argentina
Yes.
That will start to, he will be a social worker, no, he's a psychologist.
Look at that.
And he will work as a psychologist at the end,
I have a friend that is an Argentinian psychologist.
Seriously? And he works as a psychological clinician?
No, he works in an institute. In reality he's a pharmacist and after he got a psychological degree
Look at that.
And so now he's a psychologist, he works here in a clinic. It's called Gustavo Clurf- Clurfman, or something like that.
I don't know, I don't know it. wow.
His wife lives and works at Penn.  She's about to be a professor.  She's applying to different universities.  She's a biologist too.
Wow, there's a lot in Phila
Yes, and what do you do in Boston?
I'm doing a post-doctorate in genetics.
A post-doctorate too? Martin just started the the postdoc we say.
He's in Hopkins to do the postdo-
At Hopkins, yes.
Sure, I'm here in Tufts University
Now he's doing genetics, Something in neurology, I don't know what it is.
That's good.
I don't understand anything
I always say, I don't understand the couples who are scientists
None
It's crazy, right now I'm single because I don't want to have a scientist next to me. there need to be two different conversation topics.
It's crazy, here, everyone we know are people from the faculty and we're all like that, the majority are biologists, or economists, who we know here at Penn at least.
Same as here.
They're, you see? They're always the same topics, or, what do I know? It's funny.
Yes here for example, in a moment I was tied because I had friends from Berkeley which is Tufts University
Yes.
And I go out with them sometimes and it's another vocabulary
Sure.
Recently someone asked if I was a drummer or a guitarist.
They seem similar to you and sound really musical
None
They laughed and I didn't know it was like this, it's good, really.
Look at that - And how did you get into this Fisher thing?
In exchange. Mariano told me, when I came here and she told me that they had
None
I work close to a hospital in
Yes.
Human Nutrition is a whole building dedicated to studies.
Sure, obviously.
I enroll in a lot of them, they're on the, the fifth highest floor of my laboratory
Look at that, around the corner
I had to go six mornings and on one I stayed there all morning with a
Yes.
They take out blood and it's six hundred dollars a month
Yes. Wow.
I started to tell them this whole story, and since sixteen I'm doing one to talk, I say, and the date passed, and in some way I have to get some money together,
The money I'm making here, I say with these two hundred dollars, I can go skiing four times.
If you want to go back to Argentina, it is part of the trip.
So no.
Between Marin and I, God willing, we'll make between two fifty and five hundred dollars.
Sure, it's great, it's great
You see?
Yes, I signed up for all of these.
I've never got into these things that here there's a lot of in the universities.
Don't trust, maybe they're going to take an organ.
No it's too much.
Sure, no, I was in a room, sequestered, with a needle, let's say
Why? Because they were taking blood? Sure.
Sure, so, and I saw the study they wanted to know, see the times when you have a glucose analysis, if you're diabetic?
Yes.
I don't know if sometimes they give you a they give you something really sweet and they take your blood?
No, they never did this to me, but I've heard of it.
They want to check if it's the same if they give me bread or juice, so one day they give me bread and the other juice.
Look at that.
And you see, the amount of money they spend in trying to find out if it's better to eat ninety grams of bread instead of drinking juice. That's amazing, oh.
They have the grant's money to do that, so that's it.
Sure, no, sure.
I think scientist have money saved to buy telescopes
Hey have it saved for that since, so these
It's okay, I had never taken part of this things, I mean, it seemed too complicated for me, I don't know, it was weird. But that, when, when Mariano mentioned it, we met for lunch just before Christmas
The four of us were talking when suddenly he
Yes.
I was like, how much are they paying you? I though he was going to say, fifty dollars but then he said, two hundred and fifty and I was
Sure.
Where do I sign up, and he sent me the info that same night
I see
So we signed up and now, this is my third call.
Oh, look
So
And you know what happened to me? I spoke with a woman from Guatemala, and she said Were do you work?. I told her
What do they get out of this conversations, what is this for?
Yes
I work there
She told you?
Yes, then she told me that in reality I didn't like it that much, at the end
Why? How is it?
See, for example, Word that has Spanish from Guatemala, Spanish from Argentina, Spanish, Understand?
No, I don't understand, I don't understand, what, what?
See the programs, kind of like Word, that has
Yes.
In the dictionary, of the Spanish of different countries.
Yes.
Well, they want to make a program like translation, and they need to gather information from Spanish.
None
Then it goes to a computer file that they are training to be a good dictionary, understand?
What are they going to do? Because I mean, our our Spanish has nothing to do with the rest of the Spanish of, of other countries
What?
That's the way we talk in Argentina. It's very different to how they talk in Colombia or in Venezuela
They use our talks to gather information
Yes, I knew they recorded it, I mean what I had understood was that it was a linguistic study.
Sure, I thought that it was that.
Nothing else.
Yes. It's more commercial-- Bill Gates must be here.
Ah. And well, what are you going to do? Everything is done for money
Sure, everything to go skiing four more times.
Where are you going to go skiing? By there near Boston?
And near Boston, fifty minutes away, I didn't ski in Buenos Aires, let's say
Yes.
None
Is much more expensive there, or more inaccessible because you have to go up to the south.
Sure, that can, here I have friends with cars, we go in car the closest one is fifty minutes away
How nice.
Yes, for example, and is open at night, then already a couple of times, we left from work early, four in the afternoon
We were skiing until 10pm
How pretty, you know how to ski already? The hand, was it easy to learn?
Look, the truth is I picked up fast, since last winter, yes, I picked it up fast but,ski but now, this winter I'm going to devote myself to snowboarding that they told me was a little more
Look at that, mate, how good, how good. I would like it.
Yes, in a month and a half I'll let you know.
For me, we would like it, what happens is Baltimore is closer than Washington, then it gets harder, but just the same with all the friends we have here
And we have another Argentinian couple that live in Vermont
Yes.
Obviously, there's much more to do in Vermont, but they go skiing all the time.
Sure.
What is their name? They always tell us come visit and lets go skying I really want to
Sure it's okay. I like to do , it allows me to
Yes.
Long for the winter.
Yes. Hold on a second. Yes, it is in my wallet, I think. What was I saying? Oh, yes, about skiing. I want to learn how to do it.
Sure, yes, that would be great. but, I'll tell you latter about snowboarding
I heard that Snowboarding is really good, one of my friends, well he's restless, he's an Argentinian guy from here
His name is Frederico.
Since he skis, it's like you have a lot of things to
Oh, I see
You never stop to try to perfect your skying.
Sure, that can be true, but the ones that practice snowboarding say it's funnier. They never go back to.
Skiing?  Really?
They say it is much more fun.
It seems hard, snowboarding, I believe that even, when they should, I feel like it's easier to learn how to snowboard than to sky.
Sure, no, I don't know, I've never been able to get on a skate
Yes, it is complicated.
So
And the lowest salaries of the country.
None
The move, all my friends tell me I started. The move, the culture, the ones who make the
None
Snowboarding is similar to surfing at the beach.
Yes? Are you serious?
They get into a good time, then I said, let's go to do it. I bought, then they bought
Ah, do you have the snowboard and all the stuff?
No, I say they bought me
None
William, Orlando, Florida
Good evening, Aurelio from Washington DC
How are you sir?
Very well, thanks. What's your name again?
William
William, what's up?, nice to meet you
How are you?
Very thanks, I'm driving here, can you imagine
None
Equity, maybe we could write a book
Where are you from?
I'm originally from Venezuela
From Venezuela
Yes, from Caracas.
The Venezuelan and the Cuban together
Exactly, they're now there with Chavez in the new set
How's equity there in Venezuela?
I will tell you that I haven't been to Venezuela since ninety eight.
Yes
I grew up and lived there. I came to this country when I was twenty four years old.
Wow
There was lots of inequality in Venezuela
Lots
Sure, between the rich and the poor
It's something similar to this country
It ws different because here is has to do with race and over there it has to do with
Yes
The social class
It's about the economy
Exactly, do you understand? In here, at least the ones that don't make much money they can still have some things that the poor people
They will never be able to have the same circumstances as the ones from our countries.
I understand
This inequality it's different here than the inequality from
It's mostly about race, I for example
Religion is something else.
I used to live in Miami for a long time.
Or twenty-four or twenty-five years old and now in Miami you don't really pay attention to race because everyone is
Well they come from the same city, which is mostly made up of Hispanics, if you speak Spanish, everyone can understand you
This is a county of inequality but it's not so much because of the money, like you said, I think that money is the biggest race in this country
Sure.
You make money or you don't make money.
It's true that here in Washington is such that enough money and the race I say .
Yes and the race
Yes, that's another thing in this country. Depends on where you are. If it's here, for example, in Washington looks
Yes
The other day I had to go to the police department because I had an accident recently so I go there to settle some issues
None
It's the first time I've gone to the police department .
The first time in your life.
The first time in my life.
Okay
And the car burned when I was traveling in Italy.
None
When i returned after a week out we saw the car burning
Hell
It would raise and they neutralized it completely, it burned with this thing called paint center
Right, but why is that?
Exactly yes, well it turns out that I had to go to the police look at all the people working there in the police here in Washington all I didn't see any. not even hispanics, all black
None
All black friends
All the blacks same as here in Miami and in Orlando because almost all the mulattoes the blacks you can say so.
They all have the jobs that are in the state, federal, in the city, everyone
None
Here until the coast the girls write on the computer, what they receive
Let him write
The people who pick up the garbage are all of black and mulatto origin.
The same here too, the guy who drives the bus is black, the guy who picks up the garbage is black, it's a crazy thing
It was incredible because not even one Hispanic.
We are waiting behind.
The big concentration of Hispanics in this country are from Central America.
Yes, the majority
The great majority in the area of Washington come from El Salvador or come from Honduras
From Mexico
There are few Mexicans.
This is really surprising
When you go there it's clear that they are from El Salvador.
Let me ask you something, There in the north the total percentage of the city.
What would you say is the percentage of the Hispanic population there?
Sometimes here I would say it's about
Yes
Five percent more or less
Nothing more
Depending on the area where you are. There are parts in Washington that are totally Hispanic, also stores.
The restaurants are Hispanic, you're walking on the street and it seems like I don't know if you've directly seen in El Salvador something like this
Yes you know
You have people selling popusas in the streets
The Hispanic things that we are looking for.
Exactly similar
Yes i well known
Look for me, I'm going to tell you something, I know something else that doesn't get a lot of attention either
No
It's mostly the majority of Americans here thing that I'm Italian.
Yeah?
Yes, there are some who think that I'm Puerto Rican, and there are others who think that I'm Italian. I say no, and they fight for the two.
None
I'm Venezuelan
From the city of Caracas
Yes, exactly, and another thing, I worked for two years, I worked in Radio Shack in a shopping mall
None
A really big mall and I saw that the Arabs who came thought that I was Arabic
They'd start speaking in Arabic and I'd say calm down man.
I am not. But you have never been in Miami, Orlando.
Yes I've been to Miami and Orlando many times, my family owns a
What do you think about Miami?
I love it
Nice, come hear, let me ask you something because I'm quite curious about it, I signed on to join this program but I really didn't read what it was for
Why are they making us do these calls. I'm not sure what I signed up to but it's been a while and I don't remember exactly what it was for.
This is a linguistics study that is conducted by the University of Pennsylvania, no? I'm not sure if it's the University of Pennsylvania or not.
They are trying to do a linguistic studies on how people speak Spanish.
To train these machines that can recognize who is talking
None
Machines that you tell them anything and then
Yes, like when you call Fedex and you just have to speak to the machine and press a
That's the same thing, well, that's what they are trying to do
Wow, but do they do that only with Hispanics or with gringos too?
You can tell a native English speaker by their gringo accent.
Sure
They also included them here so I think there's people that talk to those machines and they have an accent
Be able to recognize the accent someway
That's amazing.
Yes, but it seems to be a very interesting study
I have family in Venezuela, it's incredible!
Really?
I have two cousins, aunt, aunt's husband and two or three people over there and i'm really worried about the situation
None
In Venezuela they're fine, they don't live badly now, and what I want to ask them when we can see each other, when they will come to the United States
They say that they can't in the next ten years get out of there
Things aren't easy right now to come here from there.
The thing is really complicated
Yes, before moving here we came here many times, my dad had a visa.
He's American like to come here, well as a tourist
Sure
But you don't think that it's as easy right now
For what they tell me, imagine living as well as they are living, there's money for things, there's job
Family to keep us mythical
Sure, yes
I personally compare it to where I come from. I lived in Cuba for nine years and so this is, pardon the language, tremendous shit, so what happens when they tell me they're living so well I let them
It's comparing to how they lived in Cuba
Sure
I say damn, you're living so well and you can't come see us, it needs to be a little more complicated than this
Well I am going to tell you something. I was with Cubans here in this country and they tell me that the situation is not very good as it is said
None
They are not well, they are bad and there are others who say that they are well so it is a thing like I tell you it is difficult to
It depends on each person.
It is difficult to generalize
It depends on the perspective of each one, there are people that say the situation is good, we are fine, there is not a problem
Yes the worst maybe the one besides you is all fucked
It is difficult to tell it
What can you do in Washington at night? It's very cold in Washington today.
Yes right now is not so cold, I donÂ´t think about it because if a
Yes
We have thirty seven grades Fahrenheight. That's is like.
Fuck you bet here in Orlando there are forty and I am freezing here the air
Good evening, my name is Martin
Hi, good afternoon, my name is Jorge and I'm calling from
From
Los Angeles, California, where are you calling from, Martin?
Martin from Philadelphia.
And you're Argentinian?
Yes
You're the fifth Argentinian I've called on the phone.
Really?
When was it? The day before yesterday I spoke to another girl from Philadelphia.
It must have been Mariano
No, a girl from Philadelphia that's called Leticia
Yes, Mariano's wife.
What's this?, do you all know each other there?
This couple of friends dragged us into this oppurtunity
Yes
We all know each other. My wife just talked to a girl that was also a friend of Mariano but lives in Boston
Yeah, well.
This is very funny
Did you say that Mariano lived in Boston?
No. Mariano lives here in Philadelphia
Mariano, the interesting thing is that I've been talking with Leticia before yesterday and she tells me
Yes.
The other day I spoke with an Argentinian that lives in Boston
Yes.
Yes, she tells me, and what's her name? Her name is Tamara. She tells me, oh I know her, is a friend of a friend of mine.
Yes.
So we are all well connected. That's good
Yes, no, is that we are
What place of Bue? Are you from Buenos Aires?
Yes, you?
Yes, I mean that, Yes. what place from Buenos Aires are you from? from what neighborhood?
In reality is outside of Bueno of Haedo.
Yes I'm from a neighborhood called Lanus Oeste
Yes.
Valencin, Alcina, but I've been in the United States almost nineteen years.
How terrific.
None
It's been four and half years, more or less.
Pleased to meet you. The topic that we have to talk about, today, this people find such topics
Yes
That make you philosophize
Yes
The subject they want to make us talk about today is equity.
Yes
I think i have never seen in these nineteen years, with all the talks about equity
Yes
None
I find that kinda unbelievable too.
Yeah, and you are seeing that already in.... In these four years you've been...?
Yes
I have really witnessed it a lot with these nineteen years.
Yes
Equity has been discussed for so long in this country, it's been so long since they talk about the good, the constitution of the country, everything
Racial differences are so evident that I never saw that
Yes
Anywhere else in the world
Yes
In Argentina
There is inqeuity in Argentina between the rich and poor.
Exactly.
There's inequality but s not so much. What happens in Argentina with the immigrants. The immigrants arrived and got mixed among everybody and you still see that here on the west coast. The immigrants are from other
From other countries, but here are the same from the same countries that went to  Buenos Aires. The Italians and the Polish and each one has their neighborhood. This is the Italian neighborhood. This is the Polish neighborhood. And, they don't mix.
Even in Philadelphia?
Yes in Philadelphia
When I went to New York
New York also. But in Philadelphia is the same. There's the Italian market and they are all Italians.
None
And they are still fourth generation Italians and are called Italian-American.
None
As if I was called Italian-American simply
Is your family of Italian origin?
Yes but that is third or fourth generation, then
Sure. Me too
Is as if I said I'm Italian and would talk with a strange accent that's why I thought. Then is like it was always very marked
Em from where you come and well, and your origin and everything makes you different and that's why the racial differences are marked also.
Exactly.
I don't know.
You are the third person I spoke to from Philadelphia. The other day a guy from Asuncion told me that in Philadephia
Yes.
A great one. Also I tell you, in parenthesis, if you hear a lot of noise is because I'm making this call from a public telephone.
None
I'm almost next to the street, what happens is that these twenty five calls, I don't know, my plan asks me to make five, I don't know in your plan,
Yes.
In my plan, it asks me to make five calls that are not from my house.
Yes, the same,
This is the fourth time I passed by a public phone.
Yes, they give you fifty dollars more.
I was telling you. The other day I was talking with this guy from Paraguay and he tells me that in Philadelphia
Yes.
I can get to say that the majority or a great majority of the people are of the black race.
Yes. More or less.
Is that also your impression?
Yes, if it's not fifty percent, it is forty percent. The population is very big.
How incredible, right? Look at that.
Yes. It happens a lot here in the cities. New York not so much because it's a huge city and is very cosmopolitan, but even Washington DC or Baltimore which is
In fact we and they are going to move now to Balitmore.
Look how nice
It's also about forty to fifty percent blacks.
Exactly
Is like that.
Have you ever been in Los Angeles?
No
You've never been, In Los Angeles
No.
There are many types of races, basically
Yes.
There are Italians. There are many people of European race.
Yes.
But also other types of minorities abound. Well the Hispanics are very big here in the United States.
Yes, sure.
Especially here in Californina, in Los Angeles.
Yes
Many minorities from Central America.
Yes.
There are a lot of Argentinian people.
Yes.
Every day there are more Argentinian people. There's a big colony
Yes.
Armenians here in Los Angeles.so that they have named one of the areas of Hollywood Little Armenia
Really?
For example, the neighborhood I live in is a big
Yes
Russian immigration
Look at that
Sometimes, you're walking around the block I live in
Yes
And the only thing I hear is Russian.
None
It's very interesting, i think. It's like I was in Moscow, or i dont know where, right?
Sure, yes.
The problem of equity, here in Los Angeles, to be more specific
Yes
They make you feel like they don't have to talk about it much or there's nothing to talk about.
Sure, yes
Arnold Schwarzenegger
Yes, yes!
He's basically racist.
Sure
Against minorities, especially Latin minorities
Yes.
And he has basically declared himself against many of the laws that favored the Latin minorities, especially the Hispanic minorities.
Sure.
He basically is a citizen of the United States, but he wasn't born in the United States either.
No, it hasn't been that long
Because you know that he is German.
He hasn't been an American citizen that long, Yes.
I think he's from Austria
Yes, he is an Austrian.
He is the one that should least talk about those type of things.
Yes.
In class we are analyzing a law in California which may give you an idea you might have heard.
Yes.
That they wanted to give the opportunity of having, how do we say it in Spanish, we call it the driving permit.
Yes, the driving license.
There on the east coast?
Yes I heard a little
Well.
Sure because no in - the federal law doesn't let you get the driver's license if you don't have.
None
A valid visa, basically
Exactly a social security number.
Or social security number, yes.
So a large percentage of the Latin or Hispanic community in Los Angeles don't have valid visas.
Sure
You know there's like eleven million in this country
Yes
That are fighting to correct their legal situation, so he basically
Yes
Spoke in favor against the law
Sure
You see there's a lot of inequities there, another thing that was
Yes
A couple of years ago, here in Los angeles, there was a very famous case about Rodney King
Yes, yes, I remember, yes
Maybe you've heard about. Oh, you were still in Argentina at that time
Yes, I was in Argentina, that was on ninety seven, something like that.
It was a huge mess
Yes
There was an incident and they beat him, do you remember the trial they held for him?, [riots] broke through
Fires were alighted in the Los Angeles area
Sure, because people wanted to protest somehow. Yes.
It was pretty serious, it was huge. I used to live there and it was something so big, was badly destroyed. So, oh, equality.
Is something that in theory sounds interesting but doesn't really exist, equality.
Yes.
In the United states , in many other places
Yes, I agree.
None
It's like-
Hello!
Hello!
Who am I talking too?
Hello, my name is Leticia. I can't really hear you that well.
Excuse me, are you able to hear me?
That's better.
What's wrong? Where are you calling from, I'm sorry?
From Philadelphia.
Philadelphia. That's fine.
And you, what's your name?
My name is Cris, I'm calling from Houston
I can barely hear you
This is Cris from Houston.
From Houston
Yes.
And, what do you think about today's subject?
I think it will be a while before we reach total equality between the sexes and races.
We still have some segregation going on.
Yes.
Types of races
How is Houston in there? What are the bigger minorities over there?
Houston is very diverse; I think that it's one of the most diverse of the United States, including New York
Yes.
Yes there is a big Hispanic presence.
Yeah
Yes, in comparison to others in other states. Because it's Texas, right? it's close to Mexico
Are you Mexican?
Excuse me?
Are you Mexican?
Yes, what do you think?
And I haven't been here long, living in this country. The truth is that I still couldn't live very close
Here in Philadelphia, there's a very big community of African-Americans and no. No, there's so, so many Latinos for example, yes there's a lot of Asians, mostly Chinese.
Yes
The truth is that inequality shows itself. What I see is each one, how they are
The African-Americans between them, the Asians between them,
Sure
And I wonder well, the Latinos take care of it, I don't know, or rather I don't know if it's because there's a segregation or because
The people tend to group together to be a determined minority
Sure.
The truth is that I can't define it; but the neighborhoods are very distinct. I don't know at the national level how
If they contribute for it to be that way or if coincidentally, for example, the Blacks are poorer.
Yes
I guess no
In general
Yes.
I imagine they are
Well I don't know what the government is doing for it to be that way or if it's a problem derived from the society in itself.
Let's put a law that says that we are all equal and we are not going to discriminate.
It's true, when for example, someone is looking for a job, a person from
Yes.
A person of that race
Yes.
In that respect, yes, there's some equality. But the reality is different in my opinion?
No, we are not all treated in the same way. I believe that reality is quite different.
And something that is being shown, they want to make it look like
Yes, sure.
Yes, I was impressed looking for a job.
Nobody states in their curriculum how old they are, what genre,
Sure.
What Nationality, when they got to this country, it's something that one should state
Yes, in your curriculum
Then here nobody asks for those things
Where are you from?
From Argentina. And that grabbed my attention. It seemed good because
Yes, sure
It means that the employer in some way chooses ot by the sex, the age,race, by
Yes, but rather by the abilities no that
Yes.
For being an individual
Yes,that I've been here a long
Easy to socialize with Latins, Spanish, Europeans but hard with Americans.
How long have you been here?
Is the same.
What?
No, I didn't hear what you said.
And how long have you been living here?
And since it would be eight months,
None
I don't know. Do you socialize with a lot of American people?
Of everything.
Of everything.
Yes. Almost no. Well, with people of Indian origin.
Indian. Are there many Indians there?
Yes, well the University that I attend there are you see many Asians and
None
Many white people.
Sure.
I do like to relate with all kinds of people No? To get to know different cultures.
No, it's logical that's interesting, And did you ever feel any kind of discrimination?
Well not directly. I don't remember one  I arrived here and well because of the language no? that
Because of the language.
Isolated. So people discriminate you and they push you aside.
Sure.
Well, at least it's not experienced any type
Yes, the truth is that it's more or less rare here. Because on the other hand it's a country that is so cosmopolitan.
That has so many people that come from other places, I must be one of the most cosmopolitan in the world
It could be?
And I don't know, to tell you the truth. I haven't felt openly discriminated,
You think what it has to do with the country where you come from? Because I have noticed many people
According to the country or the situation, socio-economical of each individual, I don't know if you have noticed that?
Yes
But,that is not only here, but all over the world, right?
Yes, maybe it is related.  They open their doors to everybody, right?
Sure yes. Or even the skin color, right?
It happened to me. I talked to a lot of Asian people who complained about being discriminated. Or mistreated
Where?
I don't know when they go shopping, when they need to process something, they told me they were discriminated. And
And I told them that never happened to me. I have never been mistreated.
Also it may be because of the bad temper of the person, but it is not against me. So, I don't know, that may exist, honestly I don't
If it is.
I think that is to certain people, don't you think so? Some people are very racist, others aren't, don't you think so?
Yes sometimes I hear you so that it is hard to follow the conversation
No, I'll put it louder.
Yes please, because
Do you hear me now?
Yes, that's better
Ok, sorry.
Do you hear it right?
YES
I don't know what happens but
Perfectly. I think is the distance Right?
Yes, I don't know what it is. Are you talking with a hand phone?
Yes.
What were you telling me?
Some people have certain discriminations toward certain groups.
None
Yes,
Don't you think?
Yes. I think that some Asian people, perhaps have said the the African Americans didn't treat them well but
I don't know if its real or not . they are sensitive  Right? Because there are times, that also you have to
Differentiate between what is discrimination and what isn't. Have you lived in the United States for a long time>
Yes, I've been living here seven years
It's been a long time. And always there in in Houston?
Yes.
Do you like it?
No
No, What part of Mexico are you from?
I'm from Cuernavaca, Morelos.
None
Do you know Mexico?
Yes, i know the south
OK
San CristÃ³bal
Let's see
Yucat'an
You see, last time I spoke to an Argentinian boy, and he also knows Mexico, but the South too.
None
Yucatan and Chiapas, all those places in the south
Chiapas, yes
Yes
Hello
Can you hear me?
Hello?
Hello, Silvia here. with whom am I speaking?
I am from my home
I'm,in a suburb of Chicago
I'm in Texas.
It's called, in Texas, very good
It's the first time I've done this. And you?
Yes, no, this is the sixth call already.
Yes?
And I've talked with, it seems that it was four men and two women, and the topics were varied, vary from being able to break up in a couple.
The religion
These were the topics, but no, others have told me that it's not necessary to speak on a specific topic.
I already forgot what the topic was on. the equality, right?
Equality between the sexes
Yeah, or globally, because for me there will always be discrimination. Discrimination against any person who's not the majority there, so
For me, coming here about five years ago, the United States will have for me, more ah, people, ah, mixed with Hispanics and people
Of color, and very few will be people of completely white blood for me
Yes, it will be very rare to find, and from now forward I don't know when
None
And it's been happening for a long time, but as far as equality of the
None
Jobs and that the problem that exists now is that although the women can do the same job as a man
None
They don't pay them the same.
Exactly, that still happens a lot in fact, I finished doing a job, because I do insurance, and they send me to different states to be able to represent the company and its benefits they offer that year
None
And in two or three weeks we are there with thirty of us as employees, and we explain the benefits one on one.
I got to Louisiana and sat with
None
One hundred and sixty people during that period of time and they were whites, blacks, Indians
None
They had French names because that area was Creole
Yes, yes
It was very popular, being Indian
Yes
Very few spoke Spanish. I stayed the same. I thought I was going to learn what was the difference of an Indian and a Mexican
Knowing well that originally we are Spanish mixed with the Indian, but which Indian? I still don't know,
Should I?
I haven't been there a lot
Where are you from
My grandparents are from Mexico but my parents were born in Texas.
Oh, okay
I was raised in Laredo, Texas.
Okay, look
My grandmother forced us to speak Spanish when we were little, when we were around six or seven years old ,and I thank God for that, as I now speak Spanish
I moved to the congregation
Yes
Yes, Spanish to continue and it has been of a lot of help in my job because
None
I was always needed at work. They even pay me more for that. Twenty five dollars more per day as I speak Spanish, so, it was pretty useful to me.
Really? Well, I've been lucky, I
I see
I'm from Puerto Rico.
Okay.
When I got
People from Puerta Rico have an accent
None
None
It was because, when i got here, i found out that no one wanted to give me a job because i had an accent
Right
All these years i have done everything i can to lose the accent and everyone in my house speaks English
Wow
After i've been established.
Right, right
Because I've been here for twenty years
None
I'm starting to use my Spanish again and trying to find more people, because i never, since i got to the United States, I've always been with my husband
Right
How do I say that? I separated from
Right, well, you forget
Latinos, except when I go to Puerto Rico to visit my mom and brothers
None
But aside from that, I'm always with Americans here.
Yeah
It's a habit I have, and everything I have, what I cook, everything's American
Yeah
I don't know what has gotten to me
I've missed from time to time, i need to find more.
None
None
One needs to be able to pass on to our kids and grandchildren
Yes
And those
Yes, my daughter has been interested in learning Spanish and customs and all that,and she's practically the one who has brought me more
Ah, how nice
Again, and in fact I was researching online, to see if I could be an interpreter
Is
I wanted to be certified
None
Because,what is it? now I've been seeing more jobs that need interpreters and all that and that is something that I would like to do, you know
You should do research for the courts because when a person is going to do citizenship papers
Yes
They need attorneys, here is something that is in high demand
Wow
But they said they want you to go to school
Yes, well I found on line here to do I just saw online classes
Oh excellent
They come from Washington, but I don't have to go there, I can do it all on the computer or by phone.
What is the company called?
I'm looking at that. No, I have it at work, I was looking at it at work, I have it in the favorites.
Yes
At work
Okay yeah
I don't remember now, I think it was something like that
Very good, because
I don't remember but
I have been investigating. I found I want to travel to a country outside of the United States.
Okay
And what I did find is that if one goes to teach English as a second language, then I was searching for a Latin country to be able
Teach English so they pay me to travel? but what it has shown through the computer it pays hardly nothing, it's five hundred a month.
Yeah
Or if not they give one housing, a house to share with other teachers
None
They give twenty dollars a day which is very little,i know the advantage is travelling,but
Yes, but in what? Are you telling me you are working with insurance now?
I did it for twelve years of medicare.
None
None
The insurance benefits of the big companies, no? Where instead of them being a great board and announcing all the benefits that they get
The company sits with the person individually with the computer and they show them everything that's free.
Pay, voluntary, voluntary services, and this happens in many different states. I'm almost at home. I'm almost never
You don't have kids?
So mine are twenty five, twenty six years old and I'm forty four, my daughter
Yes.
Isn't a girl anymore, my daughter who's twenty five stays with me, she doesn't have kids, she doesn't have a boyfriend, she goes to work and comes back.
Yes
Every day, I say, this one will stay with me until she's fifty, I can't get rid of her
Yes, you are not married?
Yes, I divorced after twenty years of being married
Yes, now you have time to travel and enjoy and
I want to travel now
Yes
I looked for this little job that brings me to different states and I've liked it a lot because the company pays for everything
Yes
And when I come back well I fix my situation but I have my mom who's almost eighty
Yes
And I like to check with her because it gives me the opportunity to see the states that I haven't been able to see, because I didn't travel in my whole life, only on three or four cruises
Wow
I was able to go to San Juan
Yes
Cumule, in the Caribbean, or to Hawaii, aside from these four trips I haven't traveled at all, but this is where I knew my country, I don't
Know Mexico at all, I don't have family who I know, but all my family is in Texas and there I don't know anyone
None
So I would like to maybe travel as much as possible in the United States with this job
Yes
If the
How did you get into this thing you're doing?
This work?
Yes
In my company they all talk about it. When you see a person from, when you have experience in this area of work
Yes, many talk about what they will do, and now they call it networking.
None
When you stop working and go through the phases
You've been for many years, this is something in the past. The company where I worked for twelve years, they treated us really well and paid us well.
When the government didn't want to pay for the HMO, then they really cut down on us.
Yes
They already cut our officers from five to one and now they offered us packages to leave.
None
The ones that couldn't live with that cut were
Hello
Hello, good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
My name is Elena.
My name is Rodrigo from New York.
Hello, how are you?
Good, and you? Vancouver?
Yes
Is very far
Yes, are you Chilean?
None
No I'm spanish.
Oh, how do you know by the tone of the voice?
Yes, I have a good ear and many Chilean friends
You already know.
Yes, and I've talked with many people from Latin American so immediately immediately I hear the tone of the accent.
Yes, that's what happens when one already talks with a couple of people. You already know the tone and all that. I also know Spain, I lived in Madrid.
I'm from Madrid.
Yes I knew Madrid. I was in plaza of Spain in the, train stations, in collao and all that, I liked it there a lot.
I was there two months.
You there on vacation or for work?
Yes, I went on vacation and took photos in the little castles.
How long have you lived in the United States
Yes, I've been living in the United States for two years.
And are you going to stay there, or no?
Yes, now I'm thinking of staying.
You like it
Yes, I like it because I came, like I told you, two years ago and now I've gotten used to it.
Sure
I started studying and start a little business and now i got sued to it. i like having come other times.
None
Twice before. But this time I want to stay.
Super. How great.
Yes
And the business,is it going well?
Yes. It's a business that we Chileans have here in New York, that's about pineapples, selling this, mani, cacho, almonds, and all these things
None
I don't know if you know New York.
No, I don't see why is it particularly a Chilean business or
Because those who started the business were Chilean, so now the company has grown and yeah, there are others from other countries but those who started the company were Chilean.
What are dry fruits?
No, did you see that? What do they call it? Peanuts or things that are cooked with fire in a fogoco
You pour water and sugar, you warm them up and they sell
Yes, what we in Spain call garapiÃ±adas [sugar-coated]
That, that's it, sugar coated
None
We put sugar and honey on it
That's very tasty look at that
That's what we sell, and that's my business, i live from that
None
I have an apartment and i have my business
That's wonderful because it's just that New York is very
Cold?
It's very expensive
Yes, life here in New York is expensive
Have you been in other places?  I was living here in California and the truth is
Week ago, I was in San Francisco and I love it.
Yes
Yes, that's
No, the places i know here are only in New York and New Jersey
Have you never thought to go to California?
It is said that there are many Hispanic and many laws, many things I donÂ´t like a lot.
Yes, I don't know. Well, the truth is that, I was, the firs time I went to the United States I went to the east coast and I like most the west coast. Because of the weather, the people, for the
The quality of life. Inside the United States is much quieter, people are least materialistic and
Yes to me, where I would like to go is to Miami, live there in Miami.
Yes you can go
Because of the weather.
Because of course
You know that in New York is very cold. We have almost eight cold months.
Yes
And we only have June, July, August with hot and others are colder. Right now is cold, it begins to snow and all that stuff.
Have you heard today's topic that was put
The equality
Yes have you notice?
Yes
That inequality in the United States
There is much difference.
None
There is much difference when a person is an immigrant and comes from another country now. The single women.. they donÂ´t want them to come anymore
None
Mexicans, one died, one was killed short ago.
Yes
I find that there is not equality here, so much injustice.
Yes
Because if Mexicans come and jump is because they want a better future for them, for their families, for their kids.
None
The people in it, I don't like it.
Immigration, they also are dancing that, they treat them bad as the worst. I found that is not fair I donÂ´t like it
None
I do not think that there is equality here.
I think that it does not exist. Equality never exists
No.
A better thing, right? I know that I have seen for example in reference to Latin countries including Spain for example between men and women
No
There are more differences in Spain than in Cali, Canada, or the United States because in Spain, the woman
Because she is a woman she has less work, she is less paid and, besides that, also the job offers, and in Chile is the same.
They ask you questions that in Canada and the United States are forbidden. For example, your civil state, what is the other one, and things like that
In  the United States would never ask you if you are an illegal, in Spain they still ask you. The curriculum, I donÂ´t know if you call it like that in Chile
None
You have to put your picture. There are jobs where they require you to be younger than thirty, so there is age discrimination, there is sex discrimination,
And there's also, discrimination of race, right?
In Chile a woman wants to work in a supermarket that says, needed cashier up to twenty five years old.
Sure
Security guard up to thirty five
None
They put the age already by that limit you are already bigger, older, you can't opt for that job.
Yes is the same
None
I have a friend. His look is interesting, the opposite in your case. He was living in the United States for ten years.
He had his papers
Okay
But he didn't like it, he didn't like the United States and at the end has gone to live to Chile, he's been there already three years
I'm not sure how he's been doing since he was exiled from Chile and went to France
And then was living in the United States.
Sure.
And it was quite hard for him because he didn't know the language. Did you speak the language when you came to
No, I just recently started learning because I'm going to school to learn English.
None
Yes, it's hard, but you know that here the people are understood well. It is not impossible, I work just the same, in English.
Sure
Do you know what I didn't like about Spain? That I wanted to work in Spain and if I didn't have the job offer, I couldn't work
Sure
Job
If you don't mind,
No, ask me anything you want
Yes, what did you, what did you work on in Chile?
I worked at one of those markets
In Spain you can get a work permit because, for example, I know many girls that work.
Babysitting and they give them a job offer
Yes, i tried to get that job offer, but it was almost impossible, right?, it costed a lot, so i was there for two months and my ideas was to go
From Chile to do my life in Spain, but I went with two more friends. We were three
Yes.
And we were four
Right
Two stayed and two came. My other friends stayed there as well.
In Spain
Others in Spain
None
We went there on like two thousand and two.
Right
They have three or four years here and I think one resident.
What are they doing for work?
Having no papers they went to work in the fields to harvest the olives or
In southern Spain right? Almeria
Yes, but I did not like had a theater workshops
Yes
But when I saw the boss he didn't want to pay
It happens without shame.
I wanted to pay because their passports and held me all that I did not
I have family members here.  Excuse me a moment to say hello to Mary and give her a hug.
Your dress can you give me a kiss? I'm talking on the phone, but I have to go now, okay?
We are celebreating the cinco de mayo, iÂ´m sorry January
Yes that day
The three kings day
We celebrated yesterday with rosca
Fact
Rosca de chocolate (chocolate bread)
A chocolate cake
Yes
I've been here about ten days and I have not spoken to family members.
I'm gonna keep doing this, right?
How many calls have you made already?
I have around five, and you?
I have four or five
OK
I want to finish already, I told the operator, Can they call me three, four times a day?
She said no, it's only one a day, it's one a day, right?
I don't know, sometimes they call you more, it depends, if you have the call or not, but it's interesting, the truth is that you get to know people and you can see a little bit about the
The differences, right?, and, do you have friends in New York?
Yes, i have lots of friends here in New York, i have lots of mexican, dominican, puerto rican friends, I have everything
Yes
I'm one of the few Chileans that hangs out with them. I hang out with them because i don't quite get along with my race, which is chileans
No?, but why not?
It's like a very... like very envious people
None
None
Yes?
Sometimes you have a little bit of, of people from your own country, and you find friends in other countries that are better
None
It's not the same
Expensive, In Chile always, The Chilean people yes, have always been people very they have always given me the sense that they helped a lot.
Yes, we
They helped a lot among themselves and were very cooperative.
Yes that is true. We for example, the Chileans
None
We give them and where are you staying? Come stay here, you haven't eaten? We will make you food. We are like that.
None
We are very, loveable with the outsiders.
None
In the United States, they are not like that, it's very cold.
Sure
You come from outside and the people distrust you, they donâ€™t open the door, they donâ€™t give you a glass of water, they donâ€™t help you at all. Here one doesnâ€™t know the neighbor.
Okay
No, doesn't know how, that lives, no, they don't even know each other. I've been here in this apartment a year and a half and I don't even know all my neighbors.
None
I don't know them.
You
I live in New York.
Okay
In Manhattan.
Wow.
Yes, I like it here.
Sure I, you like it? sure, here, what happens in
You're in Canada, no?
Yes, in Vancouver, I told you, I lived in the United States
Yeah
Yes, I like it a lot, I'd go to live there but in terms of visas and everything, I can't get the green card. I was working legally
Yeah
My husband is from h ere. That's why we have visas today, because it's his family and, they're Canadian so I came here and I've been living here for two and a half, almost three years.
You are Spanish and your husband is Canadian.
Yes, yes but we're going to Spain
Yes
I always say we're going to Spain. Now starting in January, a course on import export and well, if I find a job I'll stay a bit but
In theory in September we'll go back to Spain.
Here in the United States, many Spaniards came to try their luck here because your country is good.
Yes, there's more in the United States, I don't
Hello
Hello yes a pleasure, my name is George calling from New York
How are you, George?
What?
What? yes I'm Antonio, I'm in Florida
How are you Antonio? How is it going?
How are you? fine, getting into the matter, I hear you.
Yes this about the inequalities, right.
Of inequality, discrimination, integration, all that fits there.
There's a lot of that, right
Yes,
I tell you let's see.
How long have you lived here?
Me is five years. You?
Always in New York?
New York.
Very good
How long have you been here?
I've already been here eight years and I lived in New York a while.
Yes
Yes
Got tired of the cold.
Well, so tell me your impressions
Man let's see, well there's inequality because of the economic issue but also there are inequalities
Yes
I think here that is almost, almost opportunity for everyone, true.
Yes
If you put in effort, there are opportunities, but many people don't bother to take advantage to overcome inequality.
I mean one part depends on the system
Correct
Of the government, of the people themselves and another part well man if I feel unequal, well I try to improve myself and get ahead.
Correct do you come from Colombia?
Yes I'm from Columbia
Me too
Yes What part?
Yes, from Medellin.
Maria, well you don't talk paya anymore.
Eh, barely. Where are you from?
I was born in Ibague but I lived in Bogota for more than twenty five years
It is good and very close to Bogata.
Sorry?
That Ibague is also really close to Bogota.
They're like three
It's very close, there in the neighborhood.
Yes
No, well, I agree with you, this is the land of opportunities
Yes
The evidence shows discrimination is crazy in some regions.
I don't know if you know that in Europe there are countries
Yes
That by constitution
None
A nationalized foreigner can't occupy public office
Yes
Imagine you have immigrants since they've been here to prepare. Here the only preserved office is
The President and the head of the Supreme Court.
Yes, the rest, everyone can have any office
That there's people, there are many success stories.
Yes
There are people who have a lot of prejudices.
Yes
In ours it's not so much the color of the sking but their status.
Yes
Bogota north south such enormous differences
None
And how the ones from the south there's no integration and and there's not much access to certain places.
It might even be possible to find more racist people amongst the Latin and the Black populations themselves rather than amongst White people
I mean that
Americans
Yes is that many times
Very racist, that the Puerto Ricans, the Dominicans, the Mexicans
Each one starts to put their country above,
Yes
In that vicious cycle
None
In a city like New York for example.
Yes
What as far as the integration?
No New York, since there are people from all over the world and there's a place for everybody.
Really
But definitely well like each region is, is closed. I don't think there's much integration. Suddenly one sees the Asians, the Chinese
The Hispanics and within the Hispanics the amount of groups there are each group is closed.
Yes
Basically, it seems to me that there is very little integration.
Correct that's also what I witnessed, but above it all you can
None
Say something grandiose. There is the coexistence, together but not in each other's pockets. They are not killing themselves because of race issues. And there are people from all over the world.
Yes.
Then there are places where
Yes
You say there live people exclusively of one ethnicity or race or region.
None
Yes, they coexist.
Yes, no and for example one finds for example in the English classes those types of things
Yes
I see many people that like the same, I try to integrate with Russians, with Japanese, yes and I've never found any type of rejection, within those people or nothing like that.
None
Is correct.
I think if one wants it one can do it, a lot of the racism and those types of things is a little bit of ignorance of the people.
None
Yes definitely the people, I see how ignorant the people are, that the first thing they put is the color I've had black friends, yes
Yes
People tell me And how do you understand black? no, I have friends two three, but And they have been like special with me, and I say, I don't know
One has to know the person
Yes definitely, exactly, I also think the same, that the people that put their racial prejudices or any other type ahead, are very low people.
Yes
Definitely you have to go further, man, why not see someone at the end for their values, for what they think, for what they do
None
Not just for the color of the skin.
Yes
Yes but unfortunately that's how it is. Just look
None
What just happened in France, where
None
They themselves had put a blindfold saying that everything was fine, everything fine, and everything wasn't fine.
None
It seems they have some belts almost of misery and they never wanted to see them.
And you would never hear
That all they talked about this country you know that in general the Europeans are always knocking on the gringos.
None
There I saw some documentaries from the Spanish television, done over there not from the gringos,
Yes, I was surprised with that.
With the ghettos that the gypsies have in the
Yes
All central Europe and especially in Hungary, Romania, they don't want to see the
None
Any misery neighborhood in our country is more than that
Yes
In Europe they close their eyes and say everything is perfect.
I really didn't have any idea of that situation
There you do notice a certain racism of the other where the people are not allowed, to advance socially.
Yes definitely the inequalities are the same in all the countries of the world maybe in some is more deeply rooted, or in some they cover it up, or in some they manipulate the situation
Yes, because inequalities, definitely in all part-here. One I admire when ones goes to certain part of the country
Is true.
I dont see shacks in the agricultural states
Also
Yes, I didn't imagine.
Yes, one.
None
In his country
Yes
Everybody lives very well. Well at least all the whites
No, I've seen many people that
Sure because there's also other people that I've known that don't care
Yes
Make a fortune, that's not their life ideal Then they live and survive but
Yes
They are not interested in sacrificing tim, to make money, that is what's happening last.
Yes, here there's not a culture of saving, of making capital, that many people live
Many people yes, well obviously, they do dedicate themselves to capitalize
Live no, yes.
There are others  that you have to respect. People that don't care say no, I'm not going to change years of life, precious time to enjoy submerged in money.
Yes but let's say in our countries, for example in Colombia everybody has a goal, their house, their savings, the education for their kids
Yes, like everybody has the same but not here. Here there are some that businesses or make money without caring too much about stepping on whoever.
None
Correct
Another sentence that doesnt make sense to me
For the mone. But yes you couldn't say they were unhappy, perhaps they are happy like that.
No yes, no, they don't worry about that situation they live there day to day, yes
I know there are people that are fine like that.
None
That is
But the problem is that this country goes around with it's head down and so then the people aren't watching that, because
Yes the last couple of years have been difficult
Because
What country is that?
Here, nothing is going to happen
No yeah that's not that the stories that they tell that they tell those that came here forty years age, that's not no
Yes
That they would go out in the street and the bosses would fight for them
Yes, not right now, right now right now for example top executives, executives who rare fifty, fifty five right now there are a lot of people in the street
Yes
Here with the pension plans, there are a lot of employees that are wanting to file for bankruptcy
Yeah that has been huge, that was an enormous tragedy
THEY TAKE THIS FUND THAT TRUTH, NOT THE PEOPLE WELL YES I HAVE BEEN READING STORIES OF PEOPLE THAT WERE NOT USED TO IT AND EACH TIME THEY WERE CHANGING JOBS GOING UPWARDS
After two and three years the situations getting worse
You see that, right?
None.
Addendum to this What do you think about interracial marriages or interracial couples?
It's hard between some, between some races I've read a lot about cases where, especially people married to Arabs.
None
It is a difficult case for the family due to the submissive nature of Chinese women
Yes specially for women, right
Correct
For women from here from women from, married to to people from middle east, it is difficult.
Sometimes they don't bother doing a little research.
Yes I have a daughter
They take very unpleasant surprises.
I don't think they are able to free themselves
Like prisoners, thatÂ´s correct

Marriage, what do you think about it?
No, i don't know, i don't know, I'm single, i won't marry, No, no, neither crazy nor drunk, so, no
If you fall in love
It hasn't happened to me so far, because i like to date many women at once, so that's a problem
Oh, well, but you're a crazy ladies man
Sure, yeah, a ladies man, yes
None
Sure, but I will still have a good time.
Fun?
That's why I'm single and i want to stay single
What? You go out and never
Yes
You never get oh, it'd be nice to live with someone who makes me company, right?
I always have someone who keeps me company
You're lucky then.
Are you married?
What?
Are you married?
Yes
Oh, do you like to live in marriage? Hello?
Hello
Yes
No, an, i don't know, yeah, it's good at first, and later, i don't know, the routine
It wears out in time, right?
Dude, i don't know if you're so lucky
That's why I'm not going to marry. I don't know if I feel like it, right? In time you wake up.
Everyday and there's the same person next to you, that's
Yeah, a bummer, yes
That's why I want to be single. How many years have you been married?
Three
Oh, but it's not too much, you're like, you should be like still on your honey moon.
No, but a year and a half goes by right away and then the problems, the coexistence, you see, it's not the same.
Boring
Yes
It gets boring
I don't know it's not torture
But, you're plan on separating now, right?
No, I'm comfortable, the guy has a salary, and i don't know, you see?
You've married a wealthy man
Yes.
This is good
Yes, he's older than me.
That's good.
A big man, yes, sure.
None
No, but he's a good person, isn't, he's
None
None
Is this man very big?
None.
What age are we talking about?
Fifty five.
How old are you?
Twenty eight. No, I lied, thirty three.
Thirty three. Yes, that's good. And with time this will be a problem. Have you thought about this?
Yes I don't know, love, you know. this never happened to you.
No, for now I'm thinking about, in what you say, what do I know, for example with, with sex, when this person is eighty you will be
Forty, you will be a young thing
Yes.
And what are you going to do?
And I donÂ´t know.
Sure is complicated, not everything is the money, no, the money doesn't fix everything.
No, it better not , it better not
None
But it helps.
Sure, I can imagine, to the topic of the day, which is the marriage of different races, do you have any race
In particular with whom you would have liked to have gotten married to or is not, is not, is not an option for you?
No, I never thought about it, I have nothing against any race.
I don't mean against, I mean in favor that you like one race more than the other for the future, no since this man is older, perhaps one day
And no, and don't tell me that.
You have the option no, but with good vibe, I don't know. Perhaps this poor man one day
I don't want to think about those things
Leaves you the bank account all in your name. I expect to be alone in life.
And I don't know, but then you tell me something. I start to find you way.
Sure, it could be.  Well, you can give me your mail, so that perhaps in the future we can connect,
No, but I'm married. How am I going to give you my mail?
Let's keep talking of the races, do you like any race?
The, and the interracial marriages, what you know any?
Of the marriages?
Interracial like that one, is of one race.
Yes, I have some friends, yes. The girl is Chinese and the guy is African American.
How weird.
The Chinese girl is happy, yes, it's going well.
She's happy? And he's also happy?
Yes she is happy. No, I don't know the African American.
You don't know him.
Honestly no, but the girl goes, she's a co-worker, and she goes happy to work.
Look
You can see that
Look at that, but is weird
That this
They don't mix that much, I mean not usually, is Chinese with whites or blacks with whites, but not
None
Chinese with African American
Yes
Look at that.
They look like they are in love, right?
Do they have kids?  How are the kids?
The couple, I don't know. The kids came out beautiful, yes.
How are they? are blacks or are whites, how did they come out? Because that mix is strange.
They came out black like that, but with the, short, short. And with Chinese eyes
None
I don't know if the word would be beautiful
Strange.
I don't know. yes.
Look at that, look how incredible. how nice that, I love that, I love for the races to mix.
Let's return to the topic of marriage, what are you not happy with in your marriage
I didn't say that
You weren't happy you had told me.
Yes, but I don't know, yes, you're right.
That is boring, for me marriage it doesn't exist because I don't know, I don't know for a person like me that likes women so much, going out partying, going out at night.
No?
Yes, what do I know. I don't know.
Sure, and like I have it apart, just in case I, don't plan on marrying at any moment.
Never say never. In a few years, married with five kids in love.
No
You say that now?
No, knock on wood. No, I don't think it would happen to me. I don't think it would happen to me. I don't think it would happen to me.
Let's see.
I still haven't found.
I've known many who think like that have ended, look
I haven't met my match.
What a modern difference yours
Yes, I'm a guy.
Man no, great, but I was telling you, that I have a friend
So your husband is very old, no, let's keep talking about your husband, yes.
No, like that of my friend of, like that of Mar del Plata, Argentina, where I'm from.
None
A crazy womanizer, was never going to get married.
No, sure.
In a year, met a girl and after a month he announced he was getting married.
And what race was the girl?
White.  Same as him
Really?
Yes.
One that is kind of short?
That's in Philadelphia, also, yes.
Yes, I know her, what's her name? I don't remember, that she has her head full of curls.
You know everybody.

All the mines, they look at him. Yes, I do play football all the time, I love to play.
None
None
Great, the Chine one?
I do know her husband.
None
Not the girl she's short. A thin one that has a lot of...what do I know?
Don't be mean.
She's  nice.
She is cute in my opinion, I think she's really cute.
She's kind of short.  She's too short for the guy, my friend.
Yes.
I know who he is, yes.
I don't know, the thin one, are we talking about the same guy? Does he has big ears? Big ears and a big head?
Does it has what? no, we must be talking about a different guy, I don't think so, he doesn't have a big, what do I know.
It's Pablo, Pablo is his name.
Yes, I don't remember.
It seems to me, no and nothing, he's not ugly, no? But he's not that handsome either, no?
No, so it's not the same. What I say is no. Someone who already has a big facade.
Yes, it should be the same
You're not sure? That your orientation
Sorry?
You're not sure in your orientation? You don't want to get married, a boy who seems cute
This why I'm pretty deviant, you say?
I don't know.
I don't think so
And my boss, who i work for is German and she's married with an African man
How did the kids come out? Like almost coffee with milk.
Pretty, they're really cute, they're yes, she had two little kids.
None
And,
But, what color were the kids? I say.
They didn't come out
Coffee with milk.
Yes, coffee with milk.
How crazy.
Yes, and they have, but they're very cute, they're very, very cute.
She's happy?
Yes, she's happy.
That's so good.
I know another couple like that, but I know an American with a Mexican but that's no interracial anymore.
What do you mean, it's not? It is
Yes, also
Sure.
Yes.
None
No, those are the only ones I know, they are also doing well.
That's good, man, do they have kids?
Yes. No they haven't.
Oh well, I don't know what else, no, I wanted to ask if you wanted to send me your email, phone number, or something.
I see that we are now, we could get together with your husband and with
None
Become friends, what do I know!
No, I don't know, we'll leave it to faith, we might
Does he play football?
Fisher, might get us together, no?
Oh, no I don't think it's by chance but that's fine.
Come on, you don't believe in anything, you don't believe in marriage, you don't believe in leaving things to chance.
No, I don't think so
What do you believe in?
No, i don't believe in a lot of things, but it's not that I'm mean, no, i'm telling you, I'd prefer if you gave me your phone, your mail, something to connect
Yeah, look, don't get mad, don't get mad, but no, no
No, I'm not mad
I don't think it's okay, i'm married.
You told me that you're not very happy
We still know people in common, you say you know this , great girl who's Argentinian
Who?
Maybe some day. This curly-haired girl, maybe someday she'll introduce us. I'm gonna ask her'
No, she's bitter, so no
You say no?
I'd rather you didn't name me, no
The girl is cool. I liker her a lot.
Not at all
Maybe is not the same
Not everything is what it seems
None
No
I'm not going to give you my phone or mail. Can we keep talking about the subject of the day?

All of that. I don't know if i want to, i don't know
Okay.
Is that, the things in the car.
Same use many things, right?
For the plants the food the cushions. And the luggage. That's only a couple of trips say
Okay, But can I help you?
Yes. Let's say the food would be outside. I take it almost. Or I don't take the food up and I have to take the car. I don't know how I'm going to do it because
The issue is that I was looking this thing in where it comes out that is Lombard Street is near the and I don't want to go walking.
In other words, be one point six miles
From Where?
From home
No. In Baltimore, you don't manage walking.
I'm going to get the car, I'm telling you.
Yes.

And I'm not going to take everything out because there's nothing in the car. It is not and they take it out. You take out everything and for some coins for a while, you take out the permit. Did you take out the permit?
Permanent if they let you. And if they don't let you, even seeing a visitor's permit that probably exist. It exists everywhere.
Yes. something
I mean a little more expensive but there's no problem.
I forgot to whom I signed the check.
Well now I'll sign it already.
What was I going to tell you? And after this I went to the house and I don't know if it's the Marquez. If I have time tomorrow I'll go to the police and if not
Tuesday morning. I already fixed this so everything in fixed of the four. In all its ways. The four or the five.
Four thirty to five and if it's getting dark I don't want to be outside.
No, better not.
I don't think that I'll be able to do everything. If I go back, I
Yes, what did they say about this part of the permit?
That of the police.
None
That also stay but I don't know where. That the thing is the permit.
Well, the police on Tuesday. It's cold
Yes, I also can't do this today, I tell you I'll do everything tomorrow.
That's good.
He's in Baltimore already.
Yes.
After I'll call you to let I'll tell you what I did or didn't do
Good.
I suppose, but with the telephone, because it's tomorrow.
Perfect. yes. Perfect.
You're on the telephone.
It doesn't matter. I can also use it tomorrow. It can connect to

The phone, the DSL, they're more likely to send you a package
OK
You can try. I'm telling you people think that way you're going to have half
You have this they're sending them to plug you with
Oh, and Netflix? It still isn't
No, I wanted to do that but we didn't

Yes
Something around there a bit quiet i mean during the morning and it's ten to twelve the way to CRUMB and back
It might be, yes.
I went every day before eight a.m., the show starts at eight.
Life is good, yes
And I thought about that on the way back.
Yes. I have to leave still, round trip.
To see
They have posters in that areas to signal in which stop you need to get off
Yes
Oh, they have posters that take you there in
It's okay.
Since ninety five.  And in the way back too.  Since the ninety and then the ninety five you are just going to drive

Yes to the South.
Where were you going in the morning
To the South of Balitimore. It's before.
None
Kind of.

None
And have a coffee or something.
This would be bad.
None
Not like that, but
I want to relax. I don't want to be turning around a lot.
No, it's good. Try it with that and also with the antenna. Did you keep it?
Yes, before. Yes, I erased it.
It's the same. I plug in the white one to the wall and the TV, I plug it in the same place.
Where was the antenna? Wow, you're helping me. Aye, important. I can't hang up. Aye, it was something hurt in the apartment. A little. Look UNBC
I will check if it will hang up
Yes
On its own.
Yes I don't know. Sorry?
Fascar?
It will be this.
Charge it in the car tomorrow too.
After the last one take it and they have to charge you.
That's fine, but because I have to pay the tolls and all that, and
Yes
I need something, just in case.
I still tried to pay with the debit card and no
Yeah
Like that, not to keep
I don't know if I'm gonna go to the mall at any time. I guess, on Tuesday or wednesday. I can barely hear you.
Yeah, no, i pour the sauce and the noodles and i have choclo and that stuff; no, yeah, not that, if you want me to wait for you to go to the super, i don't know
Yeah, but we need to buy food for the weekend, the girls are coming. Sure, I don't know how long it will take us to get back, maybe there, the mall near
Home, with the car. I come and go.

Yes
You say that they have a number, for example, they start late, like after twenty or something, they start on the other side of the station, the parallel
None
Yes
Yes
That you have three or four over there without order
It's OK
The flag goes up to the north, right?

That's good. Same, nothing's happened to me during the day. What was I going to tell you? I think that it's all going to be OK. I dont' know.
And here I have a moment.
A step forward
Good luck getting them to do that
Return to
It's good. The money, yes. The money that they give you.
It's not worse until they give us back the deposit.
Until what? yes
There are things. There are the view seats, Like insurance.
Yes. I have to go to the baby soon. you don't see many service stations in Baltimore.
I remember one. The North
Yes you have to ask
No.
Ask the guy at the entrance, the guy at the gate knows everything.
Yes, still twenty five dollars .
Hello, I'm Rodrigo from New York.
Mirian from Florida
Hello,
Hello,
Tell me, but you're calling from Florida.
Sorry?
Where are you calling from, Florida?
Yes, from Florida
Yeah,
Yes, what do you think about the topic?
The topic of today
None
Well I agree
Yes
I agree that people who want to come to find a new future, who come to this country and it's a good that everyone who comes.
I don't agree with this big wall they are building against Mexico.
Yes,
You, what do you think?
I think the same, that everyone
None
He came, the majority of people come for a better future, to have a better economic life, to help their family, from the country they come from, and here this country
Help people to have this opportunity. They give them the opportunity, including my dad who was an immigrant, for many years. Now thank God he's making enough money.
Yes this is good. Have you been living here for a long time?
Yes, I've been here fifteen years
You're used to it, you like it, no?
What did you say?
You're already used to it if you like to live here in the United States
I love it. I went to Mexico and I love to go, but only on vacation. You're already used to it here, going to live there again, I don't think
I would be comfortable. It wasn't the same when you've been living in a country and you've adapted to the culture of that country.
Sure what happens is that people
You know?
People get used to a level of life. You're already used to living here in the United States. And after going to live in Mexico, since you
You would only like to go to visit because you're used to living here yes
None
The same happened to me, I lived in Chile
Yes
My parents came from Chile, but I'm used to live here too
Have you been here for many years?
No, I go and I come back, I come and it's like the fourth time and now I'm here again, yes.
I understand. I'm Mexican and going back to Mexico, I don't think I could do it.
My dad cooks No, don't think that you can go back to your country and get used to living there, right?
But yes, no, not any more, I would not be able to get used to it again any more.
Yes it's hard to get used to it, and that's why I'm telling you, I think that this country gives many possibilities of
Yes,
Like what they call here the American Dream, so everyone that wants to come here and I think that's good. Give an opportunity
What one earns in a day, sometimes a person makes that over there in a week
Then so used to a way of living
Sure
That and a hundred dollars a week.
None
No, we wouldn't be able to live.
No because you know that here
No, I mean It would be difficult for us
None
For us to get used
No, here one can earn a hundred dollars daily. Over there I tell you they earn it in a week, as you say Eh, one has to get used to that standard of living.
Exactly, yes
Yes,
Imagine it's be, rather the country
Yes
What damage
Exactly, I don't know why those men
Personal
Mean men I don't know what they are called Who are against the
Yes
We come to contribute to the country.
The labor and production
Yes
They aren't coming to do harm.
It seems that I heard that
There are so many racist people pardon
It seems, I heard that, the founder of that organization
None
Is an immigrant
Imagine that
Hhow can an immigrant do that to his people, understand,
Yes, I also know that
When
There were some Mexican people that were saying they were like accusing, they were in charge of looking for people that were coming through they themselves
Being Mexicans or from Mexican parents that are into that too, how can they be like that.
None
That's not all right.
All Hispanics do the jobs that Americans reject.
Sure
And that
Just imagine how it would be without them.
It's everything this country doesn't want, they don't want to acknowledge the fact that they need the immigrants and that's why sometimes, they do grant asylum to people, to people from countries like El Salvador.
Sure, that's why they don't want to acknowledge the fact that they need them, yes
Yes, so, for example, this lottery thing, have you heard about the visa lottery?
Yes, the
Yes, it includes lots of countries that have been excluded from the lottery, I mean, because, they chose to let in some countries and leave some out
What happens is that, the, they include them because they have already filled their quote, they have a quote for example, there are lots of Mexicans, so we have lots of Mexicans
They don't want to let in more Mexicans, so that's why the are left out but, there's still a
They also leave the Salvadorians and Hondurans out
Yes
Guatemalans.
Yes, because I don't know how this works so they I believe they fill their quotes and they need foreigners from this country
They don't need more. I don't know. I only know that Chile is not excluded from the list.
How?
I the only thing I know is that Chile is not excluded, no, we can
No
Well, before it was very easy for us to come to the United States. You got a visa, anyone who had a good job, who had a
Regular economical situation got one, but now it is almost impossible. Now for a Chilean to come to the United States, he has to be almost millionaire
Yes.
A long time ago he got the visa
What?
He got his visa a long time ago.
I got it in the year ninety-four
It's a long time ago
The important thing is to keep you coming and going. They give it for six months or one year, and you must respect that date
And that's it
Yes, but it is nuisance travelling there. Every six months spending on two way passages is expensive
The idea is staying here for a while, but it's illegal.
None
I told you, from Mexico it is also difficult to get a visa to come here
Yes, really difficult.
Too much vigilance
Even, in my country, it was easier for a person who was studying in the university. Regular students from the university applied for it and got it.
He may come to stay
Yes So many people opt to leave the hard way also hello, okay
Yes
It's hard but they come and opt to leave the hard way
I can't hear you because there's too much noise around you.
You can't hear well
No, it's all the noise in the background
Okay, hold on.
I can hardly hear
I'm going to move to another room to talk.
Do you have a party there?
Hello
Are you having a party?
Yes A little party of the magicians, that we 're still going with the magician's party and Now yes. Now you hear me fine right?
Yes. Okay.
Now I came to the room, yes
Better yes than no. For example, they want to build the wall which will divide Mexico and the United States.
But the funny thing is that the Mexicans think that the Mexicans themselves are going to do that because they can pay them cheaper and the
Yes, I understand. He found the bar, but the cafe for the Mexicans
Near the border, what you see is the immigrant. An American is not going to work for five or six dollars an hour
No
They would have to have a great need, and then, unfortunately, the Mexican or immigrant would have to
It is like an irony that they themselves have to build their own barrier
Yes, that is what I was saying
Their own wall
I heard in Primer Impacto the other day fashion shoes, been sold in New York, in New York
Yeah
They are being sold around two hundred dollars each pair, and the designer of those shoes went and gave them as a gift to immigrants
Yes
Because she made a promise, and the immigrants have very expensive shoes, and here americans paid around two hundred dollars to have that pair of shoes
Yes I saw the all terrain shoes.
I suppose they have a compass
Yes
Like air under them
They were all terrain shoes, prepared to cross without a problem
Yes, those are the shoes. How funny that an American has to pay $200 for a pair
Yes
Those illegals are going to have the shoes for free. All is an irony in life right now
There are some things that also help. For example,
This
I have friends that They have, they work with a cart, so they sell on streets Yeah And time ago that person could have a license
Now a law was enacted, after October, November That the person that doesn't bring papers Can already get their license, the only thing they need to get is the Tax Id
Yes
Yes
Yes, because
So already
Yes, I heard that the immigrant couldn't get, for example, a license because the process became harder in light of terrorism
Yes, And that more than anything had affected the immigrant a lot All, all the terrorism that there is that there's been lately, the attacks and the threats
Has affected the whole nation whether you're an immigrant or not, because still
Sometimes I think that is too much
Yes, but they are doing it for your security, of your family and mine
Yes
And certain things are good, for example in the airports. I don't know if you have traveled lately but in the airports
No
Sometimes you canÂ´t even carry a razor
No
In the cabin Because they take it away They wouldn't let you carry it.
Now they are allowing the use of scissors again.
No, that I haven't heard
Doris
Maria, hello
Yes hello good afternoon
Yes good afternoon the topic is the immigration
Yes
What do you think about a little bit the topic that they posed the impact of the immigrants inside the economic structure of the country
No, I think that the immigrant has been the great majority structure of the country because nowadays the immigrants are the ones that work in the country, the major
Source of works are done by the immigrants.
Sure
None
In the beginning history of the country, the presence of immigrants was very important, especially before and after the the wars.
Sure
Already having an established country with a social economic and political structure don't you think that the presence of the immigrants can affect what the
The social structure
What happens is that
For example the fact that the social minority transforms into the first minority of the country don't you think that can have an impact
The natives from here don't want
Yes but the Latins are the immigrant already turning into the majority of the country each time more and more immigrants arrive
I think that after they come to do a job and help the economy of the country right? because they also contribute to the economy of the country, of the country I think there's no problem
I think that the immigrant presence is positive in any country.
To a growth, right? I think that interchange and multiculturalism is positive
Sure
Yes, I think that in other countries, and specially in the Latin American countries they are much more tolerant with the immigrants and offer much more options for them to stay and settle
The policy of this country is often too restrictive
Yes, I think so, because I think that, if they come to work, and they come to take care of their family, and they contribute to the country because they work
Contribute to the economy of the country. Although they are immigrants, I don't see the reason for those laws and that pressure. There are other countries where they can have a chance.
Without all the requirements of this country
But, I think that beyond the economical impact there is a social impact that I think affects, I think this is a country with a structure
A social structure quite conservative, more than is often shown
Yes, that is the real problem, I think that what affects them most is how their culture is being affected
And is getting mixed with the immigrant's
Thinking about cultures from different places in the world, I think Latin culture is not contradictory
The American culture, because I think that for the Hispanic community, the religious values of the families in the United States
And some certain policies have a big support among the Latin community, which may be different in other communities, in other cultures
Hispanic immigrants have a positive presence because of their values.
The American hold
Culture diversity is very good, I think that people
The American can absorb a lot of things from the immigrant and they can live normally, it's just the laws
Don't help the immigrants
And why do you think the American has this negative attitude towards the immigrant and the Hispanic often?
I believe that it's because it's turning into the most of the country already has more rights and things are changing for example, regarding the language
Spanish is now becoming more important than English. All those things I know that more immigrants are arriving and the country is filling up with immigrants. They have more rights and they can
They can have the right to certain things and be able to take decisions, because the number of immigrants is growing
I believe that the United States is afraid of, of loosing its basic beliefs so, I think that the majority of the
Hispanics arive, and then they are given a voice and power to vote on the nations matters.
I don't know the basic beliefs, I'm doubtful about that, yes, is it a matter of belief or a matter of
Racial discrimination. I had a situation when I was in this country that I didn't know about it when I was living somewhere else, but now I see the discrimination.
Racial discrimination, this discrimination started against the black Afro American population, the black people and I think it's now against Hispanics too
I don't know if it's against the culture or against the core principle of basic beliefs of the North American culture and Insist, to me, one of the
Basis of the American culture is that it's so conservative and very religious and I think that I share that with the Latin community
That might not be shared with the Asian community because they are different, they have a different vision of the world, no? But I think they are similar to the Hispanics.
The discrimination is racial
Yes I think there's lots of racism here and I just got here and I've seen that and I'm
I'm an American citizen without an immigration problem. There is lots of racism, fear, and confusion here.
They treat you like you were inferior because they were born here.
And you think that most of these controls, the patriot act, the real ID, all those new things that were approved in 2005 that are going to be discussed in 2006
The references to immigrants, do you think it has to do with what happened on September eleven?
Yes, I think so, yes, I think that they are judging all the people because of what happened on September eleven and I believe that
They judge us and are afraid.
It might not be an immigrant that does something like that again, it might even be an American, you never know
There are many people out there that are not well mentally.
None
And and it can be from the house. It doesn't have to be an immigrant. Understand that for me. Maybe an immigrant can come with good things just as he can come with bad things
It can also be an American who has good things. Just as it can also be bad things.
Yes the topic of security is not a matter of ethnicity let's say
Pardon?
The topic of security because all the laws that are emerging and all those things that are being done they are shielded in the national security almost all come from
The department of home land security  and I think that's also a way of creating a very negative awareness towards the immigrant
Because of security then we are going to close the doors then i think that there's an idea
Using that idea to justify policies that deep down have nothing to do with a topic of security like you say
The security, the insecurity is independent from the race of whatever person right? this can be the same American in fact in this country a thousand atrocities have happened
The problems in the schools, and the rest that have been in focus; have been caused by Americans.
Exactly
Where are you from?
I'm Puerto Rican
From Puerto Rico - I'm from Argentina, and how
I arrived here and then I also received rejection even though I have American citizenship, understand ?
None
You know I didn't go through the hard work that immigrants go through to enter the country
Sure
You know I got things like if I was totally inferior to that you understand me and that many people that are not even American also get
Sure
You know that one comes to the country has luck, it all depends I think that we can't judge anyone understand
But even when you are Puerto Rican and come here, you feel that in some way they judge you with the same stick as any other Hispanic, with or without papers
Yes, of course. No, they already don't look at you as if you were. I have the citizenship but they already look at you as an immigrant, also
Sure
They don't look at you as if you came to the country and you already have, you are an American citizen, you know many people don't but many people look at you yes
Where are you from? You are an American citizen, but they look at you because you are Latin.
None
That's what they look at and I think that no they judge people a lot because of that
None
It shouldn't be like that I think that all, we all come to give something period and the United States lives a little bit in fear of that and I think that the immigrant comes to give
Like the same American that lives here he is offering his country but the immigrant there are some that know but there are others that you know everything is
Sure but do you think that they really are scared of them in reality because to me the fear of the immigrant is an excuse to cover up another fear
Yes I think so I think that the United States is afraid they will stop being the world power.
I am
Hello.
Hello?
How are you doing? My name is Adrian.
How are you? What is your name?
Adrian
Adrian, where are you from?
I live in Toronto, Ontario, Canada,
None
I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
I am Chilean.
Yes, and where do you live now?
Now i live in Maryland, near Washington
In Maryland?
Yes, near Washington DC
Near the sea?
Not near the sea.
No? Not near the beach?
About three hours from the sea.
None
Well, not very close
The only thing that we have here are lakes.
None
None
Well it's still water
I don't know
None
Have you lived here for long?
Four years
That's good. More or less like me.
Do you like?
Yes, it's a little cool at the moment. But,
Yeah, the climate's tough.
Yes.
Yes.
Over there it's not so cold. Right? In Maryland.
It's pretty cold, yes, in Winter. Not now, but, mostly in winter, but in winter, to
Nie, There's snow and all that?
Yes.
Yeah?
Yes.
No.
No. It's cold, yes.
I don't know, to the south, where the snow gets to. But,
Me neither. I know it comes here, yes.
And,
What, mm,?
Were you born in Santiago?
Santiago yes.
Why did you leave?
Because I married an American.
Then you didn't leave.
They took me, yes.  They brought me here, yes. Exactly.
Where did you meet him, in Chile?
I met him in Chile.
None
In my country, yes.
Was he working there?
He was working there, yes. He had a company over there of consulting company, or consulting, or something like that.
Yes, exactly.
And you? Why did you left to Canada?
I was tired of Argentina, How can I explain it? I know, I know that things are a little different in, in Chile, but
The way of how the country is, if you want, or, or society, or the people, or the politic, or the economy, or everything together
Not being able to make long term plans
None
And, basically, tings like that,
None
Buenos Aires is becoming a city, quite different of what it was like when I was little.
Yes
Is a much more dangerous place, I don't know.
None
I don't know what else. In my life I remember at least three of the important economies and
Yes.
With everything that has brought me. Right? Is not only the economic, but there is an issue I don't know if it's psychological
The situation is very hard, for the Argentinians. Now, and, and, we, I think that we've taken from here, from there to here, in the sense that the Argentinians traveled to
Chile had problems and we traveled to Argentina when they had problems
Yes, always yes
With the matter of currency exchange. We knew what was happening in Argentina. Really, it's a chame because a country, with peopole
I like the Argentinians
Yes. When they are all together, holds back so much
None
Yes. More than two points, no
Yes. they have their things. But, I would say that they have good things also. But, I don't know if it's bad luck, the truth, no, no, I don't know.
No, it hasn't gone too for them. But, we have to talk about the topic of immigration.
It would be a little subjective in our case but if you wouldn't have married an American would you have left Santiago or not?
In my personal case no because I didn't have many reasons to emigrate. I was working and making good money. No, I had no situation that would tell me or that would push me to,
To leave to another country. Then, but I think that there are many people
Did you get married and leave or you got married in Santiago?
I got married and left.
None
I knew that. I knew.
Obviously, yes, they fooled you, that's true
No, but I want to say, that it wasn't something that
None
That came in the way and they told you, listen why not? No, I knew, And, the truth is that I'm very adventurous, then no, I wasn't scared.
Okay. But, for that it was, when you accepted the package, it was with the tickets also.
Exactly, yes
But
Yes but, I don't know, I, the truth, no, the topic of immigration, I think that it has advantages and disadvantages, like everything. Isn't it true?
I find that legal and illegal people come here.  I think that the illegals, of course is a complicated situation to handle.  Illegal people don't have,
They don't have health rights. You can't have a control, but you don't know who they are. You have no record.
Of that people. It's complicated for a country to handle that.
The health, no, I don't live in the United States but if you don't have money, you don't have access to it right? If you don't have money to pay for healthcare
Does it matter if you are there legally or illegally?
It has nothing to do with being illegal, but in my opinion, the
Of the country, it has its advantages and its disadvantages. I think that it has both. It has both, I also think that many people take advantage of it and they pay lower wages and all of that.
It favors the economy.
Yes. That's why from the outside, they complain but nothing changes, everything stays the same as it wouldn't suit us
I believe you advantage of paying them low wages for their job and they can't complain because they are illegals
They are illegals, so, I don't, I don't know. Look, the truth is that I don't know. I think that I don't really believe in, in, in countries, they have the Internet, and with that
The information comes and goes and in the end, the countries are going to end, so, I don't know, it's a bit
No, I don't believe so, I don't.
How?
Like that, yes. It's quite a romantic idea, but
Yes, I know that, but, the truth is.. no, I don't know. What do you think?
No, I don't know, when you spoke about control and you don't know who they are and I don't know what, what, what, what, what, it's the bad side of
This, that could happen. Do you think it's wrong?
I think it is wrong. You know why?
The illegals they don't know who they are and no, they can't control but, why would they have to be controlled then?
No, it's not about control, but, it is in a sense, if you live in, in a place, you have to know your obligations and your rights.
I see it from the point of view of the rights, for example, if you work, and you get a wage, you have the right to have that part of your wages and to have a retirement fund and to have health coverage and all of that but if you are here illegally
Consider how you are going to get that. It's hard.
That's their fault, the problem is for the illegal or for the one that has given him an illegal job, or?
No, I think they share the blame, of course, this, the illegal, I believe, he doesn't, I'm not sure, I've never asked them if they are illegals or not, you never know.
I believe that if someones is traveling to another country and leaving their family behind, is because they have a lot of problems in their own countries.
I believe that they share the blame or there are situations in both places that make them
Promote that, you see? In some way, they receive information in Mexico, or wherever the immigrants come from, about the best possibilities in here
Who are giving them those opportunities? It's the Americans like myself, so we share the blame
No, but I think that for them to leave their families and all they have behind to come illegally to the United States is because,
They are desperate,
Sure.
Whatever that means. It is
Sure.
The, I always think that, that, that, to me it's not, that doesn't make them a bad or a good person, a better or a bad one
No.  you are not coming here to play.  If you are an illegal migrant, it doesn't mean that you are a bad person Most of the times
No, oh well, I've never experienced it. Illegal immigration, it basically doesn't exist. The,
I believe the difference is because everybody can come to Canada and file for political asylum
None
I think that for default, they don't refuse it to anyone.
Sure.
Starting from there, you can start the formalities.
Sure. Yes, politics.
This is why I tell you no, there isn't a strong market
For illegal immigrants, there are some pretty obscure jobs.  The boy I met was Chilean.  The Chileans don't need visas to come here.
None
To study and to, because of NAFTA.
None
You can come, but I think that you can't work,
Hmm, yeah.
For example, he, illegally, in quotation marks. He, and there are some jobs in this call center, that do like scams and some fraud.
None
With.
This is everywhere.
Yes, but this is why I have problems
They don't need illegals, or immigrants, do to this.
It's something that's obscure, the work in this
Yes.
If you go there, you know that you're losing something,  it's gray, with respect to the law, and things like that.
Yes.
That goes more there to the,
Carlos
Marla, hello, fine, and you?
Hello, how are you? fine thank you, how are you?
Fine
Oh, good.
It is the first time I've done this.
Me too
Well anyway we are supposed to talk about immigration
I have no idea because I didn't expect the call
What? But do you want to do it?
Yes, of course I do, go on, I listen
Yes I'll start. I don't know. They asked about immigration.
None
Whether you agree to an indiscriminate immigration here in the United States, or not.
Yes, I think that this is the country of freedom they call it, right? But there must be some parameters, also.
None
Because it might become a social problem.
Aha.
And a cultural problem for the United States, because certainly every person, depending on the country you come from, whether it is Central, South America, or even Europe
Absolutely
They bring their culture, for example, now, with Hispanics, we know our culture so then there's a clash.
Yes
There's a culture clash and social clash, because we also have to get used to all of the culture of the United States
None
But most of them see that we are Hispanics and that also affects the United States
All together, the whole of society
Yes, even in religion
Why religion?
Because, for example, the United States has mostly a protestant society
Hispanics are Christians, yes
Most of the Hispanics are Catholics there's a religion clash and not only a cultural one
That's right.
Religions, where, if we put ourselves in the United State's shoes
Yes
We know that they have to handle it and I think that they must have it under certain control
None
They must have a certain control over it because the moment will arrive when this will get out of hand so, they have to control it
Yes. I believe immigration should be regulated.
Everyone, in general I believe that
None
So the country would have to evaluate the kind of immigration they want to benefit, so to construct a stronger country
To do not happens what you are saying, so I for example if I had, if I were the United States
Where are you? Which country are you?
If I were the United States
Yes.
Not if I were in the United States. No, I am in the United States. I am here in Boston. If I were in charge of the United States' politics
Look at what they do in Canada. We need a labor force with sectors of the economy
I would let people come who are
None
Of course positive for economical development and on the other side I also would let those who make doctorate here who want to stay post doctorate
This kind of immigration that raises the education level in general of the country I think that is good
Yes of course, I think that anyway, here come
None
To me, in my way of seeing things and in the little I know from the time I have been here most of the people who come here are very in need and they are people from low income from another countries
I talk of a country, Hispanic or Latin, most of them.
Do you think so yes, but are you talking about illegal immigrants
Most of them however is not our case. There come so many people that come here because they have very bad economical problems in their native countries or in the countries they are living
None
Then they come here with what they have called the American dream
Of course but
Not everyone is professional and not everyone is studying. And not everyone has had a career.
None.
They came here searching for a better future.
Sure but I mean with the immigration laws that they have now if you have that profile how do you enter the country
I entered as a refugee
What is that, political refugee, okay okay I understand already
Yes is for a situation that was out of our hands already and we got to leave
Where are you from originally? Columbia
From Colombia yes from Colombia then that is a situation but I do think that they should regulate some more
None
Avoid that cultural clash and that religious clash also that whether they want it or not it's going to affect this country
Yes absolutely
None
None
They do it, they do it I think, sure, then is an issue quite complex but I think that there should be a control, I don't know if there is I think there must be but but I think that
Yes, I think there is. With the Green Card drawing, that lottery
Yes
For example there are countries that cannot participate
Yes
In that lottery I don't know I think that China can't participate Jamaica cannot participate either
Yes but the same I think that there are many people that, that are, that have arrived to this country and are here illegally
Of course
And I think that there is where they have to become more hands on, pay more attention
Yes what happens is that I mean I don't know they have to decide to control it in some way
Yes
I don't know the people that enter illegally, I don't know how you can control that
That there should be some way also
None
But for me that's the biggest problem as far as immigration
None
The person that arrives here illegally
Do you think there are many that come illegally?
For me is - well I think so
Yes, what happens is that, I don't know I can't even think of how to do it I mean is like I don't know
No, but I think that there is where they most let come in.
I think I don't doubt what I don't doubt what you are saying look I'm telling you I don't know how you do it cross the border I don't know without anyone seeing you
None
How do you do it? Every time I enter the country I have to provide several documents.
Yes I entered before requesting asylum with the visa and without any problem. but I don't know how the rest might have entered but there are people that don't have a social
A document and are here illegally
Yes, I am
The great conflict is on the border with Mexico.
Of course, okay I know someone
For me it's all a big problem.
Okay
It is a big problem.
She lives in Miami
She came as a tourist and never retured to her country
Yes
She really bad happened because I had no access to any health service.
Because being illegal is terrible.
I think we all need someones's help because we are all human beings.
We are all human beings.
I work in a school where most children are from illegal immigrants.
You can not deny education to a minor.
Of course.
Just because parents came here illegally.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello, who's speaking? Leticia?
It seems we agreed.
I've been calling  you for two hours. I'm here calling, yes.
Really? I went in and it sent me. Sure, we were waiting.
I was watching TV
It had been such a long time?
I don't know. But yes.  Ten minutes, fifteen for sure.
I'll probably get someone I know, but i didn't know with whom
He already called five different ones?
And, I told him, yes.
None
Because he used one of
From the laboratory.
The secretaries also. He got in the laboratory to talk. Since it didn't call, he said,  I'm going to start calling, because if not...
No, I can't believe you. It has been a long time since we saw each other and we have a lot to talk about.
It's been like yes. Less than twenty four hours.
Yes.
No, i already did this topic once.
Yes? I didn't get this one. They do repeat the topics as I've gotten them repeated before.
Yes they repeat them, that's why I already got this one.
None
And I don't remember if I talked to someone on the topic. Who was I going to get? I was intrigued...
No, I don't know. I was convinced that I wasn't going to be able to communicate in reality. Then, since I saw that it wasn't connecting, and that for sure I wasn't going to be able to talk again. And I was, come on. I had no expectation.
Yes. And what are you doing? Waiting for Paulo to eat, or?
Yes. I mean what happens is that
What? yes?
Waiting until eleven thirty, twelve, like you start snacking.
That's why. how do you do it? Is a pain waiting so long.
But, I also don't like, I don't know, for him to come and eat alone,
No, yes.  You'll make the effort and will eat again.
Sure, like I snack something there. I have soup envelopes. if I get very hungry I drink a soup, something
You cook for when he arrives?
Sure. yes, now, just now at this time I start to cook. So, can you imagine? for eleven.
You have a ton of time.
Yes
Yes, obviously.
Really? How nice.
Not me since we just arrived. We came in the train bus. Since it's so nice. See that is twelve degrees?
Is very nice
Yes, and then we decided to walk a while. We took the train bus until the twentieth, and then walked. At least that way we do some exercise.
Yes.
Then the man made me make milanesas, for the oven.
None
So we made-
How's the diet going? Did you catch Mariano again and put him in line?
No, mariano is
Already is.
Yes, no, no.
DIeting take discipline. Once you break a diet, your diet is screwed.
No, yes.
Is like quitting smoking. You stop smoking, you smoke one of these, and already you started to smoke again.
That's it. No, that's why, yes, is very hard. I don't know? And, I don't know. I'm like controlled, but I'm not doing. In reality I'm not doing the diet that, that, that
That my sister gave me, nor any diet in particular. like
You why because you gained weight? are you eating too much, or because of the change, of the quality of the things?
I try not to eat sweets, basically. I don't know? Honestly, I don't know. This last month, I figure
But have you weighed yourself? Are you sure you gained weight?
I was eating yes. Some one kilo, two kilos yes. I mean more than what I brought from Argentina, that already it wasn't what I wanted, Right?
None
But for me, it's the lack of activity in these last months.
Yes
Because last before
With this cold on top, sometimes you don't even feel like going out to walk
I started to work, and started to walk less.
Sure.
Every day they had some cookie that someone had cooked. It was incredible.
For the holidays, they give each other things,
Every day there was some cookie.
Sure.
See. I mean, you pass by there, in the morning you get hungry.
Yes, ues
You pass by where the cookies are and eat one.
Like now, that the German girl came from (?) and brought chocolates, and you think that? Just from the tray I grabbed one.
Sure, that's why, is
Are you bored working?
I get hungry.
You're going very early, right? Eight?
No, eight thirty or a quarter to nine, depends of the bus I take. That I took. No? But, I don't know. Ten thirty, eleven I get this voracious hunger.
Yes.
I ate an apple.
Sure,
I eat it.
Yes.
I swear that in December it seemed as if everyone had to take something because of the parties. Many people cooked, and then they would take things,
Okay, and if it's a big laboratory, like they wind up and many come like that.
Some that were good, yes. It was fatal. Also, I received little gifts from everyone. Everyone who's closer to me.
No?
Taking cookies, all my close co-workers, they gave me some gifts.
A chocolate
Chocolates, a little soap, another candle, another CD with Christmas music.  No
How funny
It's customary to do that, and
I don't know. My boss gave me a card, the only one.
A card to Mariano, the boss gave him. they, Mariano gave him a gift because the Chinese guy told him that last year the boss had given gifts. Then they anticipated
They gave him a gift, the Chinese guy chose a fruit basket.
Between all of them.
It seems kind of strange
But, on the other hand, that's customary I saw in many places set up fruit baskets.
Yes, the Chinese guy was insisting that it was customary. I said And they gave him that. But, then the boss gave them, some bomboms and a
What's it called?
None
For twenty five dollars, like how nice.
What a son of a bitch. My boss is call-
He was reported.
My boss only gave me a card that she made herself on the computer.
Really?
With photos that Paulo took. One day we went to eat at the house
No. She printed some things and done. No?
Sure. Went to eat at the house, and, and I said, aye, i want to take some nice photos of the kids to make a Christmas card for my family because I have family in Germany and Africa. that don't have anyone.
None
And I didn't have a camera there, what do I know. So, Paulo took photos of the assholes.
Put together a card. Yes, sure. She gave one to each of us in the laboratory and sent one to her family. It's printed there on the computer
Yes it wasn't anything like that.
At the time I was happy, but now that, that I hear it, I don't like it that much
Not playing. I didn't give anyone to anything, I mean,
Me, nothing. Not anything
I didn't give anything. I didn't know if there would be this vibe in the laboratory. When I came, for me it was almost -
It depends on the laboratory.
I had just started and for me it was little
Very jeered.
Since it still wasn't in the vibe there, I don't think I ended up badly because I had no reason to know that they were giving away all those things
Nothing. I don't think that is what is customary. Is that your laboratory is like that or Mariano's
But buy there he could've talken something.
Not me, mine nothing. And, the one in front, Paula's, nothing also.
Yes, there because they are American bosses.  But Paulo's is also American, what happens is, that he doesn't care.
Yes, but is seems that Paula's is very cheap, see that she counts?
None
No. for the holidays and,
Yes.
They brought a basket with oranges. And, they put the basket there. No, no, fatal.
Look. Look at my laboratory. The German lady did, because they were used to celebrating the sixth of December more than the
Twenty fifth. I don't know why the sixth. In reality the sixth is the day of Saint Nicolas
Why the sixth?
Christmas is the day when Jesus was born and on that day Santa Claus gives the gifts to the kids.
Really? Don't they go the sixth of January?
The sixth of December. We only celebrate the kinds in January with a small gift.
Ah. Look.
A matter of making some cookies, then they give us some cookies.
Yes.
Fatty things that come apart in the mouth
Delicious.
No, no, no. I asked her for the recipe, but well. I have it written down there. But, they are hard to do, I mean, not hard, but they have eighty thousand steps, and kneading, and
Yes, you have to make them, yes. It goes in Sure.
I don't think I'll ever do them. If some day I do, I'll give you
Yes. go then.
I don't know what they are. Is something incredible. Kind of like the dry pastries of over there.
Yes.
Thinner. I don't know how to explain it. They are more delicious. More delicious.
None
But that was the only thing. My boss was the cards, and the fat guy nothing, the other guys nothing, me nothing. No,
Yes. Yes, I won't know why, in the laboratory, I don't know what.
Really good.
It was done like that, and I said
The same next year you will have to take one.
Next year,
Candies, something.
I said When I go to Argentina I'll bring something.
Sure. Well I didn't go to Argentina, I brought them.
Sure.
I brought chimbote candy.
Yes, when I go to Argentina
Yes.
Mariano was already looking at the prices in that page you sent him. The one of cheap, and told me he found good things.
Did that page is super good?
Yes.
They have very different prices from all the rest.
He told me there are good ones, but some don't tell you the airlines
No.
Is it like priceline?
Sure. It doesn't tell you the airline, and doesn't tell you many of the times. It tells you, put, such day comes out. But, but it could be from the day from zero to twelve.
Sure.
I mean if you are going to travel
There the schedule doesn't screw you so much.
For a weekend, it really screws you. Because, is, is very different to leave at a time which is twelve hours later.
Yes.
For a long trip, no.
Yes, no. For that. Right?
It doesn't matter. The truth it doesn't matter.
He was looking, and, because he had already looked before, in other pages, and up to now it was the best.
Yes, I don't remember, because I always looked, and they said, but I don't know, because I put it on cheap tickets.
And, cheap tickets is terrible. It's a scam.
None
None
What's it called? Than despegar, than Asatec, than any.
Whoa ohkay either im having a stroke or this sentence doesnt make sense
They had no offers for April
Also the things from the last minute. No? I don't know what they are.
Yes, it's good to get it at the last minutes because before you had to look for the flight earlier.  Now, it seems like the offers come morre at the last minute.
Yes, when the airplane is left empty.
Yes, when they see that, they won't fill it, they put it on sale
None
None
I went when it was the holidays. When it was on vacation, I said, if there's something on sale for Spain, we'll go, we said.
Yes. no?
No, there wasn't anything. It was really discounted for January. It was after. For the holidays there wasn't anything, it was really expensive.
Sure.
Now in this time, going to Spain is crazy, two hundred dollars for a return.
Yes, it's crazy. And well, the Spaniards wen-
Hello.
Hello, good evening.
How is it going? I'm Manuel.
Fine, thanks. How are you? My name is George.
Pleasure.
Yes, And what do you think of today's topic?
About the immigration, I don't believe they reduce salaries at all, right?
Yes.
I don't believe they have anything to do with that.
None
Rather it would have to do with the poverty here in the United States. Right? That, they also take advantage to pay little, since, the people that need the money, will get it regardless.
Yes.
But, they don't exclusively depend on the immigrants.
Yes.
There's
I think that here, the system, a form of double standard. Right?
None
They blame immigrants.
None
They want to have cheap labor.
If it's true.
Sad, with the benefits of to have a right to a, personal and to legally established here, Right?
I'm not very well informed, but I believe that Mexicans mostly do all the work on the farm.
Yes, no, all the farm labor, and all the low, low, low level work
Yes, well, right?
We say that how they've been displaced from the mid-ranges
None
That they've been forced to, begin and to take some low level positions, right? Before they wouldn't have taken
Yes
Soon, because of the economic situation, the situation is changing a little bit.
None
But, if you look at the majority, I think that seventy, eighty, ninety percent  of the hard labor, the tough work is done by immigrants, legal or illegal
More than anyone else, illegals have working conditions that are most times sub-human, right?
Sure, because if they don't have papers, it's more difficult for them to reclaim their
Exactly.
The stability
None
Ay, this, also the owner, or the, or whoever's in charge of hiring, they take advantage of that. Right?
Yes, well, I always, I always said that it's a double standard.
None
The businessmen as the government, know very it's very easy bringing a illegal person.
Probably yes.
They, the only thing they do, is, present before the public opinion. different positions. And, that's what's happening right now with the Senate and the House of Representatives.
Sure, I also don't understand why they build that wall if all the laborers are Mexicans.
Because
They aren't going to throw them out, right?
Now, there are elections coming up
None
Many politicians need to start pleasing the people that vote for them. Right?
Sure, probably for the wall
Then the
An act for the electoral propaganda. Right?
Yes, they are always in favor of the immigrants or against the votes.
Sure, because there goes, a good sector that doesn't
Yes.
More is a little like xenophobic. Can't stand immigration.
None
Because
Yes
Yes because the state has a double standard.
Yes because that's not, it's not hard, to determine, by means of an employer, to determine if someone is here legally or not when they hire them.
None
Sure, they can easily get to know that.
They do know, they do know, who is going to do those jobs
Yes, yes.
Some jobs have been taken to other countries.
None
Yes, for example, maquila to Mexico or Central America or to China but some jobs like in the farms they can't export those because the fields
They must keep those here, right?
The fields are here and they have to farm it, no?
Sure, and no gringo wants to.
No
Well, some gringos do, some are farmers too, but not that many, well, no?
No, and they pay bad, they are farmers but, they are used to work with their
In their own lands, maybe?
I think so, yes, and with modern equipment, they won't stand working that many hours, under the sun and all of that, no?
Yes, but this is for the illegal immigrants that are farmers and pick crops.
Yes.
Oranges, tomatoes
Yes.
They have to do it, with, with people with illegal people. Right?
Yes.
Nobody does it.
I tell you that I had the experience, I worked in a factory five years ago, when I arrived here
None
And it was an egg processing factory
Okay.
There were two lines, there was a line operated by pure immigrants
Yes.
The majority were illegal.
None
Another one operated by Americans.
None
That's supervised by a person from the government. Every day, the machines have to be impeccable.
Okay, the facility.
Has to be, yes, the facility has to be, at six in the morning has to be completely clean.
None
Processing eggs,
None
Yes, if they find any egg thing, they wouldn't authorize that day.
Yes.
Turn it on.
I already understand.
Not a week would go by in which the line of the Americans didn't have work for one or two days
None
Of the badly done work.
I understand, okay.
Yes and the manager, would tell me, it's incredible, here the illegal people, because they are the people that work. The others don't work.
None
That's true.
Yes, there isn't a big necessity.
Imagine it happens like that, because, definitely, the culture is different.
Yes, any job if you've had one or worked anywhere, you realize that sometimes
Yes
The Americans, are not too interested, in the small jobs.
No, they take their time.
They get them to pass the time.
They talk a lot.
None
They don't care about changing jobs. Mm? They change jobs as if nothing
They can jump from one side to the other. The illegals prefer to keep a job if it's good
If they like it, they prefer to wait there a while.
Sure, and they have to take care and be there.
To produce. No?
The American, without a job, he'll go to look for help from the government.
Yes, they pay you eighty perfect, I think, from what you're earning. No?
Exactly, while an undocumented person, the immigrant person without papers
Yes
Who, has to work
Sure, has to work.
Has a job where we have responsibility, here responsibility in our countries. When you come here, then, you, what you're worried about is work.
Work, and work.
Sure, because here, the immigrant finds work at the beginning, but badly paid
Exactly
Sure, everything you do is a lot in your country but here, it doesn't cover much either. I think that it's like you say. No?
They say many things
Now, another situation, for example the, the poverty in the majority of the Latin American countries, have been provoked by this country.
Sure, no?
None
Yes
This is the consequence of what they have done over there.
None
The people have had to immigrate because, What else can they do? there are no job sources
Right? They come because there's no work over there.
Because there's no work.
Right? It's not because the country is bad but rather the individuals are bad, especially the ones who are unemployed.
Yes.
That's the reason that propels them.
Now, this country has been one of immigrants always.
Right?
It makes me laugh to see thirty to forty year olds fighting against immigrants. If you look at the origins of any person...
Sure, all the whites from here - well, Irish
Yes, Europeans.
Germans, Europeans, Right?
Asians, from all over the world. Then,
None
I don't know who,
But,
Who isn't an immigrant here.
They go to the Latins and Chinese, but not the blacks who are already established.
Yes - well, they really were immigrants because initially, they brought them here as slaves.
Sure
Yes. They bought them because they wanted to.
They were forced. No?
None
Yes, because also, for example, for a European immigrant, it's easier to get the papers, it's simpler immigrations than for a Latino immigrant.
None
There's
But why?
It's a bit, well, for him, it will be, well, for the racism, no? still, in North American culture.
Yes, I don't know.
Obstacles to
I don't know.
No, if immigrants don't have papers to be able to be working here, they kind of have to take what comes.
But it's not easy either to put the fault on the immigration for the decrease in salaries and all this, since this responds to commercial strategies
That administrative policy will take advantage of what they fine.
Yes, there are many businesses here that like cheap costs, they take them, it's because
None
They have workers--badly paid
Yes, well.
The people who come to look for work from other countries.
It's like this. No? I can't remember, what was the last?
I think that the qualified workers
None
I don't know, I'm in a very special situation. When I came here three, four years ago,
None
With the development of the Internet, and the rise that it had, all the companies were asking for authorization
None
Yes, to bring
To bring people who worked in, computers, No?
Exactly. And that year, no, there was the great collapse.
None
They complained that more than one hundred thousand. And no, this quota didn't fill.
Definitely the fall of the internet, many businesses fell, and no, people.
Yes
Now they are bringing many people from India to work in systems.
None
Now they're hiring, over there.
Yeah.
There are many business that are taking everything to India, above all, support.
Yes, this happens, no? Many people from India, it's
None
Experts in informatis systems, no?
For example, support for, support for, I think that there are some accountability programs. So, calls for support
Inge
Hello my name is Miriam
Hello Miriam, how are you?
Fine, what is your name pardon?
Inge
Inge
Yes
Right, and where do you call from miss?
I am calling from Washington
Is there much immigration in Washington?
There is quite a lot.
Yes
Where are you calling from?
I am in Toronto, Canada
In Canada.
Yes
There, the immigration situation is different
No, there are also quite a lot of immigrants, quite a lot, but I guess the United States are more saturated, because even the people from here moves there because the sallaries are better
It looks like
The sallary is better than in Canada
In some places, maybe. In some sectors
Yeah there's a lot of people here from El Salvador, not so many Mexicans, but a lot from El Salvador. Where are you from?
I'm from Peru
None
From Lima, Peru, and you?
You've been living in Canada for a long time
Yes, ten years
Oh, quite some time
Yeah, yeah, and you seem young to me
Yeah, not too young but you can talk to me informally
I see.
How long have I been here, is that what you're asking?
NONE
Four years
Where are you from?
From Santiago de Chile
Santiago de Chile, that's good
Yes,
I didn't recognize your accent because i know many Chileans that have a different accent, a little bit, like yours.
Yeah
But i didn't get any accent from you, that's why it was a little bit hard, maybe the province, i don't know
Maybe, yeah, they speak different in different parts of Chile
Tell me, what do you think about immigration? Do you think it's saturated and that they shouldn't take anymore? Or that they should take everyone?
No, they're two extremes. Not to accept any more and accepting them all, two extremes
Right
I think they should regulated immigration a little bit more
Yes
I think it's regulated, they're probably the illegal people the ones who have more problems
That is very true.
Illegal, yes.
There's plenty of illegal people
They don't say they're illegal but i imagine
Yes, because i have seen on tv, i have also met people here that come here from the United States but then they don't like any thing here
Why?
Because Canada, first of all, I mean people that come from different Latin countries to Canada and goes to the United States. They like Canada, and people that go to the United States first and then come to Canada, they don't like Canada. They think the country where you got to
First, you liked it there and you got used to the people
Uh huh, sure
They go back right?, anyway, I have heard about a lot of people that go back because in Canada, for example, they speak English a lot
NONE
I don't know id they don't in Washington, i don't know, it seems there are more latinos, where people can work without trouble
Without speaking the language
Speak the language yes
Yes.
However here in Canada is very indispensable to know English
Okay
Although it's becoming really, for example you find Latins everywhere.
None
You will find it everywhere and there they give you a hand translating, but it's always necessary to speak the language, and also that they pay is really low
None
And that I don't know the cost of life here is high, and you can't find work because
There aren't a lot of jobs.
No, there's even employment agencies that pay little they exploit them a lot, but there aren't many.
Sure
The government put as a restriction that the same employment agencies ask for the social insurance number
None
Many might fabricate it, I don't know.
None
But it's a little hard finding cash jobs here in Canada
Do you think they should allow more immigrants or make it easier for the immigrants or qualified people
What can I tell you, Canada is a country different from the United States, Canada has a lot of land
Sure
What happens is that they all gather here in Toronto
That needs to be exploited, but the people don't go over there, see
Well it's also very cold there.
If the government or people would invest in other cities it could impact traffic
None
The traffic, because the traffic annoys a lot. That's why the people want to stay in Toronto because they find the buses and the train fast see
Sure
But if one goes out of here is hard, with a winter, I tell you that is horrible
I can imagine
Because waiting in there in those stops with that cold, that's horrible
Well that's why they don't have that may immigrants either.
Already in Canada there's a lot, but I think that the problem of the United States is much bigger
None
It's already much bigger
Yes I think that too.
I knew an Argentinian lady okay she had spent like more than ten years living I don't remember where, but it was in the United States, without any problems
None
Without papers or the need to speak English, however she felt very inhibited when she came to Canada because she couldn't speak English and needed favors from people.
And she couldn't find work. They left
Sure
And then I men a Colombian woman, same with the thing that she didn't like Canada, yeah
Yes here
You have never been here, come one day to see
Here there are it's practically, there's everything, restaurants, there are television channels in Spanish.
Yes from here we se over there
Radio stations
Many channels that we watch are from there.
None
I mean the production of Canada is more
Sure
Yeah
Sure
It's a nice country. It is developed, but I think
Maybe life is very difficult there.
It's a bit difficult and the more conglomerated it's the United States.
None
It has diversity in many things
There's a lot of people  for example immigrants generally work in mowing lawns in the summer, to do everything that
None
Patios, gardens
And so you think that one of the questions was:Do you think that they deserve the salary of a resident and why?
No, I don't think so.
Or they bring new energy. Alejandro hold on, Alejandro stop
Yes
Look you are going to fall, sorry
It's OK.
It was my son who was climbing on the window. Do you think that he damaged it or brought new energy?
In reality I think I don't know how to answer that question
None
Because I think that on one hand they benefit from being able to perhaps have a salary that lets them live, I think in comparison with, with their situation in their original country.
Yes
On the other hand it doesn't have a lot of benefits. They're workers but they don't have benefits or
It's sad yes
Or health, or any of this, so I don't know perhaps it's worth it for them to come and live here, and if the government lets them come legally and this
Perhaps they will have a lot for free and there won't be enough work for them, I don't know.
Also because there will be a lot, who don't want to see everyone, sees the United States as half.
Yes, they all think that.
Or Canada also sees it as
Life is easy there, or they can make a lot of money.
Yeah, look, professionals come here, but the English barrier is very strong, because I don't know if in the United States
None
Is like that, but in Canada, the English barrier is very strong
Sure.
They demand a lot more
Right? Well I imagine it depends on the area, right? Since here there is a lot of immigrants.
That too
The residents are more sensitive, so they're not so closed with their accent and their words. They have a lot of interest in learning Spanish.
That's good, that's good, but like i told you, I've met many professionals here that, they don't get, they don't get with their papers and they can't find a job, they can't perform in their area
Right
That's, it's very sad
I think that if you talk here, in a professional level i think you'd have the same problem
To the United States
There's people that don't speak English. There's people that does work, like manpower, fixing gardens and don't need to communicate.
Right
Or take out the snow during the winter
Right
That sort of construction that don't need
Construction pays
They pay it, yeah, they pay them they pay them i think
Yeah, here in Canada many people look for jobs in the construction business because you can make money, itÂ´s hard but you get money, the money
None
If you go to a factory or something like that, you get
Sure
A lot of sacrifices. I'm giving it all up.
Sure
Giving many things up to save money
Yes
Rents are very expensive, too expensive, theyÂ´re
Yes, this area is a little expensive.
And
There are sectors of, just immigrants, latinos, and they all speak Spanish
Yes
It's different, it's like having a country inside another, sometimes
Yes how interesting
Yes, but some people don't like it.
Here itÂ´s not like that, everything is mixed
None
I wouldnÂ´t say there are sectors, people do tend to look for each other, right, and there are some areas where more of them
ItÂ´s not exclusive, there are other people with them, but itÂ´s like they
None
They look for them that way, they try to live close to each other.
Sure
For example, Polish people try because they are white and racist. The Europeans talk to a lot of people but they don't actually accept them.
Sure
They are just polite
None
I heard they live in a city away from Toronto.
I see.
I've heard that they look for people like that. Yes, that's true.
Yes
I see
Hello?
Hello

Look at that, what a coincidence. Where are you? In Philadelphia?
I work at the university of Pennsylvania. I live in West Philadelphia
Look. Me too. I go, I'm in the, in the laboratory, in the department of genetics. Doing an internship.
Very good.
Yes, you. What do you do?
That, and, internship in what?
Of what?
Yes
I look in Buenos Aires, I am in the second or third year.
Of what?
I don't have much working experience.
But, what are you studying?
I'm learning a couple of things.
What are you studying?
What?
What are you studying?
Biology
Very well
Yes, you? What do you do?
I'm biologist
Oh, look at that
Yes, I work doing research, I'm doing a post-doc
Oh, about?
About rapid development in mice
Development, what?
Embryonic
None
In mice
Oh, that's really good dude, that's good
You see
Interesting, interesting, it's really good
Have you been in the United States for long?
I got here ten days ago.
Newly arrived? I've been here five years.
You, five years?
Yes.
Whoops
What do you think of immigration?
How is life here?
What do you think of immigration? Let's touch on today's topic.
The topic, no, that it concerns us.
And it concerns us, exactly
That topic concerns us, of immigration here, in the United States. And, it's complicated. It's complicated. There's a lot of people. A lot of immigration. Especially
But, do you think immigration is good?
From Mexico.
Do you think that it's good? Is immigration positive for the country?
Immigration?
Yes.
Yes, let's say that it is too excessive, I think the immigration to the country. What do you think?
No, but, I think that it's good, that it's something natural
Yeah yes, it has
The people don't have to work on this side
Sure.
He comes.
Yes, has its things. What happens is that
Also, the Latin people are the only ones that work.  You go to any restaurant, and the ones that are in the kitchen, working, washing dishes, are
Are all Latins.
Yes
That's true.
Or Chinese, all have big.
Immigration is good. What happens is that
There is
There's a little bit of regulation missing.
Same in the university, All the post-grades and all the doctorate students the majority are foreigners
Sure.
I think that is something that's good.
Sure, but there's certain immigration that perhaps is not, is not too regulated, by the state and many people
Yes, the state can
Work in conditions more or less, labor
They come
Semi-slave.
Sure, because they come illegally.
How?
It's not regulated because it is illegal.
Sure, yes.
Or to establish a more permissive immigration law, so this matter can be better regulated.
Yes, that is right
Yes but instead of establishing, instead of establishing permissive laws, they build a wall, and that and that only makes it
Sure. Hello,
Hello,  Can you hear me?
No, I didn't hear that last part.
No, I didn't really say anything.
The last part of what you said, I didn't
But, no, the reality is that with these policies the only thing they are trying to do is
What do you think that, those policies have?
To stop immigration, yes, there's something about it, I believe that the policies are meant to
Xenophobia?
No, it's a policy. In order for the government to be popular, people who are middle class or working class
They are upset about immigration because it takes jobs from them. Most people hire illegal workers because they are cheaper.
Yes.
That's why they take jobs away from the local people
Sure, that's right.
To show that it is visible that they are working on it.
About the wall, yes, it's very exaggerated, I think.
Build a wall, sure but it's something that, I mean, the people that cross a river, and cross a desert how are you going to build them a wall.
Sure
I think that the matter is another
Yes.
No, but yes.
They'll cross in some way
The way of stopping immigration is developing, or investing money in
I can not hear you very well. Developing, a little
In other countries. And developing the other countries, especially all in Latin America
None
Giving money to Latin America. The people I mean, the people won't come to the United States if their country has money.
Sure
I don't know, what do I know.
None
Sure, yes.
That the United States, finds the easy solution, that nobody crosses. But, but the truth is that, is very, the wall, is kind of
It is bad, and yes, it is very messed up. Many cross and then they hunt them with trucks, as if they were animals.
And they returned them. I don't know, everything is very, very bad.
Yes.
What?
Yes, that you do need to know.
Yes. The truth. And life here in Philadelphia?
No, living in Philadelphia is fine. Yes.
It's good?
Yes. we miss Buenos Aires,
Yes? From one to ten? What do you give it?
None
If you have to give it a score?
I don't know, I don't know what
What?
I don't know.
You wouldn't put it.
No
None
I don't give it a score. No, but it's good, you live good. It's fun, there's a big group of people
A lot of friends?
Yes, all the people from the university, Europeans, Spanish, Italians, South Americans, honestly, it's very good.
There's a nice group.
Yes
Also. Four or five years since you've been

Yes
Of March, with the facu, yes I, I still a, one more stretch yet.
Yes
A long stretch to finish.
Yes
Yes. SO little by little no.
Yes
T-step by step
That's good, no, it's good. And do you think about returning, would you like to return or
Return here?
Yes.
Yes, if working conditions are very good.
That's good. Do you like the work you do?
My job?
Yes
My Job is good.
What do you do?
I'm learning about culture
What are you doing?
Cell culture, basic experiments with gels, PCR, things like that
That's nice
My boss is a pain in the ass but, well, you can't have everything.
Yes, it always happens, problems with bosses
He's a pain the ass
There are problems, yes
Pain in the ass, but the truth is that, my job
What happens is, that
The work makes up for it
What happens is that in my house, the graduates that are here are quite lazy.
The undergraduates, they are lazy?
Yes, they don't want to work
No, who, they don't want to what?
I don't work as hard as I used to in the past. They don't want to work like we used to work.
And yes
When I was a student and worked in Argentina, I worked without resources, and I worked many hours
Sure. Worked full and here
I didn't complain much.
Here they are more
There's almost
They're served on a tray here. Of course they have it.

Yes, yes.
Wow and there aren't many who, apart, this orientation, from science. People who live here
Yes
Or no? They're nothing like outside, no, the way they suck.
Yes. In general people doing a doctorate put themselves in a foreign state.
All foreigners?
Disciplines like bio engineering or computers are ninety percent foreigners.
Engineering and computing?
Yes, it's what the people
I can't hear you
Americans instead of going to graduate school, to study for four years and earn fifteen hundred dollars per month
Yes
They go to work at company and earn four thousand.
And it all goes to the

In the economic area.

None
I will go to Washington and from there to Virginia.

None
Yes, I don't know anything about this immigration.
None
At least what's in the news
None
But they say that we can talk about other topics
Course so, I think so. The last time I talked with another person on another topic.
Yeah for...
We didn't talk about the topic of the day.
Yes, for me the immigrations are, yes I support them. in opinion, it's what we owe to the Americas.
Here in America they have, This idea that anyone can come, no?
Yes.
But there's also abuse when the person has to die to be able to pass, yes. Sacrifice so much. He can at least help to make it easier.
Is it a process to help them?
Yes, it's good.
In the events, because I grew up in Ladedo, Texas. And they told me that there the tourism business is finished, it doesn't exist anymore
It's
Yes
Simply because there is so much crime due to poverty. I don't know if it's the drugs or
Yes.
Where there's a big market in the streets, there's nothing
Yes. Above all.
For me, this has to do with the police who don't have control.
Yes, this.
Or the government when I get these calls. It could be any
None
Moment in day and here he found me. Searching for a key for my hotel. I will find it now.

None
They give him very little free time.

Sure.
No, but yes he's Mexican, no?
Yes.
None
Mexico
From Mexico. I see. I don't know much of Mexico, only the areas we have been to on vacation, on the Cruises, which by the way were only Cancun and Coserle
Yes
And when grandma took us to the 'partillas' when we were little. And we were a queue of kids, four kids. With just 'tortillas', but by that time
None
Right? there was much more free time. You don't have to, our grandma advised us not to talk to people
Strangers, right?
I agree. Please hold on, I am getting another call from customers.
Yes
Seven or eight calls
None
When I first started getting calls, I forgot the PIN, then I got like thirty calls
Wow. I have, how long?
I didn't go back home, I was in these assignments
Yes
I didn't know where to look in the house. Then I finally remembered where the number was. But I forgot how they pay, I haven't got any check yet
And you?
No, they pay January about March
Oh, Until march
Once when the study ends, it depends on how many calls you've made.
Yes. If I've forgotten.
They send it to everyone now.
None
I think that until March, but it's not immediate.
But it's not regular, so I forgot how they paid. It was from twenty.
Yes.
Five calls but above it was two hundred dollars, no?
Yes.
Hopefully it will come to us.
The and five times calls, and five different telephones. They give you fifty dollars.
None
Extra.
Are there different telephones?
None
Telephones?
It can be a cell phone. Of a friend, your cell phone. At the house, five different, different numbers.
Yes just to test a telephone.
Yes, me too. But how many calls to you have?
With this conversation maybe eight.
No. Don't worry. I barely have three with this one
I have talked with thirty to forty people.
None
None
Yes.
I talked to a lady named Olga and she lived in Detroit
None
Or no, that lives in Canada. Another one from Houston. That's why, it seems I recognized the voice. It was a young man. A man from Uruguay. Another from
South America nationality.
Argentina?
Yeah I spoke with a man from Argentina. And with a man from Colombia.
None
But the call to a Puerto Rican girl was disconnected because my phone wasn't charged.
None
I didn't know how to get in touch with her.
I think that
Yes
No, I think it is like an automated system. right?
None
It connects you and disconnects you, so.
Okay.
You lose the contact, the communication.
What other type of study do you do in Spanish? Is it the only one?
Is the only one that I'm doing. yes.
I used to converse with many in English here in Chicago.
Yes.
They've paid me up to two hundred fifty for forty minutes of doing a study on new foods. For example, KFC wanted to introduce
Change the recipe of its the coleslaw
None
They had us tasting and taste and taste the recipe, the differences. And they gave us a sheet of questions and to write what it was you
Yes.
Noticed if it was wet, that if it was dry.
None
That if it's hot, if it's spicy. The Baskin Robbins that they added, the custard or
None
Something different, but it has a lot of criteria; you have to make a certain amount of money.
None
But, that's what I like about Chicago. One can go during work hours or dinner time and you finish in plain day
How nice.
Yep. I think I'm going to go down to find another key because yes I lost it. yes here it is Is strictly in Spanish. There's thirty of us
I don't have a big family. If I have it, I don't recognise him. My whole family is in Texas.
None
Yeah
None
No. Some cartridges, yeah. Look there are the bosses as well. Okay, thank you Ma'am. Oh, great. So I'll share. Okay, sorry.
Oh, don't worry.
Yes
How is the weather right now in Chicago, Is it snowing, is it hot?
Snowing, we're expecting four inches this year yeah
None
It was more or less good this year.  We had it good.  For example, we were in the fifties some weeks ago.  I don't know if it broke the record or not, but
You've been doing OK
None
Because for example right now, to get in front of the Field Tower
None
Almost one has to be on his side to be able to walk.
None
That's why I come to the South here for this assignments.
None
They sent me to Arkansas. However, they have the central offices in the North and from there they put you to work. I said, OK I didn't count on that.
That's why I'm leaving tomorrow. I have to go to Washington.
None
But
You already finished a lot?
What do you make a living of?
Pardon?
What do you do for work?
I
None
I don't work. I study.
No, you study, that's very good. And what are you studying?
I study at the university.
Is not
I'm studying economics.
Thank you for the card. Tonight, room, room. two sixteen. Yes. I left it inside. I'm sorry.
Well, no
Yes, I'm going to study at school to be a real estate investor.
Good evening, my name's Marco and I'm in Philadelphia, and you?
Good evening, my name is Vilma and I'm in Maryland, how are you?
Hello Vilma no, sorry, I was trying to adjust my ear piece when they were saying the question, did it have something to do with relationships, on the internet and that?
In the, exactly
Meeting people I remember when I was younger, let's say
In the good years
Because of course I'm still young
At heart, right?
Sure, I remember that they said that love from afar, eh, love of fools
It's the same in my country.
Sorry?
Yes, I think that there's the same saying in my country, where are you from?
Yes? I grew up in Paraguay
Okay, I'm from Bolivia
And you? Close, very close.
Yes, neighbors
My father has an estate in Charco Paraguayo, approximately sixty
None
Kilometers from the border of Bolivia
How nice!
But, as we used to say
Regarding relationships, for example I think that when we were growing up, we didn't have this Internet thing
No
I've had the chance to meet one of my partners in
None
To fall in love through the phone was in the past
Yes, you still, I also remember when, hours and hours here in the United States, at least there's the unlimited
Calling, local calling, we didn't have before
The bills were for the parents, they'd pay any amount,
Exactly, that's something that my dad is always going to remember
I see
He's always going to remember that because the telephone bill's that he'd get
Do you think that this new invention, the Internet,
None
It'll be useful to get to fall in love over the Internet, with someone that you don't know where they come from, because there's so many lying that you might not be aware of, because you don't even know how their voices sound
You are not too sure if the person you are talking to is really who they say they are
Exactly
If it's not a she, or if she is not a him
None
Those things, I remember, one of my friends, she was not my, she was not my girlfriend but for all practical reasons we were dating
I see
I never kissed her
None
I keep hitting my head for not having done that, but, memories
I see
We met on the phone, she knew a person I knew and for some reason, I can't remember what it was, I think she was about to do
A telephone and needed somebody to
None
She asked me to sponsor her.
I see
And we talked for years - it was not just one call of course, but we talked for years and got to know each other
And
I think it was months until we met in person
I think that romances before were a little more romantic because
Yes my darling
They want to go too fast
If it is on the Internet they want to see naked pictures.
None
If it is in person, it seems that, I am out of the market since some years, but it seems that its is like 'let's go out tonight'
If nothing happens tonight, well, maybe tomorrow.  It must be very fast
Yes, it's, it's very rushed, I believe that all that romanticism that we had in past years, it doesn't matter in which country because I believe that here in the United States it was like that too.
Yes.
People used to be more romantic, they would go slow and now it's like in the first or second dates they're having sex and then it's over.
Yes, exactly, they do it on the first date
None
I think that's a reflection of one in every two marriages ends up in divorce in the United States
Yes
That's an overwhelming number. It's quite scary
I'm not aware of the percentage of the couples that get to marry and then start to fall in love through the Internet. No I don't have a number or the percentages.
The way in which I count them is through the number of people that I know, that have met through the Internet,
No, I haven't met anyone, I don't know anyone that has
I have. Yes.
Well yes I'm lying. One of my coworkers has a daughter and she loves to go out with people from the internet. What do I know?
None
Every time that he goes on a date with someone from the internet, they go out and it's a fraud. They get nowhere and as I was saying, on their first dates these people want to have sex.
Yes, they don't really get to know each other through the Internet, you don't get to meet their friends or their families.
Exactly, that's another disadvantage
So, it's completely anonymous
Yes, totally
In that respect, in Paraguay they'd go celebrate. I never understood why they'd use this word, celebrate, but they'd use it to say that two people were going out together
None
When they went out together, when someone goes out, if you and I go out my first question, like, yes, on the phone, starts
What are you wearing
Hmm,
It's hot down here, they're starting, wait a moment, because we're talking about, what do people talk about normally?
Now in these
It seems like the art of conversation has been lost
Like I keep saying, there's no romance to get to know a person
Yes
I think that maybe people are turning more frivolous or more materialistic because now they ask if you have a car
Well, especially in this country, you have to have car
Yes
But in our times there wasn't, at least in our countries. The boy went how he could to her house and
Yes,
And they got together, like I think it's all changing now, and it's a shame because, well, I have young daughters but I don't see
That my daughters are living what I lived
No. Don't forget too, that, at least, for example, here in the United States, something that I realized is that
The Yankees do each stupid thing
None
When I was in Paraguay and they were there, I always was in, I went to an American school in Asuncion
Okay
I always met many people from the embassy, American people, I simply met
None
It can be said that sometimes the American does such stupid things but also have a view from the practical side.
The American is quite ignorant, there are many Americans that you give them a screwdriver and they don't even know what side to grab really, but one thing that I remember, I would defend
Yes
Yes, is true, there are a lot of practical things that they don't know, but, one thing yes, the American works
None
The American works more than a worker from another part of the world in number of hours and in amount of work
But perhaps that is another thing that jeopardizes a couple because they are so bottled up in their work, the work absorbs so much
One doesn't have the time
There's no balance.
Yes, there's no, exactly, there's no balance, I'm I'm, engaged, to be married with my girlfriend, who is here
She has a five year old son
Is she American?
She's American, eh, is funny, her name is Hernandez but she doesn't speak Spanish but she is American - she got married, basically she got pregnant, and what does a Catholic person do when she gets pregnant? she gets married
None
She got married before of and immediately
She got married before falling in love.
She got married with her boyfriend of many years
Good
They broke up, he was the boyfriend again, they broke up again.
Several times, but what ended up happening is that she got pregnant, they got married quickly and, the creature was born, and had his name
None
She kicked him out of the house before the kid was one year old
None
I knew here before this and had lost contact for some years.
Yeah
We started seeing each other when the kid was a few months old.
None
After having the kid she was starting to be able to leave him at night
Yeah
I've seen how at the beginning you need to still be really attached but when he started to get a bit older,
None
One to five months.
Hi, my name is Martin. I'm talking from Philadelphia.

Yes, there in Boston, in Boston.
Look at that.
We lived in Boston.
A really pretty city, but it's a bit cold.
Yeah, this is why we cam here, from one extreme to another, no?
It's sure
None
The weather in Phoenix must be incredible.
Now it's an incredible climate. It's three very cruel months with the heat but the rest of the time is really beautiful, really great.
Is it too hot in summer?
Yes, too hot.
None
Too much
Of course, because they always portray it as a place with nice weather that never rains, but in the summer it must be very hot.
Yeah, but during the summer, it goes up to about a hundred and fifteen, more or less, the temperature
Thats like 45 degrees
Yeah, more or less, yeah, it's a lot
It's a whole lot yes.
It's a lot.
Is it at least fresh at night?
It's fresh at night, but during the summer not even the night is fresh.
Right
Not even a little
Right
It's pretty hot
You have to put up with snow now
I prefer to put up with this summer for three months
Yes
Than that winter for six months, you're locked up in a house without being able to go out
Sure
It's easier to beat the heat than that horrible cold
Sure
It's very horrible
Here is not so, the winter is not so terrible, it's a little bit better than in Boston. It last less, at least, it's three months. It's cold but,
No, It's so terribly cold in Boston.
But in Boston the spring and autumn are like short.
They are very cold. Is that it starts snowing, sometimes, since October.
They are short. Sure.
Then, you don't have like a lot of time to
Sure.
Of good.
Sure.
Climate, and when there's good sun, there's humidity that's unbearable.
Sure
An unbearable humidity
Yes, it's true. And what, what do you do, work, study?
No, I'm a housewife.
None
No, here I don't do, at this moment, I don't do anything.
Okay.
In Colombia I, studied librarianship, I'm a librarian.
None
But, here I don't do anything.
How interesting.
Here I'm dedicated to the home and the kids.
Sure
None
That's good.
To the maternal state, I'm dedic- Yes,
That's very good. How many kids do you have?
I have two babies, one girl who is a year old and another a three year old boy.
How cute.
They are very little, they barely walk
Yes.
Starting life...
Sure. And is the older one starting preschool already?
What?
Is the older one starting to go to preschool, or to the daycare, or does he stay home still?
He's still here in the house, we already registered him, this year already he starts to go to preschool.
None
None
Sure.
Already this year he's going to go to study.
Sure.
Because it is already time.
Yes.
Do you also have kids, or are you married?
I'm, yes, I'm married, but, no, I don't have kids yet.
Not yet?
No, we are thinking of having in the near future. But, in like one or two years.
Yes
Yes.
That's good.
We want to start trying.
Yes, already
No we do want to have kids badly, at least a couple.
A beautiful experience.
We'll see later. Yes.
I took a long time to have my kids, a long time.
Yes.
Because I had them when I was already older. I've enjoyed them so much, maybe it's because I had them already older.
I had leapfrogged.
Sure.
That has helped me a lot to enjoy my kids.
How nice. Yes. We see, our friends who had them older. She is young, but he is a little older. He's forty. Forty two, something like that
She is.
None
Thirty one, thirty two, only, young. But, and we see them that they enjoy them so much, they have, had twins, and are very fun, is very entertaining.
My baby, I had him when I was thirty four years old.
Yes, That's good. is also young.
Yes.
Yes.
No, Young, also. Yes, almost forty
Now people are having kids in their twenties.
None
Is very common.
Yes, that's true, that's true.
And, on the other hand, one can take advantage of the best of both things. Be independant and later enjoy the kids at an age when one is still young.
I've always thought if you have them too young
Yes.
You are not going to have time to study, to do that things that you want to do.
Yes, sure
It will be difficult.
Yes, it's difficult to even go out with friends. Or anything, to go out to eat, it get's complicated because
None
If you have a couple of children, you have to movilize the entire family, but, the same, I mean, we would also love to, the truth, in a couple of years yeah
Start with that stage, but on the other hand we know that we could've have a good time being married without children, and it's nice too.
Yes. That's true
None
It's very nice.
Yes.
But very nice and children were very nice, I live happy with them.
What? I couldn't hear.
That children are divine, I live happy with them.
Yes, sure.
They are, I don't know, they fill up your life.
Sure. Yes. Em, Yes, I don't know what else to tell you and
Above all, about the topic,
What do you want? let's talk about the topic, then,
Or about what? I don't know, whatever you want, however you want.
We can talk about anything. we can talk a bit about the topic, because we didn't talk about the topic. What was it? It was dating.
Something about relationships.
What's that?
I don't know
I forgot.
Me too
Let's talk about something else then
Yes, about what?
I don't know, i don't know, tell me a bit about how the city is
This city is pretty nice
Yes?
I didn't think it was a pretty city. I thought everything but that because I thought it was a city.
Completely deserted. In fact it is, but on the outside
Sure
And in the city, the surroundings are very different.  I missed that a lot about Boston, because in the summer and spring
Yes
It's completely green
None
There is plenty of green with the plants, the trees, the vegetation.
Right
Be here there are plants and everything, but it's not the same
Sure,
It's not the same as there. Nevertheless, there are some buildings, some really beautiful structures.
None
The city is bas
Yes, the only thing I know is by watching NBA and they show the city in general, the sky scrapers and it seems like a really modern city.
It's a really modern city. Pretty modern, yes.
Yes.
It's a pretty modern city.
None
It's a city with very new
Sure.
Last year we came for a visit, because my husband has family here,
None
And there was a lot of land that was vacant and all this, and now everything's going, everything. buildings, there's a lot of these, houses, these, what are they called? Condominiums,  from
Well, a lot of things
Sure.
They're totally building the city.
It's growing a lot. Yes.
Yes. It's growing a lot.
Yes, they're building many cities too, here in the United States. But no, people are coming back more. Before people were going to the suburbs to live.
A lot of young people, professionals, young people, their families with children are going back to live near the city. And also makes them develop a lot
Right? I don't know
None
Here, in Philadelphia also. This started about five or six years ago, more or less. And they started building in an extensive way, all over
Yes
Areas that used to be, a little poor, or were sub-developed, with voids, developed a lot. And, I don't know, now we are moving to Baltimore, andÂº
It's similar, they are building a lot
Yes. Here too, here it is incredible the way they are building. But, it's amazing how people want, I mean, that people like me, I include myself in the group,
I want to move. What am I doing here in this desert.
Yes
This is not the typical desert we are used to. It is a very rocky state.
None
It's pretty rocky, so there are no plants
Sure
There are no plants there, that's why it's a desert.
Yes
There is no way. No, that's why they call it
Lourdes.
Hello, Lourdes. How are you? My name is Eliana.
I, you are from Boston, Right?
Yes
Good. How are you?
Fine. How do you know?
I talked to you a while back.
How do you remember my name? I don't remember. Let's see, tell me where are you from?
We talked about living in the city that you would like to live in
Are you in Los Angeles?
No, I'm in New York
Then.
You, had said that you would like, going to a little island with a cocktail when
I remember.
How have you been?
It was plan -B.
Plan B.
Yes, Look, I didn't know that you could, that, it could be repeated.
The combinations of participants?
Sure.
Yes, because since they aren't, there aren't so many people, I imagine, At the end of the day, it's very logical that it happens to you connect
Sure.
For me, there's a girl in Florida who, we talked like three or four times, and I asked her about home buying because she's a broker.
Really? How nice. Wow! Now, the topic of the day is relationships.
Yes, tell me, are you single or married?
Yes, I'm single, look, I'm thirty, so all these ideas
Good.
In any moment will come up. And you?
No. I have been married for two years and have a nine-month-old baby.
Sure...I remember you baby.
Yes, yes, yes. Well, tell me, How are relationships, then?
None
Have you done online dating before?
No, never. I don't know if I will get motivated to do it.
I have, yes, tell me.
NO, because the topic is the language, it should be in Spanish. To me English is still hard. That's my problem here.
What were you going to tell me?
No, I was going to tell you that one of my, before getting married, one my roommates did online dating
Yes.
She had stories from each, from each person she met.
Yes, no?
Why?
Yes, did any of them end up being normal?
She'd do the screening and keep in touch via email with the other person
She didn't want to get to meet the person quickly, she wanted like to let time pass so he lost his interest and stopped
He stopped talking because what he wanted was
Sex.
To go out everyday, meet lots of people, so if you are throwing the net to them, you get whatever sticks in it, and everything that fell outside the net, you just let it go.
I was told some stories how they did get married and they met via chat but I believe those are not common
Yes, no, I believe that, only few stories end that way.
I believe that too, I'm still single, hello, in all the lines,
I believe there are lines to look for Hispanic partners,
No.
I do
I am going out with a guy from Argentina.
None
I haven't looked for anyone.
Sure, so.
How old are you?
How?
How old are you?
I'll be thirty three year old February twelth.
Right before Valentines?
Let me tell you about this relationships,it's like a trial marriage.
In the end,nothing changes just leave your tooth brush in just one place.
Yes or no?
But, this dynamic, the communication that has to, sometimes, you have to guess what the other person is thinking
Sure, that doesn't change, let's say, for sleeping. It doesn't go through the sheets.
No, it's not through osmosis, no, it doesn't work.
Sure, that's a pity, yes
It doesn't work. That,
My mom just got me now. I'm telling you I'm fine. I'm 30 years old and I have a doctorate. I chose to work, to have a professional life
Sure.
I did have boyfriends and well, that's what happens? Nowadays everything is delayed but my mom has a nervous attack
None.
She gave me a book that says, I want everything and I want it now, the thirties, this decade changes your life, right? It talks about the divorce at thirty because people married too young
The relationships and if you marry during your thirties, and I'm reading it and it's the first time that I read a self-help book.
None
That my mom sent me and I'm reading it now but I think it's funny, what do I know?
During your twenties, everything is experimental. I can take this, taste this, make decisions, change my mind.
When you reach you thirties, you begin to think, wait, for example. I did the same. I finished my doctorate.
I married early, I got divorced, I finished the doctorate, all that, those that, those things that are in the book, all that
Of course.
When you begin in the thirties, wait, I have my career that is important to me, but I want a family too.
And then there, you begin to go out with the goal. The goal is not only to find someone to be with now, but the goal is
Let me think with whom I would like to form a family. Yes is him. Do you understand me? If that is what you want to do.
Of course.
So you get more
Finest.
More, yes. Not more, you donÂ´t accept anything. Do you understand me? you donÂ´t accept foolishness from anyone.
Of course.
Yeah, if you are going to go out with someone, you are not going to go out and loose your time, you are going to go out because, because you are looking for something more comfortable, something that
That makes you feel good, that, that the company is not only a thing that, lasts two or three hours, and then is over.
Of course, yes.
The courtship becomes something different after the thirties.
In,in, the more remote, in the back of the brain.
No, sure
That is always, you, or you are thinking on it. Right?
I want to be with a partner and feel in love.
Of course.
I know that everything gets if you are nervous about it. You become desperate and you won't go anywhere.
Exactly. So...
It's true, lots of times you realize why can't I find it, why can't I find it? And maybe it's because you are, chatting and maybe the guy you are chatting with
It's not the man of your life. You will probably be introduced to him by someone that is in your same circle.
Exactly.
If you go to dance in a place, it's less likely than you will find a husband there.
This thing about chatting
It's just temporary, no? maybe for women as we are always looking for love and we, to me it sounds like a
None
Sure, not at all.
It's just an easier strategy, to get to meet more people without even having to fix your hair or wash your teeth in the morning
Sure.
You also have to think about how technology has changed lots of things in our lives,
Technology is changing the way we fall in love and find our partners.
Yes.
Right?
Yes, that's the change that is happening to us, to our children, and your daughter.
None
She's going to start chatting with boys when she turns ten years old.
Exactly and look, for example
For example, I know that there are some chat groups about music, so, you will also find it there
Sure.
Someone with your own tastes.
Sure, look, if you think about it before...what's the name? The celestina? Matchmakers? The matchmakers?
Yes, yes.
That was the way through which people used to get a couple, no?
Sure.
The social changes, people weren't looking for that type of things,
To go out to look for someone that is kind of similar to us, that was not the way in which things used to be done back then. Back then, they did
It was because of an economic compromise or to strengthen political alliances between families, what do I know! That one had more cows than I and I needed to have more cows.
A bull, maybe.
He had the cows that I needed, I had a bull.
Sure
But even if I now feel like I don't really trust the chats, I say so because my sister is one of the ones that's into them
She's started to meet lots of guys, she's trying to go out and she's using the internet a lot. I tell my son, that's what he's going to get to know, and for him
For him, it's going to be normal, no?
As is.
The way in which things are done.
Yes, that, maybe, due to us being women, we are afraid, no?
Its a safety issue because any psycho can log into a computer and say what he wants.
Sure, of
Hello
Hi
Hi, How are you?
How are you? Fine. My name is Roman, And yours?
How are you Roman? My name is George

Fine, and you?
What do you think about the topic?
From where?
What do you think about the topic? I can't talk too much because my throat hurts. What do you think about the topic?
Well I would say the topic of internet dating
Yes
The truth is that I never had one
No
I think that I have two comments that sometimes they were positive and negative, you never know what you're encountering.
Yes
It can be that you talked with a person and suddenly you find them, it can be your grandmother.
None
I don't know.  Have you had any experience with this?
No, yes, this isn't right, a date with someone who you don't really know, to see it, and nothing happened,
You had an internet date with someone you met on the Internet one time
No, I don't believe many opportunities of meeting on the Internet. I had a contact on the internet but nothing happened.
It's very difficult
Did you meet on a website and if so which one?
No, I don't remember, this was like two three years ago, I don't remember, I don't really remember, someone on there wrote me and made a date but no
None
No, she wasn't my time, so no
Yes
Everything ended
Are you married now?
Yes, like no, I was, yes I was but I yes, Internet really difficult even today people use it for the lack of time, lack of
Sudden opportunity to go to a social event or one of those things to know people, sure
Yes
I think that it's a good way. What do you think?
You told me that you were married, so you're divorced?
Yeah right
You are divorced.
Yes
Did you divorce a long time ago?
Excuse me?
How long have you been divorced?
Last time I was on that process for about
You said, where did you tell me that you are living now, in which city?
Yes, I'm in New York.
Oh in New York, how, how are women there?
There aren't many
Are they easy over there?
Very few, you don't have the opportunity to ... there's plenty of social life I still know very few people, no
Yes
It seems easy, there are lots of clubs, discotheques and all of that
Are there many Latin women over there?
Sure, there are many but I don't really know
That's fine
There are lots of them.  Where do you live?
I'm in Miami
No, it's still better there
In reality here, there are more Latinos than Americans.
Yes, sure yea
It must be more difficult because the topic of cold doesn't leave or not?
The issue is stupid, it's not a question of
Sure, here everything's open all day.
Yes.
Night and day
Yes
It seems like a Latino city
I was in South Beach about three years ago
Yes but there's a lot of ambiance and a lot of ways to meet people, no.
Yes the truth, the social life is closer to the Latino
Yes, I had. I'm Columbian
Yes
I worked in a company that hired some people from Orlando, and there was a woman who said, It's not that Miami isn't in the United States.
She was American, and she said that Miami isn't from the United States, it's another different world
How long have you lived here?
For five years
For five years
Yeah, five years ago, right?
Yes, and you went straight to New York?
Yes, I came here directly. I'm open to go anywhere, but I've spent the last five years here.
Yes, and how do you put up with the cold? Isn't it very cold there?
Yes, I really prefer the cold than the heat
Oh yes, i'm, yes
Yeah, well, no, it's really something, i have a bad flu right now
Yes
And later on you have to go out with a coat
The thing about
But
The soccer thing, you can't play football there.
Come again?
During the winter, they can't play football
No, but there are closed places where people play a little. There a few. You know New York, right?
What?
You have been to New York, right?
Yeah, I've been there twice
Yes, on Manhattan, on the riverside, there are Piers, there are warehouses out in the open, and they play there
None
There they play a little and it's really like two months...no more.
None
I really don't if the people attempt to play Saturdays or Sundays in a park or something.
Yes
Last year I was trying to play after five ears, then I got messed up and broke my tendon and didn't go out
But there are groups I imagine that try to play a little
And I
Is not too cold
I broke my internal ligament
Yes
Yes playing soccer also but yes
None
I've been here seven years of which
Yes
I lived in Tennessee
Yes
Tennessee is totally different to New York and Miami
I imagine calm for one
Yes it's very
Tranquil
Very calm, very Americanized, all of it, it's nothing like our own culture, you are not going to find it there
Yes
Nowhere
Are you married?
No, I'm not, you can't be married in Miami
Single
With all those women in Miami one can't be married.
Then tell me about one experience you've had in your relationships, so as to stick with the subject
To discuss the subject, I'm a person who stayed with a girlfriend for a long time.
Yes
Always with one...or the other...
None
Between break ups, but I try to enjoy as much as possible before I start dating another one
Yes
When , when you are near, when winter is coming, I need to be with someone to be warm, I need someone to burn me up
How do you find girlfriends? At discotheques, parties or on the internet?
My three ex-girlfriends
Yes
They used to be my friends
I see
So I already knew her, I had known her for a while
Yes
And things happened, and then we realized that we belonged to each other.
Yes
And all of my other girlfriends, we dated during six years and I dated with another one for three years
None
And with the third one, eight months.
Are all those women from your own country, or from here? How is it?
Two were from Argentina
Yes,
And the other one was from Peru
Peru, haven't you dated Americans, don't you like American women?
Yes, the Peruvian was American too, we were together for three months while I was living in Tennessee.
Yes
The truth is, I don't know if this also happens to you, but it's different. You reach a point in which
None
It's not that you don't understand it but you get to a point in which you don't get along with that other person, and I'm also
No, yes, that's my opinion too, but you have lots of experience so I'd like to know, what was the difference, which points
Are different. What should I know about it?
Yes, yes. The truth is
Which one?
In reality, when I started dating the American, it was something new for me, she was a pretty girl
Yes
But at some point, you need to use your own language to have a better communication
Yes, I believe that's a huge barrier, it's very, very different to talk in a language that is not your own, to express your feelings, that's true.
Yes
Yes, I believe it's hard, I mean, the relationship cools off pretty quickly
That's right, part of the heath is different
Yes, and
The feelings that you have for the other person
I mean, the way they are
You can tell
The way they dress, is it very different?
Exacty, latinas also take good care of their man, it's completely different than the way American women treat their men
Yes, very different, they all live on their own
And they are very independent, Latinas are different, they rely on their boyfriends or husbands, their partners
Yes
Americans are more independent in that regard
None.
It's like they are more open, open mind, I'd say
None
The Latin woman is dependent, she always asks you what to do, what to cook, everything
Yes
I think that's nice to have something to look for, I like that, because they
Yes
That's why i get more hooked up with latinas than Americans
Yes, and, are they passionate or is it a very cold attraction, how are they?
And
What was the reaction?
You're talking about sex?
Yes, it's important because
No, the sex, i assure you that the Latin woman is hotter than the american, it's not that the american...
No, yeah, that's the concept i have, right?, suddenly the woman is too cold, too practical sometimes
Yes
I think you're very used to the Latin woman, to be indulged, to them being passionate
It is exactly.
To them dressing, get dressed up, them worrying about their things, even the way they cook, all that stuff, isn't it true?
Exactly
None
Sex is more that you find out
Yes, OK
Good evening
Good evening.
My name is Nancy.
Luis, nice to meet you
Nice to meet you, what do you think about today's subject?
Yeah, it's, ok, about meeting someone through internet or
The
Well, not through internet, no. Personals, well, I don't think so, it's never worked for me, and I've never tried it, but
None
No, I don't think that, not for me
It wouldn't work
No, it wouldn't be essential
It is better when you meet the person face to face.
Sure
You can get to know them physically and know what they think and all that.  Through the internet, they can write
Yes
A lot fo things and you wouldn't notice
Sure
Or what kind of face they will have, yes
Yes
I've never participated before
Pardon?
You've never participated in having a relationship by internet or by an ad.
No, nor would I like it because well
Yes
Is the same
Yes, let's say in that.
Pardon?
Have changed a lot, the courtships have changed a lot, before it was very
Yes true
Very different, yes because, from what I understand before they would sit, in the old times somebody would sit in the living room in the middle of the boyfriend and girlfriend.
Yes
Yes now it has changed a lot
Yes, and even the courtships that last less time
Yes that's two months.
Yes
Never know or no
Yes
Or if not goodbye and thanks, yes
None
That's true
Have you met anyone on the internet or, or some personal ad?
No, I haven't been either. No I'm not. I don't have that way of thinking, of meeting someone over the internet. I'm not interested.
Yeah, you prefer to
I'm sharing with the person.
Looking into its eyes, face to face, yes
Yeah, sharing and knowing each other better, having a more.. contact
Of course
More intimate, and that way you don't share that
Of course, what have been your worse dates?, well, if you have had
That way of thinking
That you've had
Suddenly, when you're at school, that was like just to mess, and then you said uh, no, i don't like that boy anymore
None
Yeah, i remember once that, insisting, insisting and since that day i will never date anyone anymore like that
That, i know that like in my country, that's called meloso, when they take your hand, kiss you, right?
And lets say, you're not on the mood
And
At that time you're not just looking
Pardon and where are you from?
I'm from Colombia and You?
Colombia, Mexico
Yes Mexico.
Yes
Of the tone of your voice
Yes.
Yes, Imagined it, yes and have you had long relationships or what
The truth no, and I don't like it
None
I think it doesn't work because, well I've always focused more on my studies, right now I'm in the university.
Yes
That's my priority right now
What are you studying?
I study economics.
Very good
Yes
Now you should give priority to your studies and later,
Yes, I already studied the rest, no and at work, entertainment, etc.
Yes that, there's time for everything, I mean there will be time for everything.
Yes
In reality no, Because that right now, they aren't really for me, I don't share the idea that, they receive
Their boyfriends in their houses for as long as they want alone and in the room, I don't share this idea. Because now they say
They say that is modernity, so no.
Not including the thirteen or fourteen years old adolescents.
None
None
Yes
It is not much different than previous times.
Yes you can't at least, since they're a little bit mature. Not today. They're, they're kids.
Yes, they don't think about the consequences
No, They don't think about anything, they live the situation. But they don't think of what can come out of it.
Yes
They get unwanted pregnancies and this
Yes
Due to this for me, what they said is that kids who are thirteen, twelve, sexual relations and
Yes
Their relationship was the best.
Yes, right now, yeah.
No yes
Before no, one would remain, the women
None
Will remain a virgin until marriage, right
Now is very hard
And now
Totally hard already
Yes
That's practically impossible.
Yes
For the liberation that we have in this time that they are not going to let like their partners or something
They have several boyfriends and have their sexual relations and all that doesn't interest them anymore
Yes, okay
Before
Do you currently have a boyfriend?
I'm married and have a baby
Okay
Right now i'm enjoying that baby.

No agents for renting.
None
They are the owners directly of the building, so I work with them
None
I've been with them four years now and yes it's like one gets on the rails with the story. And this is even nice that of real estate.
I can imagine
Now I work, two or three days. the rest I'm with my baby.
None
So that I don't leave him alone such a long time on his own
Yes it's flexible. No, the schedule.
Yes let's say they are very very accessible to that, they know how the situation is that you can't really leave a little baby with anybody
Yes
You can see how they mistreat them, one says no yes
Yes for working, a lot, no
And suddenly when I realize it's that now I have his girlfriend here and you have to careful dating too soon
None
No
Yeah
No, that I don't share the the dating nowadays. There is I don't know now with time now when
What was the other question there? I didn't hear anything.
Yes
What was the other question?  I didn't get to hear it.
About the courtships on the Internet, of the ads, and what has been your first dates.  That's what I managed to hear.
None
There were four topics but, I didn't get to hear the other one
Yes, me neither.
I was blocking the phone.
Yes
I honestly don't know.
What do you think of the dates?
In Mexico...what?
Of the dates that you want to meet a girl,
None
I see it as a date unless the person is not interested in me.
To impress the other person.
Yes
But in that sense
Yes, no, that like, one has a very different way of thinking, like more mature, I think
Yes
So then no is like One is like more old fashioned a little. not so so much
No, sometimes I do think that techniques that were used before work.
Before, yes
You want to be more original, no, I say
Yes because all of a sudden, before anything the respect, if one already exist, first the friendship, the courtship a respect then like, like is a nice relationship.
Yes
That's the way of thinking, Yes.
Sure
Let's say that like that way of thinking was how I was raised, then, also. come here
Yes
Yes no Also not that in the dates no But yes, is different, having them respect you, one has to value oneself also as a person.
Yes
Then that's important too.
That is
None
Yes, your parents.
Imagine that in the university

The signal is going.
Yes

For example, this.
None
Do I turn off the light from here?  Through internet.  Yes, no, the truth is that they don't work.
Don't work in what sense?
I don't know, since you don't know the person.
There are people that, who meet, get married, everything via the internet.
And yes, there are so many things that when they're there everything can happen, anything can happen. But, what do I know
And so
I prefer to meet the person before. In any way. I don't know, able to happen to me in the future.

You're lucky
Lucky, yes.
You're lucky, you're working fairly little.
Liar.
Eight hours a no this is nothing.
No, you're not used to it, it's another thing.
It's not
Do they pay you for working more or for working eight hours?
They pay me almost nothing
Why do I ask? What's the point? Why do you work so hard, silly? Leave at five and stop whining.
What's?
Stop busting your ass before five; if they're gonna pay the same, they don't pay you more or less

That's good.
No, I had to read it again because I realized that.

I'm not really, I read it twice.

None
After I read it again
That's good.
No
And What else?
Why am I joking?
Ah, what was I going to tell you? How nice, no? How interesting.
How interesting? To talk like this?
Talk like this about things, talk a bit deep, right? of
The topic of love.
The love of a couple, right?
The first couple and
Why, what do you think of love outside a couple?
Is super fun, the couple

Idyllic.
Yes, love is very fun also Because
It will be like that Toly.
Tell me, because I've seen you have a lot of experience.
What?
You tell me something since you have so many experiences.
I don't have many experiences.
You were saying how many crazy things you had done in your life.
I'm a man of little experience a man who has been, beaten
Oh, sure
Beaten by life, beaten by everything, right? By the women, by rock and roll, by soccer, by everything, again everything fell to crap. Damn it.
What are you doing?
I can't talk on the phone and try to arrange those boxes.
Finish.
Is exasperating. As I was saying, I'm a very beaten guy
Tell me, you didn't say anything, why don't you tell me?
Life has treated me very badly.
Tell me one of your experiences
Excuse me?
Tell me one of your experiences
What
I don't know, teenager, 16 years old
Excuse me?
Some experience when you were 16 years old
When I was 18?
Yes
Which experience, and yes, it would be annoying that
Yes, it's annoying, so what?
Yes, Were kids
18?
Excuse me?
18?
At age 18, even worse
What was it?
None
When was your first time?
At age 25
Go on, man
Seriously
What a jerk
At twenty-five
Go on, tell me when, don't be silly
I don't know, I don't remember
Well, more or less
I don't have good memory
Go on you fool. Why don't you tell me?
What would it be? Eighteen
You were old already
None
You were old
Seventeen. No, I don't know. Fifth course. Sixteen, seventeen
Alright
No, fifth.  No, fourth.  I don't remember
And with whom?
I don't know, I don't remember
A club girl? A club girl?
None.
Yes or no?
Yes, but I think that, I don't know, that
Where?
Yes, fourth year. I don't remember
Carlos from New York, Carlos from New York
Carlos, hi I'm Pilar
Good and you?
I'm Pilar, how are you? is not Carlos I thought I knew you but no
Oh no, where are you speaking from?
From New York also
From New York? oh how nice
Yes but you are Spanish or no
No I'm
Man forgive me is that
None
I know your friend Carlos who is from NewYork.
Yes.
What?
Then what are we going to talk about, the equality
Yes, what do you think of this topic
Hello, tell me
What do you think of the topic of equality?
Equality there's no equality right?
Yes of how can the inequality that's in the United States be solved or
None
None
None
You have to talk or else they won't count the call
Sorry, I don't understand?
You have to talk
No
...or the call won't count.
Yes what's happened is that my friend passed me the phone because she's pretty shy, pretty stupid
None
I'll talk better because I made the other calls, I already have around seven calls
None
Out of twenty five, right?
They're twenty five
Are you Spanish?
Yes
Or French?
No, Spanish
I was in Spain, I know Madrid
Yes, I'm from Madrid
I used to go a lot to there near Spain Square near the Collao Station and near all those places
Did you like it?
Yes I liked it. I have many photos in those very big castles that were there
Castles in Madrid
Yes ther are some castles, like museums
None.
Those palaces, the exactly many garden, some big gardens and the palaces and all that
Yes
Yes, I liked it and I was there in summer, very nice.
It was sure hot there one
I used to live in hostels, I did not like it because the rent was high.
Yes it's very expensive; it's as expensive as New York
Yes, I like New York more
I like them both
Have you been a long time here in New York?
A year and a bit
Oh, and are you used to it?
Yes more or less it's that I live at the University
You are
And here at university yes I've gotten used to it, I don't know much else but well
You're an intern at the university?
No, I live in an apartment but I have a lot of work that I don't have a lot of time to go and see the city
No, I know the plan like a tourist, I've been
Sure yes
To the tourist sites to visit, but I don't go a lot
After you are there a year then you'll go back to Spain again?
No, I'll still stay longer
Well you're studying there
Yes, I'll stay a few more years and then go back to Spain.
Because you have a student visa?
Yes
That's why when someone's calling, I'm here but I could pass the telephone to my friend. She's guieya. She's guey.
Since she gets pretty shy when she speaks with women because she only speaks with men, she's a little shy so I listened to what she said
That whenever she wants with someone, I said, I bet you're talking with a woman, because I'm talking with a woman, and she's talking with a man, so she's happy
The topic of today is equality, right?
Yes we haven't talked about the topic
You know even if you don't talk about the topic they don't say that it doesn't matter, what's important is that they want to hear you talk a little for twelve minutes
Yes
The topic of today is equality so yes it's like if there's equality between the man and the woman
He no, in total, in general equality between rich and poor, equality between men and women, equality between
Between all
The races all the equalities
Sure I don't think there's equality here
No, there's none.
Nowhere, there never will be that's what we all would want for there to be equality of rights, equality of opportunities, equality of everything but that's not like that
No but you believe is possible for there to be a way to have equality
I would like for there to be some equality but like I tell you it's almost impossible I mean I don't think
I think it's in the human core to be unfair with others, and
Yes
I mean if you meet two people and you like one and the other you don't
None
Already you are not going to treat them the same, it's normal right?
Sure that's why I tell you I mean that as much as we want for there to be one hundred percent equality that is equitable, there won't be
That's like in the way I believe of the people of the humans, we are like this there's no equality that's why I don't believe in that of equality
And I say that there should be for example I find it unfair for example in my country, I'm from Chile
Yes
When they would put a job in the newspaper it would say lady cashier needed up to twenty five years old
Yes
Security guard up to 35 years old; in other words they already limiting people that are older than that and cannot give them the job.
Yes, and that's allowed because there's work discrimination that's prohibited, but
But they do.
In general, almost everything is permitted.
Exactly, i mean, there are lots of thing that shouldn't be done but they're done, and even if we try to change the world and make things change
Everything is going to be a never-ending story and it is always going to be the same.
Do you think there is more inequity than in the United States, for example in Chile and other places?
For example us, look, me and my friend, we're guey, right?
None
And there in Chile, we're like more limited, i mean, if you're guey, uh, you have less chances of being taken seriously, they make fun of you, they do heavy pranks to you
Yeah
I love this country, I feel really free here.
This country, because you're in New York
That's why
There are also other parts of this country where i think you'd be probably worse than in Chile
Yeah, that's why I'm telling you, I choose a good state to live in and now I've been here for almost two years like you
Yes
I'm not going back to Chile
None
I'm staying here to live because i like the way of life, because here we have the same rights as anybody
Yes
Even though now
There are also rights here, but are there gay marriages here in New York or not?
No, not here, in other states, Massachusetts, Washington, right?
So, of all the rights, that's still missing, right?
Yeah, no, it's true, but i don't agree with that too because if i got together with someone i wouldn't like to marry either, have children and all that, right?, i think it's going too far
Right?
Yeah, the truth is that I don't know what to think about that because my marriage is something so
Important, so serious
Right, but i mean that it's something so risky like the tradition of men and woman get married andÂ that's it
That, simply, to me a marriage between two man, two women, it just doesn't add up, right?, i mean, that
Sure, i mean, me too, i think so too, regarding that if i like another man, i can live with him, share
Have a relationship and everything you want, but from that to marrying like what Elton John is doing, spending i don't know how many millions with his boyfriend
That they're going to... one of the largest weddings of this time, one of the largest and most mentioned, because it's the first wedding
With such prestige because they have a lot of money and they're important.
Yes
But that happens at all levels
Yes.
I'm not a fan of marrying or adopting children because imagine the babies will grow and they won't know who's the dad and who's the mom
No, but the, what's true, and i think the United States does have a partnership, or it's called
None
That's, if you, that what's unfair about two people of the same sex not being able to get married, is that for example, if you live your whole life together
One of they die the person's goods go to the family of
Yes !
The one who died instead of the other when the marriage, if the husband dies, he gives money to the wife or the opposite, no?
Sure this what they're fighting about, they want justice that if they're two couples, to men have been like you say, all their life together, and one dies
It's right that the material things should go to the one he spent his whole life with
Sure this the only thing that yes, I see that
Yes
I think it's good what seems stranger to me is what you say, the ceremonies and all this seem to me
This is what chocks me, it's not that I'm an animal, it's simply that I haven't been educated like this
Yes and no
It seems pretty strange to me
Me too, imagine I'm with my family,  and I'm not used to is because I find it strange I'm put there, but this, no, no.
I'm not a supporter of this because I think that they don't have a reason to get married
Yes
Why get married with this marriage, it makes me laugh, it seems pretty ridiculous to me because you don't know which one will wear the white dress, the other in a suit
Yes if they're two men or two women
No, the two men dressed as men I say
The two
Yeah so the that one of the men dresses like a woman yeah
This is more as a joke.
It is getting worse
Yes, it makes me laugh but as I said, I find it that it's not necessary to get married, to have a wedding so that two people that love each other, two men or two women that want to be together
They can do it.
Sure
They don't have to show it off in from of everyone else and have the weddings.
None
That's why I'm telling you that I find it that there's no equality
No
There's no equality I find it unfair that women too, when some women can't when they are getting to good positions or when they are climbing up the social ladder
They just reach a certain topic and they don't let them climb up more as women can't get to those places
Yes, that's true.
I don't agree with that. For example, in my country one woman is trying to be president. Mrs. Michelle Bayalet in Chile is going to be the first woman to be president
And is she going to get picked, is she going to win?
She wants to on behalf of all feminist women, she's in favor of women showing men that they too can be
I think that's all right. That it would be something good for our country to pick a woman for four years.
In Germany they already have a woman that won the last election
None
The first President woman in Germany, she's going to be Chancellor of Germany the first one in Germany history.
Isn't she the iron woman?
No. That was in England.
Right? that was how she called
Yes, Marc Anthony.
That was Margaret Tatcher.
And this one is, Angela Merquer is her name.
In Germany.
But it has nothing to do with Margaret Thatcher people thought it was not going to work because is a little bit weird woman
And of course,
They donÂ´t have the. Margaret Thatcher was a very strong woman, very strong right?
Yes, it looks like that to me.
You saw her with the power but this one is like she was a physics teacher in the university and she looks a little bit shy it is so curious it has happened
I say to you that I would truly like a woman from my country. There is Mitchell Bresalet that was a defense minister.
None
I would like her as a minister, and very important everybody loves her because we have always have left side presidents, and the ones from the left side the same as always steal money and promise a lot
In the moment they do the things they do not do it right and then sometimes is always good a change and to try another alternatives
Yes I think the best are the real changes
Yes then we had our left side president and now we would like a president from the national right side and another right side party
Yes, because when the party changes there is always so much enthusiasm. Well, not always, but
Exactly. That is good.
They are so enthusiastic that they do well at first.  They legislate good things; then things begin to turn bad and then it is time to change.
Hello, good evening
Hello! Good evening.
How are you? Whom am I speaking with?
What? Pardon.
Whom am I speaking with?
Maria.
How are you, Maria? You are speaking with George here in New York.
Yes, sir. how are you?
Fine thanks, and how is it going? Where are you?
Me? In Ohio.
In Ohio? How nice. What do you think of today's topic?
There's a lot of inequality here
Yes.
They are topics as if there is racial inequality.
Yes.
None
None
Economic inequality.
Yes.
Maybe in our countries you don't see that or you see it a lot,
Yes, sure.
The tries to have more.
Yes, I think that all the countries more rooted in inequalities are more rooted in inequalities.
Yes.
From here.
Yes, in our countries, yes.
Yes, but it's too much, the situation here is that everybody is equal and no, no there are inequalities like in all places, right?
Yes.
Not everybody has a right to all the resources or has access to all the resources, and do you think there's some solution or what would be the solution?
Well it's hard changing this because let's say that
Already too much.
That has to be made equal. Africa is different, there's a lot of poverty
None
There never will be any equality, because there's a lot of hunger also, so the ones that get it is for that.
None
None
And I don't know what magical solution
Yes, is hard, for that.
What magical solution, well I think that something can be done right? like in fact start by making the opportunity in education equal, by making the opportunity in,
The health means
None
I don't know those type of things, no we have to start doing something, right? It could be one, no.
Yes, at least in I'm from Mexico
Yes.
Let's say crossing here is hard.
None
They always look at you as if you were different.
Yes.
There are people that are fleeing.
None
I wish it was but
Yes.
Suddenly they just come to work and work
Yes. The border situation that's a different topic, right?
None
It has the inequality, that on top of it the opportunity to work is here, right?
Yes.
And
One does a lot to work and
Yes.
You forget the other
None
The other factors, studying, and learning other things, the language
Aha.Yes. We can insist that it's also the fault of someone who's a part of the inequality. No, he doesn't look, doesn't try to overcome it, suddenly, no?
Yes, it's the problem.
The thing is that what they give you are the ways, and another things is that you contribute to overcoming these inequalities, right?
Yes.
Yes, there are people
Yes, because let's say they're presented with an opportunity but they suddenly reject it.
None
None
They have to go somewhere else to look for opportunities.
If it's difficult, well they have to look for it somewhere else
None
Or, with a sacrifice
Yes, it's like this.
Try to overcome the inequalities. Say to a friend yes, definitely.
You see
The directors of the
Would lower
Of the country, of the world we
I would first help poor people a lot, Imagine to be able so that there is some equality and but it will be very difficult
Rich people won't want to give something to the poor
None
It presents
Oh, God.
Obstacles because we are in you saw too, people from Nicaragua
Yes.
And they don't have the means to get over
None.
So it's difficult for them too.
In what part of Ohio are you?
In Cleveland
In Cleveland?  How far is that from Columbus?  Three hours or more?
None
Yes?
Two hours. it's good to live in
How the environment there? yes?
To live well
There's a big difference
Well the hard thing is because doesn't have transportation.
Yes.
Because not,
You have to get around in car, yes.
A lot of transportation, hum
There's a lot of disparity in the city, as far as the neighborhoods.
You don't see that much
I don't know
There is more equality
Yes, because there are cities where there's a tremendous amount of poverty in some sectors, right?
Yes.
Yes, but you tell me that
None
That over there does not come up.
But not here because let's say one has the necessary and you can get it and the people don't look like over
Yes
That factor didn't doesn't
Yes, there are cities where maybe you don't see the disparities so well?
None
Well each person goes, does what they can, works. They each have their house, car but they get what they can. That's the problem, it's in almost all of Latin America, right?
Yes, that is the problem.
Where we have different treatments
Yes.
All different qualities. Everything is different. Here the majority go to public school and whoever wants goes to private school, right?
Yes because the countries. One has to pay the school
None
Universities
Yes, is very costly and very
One doesn't have for
None
None
Yes, Seriously. The majority of the people from the university and all that
But they maybe don't think in the future.
None
A lot of people like spend more than what, what they make
None
So then they don't plan that, they have a lot of problems like that
Yes.
There one has to go out oneself
None
Bettering oneself
Yes,  how long have you been here, in this country?
Of Eight years.
Three year?
Yes
Married with kids?
Yes, sir.
Yes?
Yes.
Your kids got into the city here or?
Yes, there's two.
Yes?
Yes, they've gone.
And how do they go?
What?
How do they go?
Fine, they have gone to Mexico but they don't like it.
No? They already feel
No, they say they are Americans.
Brothers of age?
Yes.
How do they get along?
Good, they get along no. But like they always that they are Americans.
Yes.
We've tried to instill in them that they are all the same.
Then you have the voice of instilling equality
Mm? Yes, because few end up instilling that no that is not the same they are
Sure
They are siblings and there's no reason to have differences in that sense.
Yes. Every morning.
Yes
If you don't have
Yes, because doesn't know it.
It is a very good job
Yes, they've gone and no, they don't like Mexico because
So that
That there's too much they say that too much filth, too much pollution
Yes
And the transportation
No.  Sure, because I can imagine
So
Yes, and, in the sense of that
They are sued to the routine, so, no
But
They didn't like it
You know that it's important to get them insisted to recognize
Yes.
Really?
It's celebrated the day of Kings, and the next day is for giving and gifts
Yes, so
Then, the problem is that you have to give the 25 and the 6
And the 6
Instead, other kids, not, because they are used that in King's day they are used to not
Yes, they get used.
None
You have an opportunity there to comment
None
The equality to know, right?, and other people in some conditions, right?
Yes
Not so good, because they might, not, and what happens if you have the opportunity of also, going out an comment, right?
Yes.
This happens with a lot of people from here. So they don't know the inequalities as much as we do, when you come from outside. When people from here go somewhere, they realize that there are really people who
Really precarious?
There are many poor people
Yes
And in Mexico there are many poor people.
Yes.
In the United States there are too, that that you don't notice much
Yes, you don't notice anything.
They are there.
You don't notice the inequality as much as you notice in other countries but it's there
Yes because, Yes, because many kids start, the kids are dirty
None
No, yes, they explain it as an economic condition
They have to explain it.
No
Yes, this is important.
Yes, but they told me that the fact that they were poor didn't mean that they had to be dirty. And, in this well, they were totally right.
Yes, this true. Yes, this true, like they tell you when you're
None
Small, you can be poor but clean and proud.
Yes, another because it's like that. They are poor but why don't they clean themselves?
None
One wonders
None
That suddenly no has gone
None
They sell those
Yes, they haven't had education, they don't have a habit
Yes.
Of doing these type of things.
Yes.
Your other kids
That's why I said, there's no equality
Yes.
We don't have much but we are clean and okay. suddenly like they start talking a lot in English and then
None
They look at them weird there also.
Really? Exactly.
So they don't like it either, yes.
Neither the issue, right?
I thought that they were out of school.
No, don't they?, No, but, if you have to go to them, si
No, suddenly
To really know their origins?
None
To be conscious and help in the future of someone else, right?
Yes, because if they say that they save, that save to
And, then
To when they are able
None
To buy something there, it's
None
To have in case of going, but not to get there
Ah, well, yes good
Yes, so they
How is school for your other children?
At first it was hard
A lot
They arrived with 7 and 10 years
Sure
Then, it was hard
Yes.
They fully got into it.
None
They felt strange.
Of course.
They said that it was hard and that
But
That they weren't going to be able to learn
None
No they are already fine.
They overcame all of that.
Yes, now that. Find the money too.
Good.
To study to continue their studies.
They are already big to continue
Yes.
Good.
Then  we go to continue to work.
This is good.  I feel that it's giving, to overcome the inequalities.
Yes, this is true.
Yes, because I think it also has to do with
Hello? Yes.
Hello? Yes. How are you? My no
This George calling from Los Angeles and where are you from?
Hello, my name is Adrian.  I live in Toronto, Canada.
Are you from Argentina?
Exactly.
It seems to me that some time ago, I believe, we spoke.
Yes, that could be.
Adrian, how are you? All is well?
It's not very cold.
How is everything going there. Is it very cold there?
No, to the contrary.  At this moment it's raining, it should be more than 5 degrees Celsius. It's about 15 degrees Celsius more than it should be, but
Or, basically that is, what temperature is it? Put me, it would be more or less?
It's not five. It's  more than five, positively.
Wow, that's pretty low, my goodness, my goodness.
No, but at the moment it should be ten below
Yeah. Really?
Yes.
Listen. Where are you from in Bueno Aires, from Argentina, Adrian
I was born in Villa Devoto
Villa Devoto, yes, I already remember. I'm from Lanus
In
Valentin Alsina
From the west, no, not me, I'm from the south
The Luz west, yes, Valentin Alsina Very good
I remember a sister of my grandmother lived in Valentin Alsina, yes I have an image like that, of my childhood of.
Of the ditch and the
You made me remember those famous ditches from when I was little.
The ditch like deep
The water is letting off a foul stench.
Yes.
I remember when
What I, what I remember is that you had to jump it, that it was, it was like the curb
Yes, it was disgusting
From Buenos Aires
I remember the house on the street where I lived for a long when I was very little. I was probably four or five years old.
My grandparents lived there, the house was of, no the street was dirt
None
Disgusting, those ditches,  Adrian
The dirt, the
We have to talk.
The street the, it was dirt but the pasture, there where the ditch was and where the land of the house was dirt
Yes.
But I don't know why it wasn't in the street, but
Yes, it was a, it was, Aye, aye, aye the worst was the rotten smell that came out of these ditches
The mosquitoes in the summer, also.
Today, Adrian, for them to credit our conversation we have to talk about equality, a really philosophical topic.
No, I don't know if it's being, I don't know how it is, I don't live in the United States
None
I don't know
You don't live in the United States
Yes, no, it's Canada, I live in Toronto, Canada
No, I understand that you live in Toronto. I know that you're in Toronto.
None
Canada is another country even though many Americans don't want to think of it as more than a state, it's another country, with another flag and
None
Another anthem and another culture and another
Exactly. how many years have you lived in Toronto?
I've lived here for four years
Oh, that's little Good.
A little bit, relatively little.
With-
Yes, but the topic of equality and a couple of things here that, that in that, that demand my attention
For example, the federal ministry of health
Yes
It's one, I don't recall the name, but it's a person of Hindu background
None
He speaks with an accent. Not a strong accent. He has probably lived in Canada over 20years.
Just imagine!
I know he's a doctor, but I don't know, it seems really satisfying that a person with an accent can be in charge of such an important federal government
No, just imagine, Adrian that only after some 20 years of living in a place, basically
No, 20, 25, the difference isn't that. To me the important thing is a person who was not born here,
Exactly.
And didn't go to school, didn't go to primary school here because he wouldn't have this accent otherwise.
And that
You understand what I'm saying, right?
Yes, I understand you. This really signifies great equality. That apparently, according to what I read, to what I see on television or hear.
You are saying, this type of equality is something that happens much more in Canadian society than in American society
Yes, do you understand what I am saying?
I would not imagine
I like it.
I know that there's a Latin group with Bush but it's an exception, right? it's very, some of Bush's advisers have last names
They must be Mexicans or but, no, no, I can't imagine, Bush's side, in a speech, someone talking with an accent
Or at least with a non-Texan accent
You are so right,
Or a different skin color, that too, the
Exactly, exactly!
There's the one thing that I value most in Canadian people is
Oh, that they suck it up - they respect all the people, but there's a bad side to that too because you have to accept things that you don't really like
The talk that I often have with my wife, so well you can be open minded but you have to suck it up if something else comes up.
Exactly.
So, you can't later say, I'm open minded but not so much, I am not for this, I don't like this or that, the
Exactly. Exactly.
One of the typical stories about that took place in the eighties when one person that wasn't born here, he was of Sikh descent
The one's that use turbans.
His family was from where?
Sikh, Hindu, the ones that use turbans
Oh yes.
He came here pretty young and his dream as a kid was he wanted to become a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer.
Oh, yes.
The ones that have the red uniform, and the little hat
Yes, yes.
Brown like Yogi bear and
Yes.
He his dream all his life was being a -R-C-M-P after he registered in school, he and, took the exams and passed and started to study
The moment of the graduation came, the problem was that he couldn't use the hat because he couldn't take off the turban
Oh my goodness.
Well and, what do you do there? and I know that here it was the .... not too long ago I saw a documentary on TV on that and
I know that the discussion was important. Up to what point is it good to bend the tradition to accept someone who is different.
In the end, they did it, they changed, they made an exception with the uniform and when he was dressed in gala, he uses, the Sikh turban
Color, the same color as the hat of the -R-C-M-P
Okay
Something like that I don't imagine, in a marine of, in
No,
I don't imagine the U.S. Marines
Unfortunately no, many people tell me that Canada is a great country
In many things really is a great country in the equality, in as you say in the open mind
In the possibility, in the in the multiculturalism and apparently, in the freedom of expression they apparently have many positive things that here in this country, in the United States
I still haven't had the opportunity to visit Canada because it would cost a lot.
Is in my immediate plans
Now that the Canadian dollar is high, it will not be as cheap as before. But this place isn't perfect either
I met two or three people that came from the United States to here and because they had bad experiences,
Two of them were Chinese or, or of Asian background and one of them was muslim, i don't remember, pakistani or
Yes
I don't know where he is from. The number one reason why they left is because they could not stand
I'm not sure if estimation is the proper term. I don't know if estimation is a strong word, the
I don't know, the problem here is that you're never going to become a millionaire because taxes are too high, you're going to die of cold
They're very high, right?
Yes, you're going to freeze the whole year and
That's true, except if you go to British Columbia, it has more weather
Vancouver
Peaceful that resembers the one from Los Angeles.
It's like Seattle. It's not the problem. The only problem of Vancouver is, it's a beautiful city, gorgeous, but it rains for three hundred days, like in Seattle
None
Oh, it's a
Yeah, always something
It's very similar to Seattle
Hello, my name is Yolanda.
Hello, Yolanda.  My name is Joe.  How are you?
I'm fine. Where are you calling from?
I'm from Puerto Rico, but I'm calling from Denver, Colorado. What about you?
I'm from Texas and I'm calling from that same place, Texas.
How are things over there?
Pretty we had a nice day and everything is fine, and you?
Well, it was good too, the weather. It's nice here in the city, here in the mountains well it's pretty dry near the mountains and there are many fires.
Oh, yes. Does it snow over there?
I don't know, yes, lots of snow.
No, not today, I think I heard we had around seventy five degrees.
Over there?
Oh yes
Oh, that's nice.
Yes, wonderful, we had a nice afternoon, yes.
Where in Texas do you live?
I live in the Dallas Fort Worth area.
Dallas Fortworth
Yes, but I'm in Dallas right now, this is my last call to complete the twenty five, thank you
Yeah, congratulations, that's great, really great.
It's been a very interesting study talking to people from all around the world
Oh yes?
I admire there's so many people from different countries, and they're good, and they're making a better life for themselves, and i know that it's hard to be away from
Their countries and relatives
That's in the United States, right?
I'm from here
And you were born there, I mean, here
Yes, this is my country. And where were you born in Puerto Rico?
I was born in Puerto Rico but I have been living here for twenty six years
Almost
My daughter, she's native from Colorado
Right
The loves to have the, that inheritance, but she's also half mexican, son
Yes, right
Yes, her mom is from Oaxaca, Mexico
Ok, Oaxaca, yes
And she's super funny because when she's with one or the other
Right
Her accent changes
Yes
When she's with her mom she speaks with a Mexican accent. When she speaks with
None
The woman with the Puerto Rican accent was with me
How interesting.
She's very adaptable, she's a lovely girl, I love her a lot.
Aha. And how old did you say she was?
My daughter?
None
She's going to be six next month.
Yes, what
She's in kindergarten, she's reading.
Oh my goodness, yes.
She sings and I'm teaching her piano.
None
She likes sports. She's a very active girl, and has a very beautiful heart.
How nice. how nice. And just
And you, Yolanda, do you have kids?
Yes, I have two kids. My kids
How nice.
Are already, they are males, twenty five and twenty three.
Yes, you know that your voice sounds like, almost a girl.
Thanks.
How nice, what a blessing.
Yes, they are fine. The youngest is married and living in Nebraska.
Yes, Nebraska
The oldest one lives with us. Right now he decided to go back to school.
Hopefully he'll finish. Right? How nice.
Yes that's what we are working on,  you already see, when one has kids, there's always something to do
Sure, sure.
Yes, and you've always live in the Colorado area?
I breifly went to New York, but from there I quickly moved to Denver.
None
And I have always liked it here.  I like it a lot because
Yes, is very pretty.
One can enjoy a lot, like the four seasons here in Colorado. The mountains are very beautiful, if one wants to go camping,
Yes
Fabulous places, and there are a lot of historic places to see also, here.
Yes, a lot of history.
Yes, Have you come to Colorado?
I've passed by there several times, and I've gone there to, ah, Beaver Creek.
How nice, yes.
Yes, I saw, very nice
Have you gone skiing over there?
I just went to see, because, I don't put on the skis
Yes, Beaver Creek is beautiful, yes.
Very beauty
If you go more to the center of Colorado, you would see places that seem like paradise.
Aha.
The beauty is incredible. I got my last vacation. I spent it in Colorado, two weeks exploring the state
None
I had a fabulous time. Some of my friends came.
None
We went to the mountains and some of the passes were intimidating at a certain height.
Yes.
In the ten thousand, twelve thousand, and fourteen thousand feet, this one looks like that
Yes.
By the ravine you lose your site looking
Yes.
It is very intimidating. I always get a little bit of anxiety when I'm so high up like that. But, it is something good.
Yes, is something awesome?
Awesome, yes
Of the greatness of the mountains, yes
That's true
And we went rafting too, on the river. Which river did we go to? The Colorado River I think
Yes, that's one.
And we were rafting and that was an experience too
What level did you choose? You don't remember?
Yes, oh, no. I don't remem-
There are some that are, the truth is that they scare you to the last, and others are more soft. But in anyway, rafting is pretty strong
It was fine, soft. But, it looked dangerous but no. I was thrilled with the journey
That's cool.
Yes
Did you go on Spring Canyon?
It was on the ninety
Around then?
One, and i don't remember where it goes, it's that, when you're there for the first time, and everything is running water
Yes it's true. But yes it's beautiful
Yes, it was very nice around there.
Well, and speaking of today's subject, even though they allow us to talk like that, it's OK
Right
I think there are many things that still separate the American people.
Yes
Just like in the whole world, there are political ideas, nationalist ideas and races. Racism is still common in many places.
Yes, very. And, excuse me, but I didn't understand the word you used, what did y-....?
Immigration?
Was it..
Oh, immigrants
Was it immigrants? I didn't quite understand the recording
Yes
That was what they said. Immigrants, OK
Yes
OK
How do you see the situation here in the United States?
Yes
The kind of things, political aspects, races and things that cause division and still.
Yes
OK
Sorry.
Sorry
Well, you see. Among people of the same race, there is division. You see, there are communities of Hisp- of Mexicans, or Cubans, or Puerto Ricans or even from here
I didn't speak much Spanish because I grew up in an,
None
American world, speaking English.
Yes.
I was very embarrassed to speak Spanish, because the people that came from other countries would make me feel as if I wasn't
I felt bad when i spoke with them.
It is true there was a lot more prejudice about that in the past.
Yes.
That is something that I'm instilling in my daughter, she should never be afraid to speak Spanish.  Spanish is a very beautiful language.
Yes.
It is very important that one is bilingual here in the United States
Yes.
And, she's learning, her kindergarten is in Spanish, although is mixed with English, because I want her to learn to read and write Spanish well,
None
Living in the United States, she is speaking both languages very well, and
Words, she reads them well in Spanish and in English. I don't want her to forget I know she will need it
And is how the parents impose, or adapt them. Like you say, Yolanda, sometimes the same pressures that they put on them, one is already afraid of speaking Spanish.
I'm very fluent in English but I'm never afraid to speak Spanish.
Yes. now I'm learning, and now more, since I'm old, yes, I don't get, a little embarrassed, because I don't speak it very I speak it, I speak Tex-Mex.
You speak it very nice, you shouldn't worry about how you speak it.
Thank you
We all have an accent, all of us
Yes
So, don't worry about that.
I am learning to pronounce the words properly and to use the right words. Because here in the United States some words that are used in other countries, may sound different
Right
Yes, and I am leraning more and more
And you tell me! I was married to a woman from Oaxaca and the language, the words there, compared to Puerto Rico, there are lot of different words, and others who have different meanings, and phrases too
None
I learned a lot with my wi, my ex-wife now
None
But I learned a lot of the dialect
Yes
They speak in Oaxaca.
None
We the Puerto Rican, decompose words a lot
None
Because, I learned to talk more properly here.
None
I realized how we shorten the words. Instead of saying
Yes
For, we say, for there
Yes.
I'm upset as I'm going there and they are killing the language.
Yes. I have some friends that come from Costa Rica, and you you. And, more formal Spanish.
Yes, yes
And I admire it because it sounds so nice.
Yes, it is very nice.
Yes.
Spanish is a beautiful language. How we treat it sometime damages it but the written language is beautiful
Yes, very beautiful. I also cannot write too well. because I don't know the accents well and all the grammar.
Grammatically, I can't write too
Yes.
I can read it, and that's important.
Sure.
Yes.
That's good. I imagine your kids speak English.
Yes, but now they are trying to, to speak Spanish. They already see that is very important.
Yes. Very important.
They understand, if one speaks slowly.
Yes.
But, they can't speak very well. But they wish, now they have the desire, before when they were younger, they didn't have the desire, because they said that they didn't need to speak.
Spanish.
Notice that there are many people speaking Spanish here in the United States.
Yes.
Here is Colorado, the stores advertise many things in Spanish.
Yes.
The commercials, even on the normal channels, like NBC or ABC
None
CBS is having more commercials mixed with Spanish.
Yes. It's because they're seeing the power of the Hispanic people here in the United States. We're here.
Sure, big market.
There is money there and people will try to win their products
Sure, I imagine...
Yes. Sorry.
I imagine that there are many Latinos there especial-
This is Maria Ines from Philadelphia.
Yes, hello, my name is Blanca from Finex
How are you? Where are you from originally?
Colombia, yes
Columbia. I'm from Argentina.
Yes
Can you tell?
I can tell
Do you know what they say, if you can tell, you can tell
Yes, I can tell easily, there are accents that are unmistakable, no?
Maybe, yes, yes, no, at least IÂ´m not from Buenos Aires
Yeah
What do you think about today's subject?
Well, inequality
Yes
This is a country where you see more inequality.
Yes. No.
Yes, you can notice that here immediately, definitely
It very noticeable in Finex?
Yes, here itÂ´s very common, who would think that being an immigrants state, totally near the border, but you can notice it and notice it a lot
Look, it's closer to the border with Mexico.
Yeah, I'm up from the border, it's a border state with Mexico
And it's filled with Mexicans and
Mostly Mexicans.
There are problems like that with the americans, with people
Not at this point, but closer to the border because I don't precisely live next to the border.
Sure
Between any people that's of a different color to them, or different physical appearance, or different features
If they don't like it
They at least tell you, and on top of that, they tell you that, you go somewhere and i speak really bad English
Right
I go and then they say they don't speak mexican, so i tell them i don't speak Mexican language, the language is Spanish
I start fighting
Sure
With my bad english, and i start fighting, i leave
But it is fine. It is good you fight with them. I think it is perfect.
Yeah, i go around fighting, it makes me so angry if i don't let them know that Mexico is not a language, it's a country
Sure
They are lazy and bold
Yeah, what a mess, it hasn't happened to me here, but the thin is that this is a very big city.
Is that
I mean it has happened to me that they don't understand me but not that they tell me anything but also I think that it is because they are very used to it
None
There are people from everywhere here what you do see a terrible difference here I don't know if over there also it with the African Americans
None
There's anger
Is that I think that
There's a terrible conflict that the African Americans are
I tell you that is everywhere
Look at that
Everywhere you go and there's an African American community they are are very resentful people that all they have lived in the course of
The existence of their past.
Yes
They are very forewarned people
Yes very aggressive right? Do you see that over there?
They are people yes
When they see that you are white, they treat you badly.  It's even worse if you don't speak English well.  They hate you even more.  It's terrible.
Yes
I didn't have any problems with the white people but with the black people yes and nothing I have absolutely nothing against the race obviously they are
None
But, specially, not the Americans, which are divine, but the African Americans are tremendous, it has happened to me many times that they get me wrong in a business or that
I don't know, that they deal with you without looking at you
It's very resentful people
Yes
It's very resentful people, but i think that's because of what they have lived in their history
Yes
Instead of wanting to stand out in a good way, it's the people... where you go, they make scandals or yell, it's very messy, dirty people
Yeah, you see?, they yell, it's terrible because, them and you walk in a different direction, that's it, it's not being racist
I don't like people yelling if I see them gathered in one place, I go somewhere else
Even more, yes
I obviously don't have problems with people of color, not at all, i love them, i think they're so much better than white people at sports
But to hang with that group of African Americans, they're teribble. Here they are.
Yes, that's everywhere, but in Philadelphia, there are more
Yes, in Philadelphia, there are lots of them here too because they are poor, that poor black people
None
What's the cause
Well, that's everywhere, I'm telling you, that like, they underestimate themselves, so, later on they don't try to move on with things
Positive things, but others, and of course I know a lot of black people that live in other places, and it's normal, I think.
Yes, for example, my boss's husband it black. He' African, he came from the Ivory Coast
And he's phenomenal, he's a very educated person, he's very nice, very smart, but he came from Africa
None
I believe this is a social problem, not a racial one, the one that they have here
Yes, it's mostly social and hard feelings so, there are people that think that since they had to go through all that, they are owed something
Sure
So, they don't have to struggle to get out, to advance, they feel like everything should be handed to them.
M people, immigrants that come here one hand in their back and the other one in front of them, they come to see if there's something they can do
Yes
And they work hard and they do well, they are not poor and you would think they are Americans.
None
They work so hard but there poor
If you go to Miami you can tell the difference because the blacks caused a lot of racial problems a long time ago
None
You do see lots of poverty and dust and mess
You see
You say, they want to feel socially rejected, they don't wan to live like that but they don't do anything to get out of that
Sure
Here in this country you can have everything
If you want, in this country, you can have good
Sure
Or bad things economically but if you want, you can progress. I don't mean that you can become a millionaire but you can do well.
Oh you can't study, you can look
Yes
Look for opportunities for many things, I'm unemployed at this moment and I'm going to the unemployment office
Yes
And they're going to sponsor my study.
Look
So I can get hired then it' a bunch of thing
I knew a girl, she was Argentinian, I didn't really know is a friend of my friend. And my friend would tell me that this girl got pregnant here
An Argentinian girl and the state paid her studies for being a single mother and so I can imagine the things there must be for the Americans
None
More for them that seem like a minority group that should have a thousand things to their favor.
Exactly
However, nothing.
Because I think I keep insisting they want to continue like that
Yes that I mean one understands poor people what they went through wasn't nice and and nothing but that was a long time ago already now they could say
We are already in another time right?
Sure it already happened I mean the white people that are now are not the people that had slaves and they are not slaves either I mean that's it we are human beings we are all the same
I don't know
These days I was filling out some applications and I found very odd that the girl told me directly is not that the paper said it because
In the majority of applications it says ethnic group.
Sure, yes
There, she tells me, which race are you, I'm part of the human race but I thought her question was pretty silly, I got so mad
Sure, yes
She looked at me and asked me where, and I was like, no, I'm a human being,oh, what race, I'm part of the human race, what ethnicity, what origin?
I'm Hispanic. I felt like, what is wrong with this bitch? Those are really stupid questions.
Yes, they do ask you that a lot here. that had never happened to me before, to be asked what ethnicity do I have
And which race
In the beginning, I didn't know what to answer because you can choose Latin, Hispanic or white.
Yes
What do I know, I didn't know what to chose and now I always chose Hispanic, I've realized that I belong to that race.
That race, let me tell you, they come up with such silly things!
Yes
I don't understand it
Why are they using it for? I think that sometimes, companies have to have a certain percentage of employees of every type, right?
None
It's established in law
That's a particular way of approaching you when they ask which race are you.
It never happened to me
It did to me, and I laughed so hard, I said, thank you, I'm part of the human race.
Sure, I'm
That sounds like the little animal here
No
That is what it sounded like to me. I have never lived in Massachusetts
Look near here
I lived five years in Massachusetts and my husband was laid off from the company where he worked and then we came over here because we were tired of suffering over there
Yes and there where the weather is nice
Yes wonderful this climate here is wonderful is very bad in June, July and August is an unbearable heat
But here too
There's no humidity,it's a wonderful climate and I love it.
What's the temperature there now
Right now is around sixty more or less, seventy
How awesome
It's nice and without humidity, there's never humidity here
Sure
Only when it rains and here it hardly rains
Here the summer is terrible, the summer is heat, heat, but a lot of heat and humidity and in winter you die of cold
And is very humid, that's how it is in Massachusetts there, the summer is humid
Sure
The snow covers you up in the winter.
Sure
It's extreme and it's winter for six months. You see three months of fall, where the cold is crazy.
Yes
You have three months of winter that extend almost to the end of spring.  Then you only have a short summer and so
Go out and enjoy.
Sure, we got here a little while ago.
Good evening
Good evening
This is Carlos speaking from Houston, Texas
Hi, how are you? This is Gabriela speaking.
Where are you calling from?
I am from Vancouver, Canada.
Ok
You from where?
What do you think about today's topic about Houston, Texas.
Ah, very good, What nationality are you?
A, Puerto Rican
I'm a Mexican national.
OK, What do you think about today's topic?
Very interesting
Do you think that there are many inequalities now?
Well I feel that it's the whole society where they have to live together, different cultures, it's a bit difficult. At any rate in a country where culture,
It's homogeneous and where there's not much diversity in any way of inequality it's apparent, I think that it's something that it exists in humanity since, for ever.
I think the same.
What do you think?
In everything, in any situation, there is going to be some kind of inequality. Either about race, gender, and religion
None
Always, I think it is a part of our human nature, I mean, so much diversity
That's right, I agree
There is so much diversity in the world that there will always be room for inequalities to happen. There will always be the fight for power.
None
It is human nature, there is always a fight for the power
Yes
This kind of inequality
That's right, and the best way to, to know it, to know the future is analyzing history, along human history there
Has always been inequality. It is the powerful, the less powerful, and the one on the bottom.  It is all part of
Human nature, well I think that we are competitive, and since there is competition everybody wants his best
Do you think that inequality is alright?
Alright?
I think that the fact that there is inequality doesn't mean
None
One personn is going to be better than the other. I think that
Yes.
The fact of one person belonging to a minority
None
He is Spanish or because he is Afro-american, and i think that many, many minotities
Yes
They think that the fact of being a minority means they don't deserve, they don't fight enough to be able to stand out and have equality
Yes
In comparison with a Caucasian person or have a better social position
Yes, I agree with you, it's like, maybe
None
None
I think we all have right
Sure
I think, but what In my opinion, in many occasions, minorities, don't try, don't fight
None
But, what they might be
That's true.
In what's
I agree with you
Minorities do not try to fight in Texas.
I see many Hispanics that live here.
None
And they have lived all their life in the United States and even then they don't speak English
Yes, that's true
And, these kinds of things are a bit annoying, I think that since
None
It's not so difficult
No it depends on the age you can, on the age it was. You can learn the language, and if you don't learn the language you're out overconfident see because
How will you express yourself, how will you communicate.
Yes
From there you're disadvantaged.
Exactly how
In some form comes a key or something you can do for the issue of the topic of inequality.  This
I think that the fact that there's always been inequality and there will always be inequality, this doesn't mean that
Forms part of something that you have to accept as established and whatever. Even like you say, there will be people who maybe aren't interested
To rise above it because they feel that, that they can't, or maybe that a community or minority or race, or whatever, is inferior.
I think that in any way diversity is necessary. It's established by the same naturalness for evolution, but it's also the free will to decide what side you want to be on.
But it also corresponds to those in the minority. if a person says
None
I don't think that, a person of the Hispanic race should have this position, let's say it's a company
None
That's completely Hispanic
None
Sentence 3 is only utterances
None
There's also discrimination from minority against minority
None
Or likewise that the discrimination of saying, we don't want Hispanics, or we don't want a woman in this position.
None
Is, it would be, is hard to be able to fight it in in, against in that regard, I mean, to prove that a company to say it like that, has
None
Reasons for discrimination either for the sex, sexual orientation, religion.
Yes
They are cases that are extremely hard to prove
Yes is true, but
In the eyes of justice
I think that, in this case, the persistence, in other words not giving up. look for opportunities in some other place,
Look that the persistence has made the difference. We the women, for example, right now. You mentioned the fact that there's discrimination because in some
Companies they think, that a woman doesn't have the same ability, little by little, women have been gaining ground in that aspect and proving that, with
None
Hello
Hello, good evening
Good evening.
My name's Maira. What's your name?
Nicolas
Okay, where are you calling from?
From Pennsylvania.
Okay. I'm from Philadelphia too.
Are you? What's up, how are you?
Fine, here.
Good
To
What's up?
Nothing, What was the title about, equality?
Do you studying at the University of Pennsylvania?
Yes
Where are you from?
From Mexico.
Are you Maira from Mexico?
Yes
I'm Blanchet my queen.
You're a Blanchet?
Yes
What are are you doing?
Nothing. they gave me this when I got here, it was worth it. It's great right?
Yes, it is super good. I sent mail. You never saw it? I thought that none of the Mexicans were home. Only Arturo.
No
Yes is perfect. Is that since you never told me your name, you always told me to call you Blanchet.
Yes
To know boy.
How are you, good.
Fine here. What did you do on the weekend?
This
Giving the break
The break I went to Mexico. I was there a couple of weeks. Super enjoyable, and you?
How nice! I was also there, and in Charcatecas, and Guadalajara.
You spent it super great my queen
Well yes, it wasn't bad at all.
How Cool, what envy.
I saw the family
Aye yes, really important honestly. yes, that's what I wanted to return to. did you go to the exam that they had on the last day of class?
So until the twenty first of December?
None
Yes it was really hard But that God I had the opportunity to return and I had a really good time there. Honestly
On the twenty second. It's been a year that I wanted to do it, but no, I'm leaving. I hope it goes well
It didn't happen, I have to do it this week.
Did you have to be there for vacations?
You need to be studying everything
That's really cool
I'm doing the things to get a job.
This is true.
Totally
This really true, girl.
It's like this.
And how's the inequality?
The truth is that I'm not paying much attention to it. What did they say? That
They said that, something about inequality in the United States, about race, and if you think that it's something that can be solved or not.
None
It's like Mexico, it's something impossible. The people will never do it.
No, I think that here in the United States you feel it, no, particularly.
It feels great
Everybody can't stop thinking about these things. If you decide something, if these are black, if these are, and so on. I am surprised
If you arrive to a city, ans, the population is divides between the colored and the non colored, an so on
Yes
It is very marked, honestly
Above all
What about the gringos?
The United States is made of, its population is made of immigrants, so I am surprised that still they discriminate ones and the others. I mean there is nobody American
That's right
They keep talking about the foreigners. I don't understand. I think that here in Philadelphia, you can notice it much more than in other places.
And
Than in other cities
The black community here in Philadelphia is huge. You enter the University
None
And that is no longer seen. I mean, it's like another world
Yes
None
Have you also noticed it here? Because inside the University it is the same. All the works, of low range, they are always
They are for them
And when you find something related to administration, no matter how low it is, here in the University, I think I would do anything
None
When you deal with one who's a bit higher than the others
None
It's always white.  The stupider you see, it's always white
This is true
There's a lot of that stuff here, like they do it until the university. it's not, like, it seems that it's the way of working here. I don't really understand what happens.
It's a fee, honestly
But this bothers me a lot. When I came for the first time three years ago,
None
I saw, and I couldn't believe it. Like, I never thought that I would feel it so much.
So marked, yes. If you go there in Mexico,
Besides
And identify with people who are foreign. And more in the city, but here they say that people really strongly reject you
Obviously there's rejection, and there always will be. It's something that I say that will never be solved
None
Also as marked as it is here, this you don't see. You don't see it much.
It's more like they shouldn't be related to money
Yes, everything has to follow with wool.
Because the darker you are, if you have money you don't have a problem. Everyone treats you well.
Yes, this is very true.
I don't know.
It's rough.
Oh, how are you doing in your classes? the university, life here
I'm doing fine, I have a lot of engineering subjects
You do?
I don't have a lot of time to do anything else. I could take a writing seminar this semester
Cool, right, it's like a hobby
Okay
But everything else is. I'm taking a mechanical engineering course and physics and chemistry and math, the usual stuff
None
I'm doing fine. I'm holding on, I believe that this semester, I hope I do better because I didn't do that well in the last semester
It's your first semester.
It's the same.  I haven't done good in any semesters to be honest.
Yes
I always get a low grade in one subject and that lowers my GPA, it doesn't matter if it was, let me tell you, I wouldn't mind if it was outside
None
It lowers my GPC, but I mean, I've now resigned myself to think, at least I can do other things to
Well yes
To justify it, I didn't do
Yes, and it's a tough university, honestly, it is. I mean, it's not one in which you go and say, I don't know
Study your degree in commu, I don't know, in communication science in sweeper. I mean, don't. No my queen, here it is very tough. The issue
More because of the competition, crap.
None
Is cheap.
I'm shocked And imagine that here there's no much competition, I mean in engineering is not so hard than others.
Like in Wharton.
I don't know what rubbish they do one to another
That's true. So if you go to ~MIT there it is
There is people
They want you dead, don't they. I say, that I honestly say I couldn't live in an environment like that. But I have had great times here. And more now that we are, we are involved in rushing
Yes
About brotherhoods
Which one you are in which rushing?
I just came back from dinner, and I'm waiting for it to get dark again to go out.
OK
Yes, fuck. I don't know. I like the idea a lot. Because there are a lot that can be part of the brotherhood and do not change until
When you want. So live a year, or six months, and you can be there until your senior year if you want
None
Then I like that. Because I don't want to live there the next semester.
Okay. The houses are very ugly. I don't like them. But if you can avoid living there, is ok, right?
That is true and there is one we went to recently called the castle.
None
The one that is there, the One college hall it is great.
That is great, that is very good.  Even the parties they have are cool.
Yes There is like if I donÂ´t know. I liked that one very much
Cool.
What about you?  How are you doing?
I'm fine. Quiet. A lot of engineering ended. I would like to know when I will take some others I like, another classes, I think I am not going to do it. And right now I'm only doing campus recruiting
Well that of, lets see what happens, I don't have idea, the truth
Yes
Is that, is very competitive. You feel that is like everything is because of, people from Wharton really work much more
Than us to find jobs.
It is that way.
Yes, so, I am still with all, I have all for companies presentations, I cannot go, because I have classes.
That is.
I have classes all the day, it is not nice. I donÂ´t know, lets see. what happens, maybe something happens. And if not, IÂ´ll stay here
Yes, that is great. What I wanted to do was get a dual degree, but I need a super GPA and it is
Something like an impossible thing the damn one GPA is very difficult
What surprise me that there are people who do it
If there is a good, it is the worst, they ask you for a three point five, and as soon as you get the three point five
There are three hundred who have three point eight.
Yes
These three hundred came in first
Here not the grade
Ugly
What do you want to do it in?
I don't know if I will do it with the astronomy and physics department
Wow.
Or in finance. But I really like the astronomy option, wow. It seems really cool. But it's also really hard to get in. They have a lot of requirements.
You do this Until then you don't have a lot of subjects, no. I think that at best it will be easier. I think that it doesn't even have six, to
No, I would take two, no more than two or three subjects in astronomy and then I would specialize in physics. But it would be with this department.
They give me the option to, to take these three subjects
None
Asronomy is really small here. There isn't a major or a minor in astronomy.
Hmmmmm Wow.
Yes, it would be mixed with physics there.
That's really interesting and you end up learning a lot of things.
Yes, like I don't want to wait like this with my degree because maybe in the end I'll finish doing mechanics, and I'll change to something else
None
I don't know what will happen.  I feel really insecure about what I want.  I need to spend more time and see what I like the most and what I don't because I don't know.
I need to put my feet on the ground for a moment.
Okay. You don't have to know yet.
Yes, there's still time.  That's what worries me.
Okay, you have years and years to see what you do.
Yes, besides all that I'm taking now, are like very general subjects
None
As far as my major that facilitates the movement.
Okay
Then, about that, I don't have much of a problem. But yes, there we are. Will there be a Mex gathering at Penn soon?
This week we are seeing if Thursday or Friday
In other words, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow?
Yes
In other words tomorrow. Just send me a mail.
Is that they called me, they already called me here is good, very good, Luly and I sure, if they call me we'll do it Thursday, and I say, okay, if you want send a mail.
Yes, they said they haven't sent it yet but, if they haven't send it they will send it during the weekend.
Yes, super laid back.
Maybe Sunday, the other day we decide and then we'll send it. And for Thursday let's see how it goes.
To see what we do there.  Let's see if we go eat at that restaurant that's on second street that they say is super good.
Yes, there's several. We can do one of those. There's several restaurants that are very good.
Yes, listen, something like that, because today.
Yes
I can't stand the food here, it's so bad
Listen Sebastian told me they were going to do community living
Yes, we'll do it next year.
So..
The next semester here in Harrison
Very good, very good, how many are you?
We would be about ten.
Wow
Yes, since we live here, we'd rather stay. So we better try before they take us out and end up living in Kings Court
Which I don't think would be a good idea
Hello, I'm Manuel.
Honey
How are you?
Fine, here in Florida.
Me too.
None
Let's talk about the topic. Right?
The equality in the United States.
Yes.
There is no equality in being a female in the United States.
That there isn't?
There isn't
Okay.
I particularly see at my job daily.
None
The attitude towards the Latin, I don't find it has changed too much.
Okay
I find that it's the same, if not worse.
Okay.
There's too much stereotype as far as what nationality you are, in Latin.
Very good.
Them, I see it a lot with, how can I explain, with the Dominicans.
None
This, the Mexicans.
Yes.
I see a lot because where I work, yes, there are Latinos.
There are lots of Latinos
Yes, unfortunately, the problem is that the company we represent needs their services because much of their clientele is in Spanish.
It's cheaper to employ a bilingual person.
None
An American person that doesn't know Spanish couldn't take the calls.
Of course.
I see the treatment and I see the reaction of my colleagues who are American.
Toward the Lations.
Exactly and the comments.
None
You hear comments all the time, that how many Latino people are they going to keep hiring.
None
They are the minority, but they don't grasp the fact that one person is getting paid to do the work of two.
None
Do you understand? i see that too between Hispanics
Sure.
We here have lots of Venezuelans, Mexicans, two or three Colombians, and a pair of Puerto Ricans.
None
There's racialism between them.
None
It makes you say like, wow, still? Those divisions are supposed to have disappeared.
None
Just because of that, being Hispanics, I don't think we've progressed much.
Do you also believe that there is more inequality because of a people's origin?
For their sex
And for their sex, isn't it?
In the company I work for, if you're a woman you won't go far.
That's right, isn't it?
They
It's true, we have companies here that have been sued because of that, right?
Yes, they don't take those things into consideration.
For example, how, no? If they are sued, why don't they oppose the work discrimination against women.
That's kind of true, in a certain way. I also understand their point of view, do you understand? Women, in general, they are responsible for their children.
The opposite sex, they might have children but they don't have the
Is not here.
Generally, it is the priority of being an employed father versus an employed mother.
None
You know that from the point of view from the company, I can understand it up to a certain extent. What I'll never understand is that, You understand me?
It's penalized for having them at the priority where they have to have it, the company has to see it from the point of view of production.
Yes
A mother, the probability of being absent more than a father is higher.
It should be. No.
There are very few fathers who are single raising their kids.
Sure.
Versus the mothers that are single, that have their kids, that they have to care for, that on top of that, have to work the hours. And, even if they are not single, it could be that they are married.
But at the time a kid gets sick, or that anything happens,
None
Generally is the mother who has to go running, go get him at wherever he's being taken care of,
Sure, there it mixes a gender inequality with a work inequality. Right?
More or less, is a combination.
None
Those are the things they take into consideration at the time of hiring you, supposedly they shouldn't ask you the question during an interview, but they do ask it.
Sure.
What are you going to do? Are you going to sue them because you told them you have kids?
They ask you when they shouldn't ask
By law, in the United States they shouldn't.
But, it's done. Right?
I have personally gone to interviews where they clearly asked if I am single or married and who would take of my kids if they get sick.
Sure, and they shouldn't do it, so, Right?
It's a federal law but what are you going to do
They can't
Let's see. What are you going to go to and say, in this interview
None
They asked me this question, I answered honestly, and all of a sudden, the position is filled
None
How do you prove it?
There, you're right.
It would be your word against the person who interviewed you, judge, and I, never asked that question.
None
You know that, I have seen it
That the question is asked, I do know it's asked. Right? when it's said they shouldn't.
I tell you that it's a law. It's prohibited in an interview, to ask that question, that's the same as asking if you are a homosexual or straight. Do you understand me?
Sure
One thing should not have anything to do with the other. But they do, and, I personally have gone through that.
Of course
I donÂ´t believe equality is present in the USA.
There are many inequalities in many parts of the U.S.
Legality and equity are right?
None
They always penalize and criminalize the immigrant figure right?
I'm sorry I cannot hear you very well.
I think it's a negative stereotype of the immigrant, right?
Yes. how can i explain this you know I have family from the Dominican Republic.
None
I am Puerto Rican and thank God I don't have to go through the process of obtaining a visa.
None
I have family that have been through that process.
None
I have relatives who have gone through all that and then you know you have to go through a lot and also have no rights
Yes
I have seen the abuse you know that if they did those things to me I could claim my rights
None
Only because I am a citizen, you know you have to go through that process, they are trying to become citizents
Of course
People, in general, adopt a very negative attitude. They have the point of view that they are coming here to take their jobs, that
And they just can't realize, can't know the truth, They are not taking them any job, because any American can apply for that same job
He'll be given it
Exactly, right?
But, they don't want to go to a farm to harvest oranges, for
Sure, that's true, I think it's the point of view of somebody who has little education. If he is really convinced that an immigrant will take his chances
If you knew, this opinion is, is very, very common
None
Even from people that I, let me tell you. I hear that in my job all the time and I stare at them, because they are so ignorant.
They won't be that, intelligent, then, right?
They are educated people who are doing the comments. Do you understand? They are not ignorants who haven't gone to school or who know nothing about life
They are people who chorus the common voice
None
The adopt an attitude without knowing, because they haven't been through the situation nor know anyone who has been through that experience
None
It's sad, because I don't know, and specially it's sad for the Mexican
None
Who are, as far as I have seen, the most marginalized
Here in Florida
In Florida
None
You say that you are Mexican, and everyone assumes that you are picking fruits somewhere
Yes
Especially where I live, you have all the farms
None
They are women and they are good people.
None
It's a shame, because I know many people that are prepared. And many times, because of the language limitation, they can't find jobs in other things.
Really?
I'm talking about having studied in their country, and they have a title
That's the problem, it's based on the legal rights they can have
None
And since those are close, they have to
If you are not bilingual and do not understand English perfectly, you are very limited.
Also
Nor, not for, the assumption.
None
I have a supervisor that told me that I shouldn't be talking in Spanish.
None
I looked at her, and I told her, l regretting the case, that's why they hired me
None
Unfortunately, you can't be offended because of that, this is my native language, that's the one I speak and sometimes, it is easier for Latin people to communicate in their own language than to try to translate it into English, specially if one of its colleagues, is
Barely, like they say, starting to learn the language.
None
She said, I know a way, in which you could understand it up to a certain point, but only to a certain point.
Exactly.
Because, you can't force that person to speak the way they find it easier
Sure.
You know, instead of becoming shy, I know they are speaking, lots of things are involved and you are like
That's stupid, but they cause some problems within the workplace.
It causes lot of abuses. They make some comments that aren't well intended.
Yes, No, if you go to a supervisor and tell him, look this supervisor told me this and that, you are always the one to blame.
None
If they were speaking French or German or some other language, I don't think the reaction would be the same.
That's right, exactly.
Do you understand? I believe that we also have other coworkers that speak in Italian and I find it funny.
Yes.
But, you can't speak in Spanish because they get mad.
Sure, they don't like you
What's the difference?
Spanish, nor in, probably, nor in Chinese.
Excuse me.
They wouldn't like your speaking in Spanish or Chinese
No, that's the funny thing; there are two people that speak a
If it was a European language, yes Right?
One that speaks, Portuguese, and one that speaks Italian. If they reverse to their language, there's no comment. Whereas the Spanish, then they are, their faces mounted, and the attitudes.
None
And, in my understanding, I understand that is a form of racism
If you are American and have lived here all your life, you know that there's racism in your country. Right?
You stay
There is in many place, right?
My son has experienced it, and he's a kid.
None
I mean, he came from school, and he told me he had classmates that he couldn't talk to because the classmates didn't talk to him because he was brown.
None
And I had to tell him, well, my love, is that you are not supposed to be white.
None
How can you be white since your parents and grandparents are not white?
None
You have nowhere from where to come out white, it's not meant for you to be white, that's of kids.
There's no need.
This is what they hear at home.
Yes.
You put it in all the kids that
Hello my name is Miriam
Hello
Yes good evening my name is Miriam
Hello. My name is Mauricio. How are you?
Thanks
Have you already participated?
Pardon
Have you already participated?
Yes, I've already participated
How nice! The topic is equality?
Yes equality how is the equality in the United States
Okay
There's a lot of inequality, right?
Yes I think there's inequality and I think that it's not only in the United States, there's inequality in the whole world
Yes, but you like you feel it more in the United States in what way
Depends there's although they talk a lot about equality, of opportunity and all the truth is that is no is not equal I mean there's no equality
None
I've seen it for example for the Hispanic right?
None
I don't see that there's equality and also there's an equality that I say that when they talk about equality for example with the homosexuals, you understand me?
There's no equality with the homosexuals
No, I think that there is
How is that
As far for them.
Okay
Within the freedom within the freedom but is bad right? but as far as equality as far as Hispanics I think that there's really no equality there's no equality and there
Okay
There's  a certain type of inequality.
Who would be the ones who make the equality
In
Who the employers, the government, how do it
The people, I think that the people
The white people or the colored people
The people in general yes the American
Okay
The American and I think that to a certain extent you're right you're right to a certain extent
Why
They've come to invade their land, invade their house, and they have brought a certain amount of culture which affects the country
None
I think that to a certain extent they have the right to feel like that
But remember that North America is a continent of immigrants
Yes and
Because they themselves immigrated from another place.
Yes, but and the
The American came from Europe
Yes, but
They displaced the race the natives that may have been may have been whatever old
No, but
Partner
But at the end they are already here, this is their land so it doesn't matter where they come from. This land is theirs and this is their home.
But regarding equality, as human beings, we are all equals and we are all eual before God. But the reality is that in the world there is not equality.
If there were equality there were not wars if there were equality there were not problems between countries
Yeah
That is what I think it could be that now everybody has the freedom to have more or to have least, that we cannot go farther because each one
Has is freedom right? I think there is not equality, that it is a problem of humanity, not just a problem in the United States
In all the country as a Hispanic
Yes that is true because since the ancient times from the beginning of history man always tried to dominate man, the weaker.
Yes of course, and it will always be like that
It will always be like that because the
There is freedom, but there will always be inequalities.
There's always going to be inequality, some will have more than others
I see
Always
Apparently, you think the problem has no solution.
It does but it's complicated because, how can you, how can you do something to have the same things as your neighbor does, do you understand, you have someone beside you and how do you do it so that you have the same or what can he do to have the same things as you do?
I mean, no government is going to pass a law or make you believe that
You can have a government that can equal men in terms of food.
None
Are you talking about physical stuff or also about the
No, but when a government tries to create consumism
I see, but it didn't
It hasn't worked, no, it hasn't worked, the result has been the same
Don't you think that the Bible says that one must think of God because God is always promising us paradise
Yes
Do you think one should wait for
If we are going to talk about the Bible, God always says that we are going to have poor people among, there's always going to be poor people, I mean, when he said that, it's because they are going
While the boyfriend is away, while the boyfriend is away he doesn't see Jesus
While
When you have a boyfriend you should enjoy it. There will always be poor people
Yes, always, there's always going to be inequality, one person is going to be fat and the other one is going to be thin, inequality, how can we equal a black person and a white one
So, equality, in the end that you will always have more money than the other, sure, how we make this equal, we will ahve to see
Equality in terms of what I think that here in this country
No but I think that the question refers more to being unequal in the sense that I think that it refers more to discrimination and if there's discrimina-
How you suffer the fact that it's unequal
Well look, this is a problem for all of humanity
How can it be solved
And yes, if we go there, then the Hispanic person also discriminates against he American.
Yeah
Yes or no?
I've never been in the United States.
Yes, they discriminate because they speak badly, they complain about them
But there's a second language in the United States, which is Spanish in some states, right
None
Where do you live exactly?
I'm in Charlotte
Where? and where is this?
In Charlotte, in North Carolina
There are many Hispanics there.
There's almost more Hispanics than Americans, and where are you?
I live in Toronto, Canada
Being in Canada's okay
Yeah but in Canada they say there's a lot of discrimination, or you know when, when it was a very pretty government, a socialist government
Yes
Here about ten years ago but it's been changing a lot now they say a lot, a lot of people tell me it's like there is this
Sure.
Discrimination, there's a lot that they're already noticing
Yes
Even though they try to hide it there are a lot white people that are getting together, they are separating they look, with a little bit of disdain for other people
Yes sure
They are killing poverty
Still they feel invaded but if we went to Latin America and it's the same they would still complain about Americans you understand, this is a problem that's not just in the United States
That's it eh what country are you from?
I'm from Peru
I'm Colombian
Or Colombian here
In any case, everywhere there's going to be this problem because if you look, Latino Americans complain about Americans more today
We complain but they haven't taken a whole lot
A notice of good that's the the
They have looted us too much, they have exploited us
Some news now is saying that Hugo Chavez wants to plant an idea that he's making an alliance with the presidents in Latin America.  Everything is counter
Hugo Chavez, is that the one from Venezuela?
He is Venezuelan, yes
He's making an alliance with whom
He with the presidents of
Of South America
Latin America, of South America
For what, alliance for what?
He always goes against the Yankee imperialism as he calls it
I see, I see because then Chavez is of a socialist tendency, right?
Yes of course
He wanted to get him out a couple a times and hasn't been able to.
No
To Hugo Chavez they even tried to give him a failed coup, a failed coup d'etat
Yes, it's exactly that because of inequality
But
And for example we go there and the inequalities because he has given let's say like that a hard time to the rich people
It looks like it
He's in favor of the poor people according to what one reads in the news
But there will always be people who you can please
Of that
Because many people in Venezuela were middle class is the most fucked
The middle class, says that they complaint about Hugo Chavez because they say that they were fine and now with his measures there is not work and there is inflation and so many things
He affected with his measures he has affected not only the rich but the middle class too and many of them have come here and they complaint about the
Yes, of course. It is that way. I think it is not only a problem in the United States because, if you are not in the United States, imagine
No but The United States is a world power
It is a problem.
Everybody talks about it, and always even want you, or not always aware of what is happening there
Yes exactly but it is an excellent country and it worries about freedom but I I am Hispanic and I also see that sometimes they have the reason about discrimination
When there is that jealousy I think that, it could be normal
None
It can be normal can be normal because we are invading the land of another
I didnÂ´t know it was like that I thought it was
Hello.
Hello, hello, hello.
Hello, hello, hello.
Yes. How are you? Who's speaking?
Maria Ave, if you are good, but now there is no plan. You have to take care of yourself.
What are you doing?
In Philadelphia.
Hello.  How are you?
And who are you?
I'm Frederico.
From where?
I'm from Philadelphia. Certainly.
You were born in Philadelphia.
Yes. What do you think of inequality?
Why do you speak Spanish?
What do you think of inequality, jerk?
None
None
There's no inequality, we are all the same.
None
I think that in this country there is no inequality
What do you think about people who say no?
That person is wrong.
You see, it's easier
Do you think that for being white, for instance, or other things, you can be more than the others?
Absolutely. It's not that way
What do you think?
Yes, I think that, it's all part of a wrong concept, from the foundations
What is the foundation?
The foundation is that
Yes?
The foundation is always another. No, because the foundation is to believe that not knowing what you are.
If you knew what you are, you would realize that the differences with the others are so small that they are meaningless. But you have to know what you are
You know what I mean?
Sure
The, our concept, occidental, catholic, jewish, chritian, whatever you call it, tells you that you are, unique, and you, you area product of God, the son of God, and some other silly things.
That only increases egoism.  The fact of feeling unique, the only one,
You are something.  In fact we are no more than another living thing that breathes, walks, eats and shits, in this life.
Very little difference with the others
It's being done
And that includes other animals, but what I do know, there are people that still believe that they are born from a chicken and some think that
Well and that is part of their religion, right?
Yes, sure, exactly, yes, I mean, it's ignorant.
Exactly.
I believe that they should educate people
It was around the time of the Sixteenth Century
To teach the other people like we teach ourselves.
Yes, a religion.
There's no other solution. That's the basis of inequality.
Yes.
In the United States, inequality is not between races origins, color.
On education, if you are poor, you will die poor. If I'm a great basketball player, then you are saved.
Sure.
If you are rich, you are going to be rich your whole life, you go to rich people schools, you have wealthy friends, you earn a lot, and you'll die
Poor and that's inequality, there's no other way. The wealthy and the poor, they make them feel that
It's good to be wealthy.
Sure.
The rich people are happy, and the poor people are dreaming about being rich. There's people from so many cultures.
There are other reasons to live for and they tell you that it doesn't matter if you are not rich, or if you are not wealthy, the fact is that people
They give up their material possessions and live an apparently happy life, Without material stuff.
Yes, and many people also think that what you have and what you don't have
Of course.
To, right?
Oh, well.
Oh?
For example, the difference is in the knowing, it's in, the, the, in the, in the real knowledge.
Yes
But, how each head is made up
Also
We don't know what to think, inequality.
No, I want
What is inequality?
Talk about inequality, in fact, the word inequality.
No, well, inequality between people.
No,  they came right?
I don't know, why is someone born in a family with certain resources
It's part of
They can go to the university and you can do a doctorate and you can come to the United States and you can do whatever you want
And some other, oh, you live in, they are stuck. Oh, the parents, the mother is seventeen years old and they don't know who the father is.
They are addicts and he faces violence everyday and they end up in jail, they become drug addicts, and they end up being shot dead.
These are cult-basic
This the difference.
I don't know. Like, what did you tell me?
None
The last
Like you asked, that for you, like, where is the difference?
You have this cultural question.
In their majority.
They want to educate people.
The poor people can't be inserted with the rich because they're already poor.
Sure, but the problem, is that there's a sub-message, a subliminal message that says that, like, the idea is that people
Poor people believe that the only way to be happy is to be rich, having a car, a house or
None
None
This cultural, thisn't
No, it's good, for this.
It is ugly.
I see it more in this country where there's a consumerist culture, it's so inserted in our city, where everything is to consume,everything is to spend,
To have
Yes, more or less in the end, in big.
What?
Maybe the women.
Sure, the biggest, the most
Yes, that's why the last,
Yest, that's it.
Yes, I already know.
What do I know? I don't know, How are the inequalities in your country?
Is in Argentina
Are there inequalities?
Yes. There are inequalities, there are inequalities. But, no, they are not so, for me they are not as marked as they can be.
They are not so marked.
No,
And there's no racism?
Yes, of course. But.
There's no xenophobia against the Paraguayans, the Bolivians, the Peruvians?
Yes. No. Sometimes
In the, I think there's a lot.
Really?
Yes, I think that in Argentina, there's a lot.
This, you need it?
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Beautiful. I don't know You are seeing it, but you don't see a limit
And, yes.
With that
Yes, I am of origin.  If you have some native blood and you screw up, the first thing you are, you are black shit
Is well.
I don't know. You were driving a car and got distracted.  The one who was driving next to you screamed black shit.
They don't scream prick or jerk, or nothing.
That also
Then me as a blonde was shit, wasn't it?
Then it's good.
Yes, but there we are.
Okay, I'm not saying that it's not. But there comes that habit that the blacks are resentful because they don't have what the rich ones have. They are poor.
No, that of resentment is
That's true. You can notice that, and see it.
That,
Yes because they tell you of shit I've heard many times
The
Rich shit I've also heard many times from other people.  When you go to Miramar and the ones from Miramar were fighting with the coastal ones, and it was the shit.
And it does hurt the feelings, that is
That's where resentment arises.
I don't know, I mean, obviously, it's racism and it is racism because they feel undervalued.
It's their reaction, yes.
None
It's like a reaction to all of that, I mean, that wouldn't happen if there wasn't a reason for it, I mean, action and reaction.
Yes, the action when you push something, the energy that it has on you is the reaction. If you don't push it, you don't have the reaction. It's the same in this case.
Yes.
It is a reaction you are having. It is the social reaction to your discrimination, he feels discriminated against
What does he do? He joins others and they come after you.
What about that!
That's it, and well,
That's fine but what do I know?
Don't you agree?
Many times, you feel discriminated.
How?
Lots of times they don't discriminate. Or, what do I know? It's like they discriminate themselves, they make mistakes, at all.
But there's a social reason.
Obviously. Sure.
There's a social issue, the boy takes a look in the mirror and he sees that he's black, right? and then he turns on the television and all he sees is white people!
Do they feel bad?
But.
Blonds, no, how are they all not white?
It's all funny
No. Come on.
It's
And the publicity is calm, the publicity in all the, milk, the mineral water, whatever it is.
It always has blond people, white people, a model, I mean, a guy from the earth.
The
No, sure, it's not a, it's not an average Argentinian, that's what I'm saying. It's an Argentinian that is part of
That's fine.
Of a superior class, about ten percent o the, if not more, in terms of
Good afternoon, John, from New York.
Miriam, from Florida
Hey Miriam, how are you?
Fine, and you?
How's everything down there?
Hot
That's great because I'm going there in less than two weeks.
Yea
Yea
What do you think of social security in the United States?
It hasn't been bad and has helped a lot because my grandparents came from Cuba.
They were able to use it. My mom's now retired
None
She's used it. And no, she hasn't been bad, but it needs a few changes. They need some fixes for the medicines
Medicare
Yea yea, me- medicare the, medicines are really expensive, and, and so there are times when your insurance doesn't cover your medicine. And so- or they don't cover it all, and they're really expensive.
But I only have
Yea but they say they say that this, that for example, in a few more years that money won't even be there, and all the money they've taken from us
Yea
This, it's not going to be there anymore.
No, i don't think so, i don't think that, i honestly don't think that's
We're not having it anymore
Even though they've said it, and they've... but i think that, they're gonna do things, uh, with the, the new people that are going into the
In the system, the work system, to support the system, right?, and i think that, god permit
Yes
We should be more responsible for our destiny, right?
None
Partially, we should defend ourselves, right?, although there is a lot of people that, unfortunately, for lack of education or whatever
None
They can't, and we have to look out for them
None
Right?
Yes
When my grandparents came from Cuba they didn't know english so they couldn't work
They worked a little, but they can't do...so these people can't defend themselves, the system has to capture them and help them
The system has many
But
Problems, I have a friend
None
She's a single mom with two kids
Right.
Underage and the government doesn't help because supposedly she makes so much money.
None
She makes about five hundred dollars a week,
None
But you have to take into account the car insurance, she is paying her car.
Right
She is paying a mortgage of a house, herself
Right
Without government aid,
Right
The father of the children when he wants, he, he, he gives her money, and when he canÂ´t doesnÂ´t give money to her, because he is like that, he is not very responsible
Well, right
I have a friend too who is in, in disability
None
He is thirty three years old, and they give him food stamps So, he has more than enough money, and the government gives to him, gives him, give him aid
Right
How could the government give help to a person who does not have dependents and does not have so many responsibilities like this person. This person.
None
A hundred, two hundred dollars that the government gives to her would be of great help.
Yes
The government thinks she is basing it on her income.
None
No, they don't take her expenses into consideration or the doctors, or daycare and all of that.
Right
The government should have to, I mean, it's unfair that they can help an individual that doesn't really needs the help
Well, talking about your friend
None
I'm telling you that it's different in every state because here in New York the law says that
None
It's pretty aggressive with the fathers that refuse to make payments, they get them and they suspend their licenses immediately
And the funny thing is that she's from New York.
None
She just moved to Florida
None
And she has, she has child, what's the name
Child support
Child support, yes, child support through New York because he's still in New York.
Oh, well.
And every time that he gets a job
None
Child support gets him. When the unemployment runs out,
Right
He starts working out of the books, in other words, under the table.
Right. Well those things she obviously has to prove them, number one,
None
Number two, I agree with you that the system is not perfect and has a lot of problems and is hard
Certify because I consider that
None
The person whom she was married to is a swine Right, and there are like that, but there aren't many,
Yes, that's what it sounds like
No, because for more example look, I've been divorced four years, and I got married again, I have a daughter with my wife, and I've never missed a payment, to my son
I've always fought a lot to be with him, because this is not the problem. On the contrary, that my ex-wife would like for me to never see him
I had to play very hard in court
None
And to have him. And all the money I give her, she uses it to pay the house, to screw
To pay other things, instead of paying, use it for him, that's what it has to be for right.
The reason that you give it.
And she has lived comfortably while working a part time job
None
So far, and now he realizes she has the rope up to his neck
None
And she also lives in a house, you know, houses here in New York are so expensive
Yes
And she has used the money that I give her for the boy, she used it to pay the house, to pay for a car, a car
What can I do? I can't do anything about that, but I've done my part, I know I have.
I'm very responsible and I'm going to continue being responsible because he is my son, what can I do? But some people just don't care and they have no shame
None
And they spend their lives fighting instead of being responsible and look for a job to get rid of that and pay what they have to pay, but no, they have no shame.
None
Yes the law is tough for only her, and she can spend her time in court, but who has the energy to do that.
It seems to me that the more help she gets
That
From the system, I mean, the more they try to help those people, the more damage they causes
Sometimes it is, I agree.
Some win, they try to a certain point and they loose
Yes, I've seen that, yes, I agree with you about that. I think that there have been lots of good things done and lots of improvements
In the system because I've seen the changes and I know that they are now really hard with fathers that don't want to pay
They have to provide medical insurance for the children but like I said some have no shame and they escape the system.
None
The ply the system game, so, what can you do? you can do what you can do, and the rest is left is left to God
To take care of someone like this, because if he is not responsible for his sons, then he escapes with the law little game
Well, then he'll have to pay on the other side
None
Considering the system here compared to other countries I would like the system here to specialize more in health
To be better. That people can go to the hospital without having to worry how much they will have to pay
He goes there and they heal him, that's all. And that
No, and, I've had for instance my boyfriend, he got seriously ill once
None
And he had to be operated in emergency
Right
Finally, I got informed and told them that we didn't have the money, because the operation would cost about thirty thousand dollars
Right
I told them, I explained to them my economical situation, and they very nicely made me fill out a form
None
I waited two months
None
I was told that they would pay the whole cost
Right
That was, like a grant of, of, that the country had some money saved for people like us
Right right
I never thought they would pay the whole. Look, if only they payed fifty percent,
None
I see, you can manage paying in stallments
Right
In that, in medical things, I don't spend, I have no problems right now, I can't complain
Yes
Yes, I
And there is also, like you mentioned in the case of your friend, many case of people who fall between the cracks
Yes
Who have too much, who earn a little more than the limits they request and and if you earn less
It's a mess, so those are adjustments they have to do
How do they make the, how do they calculate the amounts, what calculations they do
They use studies of how much an apartment costs, the average cost of electricity, gas
And they will give you, more or less, what they think you need, obviously you won't live like a rich man
No
For instance, my grandparents lived out of section eight
None
Had an apartment until they died. they were given enough money to pay the apartment, electricity, gas
They still had some pesos left, right?
None
They had like one or two hundred dollars left per month with which they could buy things, or buy, or give themselves a little treat or
Yes
They had enough, in my opinion, I thought that the system had coordinated it in a way in which, they didn't live with luxury but they didn't live
They had enough to eat. If they wanted to eat seafood, one month, which is more expensive, they were able to do it
Because. No.
None
Those things that they need, they need with
Igor
Maria, how are you?
How are you?
The welfare system of the States, the social system of the United States
None
How much do you know about the social system of the United States?
What I know is that through the social assistance system with the programs that they have they help all the people
Basically with the differences that they can't cover the social insurance . Helps with the part of the medicine, it also helps with the part of for example.
The part of the taxes that it's contributed, that's what I understand right
Yes, I don't know, I don't deal with that topic too much, I have heard many controversies.
None
As far as to when the state has to be responsible for certain situations and up to when it doesn't
None
What calls my attention is the wealth this country has
In how, the assistance doesn't reach all the people that need it in the way that, that I think they should receive it
Exactly yes, well I think that one of the problems is that it hasn't been given.  I think that on the Government's part
United States is a country with a lot of land and all types of things is true.
That there are many families with many needs because there a global economic crisis and here there's an economic crisis also, there are several states where there's a lack of jobs, right
None
Lower income families that haven't been able to acquire their house among other things, much less even pay their medicines, need these assistance programs
They even have kids and these programs cannot cover the great demand that we have
Far, I don't understand this social security system I'm sure it will go broke in some years, in a few years, they can't
States have more problems every time they lower the budget
Sure, it's a dilemma for me, how to generate a social assistance system that is not just, that doesn't just put out the fire but, I mean, that it puts out the medicine or
This food, but that it does generate a series of resources so that people can become self-sufficient. I think that's a bit idealistic to think
That needs are going to end one day but I believe it would be better to have a social system that has a series of strategic teachings, no
Yes, it's important to me for example, about the food, I had the chance to know more about the coupon delivery or bonuses there
The food stamps for the school children that I don't think they will generate a conscience on them
What type of foods are healthy and how to have a healthy lifestyle, do you understand?
Yes, of course, I agree. The solution must be a global one because we really don't need to always have this, as you say
Not just exist, they are going to grow and then what's going to happen? If there's no, if there's no education included
If there is not a complete integration of all the elements nothing will happen and, as you said, it will be only a temporal remedy.
They gave them food, and that's it. There are other things that are part of it, and that's the problem. I think they should handle this in a global way.
Not as they're doing it now give them a palliative.
None
Putting out the fire instead of planning and preventing, working with the community and doing more to solve a problem because the country has so much money.
That's what I'm worried about. I see that it has a high tax rate
Exactly
And they collect
Exactly
Lots of taxes. I don't understand. In Germany they have a social system in which no one  gets discriminated against because of their status and everybody has access to it, to
Germany, France and Europe, they all have access to medicine and certain basic things that are harder to get here.
I believe that to me, one of the biggest lies in this social system is that, no, I understand the society, in, in every, all the members that are part of it
And I think that they put aside the people that don't have a legal status in the country.
And they are part of society, they consume
None
They help society.
That's right
But they are not part of this system and that creates several parallel problems, no
That's right
Aid and solidarity through religious groups or non governmental organizations but not from the State, the State doesn't, it doesn't take them into account to provide a service to them when they
Yes I pay taxes, lots of them!
That's right
They pay taxes, but they don't get the benefits so it seems like the system is fooling them
That's right
I can't see how, yes, lets say the game, there's lots of money at stake, in a way, is a mask through which we are protecting ourselves
The reality is that in the long run, if this goes on, if I give the kids money to eat hamburgers, don't tell me
With this they are getting the meat proteins that they need because that's not real meat
That's right
It's a double moral
That's an structural problem I believe, of the system. It's a balance. As we were talking, we've included, in the case of a worker, no
None
The system has a problem in its structure because instead of working to get a balance in which both sides can work and contribute together
Sometimes it doesn't achieve that no, and they don't contribute a hundred percent or they do but only a fifty percent of what they should
We are talking about a big number of people contributing to this country's economy because
Have you seen the group of people that want to contribute to the country, but bureaucracy won't let them?
None
The same amount of information it sees that its everywhere but it's not accessible, do you understand, or it is accessible but not understandable.
For them for example, I'm talking about the ones that don't have a status. They want to contribute because they are part of the economy
Since they don't they don't get loans and they don't get help and this is what you can do to achieve that
None
We are going to work so that we contribute and don't hurt the system
None
But I think that as long as there's no control,  there are many of them that are making the system break
It's terrible because even if they want to contribute they can't. They are part of the economy so we should solve that but they don't.
That's the problem of social services so, the other part of the people that are in the system, they do pay and I mean, they do contribute
As a whole, I see that I see it as a big cake in which most of the system is broke because they can't finish fixing the problem so that the people
Everybody starts contributing notwithstanding the status that they have as they are part of the economy system and that's the problem.
In the long run, I've always wondered if the social system or the social services system is compatible with a liberal or capitalist economy as this one.
None
Because I think it is all related to productivity.
That's it
No, I have heard a lot of complaints, or claims of people who lives, who prefers. let's say since this stereotype is often generated, they prefer not to work because they prefer to live on the social system
Rather than seeing it as a problem of the person, I think it is rather a thermometer of a serious social problem here. W are talking about
Serious
People, often from the afro American community, who were for a long time, whose right equity was not granted until quite recently in this country
None
It's too easy to find an answer of this kind and attribute it to a particular individual or a race
Exactly
What strategies or mechanisms were stated for this not to happen? I can't see it. I am living in the Washington DC area.
I don't see that any change is generated from the school, no
Exactly, the same case you mentioned about the hamburger. I think it is a problem of the structure existing. It's like if the necessary controls were missing, because there are the campaigns
There is the campaign. There is the planning. There is something in the machinery. There must be a nutritional system.
If we don't have the budget, we only have budget to give them a meat hamburger or give them whatever, but we can't give them a really good nutritional program, for instance
Let's study or let's see how to ask for something from the school district.
To solve this problem, then we go back to the assistance problem you mentioned, those who always want to live on the government, the government is my dad, I would agree with you
The think that the government should be daddy government, and they don't want to work, but let's go back to the case of the control, whether a person should be given the aids,
And be checked, controlled, how? Well, how for instance the gas companies do, they have programs of help for people who can't pay gas, you know?
None
They accept a flexible payment, etcetera, what do they do? they give this support for a limited time peirod
How do they control it? They make you sign the papers again.
Honey
Hi, I'm Manuel
Nice to meet you, Honey
What's up?
The healthcare system in the United States should mimic who?
Yes, that's the subject, the thing about whether it should resemble the European one or help should be restricted?
Help should be restricted.
Restricted, suppressed or controlled
Restricted, I'm sorry, but if they restrict it ore, no one will be able to qualify
What did you say?
Speed restrictions are going.
None
It was known the system was there to help the people that
None
The way it is in the United States right now, people that really need it don't qualify
Surely, the truth is that i don't know much about the subject
Unfortunately for me, I do
None
Because
Because I'm not american, so
In the United States, benefits were much easier to qualify for.
None
Not they need a number of things, for example you can't go and say that you live in a place, your neighbor has to write letters saying that yes, that you live there
That yes, that you don't have a job, that you have to go where a neighbor.
None
To tell your private life, to humiliate yourself
Yeah
After you get a little bit of help and I'm a single mother
None
I was pregnant and already had two sons. I received a thirty-five dollar coupon for my son who was not yet born and a forty dollar coupon for the one who came with me.
Some additional twenty dollars for me so for three people, like one hundred and fifty food dollars in the United States
Of Foodstamps
Yes
They didn't give for each one.
No, for each one they gave, but a portion
None
For the one who wasn't born they say thirty dollars a month
None
This was the food that they supposed that I as pregnant spent thirty five dollars a month for the one who wasn't both, and the one who was here, forty five dollars
Good !
Do you expect me to survive on fifty dollars?
None
How can that be, if I spend one hundred and fifty dollars per week?
It is possible that they spend it so fast because it's not a lot of money.
Food here is expensive.
None
Food here is not cheap.  You ahve to pay taxes over what you are already paying
Yes
Do you understand? If the price is seven dollars,  it's seven dollars plus tax
Plus the seven, not sure, it is that way
I don't know how it is in Europe but here it's ridiculous, it's the same thing with the health insurance.
It has nothing to do with how it is here in the United States.
I don't know which are the things that they use for, you know.
The medical attention is better, no
It's ridiculous.
Sure, medical attention you can go to any place
You go to a doctor
You don't have to pay for it
Not here
And they accept the health insurance provided by the State
No here the state's insurance basically nobody wants to accept it because it takes years
None
For the state you know, to pay the doctors, so the doctors don't want to take the state's insurance.
Here the doctors are also very bad, very unnatural
Yes, well what happens is that the government
But they never see anyone
Exactly. They prefer to stop earning rather than take care of you
Because here every time that I've gone to a medical center, the nurse wants to take care of me.  The technician wants to take care of me.  I tell them I'm paying with my insurance so that a doctor takes care of me.
No
I don't want a technician to take care of me
Here they want to send you a nurse
Not a technician
Exactly, here is the same. Here they send you, and you know already the doctors don't take care of you. Who ends up taking care of you is the nurse
Sure that's bad, not sure because a medical consultation
Who took a course a little more advanced
Medical, right of medical of doctor that has to see, not a consultation of
No, here you have to specify that you want
None
To see a doctor, not to put you to see a nurse and you stay with whatever comes here. I didn't come to see a nurse, I came to see the doctor.
Sure
Everything is a specialty your general doctor or the head to foot one can't do anything
Yes
That one is just there in case you get a cold
None
If you have anything else, you have to go to the specialist then the specialist doesn't want to get the state insurance
Yes
To see the specialist is so much then you submit it so they reimburse you, if I had if I had money to pay the doctor
I wouldn't have to request the state's insurance
Sure
That then for them to reimburse me is a mess and each year they cut more funds
Yes, probably.
I feel sad about the old people
None
Majority of the people they take out of your check. I'm working and they take from me for the medicare.
For the income tax
None
That supposedly when you get to be old you have already prepaid all that
Sure and they don't give you,  no
No and when you get to be old they want and they cut half of the funds.
No
You know that it doesn't make sense because is something that is free
None
That's something that you have already prepaid
No they dont pay it
But they are not there when you go
None
When you go and are going to use it, either you don't qualify or require so much to qualify that you know one gives up at the end and better
Unless I'm dying, I don't go
None
You know that
Yes well the, the attention is not good at all, there's not much help, no
No, ithey have made it so hard because many people have abused the system, I also understand that
They want to discourage you, one has to demand so they can give you
Many people have abused the system, but they can't pay the innocent for the sins of the guilty.  They don't see it like that.  Here the eldery, the medicine are prohibitive.
None
A pill comes out to one hundred eighty dollars
Yes, they are expensive.
That a person that, you know needs these medicines to live, like a poor man who's retired, that has no income, that the income is six hundred dollars a month
None
Say that a pill will cost him one hundred thirty dollars
It doesn't die no
For that it will die
Sure
That is where they've taken all the money from the check
None
It's covering it
There aren't many generic medicines here
It doesn't even matter if they are generic, I'm telling you that it's a ridiculous thing.
None
For the old people who are the ones that really need this plan it covers the medical insurance but not the medicine
Look then the same as nothing
Then what are they in, because if you go to the doctor you come out with a prescription
Sure if you don't have health insurance, if you don't have the medicine you don't get cured
It doesn't do this man any good to go exactly you went so they would tell you what's wrong with you, what it is you need to get cured but you don't have the money to do it
What good is it for, not for.
You know that I don't understand the logic of the people that are in charge of the funds but they have funds for all the other things
Yes, I think it has to do with the business of the laboratories, they don't want to make cheap medicine.
That's one, my problem is that the United States has funds for what they want
None
One has funds to go to a war but doesn't have funds to cover the medicines of the elderly
Yes, how much money have they spent and will continue to spend?
What are the priorities?
None
In reality I don't care what they are doing in the country over there
Sure, it's not this country's problem. No, unfortunately they have a politic of harming its own people or don't care about the poor.
Unless they are in mine you know but they don't take care of the ones they have to take care in the land here
Sure
You know is something that one stays with the mouth on the floor. You are going to tell me that there's ninety billion to send to rebuild Iraq that we went and bombed them to start.
None
You are going to tell me that there are no funds in the state to cover the medicine of so many people that need it.
None
It doesn't have logical sense.
You are right
That the priority is obviously what the government wants
Sure that if
They can't argue that there are no funds when they have a war
None
Stop the war and put the funds where you have to put them
Yes, because they say it's done harm to this country to go there, that it has spent a lot.
No this war has finished with a
Yes, it has gone up a lot.
The gas is prohibitive, the fuel and energy went up
I've seen that since I have been here, it has decreased to two twenty or two thirty
We are now paying about the same, two eighty-nine per gallon
Two years ago the price was one dollar
A dollar and fifteen cents
It doesn't make any sense.
And there haven't been hurricanes and it's still up again, no hurricanes so, why is the price increasing again
They've increased the prices and are going to war to get cheap gas
Three times more expensive of what I've seen it in my life
To profit
The only ones that are making money are the oil companies.
None
They are going to say that I used to know that when there were hurricanes, they struck some towers but there are no hurricanes in January
No, that's so true
And the gas prices are increasing, so, I don't understand. We have good things but
There's so much injustice
There are some things that you just look at them and they make no sense, for example the medical plans that are so prohibitive.
Sure, considering the fact that
A family insurance
Yeah, you think that the country is so rich, because they really have resources, there shouldn't be so many needs
One
Because they have a way to cover them and take care of them but
The one who's living outside sees it that way, the one who's here
None
To cover me and my family
None
The insurance is almost 500 dollars a month
Sure
From where? If my salary
None
I don't earn that in a week
You see
How am i supposed to pay for a monthly payment in a medical insurance that's more than what i earn in a week?
With all the exorbitant expenses that you have here
None
The rent is prohibitive, the gas is prohibitive, forget about a car
Yes, sure, everybody
I take care of them so that you can go to work
Yes, that's true
I know I said it once, for what I spend, I should stay at home, it's cheaper because my income is not equal, what I have to pay as alimony, thank God that I have one in college
Yes, yes.
When there were two to care for, the girl was charging me one hundred seventy five a week
Yeah sure
In a month that's almost seven hundred dollars
Yes and it's that to pick them up it'll cost you like eight, eight hundred
Half of what I earn in a week goes towards caring for the girl.
That's true
I have to spend on gas so I can get to work and then health insurance. The majority of companies do offer health insurance
You see
It's awful what mine is offering but they take eight hundred out of my check. What is the part they covering, one hundred dollars?
You know what I don't understand? I would want to give to the hospitals here, but they are prohibitively expensive.
Yes it's very expensive here, health insurance, and they don't cover hardly anything
And the emergency room
I also have insurance that costs me about every five, six months it costs like one thousand two hundred but it hardly covers anything
Here
For just one person
Emergency room; it's if you even step foot in the emergency room
None
I went because I had gastritis
None
Emergency room
Luca
Hello
Yes
Hello, how are you?  My name is Mauricio.
How is it going? My name is Luca, how are you?
How are you?
Where are you calling from?
I'm in Charlotte
Where is it?
North Carolina United States
How's the climate?
Awesome
Yes
Tropical.
Really good, what is not cold?
No, it's not cold
None
Yes. It's cold. We're supposed to be in winter
Yes
Today is good but hot.
I'm in Boston
Boston, that's sweet.  Cool.
Yes, it's a little bit colder here
I can imagine that it is good.
Yes, and how
The subject, the subject's good, right?
Yes, how long have you been living in the United States?
I've been here for a year
Oh, and, where are you from?
I'm Columbian
Right, and did you live in Colombia earlier or were you in another country?
I was in Colombia
Right, and, are you clear on the matter of social services and all that?
Exactly, i have experience because I'm in a process with immigration here
Yes that's correct.
It turns out I'm legally here, i have a work permit and all but, i got it, and my wife hasn't gotten it, you know how it is here, we both have to work
Yes, but, the, what, do you have the green card?
No, I'm in the process of seeking political asylum. I
Wow
So, it turns out i have my wife and three children
And, are you legal?
And, yes, all of us are under,  the petition that we have, we are in a process
Yes
And I already have a work permit, my wife is waiting for it to arrive, it should've arrived with mine
Yes
But, it hasn't arrived. I think it's an excellent country, but I think they should get better organized, as far as the service.
Yes
I've had the need to take my kids to the doctor
Yes
The only way to take them to the doctor is paying and I don't have the money
None
Or that it's something urgent, for example
Yes
That he's seven years old and the teeth are coming out but the milk teeth, the first ones, are not falling, so they are coming out in back of the others
None
And, is
Sure
To me I find it worrisome because, in the future we are going to have to go to a very costly treatment here
Sure, because the dentists are equally expensive, orthodo
Yes, sure
Orthodontics, Imagine, it must be more expensive
Yes, exactly, and the girl is worried about her little teeth.
Poor baby
It hurts, but it is not an emergency
Yes
I haven't been able to take her because, we don't have, we don't have a doctor.
Don't you have insurance?
No, I don't have healthcare insurance
She does have a social security number right?
Only myself
That
I'm the one that has the job permit so I'm the only one that has.
Can't they give your daughters a social security number?
No, not until we get the authorization that we have requested
None
It has delayed everything, we are within the legal immigration parameters, we haven't done anything but way for the law, but they should have in this case
Sure
Take that into consideration because I have three daughters and my case is
Yes, can't you contact a human rights organization? for example,
We've done, which one
None
We've done anything
And it's international
The only thing Social Services told us was
You have to wait
They don't have the social urgency
Yes
Not even social, they told me a, while there's no urgency, we can't apply
None
And we can't apply for help because
Because you don't cover you the needs.
We're not within the status
Sure
Do you know what i mean?, but, but I'm not illegal
Yes
It's absurd to me, right?, i mean, I'm in a situation i find absurd
Are you working?
I'm working but not my wife because she doesn't have a permit
Yes
We have three children
None
If she would work, getting something part time or something like that
The oldest is five or do you have others older?
No, they are eight.  No, how's that?  Ten, eight and six
And the other girls, the, do the older ones go to school?
So we all go, they all go to school
Is the school private or free?
No, that's free and
None
And no, they give them breakfast and lunch thank God
None
Because what I earn is barely enough to feed us
Sure, yes
I know there's people that get a lot of benefits, for example, Cubans
Yes
That's something special for them.
Can't you apply for a special scholarship?, because they also have political asylum
Yes
None.
I don't have political asylum yet.
I understand
They haven't said no
Right
They haven't said yes, but I'm in the process
None
So it's just that while I wait to see what's happening
Sure, right?
My girl has
Yes, yes, yes, I understand.
Teeth on the back and on the front
None
And I don't know what'll happen while I wait
Yes, and how long ago did your wife apply to get her permit?
In, no, the thing is that, the permit, she we applyed for the same documents, all of them
Yes
She had to, the, what we expected was to get them all at the same time, because we have done all our paperwork at the same time
Sure
Let's just call it a package
Yes
All my stuff came, and i said, thank god it was mine
None
Cause I needed to work
Sure
We have been waiting for the asylum resolution for a year and we need other things as well.
Yes
We have, immigration documents, we have authorization to be here, I have a work permit
Yes. Sure.
We are doing the legal way through a legal process.
Sure, but it's so slow, this subject
And I say, well, they should think about, our, situation, while we wait
None
Above all, the medical stuff, the children
Is it expensive? yes
Thank God we haven't had an emergency because I know that in an emergency we would still get help, right?
Sure
This non-urgent, but delicate issue is about the girl.
Yes, sure
When she, it hurts
Poor baby
When she drinks something it hurts her
And are you giving it some sort of analgesic?
Yeah, when it hurts a lot we give it, we give it Tylenol or something
Yes
So, I think that, regarding the service, they should look after the people that's also in a process
Right
I say that because of me
This is right
Not because I'm making it up, i have lived it, i'm living it
Yes
About the rest, i think that, when they give this help, i think it's an excellent help
None
Give medical services to the people, it's really good
Yes
I don't have any complaints except for my
The health
My experience, i understand I'm also on hold
Yes
I'm here now and i haven't done anything against the, against the law
Yes, and, is North Carolina, is the state expensive?, i mean the rent
No, it's good, it's good
None
It's not so expensive
None
It's not so expensive
And are the clothes for the boys expensive?
More or less, i get it second hand
Yes
On these army warehouses or so i get
Yes
It's cheap
None
So, as far as my experience, well, that's been it
Sure
But I know people that get very good help
None
Excellent help
Yeah, i really don't, i have no experience with social security because i never needed it, i mean, we came here in March
Yes
We're
Yes
Temporarily here, not the way we were.
Yeah, and, where are you from?
We are from Argentina
That's good, and, how long?
And,
Are you going to be here?
We're going to be here for three years more or less
Oh yea
We have to, my husband is, he's doing a, like a research
Yes
I'm trying to re-validate my title
Yeah, that's good
Yeah, so i can work a little as, as, I'm a veterinarian
Yea. That's good.
Yeah, it's hard, re-validatrion is very expensive and I don't think there are any kind of social services there to help
Yeah,  sure.
It's very expensive
We have applied, but they have always told us the same, right?, we're not under the status
Yes
We have this situation and now I have to look somewhere else to do something, and I have to look for a plan, even if it's fragmented, that
None
Whether it's by quotas, because the girl doesn't, she's got some problem with her little teeth
Sure, no, sure
Now, it's also nothing worth lying for to say she's delicate.
That it's urgent
Not even on urgency, because they won't see her and i won't tell my
Sure, no
No
No, if he/she wants to stay here for long
We haven't had any bitter moments.
Yes
Regarding social services
None
I think it's good
None
I think everything this country has is really good
Do your kids speak English well?
And well organized, but, me?
Your children
My children do, yeah, they're speaking, yes
Yes, they speak English to you?
Not me. They do, sometimes
Yes
Sometimes to trick their dad, to show off, they are happy here
Your wife how is she?
They are happy.  My wife is also happy because we are alive from Colombia
None
We left because of threats.
Wow
Any hard situation that we go through we always thank god we are alive and together
Yes
We haven't stopped eating, we haven't stopped having a roof
Yes
Sure, it's not easy for one to let go of what you had and used to do in Columbia. But, a life is worth more.
Sure,no of course
And the family is together
Sure
I think that soon everything will be resolved.
And where are you from, from Medellin?
No, I was in a city south of Colombia called Neibas
None
To the south of Bogota
Things are very bad with all of that guerrilla?
With the guerrilla it is a quite guerrilla area, red zone
None
Hello, how are you. I am Elena. Where are you calling from?
Hello yes I am Eliana Whom am I talking with? from Boston
From Boston look how nice, I have never been I am calling, I am talking from Vancouver
Good lets say with cold too
More than cold it rains it is near the west coast and what we have is rain

What?
Where do you think I am with this accent
Keep talking
Say ashtray
Spain
Sure
It's the first time I've spoke with a European, always with Latinos
It shouldn't have taken too much, ideally they shouldn't be aware of this program
Sure I came speaking with all Latinos and I say that how many where it will sure I didn't see anyone from Guatemala, not even from Puerto Rico, nothing of anybody like we say
You've been living for many years now in the United States?
No, just a year
Only a year, that's very short and how's it going, how do you like it?
Right now this moment in my life I enjoy
Yes
But to live here for the rest of my life, no
Sure yeah look today theme is is is, the positives of social welfare, I don't know how you you, I've lived in the United States and I have seen a little bit bit you how how do you think that
How long have you been living here
I've lived here now I've been living in Canada almost like for three years I lived in the United States for four years on the West coast in California
None
But we go a lot. I go almost every time that I can, right? to San Francisco because I like it a lot
Sure that's good but I see it like this
None
Look it's only been a little bit that I've been
None
And my country is terrible but on one hand I see it better
Sure
I feel that a lot of money is being spent in things that shouldn't be, and they are leaving all the other things behind.
None
Education, health and the whole social system in here
None
Right? Why spend so much money in wars and there are a lot of illiterate persons and more poverty here
Yes , I remember that when I used to live there. I've seen that they don't have a system, I mean, I don't know, I've never lived anywhere else.
In the United States, but in California, San Francisco is a city that has a help system
If you don't have the resources they help you, it's something that I really don't like a lot coming from Argentina
You have doctors for example, isn't it, the doctor
Oh well the health system is pretty bad in here
Sure, oh.
No? hello
Yes, I'm sorry you were speaking and I didn't want to interrupt you
No, the health system here is not that much better as the one in Argentina or in Buenos Aires, the city where I live
Yes, I'm
It's so expensive, they charge huge amounts. No, I feel better cared for in Argentina
Yes, I have, one of my friends, I mean, I've lived here in Vancouver, right? I've been here for three years
They said that in Canada it is different than in the United States but, you still have to pay for the doctor, they don't just give it to you, if you are not working
You don't have access to it.
None
I don't know, I thought that it was so different in that sense and is not at all, I mean here you have to pay it, what happens is that instead of costing you
None
Two hundred or three hundred dollars well here.  Perhaps it cost you one hundred dollars, right?
Sure.
Is not so different is very similar to the United States and of course is not similar is not similar at all to Europe that you
Their work pays for your unemployment and also for your doctor, right?
Yes, I was teaching
None
In Buenos Aires and had a social work for teaching let's say super.
None
Very state, when I was little through my parents I went to a private one but later when I started with my job what they gave me was the state one
Sure, yes
At the end of the day it was really good because I could go to the school hospital that are the teachers of the kids that study medicine
None
They would take care of me who was that was getting paid a low salary
Yes
And then anyone can go the public hospital because it's for the people
Yes
One sometimes chooses if you have a little bit of money and a private one in Argentina, because everything is faster.
None
But if you don't have money, you wait
None
A month or two months and you get turns
Sure, you are placed in a waiting list
It's like that even with the best neurologist, in the end
Yes, and so you work in the United States? Are you a teacher
I'd love to but my English is not that good yet.
None
Right now I'm doing a post doctorate.
A doctorate in what?
In genetics
What did you study then?
How?
What did you study in Argentina?
I'm a biochemist and then
None
I'm a researcher, I started to do some research and my thesis is in genetics and I came here to study a post doctorate.
That's great, I mean, that's good but sure, how long are you staying here?
I think that I'll stay here for three years. I've been here for one.
Well
What happens is that I would like to return to my country, but I'm specializing here more and that specialty hardly exists there.
Sure and you know I mean do you have you know people, you have friends in?
But
In Boston I mean it has been easy, since is the city
And the truth that well the climate is horrible
Yes
At four in the afternoon it gets dark, is very cold, and that I wait.  One can manage with subways everywhere.  You don't need to have a car.
Yes
Here at one or two in the morning is not like Spain, Argentina that one can go out at night until six in the morning
None
But one can manage alone without the need of a car because it's like a city of schools here, there's like  seventy universities, there's Harvard
None
None
Is a city of like young students
They have told me that is very beautiful right?
Yes is very beautiful, they say it looks like Europe.
Yes, it looks like Europe
When they say that, it looks like Europe.
You know have American friends or
Americans
So you can't hear the voice, are you on the phone, the voice is muted.
Yes I don't have a good signal in this house
Yes now I hear you
The truth is that I do not have many American friends but foreign people who need a family make their own family.
Of course
And what do you do?
I came here because my husband is from here and we got married.
Particularly is not that I do not like it, I do not like Vancouver for the same so I donÂ´t like it because it is very sad, it rains a lot
Here what you say, at four, half past four it gets dark and rains, we have had twenty one so twenty one days raining steadly
Is not that terrible
Yes and very boring so it is a beautiful place for people who like open spaces, the mountains, blah, blah, blah, blah.
I like it, but I do not like the culture.  I like to have access to a series of
Cultural facilities that there are not here right?
Here it is, full in that sense, seminars and lectures everywhere, in each neighborhood and
Yes, they don't like it there. They like nature, bicyles but there's very little culture, so there are some places where you can
It is in Montreal but there is also cold then not particularly it is not a place I like and besides that the level of work is
Here in the United States that is different, right? You can find a job here. You are asked for a group of requirements that you must have what they call Canadian experience
If you do not have experience you cannot find a job and there are many people here with careers engineers, doctors and they cannot exercise and are people
That come from their countries and I have friends from Argentina and  one, I think he studied Biology
Yes
He has been here for fourteen years and all he achieved was working as a, computer re-placer, moving boxes
I can't believe it, I didn't know
Yes, it's just that he was quite old when he came, he was almost forty-nine or fifty, right? I think
Sure
But no, I may be wrong, he might have come with forty-some
Yes
He couldn't speak in English, but in fourteen years all he had been able to achieve was that you have some bad times here
In the first years, it's not like in the United States where if you are good enough. Here
Sure
There is a big protection, specially from the professional associations, engineers association, lawyers association, medical association
None
Who don't let people, they just tell them your title is not good so you have to study your career again
Who would study back his medical career in a country you don't know
No
You say a lot of people are living here but they work in pizzerias and they may be computer programmers, so it's hard
It's not like in the United States bu speaking Spanish is worthless
None
Thew, ehh, the Hispanic population is very small, there are much more asians, specially in the eats coast
None
Yeah, there are just too much.
Hello?
Hello, what's up?  My name is Karina.
Hello, what's up? My name is Leticia.
How are you?
Where are you calling from?
I'm calling from Washington, D.C.
None
Are
I'm from Philadelphia.
Where
We are close.
Well, not so far away, sure. About two hours away, isn't it? No, oh
Yes, two and a half hours, pretty close.
Oh, really well.
Where are you from?
I think you have an accent similar to Argentina's, I mean, that's why I feel like when I call home.
Me too. No, it sounded similar to me too that's why
Look, are you
I wonder
Well, I'm glad that I got to talk to a fellow countrywoman. we have to speak about the social security system, right? But, here in the United States the truth is that I don't really know.
How it works, neither the European one.
Sure.
None
How long have you been here?
Yes, for a long time, I mean, this is my fifth year
That's a lot.
The only relationship that I have with the social security system is related with social work.
Sure.
I have one play that is cheap, I believe that all my complains have to do with that.
What do you have?
I don't know, it's something called permanent Kaiser
None
Have you been here a long time?
No, just eight months.
Oh no. You have just,
Yes, I mean, what do I know, I don't even know how to use the social services yet
I'm still in a cultural shock because it takes some time to get used to this, right?
Social work, it is expensive
You don't have a social work, I mean, I don't know.
Yes, I have, I do but no.
Don't you use it?
I haven't yet.
I haven't used it a lot, I'm a student at the University, no?
Yes.
We don't have the much money, but it is mandatory to have social security
Sure
We took the cheapest one, almost everyone does and the problem that I see with that is that's a different system than the one that we have in Argentina, they have a general doctor.
Sure
And you can go with him and you have a medical card
No.
For example, if you need an ophthalmologist or a gynecologist.
No, as is.
It's centralized so, you first have to go to this doctor, this person that in general, it takes a lot of time for you to be referred to a specialist.
Sure.
I don't know why, I mean, so, it's more bureaucratic. And, the truth is that it's pretty expensive.
Of course, yes if you want to.
None
You can pick your doctor, you have to pay more, There are social services that are like that
Yes that's why I'm telling you, I mean, it depends on how much are you willing to pay each month, but most of them are centralized.
Sure.
None
Yes. Yes.
Like for little things, any rubbish, you want to go, I don't know a dermatologist.
Yes
For those things that are not emergencies, they put up more barriers. But when there's something like a surgery, it sure saves you. Because,
And, yes
If you would have to pay, would be very expensive.
No, yes. How things are, it is already itself, the social security is very expensive
None
If one is not covered someone like an employer, we will pay everything. It's more expensive that we
Sure, here at the university. Are you a student?
No, I work at the university, but I'm not a student.
They don't pay part of your social security, why?
Yes
In my case it's like that.  They pay a part and we have to put the
Yes
The rest, and it depends which one you want, it is more expensive or cheaper. Right?
Of course, but the I mean, I also I have to pay am amount, bu the amount I have to pay, is minimum compared to the cost of the social security
Sure, me too. I don't even want to think about
It's very expensive. So, it can be more than three hundred dollars per month, a cheap one.
Wow. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Honestly, I didn't find out too much. But, yes, is an issue. Right? I don't know how other people do it. Because since I move in the students' circuit
But I think there's a bunch of people that don't have social work.
Yes.
Near where I live, for example, there's a Latin American youth center, or something like that,
Yes.
That, they have a place called the town's clinic, that functions kind of like a hospital.
Sure.
That help especially the Latin immigrants that they know don't have
Yes, there's no social work, truthfully, is, is all an issue in this country. For me, is a system that I don't like at all.
I don't know if there are public hospitals. I don't think so
I think there are. Here, at least in Philadelphia, they told me that there is an area where there's a public hospital. But,
Ah, good?
Also, the appointments are for any year
Sure, there aren't that many
I don't know, I wouldn't like to be without social work.
Sure.
What do you study?
I understand. I study literature, on top of that, there's not much scope, but yes. I'm happy. I mean,
Sure,
I'm finishing, this is my last year. I'm wrigting the thesis. Then, I don't know what I'm going to do. Do you plan on staying a long time?
The truth is that I came with my husband with a three year visa, I don't know
Sure.
If we can stretch it more, but I also don't know if I'll want to. I mean,
Yes.
Is all a combination.
One starts getting accustomed. I also started the master's, which was for two years, then I stayed to do the doctorate,
Yes.
One starts speaking on the way.
Are you from Buenos Aires?
I'm from Buenos Aires, a part of San Martin
I'm also from San Martin
I can't believe it.
Yes
I can't believe you. I my mom lives in Villa de Satellites. But, when I moved, I moved to San Martin. I say San Martin for the
Really? What school did you go to?
No, I went to Santa Ana when I was little
None
Later, in high school, I went to one in Florida.
None
I don't know.
I went to the Jose
Yes, yes, yes.
Yes.
Very good. I can't believe it.
How crazy.
How strange. right?
Do you know how many Argentinians are there in Washington?
I'm friends with a couple, Dolores and Mariano, who are from San Isidro, but they've been here a bunch of years.
No. The others have been leaving already. Because some were from Cordoba, and I don't know?
Sure,
That people go and come, See? That is also a, why one starts to also want to stay because you know people
Yes
And you feel a little content, but, the people also move. Then,
Yes. Yes. Yes. A bunch.
You don't know what to do.
Yes.
Did you meet any Argentinians?
Since I've been here, I must have met fifty.
How nice.
A bunch.  I'm not saying that I always see them all, not at all.  I met many, and I don't see them often.  But, some. Yes.
You see, that's good
I suppose that there must be more of them in Washington. I don't know.
Well, there's a group that gets together and have barbecues, what do I know? I'm going, I'll get it by email but I'm talking about the ones that are close to me, the ones that go to school with me.
Sure.
We are just a bunch, literature.
Sure
Popular career, so I don't know.
Yes.
I don't know, and the problem for the, for this Spanish thing, I have just started getting these calls, I don't, no
I have no experience I mean, I just, this is my second call, kind of, so, I have no idea.
I think I'm halfway through them, the calls.
I see. I don't know how they do it with the facts or the statistics.
I believe that, I think that I'll get an email with, updating me on how we are doing
That's nice.
Giving me a more information because I haven't been told much so far
Yes, I can't compare the subjects or anything, for example, this one about health, I mean, the social security does it mean the social works or also the pensions and all of that?
I don't know, maybe, it's a
An excuse.
It's of help, but you don't really need to speak about the subject.
That's good because I wouldn't have known what to say
Yes, from what I understand,  they tell you because, there, you don't know what to talk about,
Sure.
They throw you a topic, but no I think that
No
They study the language, no
From us they will
No, the opinions
They will realize that we got emotional for finding a person of the same culture
Yes, and also from San Martin, I can't believe it.
I live, I have an apartment in and Mateo.
None
Where my mom is now living, but when I moved, my parents lived in, in reality,
Look at that.
I moved like thirty blocks closer to San martin
Yes.
And I studied in the San Martin conservatory also, music. I spent a bunch of parts of my,
None
None
How old are you?
I'm thirty five.
Ah, I'm thirty one.
We must have crossed. I don't know what is it called? the library.
Yes, I think it is neither big no small, I don't know? Could be either, I don't know.
Probably
It would go more to but
Sure, look at you.
Yes, but how crazy.
And how? Impossible. No. See how we ended up in the same place? Yes.
Yes, truth.
Is a lot
Have you seen much of the United States since being here?
Look, at first, I mean, it was quite bad, in the sense that I came here alone, in other words
None
Is harder, I think. Then, I had a very hard time adapting
To study
To do the master's. Then, nothing, I wanted to return at all cost, I was a little bit bad.
Yes.
But, later, I started getting used to it, and as soon as I got a little stabilized, I tried to travel. See? more than anything, looking for conferences,
None
That would help me to do something of mine, and at the same time in some city that I would like. Then,
Sure.
I went to New Orleans before that
Ah, how nice.
There was Katrina. It is a very beautiful city; I don't know how it is now, because this was terrible. Speaking of the help  of
Yes, yes, yes, is quite bad, I think.  Yes, I don't know if I'll go there now, maybe after a while.
No, you have to wait a while. But, it's very beautiful and is very different to other cities of the United States.
Yes.
Later I was in Pittsburgh, because I found out to be closer to Philadelphia. Right?
Yes, I know Pittsburgh is near here. I have family that lives there.
Look at that, I wanted to do the doctorate in the university. I was going to transfer, but then I changed my mind and I stayed in the same one.
You like Washington?
I went to know the city. I like Washington a lot, yes. Because I got to know it little by little, I became fond of it. See?
Yes.
You already have the neighborhoods you like, or the cafes or wherever you always go.
Sure.
The people that I met here, right?
Yes, logical.
Later, What other one do I know? I don't have many. Let's see. To which other one did I go? I went to Boston, now that I remember, which is also very beautiful. Because I went to do a seminar there during one summer.
Yes.
I liked it a lot. It's quite expensive, that's the only thing.
Yes
New York, which I try to visit every now and then, may also have those Chinese buses that are so cheap.
I go on them it is ten dollars from here and twenty dollars both ways
Sure, so perfect, much cheaper than that.
It's very good
Yes, You must go often, right? Because, since it is such a big city, I
Sure
The first time it overwhelmed me, but then I started feeling comfortable with it.
Yes, it overwhelms you
After being there a couple times. I didn't travel a lot.  I went to visit  my sister who is living in El Paso, in the border with Ciudad Juarez.
None

He had some fields in Texas

The fields are nice, aren't they?
Yeah, it's nice and my dad was
There were some bad harvests or
They had cotton
He had to
Horses, lots of animals
It's nice to live in the fields, it's nice to go on vacations, for a month or a week, but it's a hard place to live in
None
To live you have to be a bit hard
Precisely, that's why I chose this job.  To know other people from the United States.  For me the States are very nice.
The states
Good they have yes they are very different for example I just got out of Louisiana and there there is a lot of French influence
Yes
And the food reflects on the names each person if they're white, black, Latinos
The truth that they're different
Even the indians, they have, yes they have French names and the habits are very different for example
Do you know much? The United States for work, no? What did you say

The fact that the people can live really comfortable and have a good, a good view from all the rooms in their house
Sure, sure is true
How peaceful it is because Chicago everything is so fast too many people
None
There are too many fast steps

The people have like too much stress

My next step I would like
A lot, a lot of people no? from Mexico
A lot of people is true
Is more like the roots
They are the roots to have the
If the Americans don't go are some
None
They're kinda cold, right, the Americans
Our race is very affectionate, and I act the same way.
None
Arms wide open
Was your ex husband Mexican?
Yes, they were Mexican too
Mexican too, yes, there's people around there that
But, no.
That's more
Yes I want to find again
Like you, but mostly aren't, right?
No

It's not true
Personality, the thinks that
Exactly, i agree with that

Yes, and the Mexicans are hard workers, they're
And they're hard workers
The Mexicans work hard
Yeah, a lot,
Yes, yes
To me, it's something.
And that's why the people, there are lots of them in the South of the United States, the native, let's say. That's why the Americans aren't many either.
None
They don't like the immigrants, you saw the whole problem with immigration, that they're even building a wall
Yes, it's a
That's terrible
My brother lives in terrible
Because, the Mexicans go there, and they work hard and
Right

Work if they are hard workers
But yes that is way the president
It can be perfect if you do not do a wall. With that you don't achieve anything
Is true
None
Okay
The people are forced to go to other countries where there are more jobs. Here they give you more opportunities.
And is a shame such a shame that I feel
It is a fundamental problem.
Correct
Everything is very complicated is all
But yes that of the politic I don't understand because it can't be done according to those for me is very easy because they need hard workers
Sure
To be able to offer them some change, right? That they learn to speak in Spanish
Me yes
The English
I don't know why it is, i don't know if it's xenophobia or discrimination
There's so much that they can offer, yeah, that's it
They don't let pass, i really don't understand why, it must be discrimination, i don't know

Here, i mean you're in the system if you have money, right?, or if you have a good job

Right

Okay.
Pay attention to me.
All right.
What was I going to tell you, that is, why do you say that it looks like they are leaving late?
Because these ones are disorderly.

Okay, because then I can tell them, but how can it be, if they told me that in the building there is.

What does it matter?
The language this people speak.
What a coincidence that we found each other on the phone.
Poor Cuco.
Poor Cuco, I wonder who he's talking to.
Yes nothing, he probably talked to someone. What happens is that Carla was going to talk to Cuco, and, I called and said, no, well let's talk
I was going to call you, to tell you that after, if you wanted to talk with Carla.
None

Any gossip, nothing?
Hello, greetings from John of New York. How are you Marina from Philadelphia?
Hello, this Marina from Philadelphia, it's all good, what about you?
That's great, I'm fine. Where are you from?
I'm from Argentina, yes. Where are you from?
It seemed to me that had an Argentinian accent right from the start. I'm from Cuba.
Yes, I can tell.
How long have you been here? Oh really? Wow, do you miss it? No, I've been here for over forty years. It'll be forty years this year.
I'm learnign to identify the different accents now that I'm here in the United States since a year ago.  And you? wow
And, what's the name and do you miss Argentina?
Yes, I miss it a lot, no, Mar del Plata, it's
Where is that? The capital? I was in Mar del Plata in the Alean avenue which is pretty popular isn't it?
Yes, really?  Sure!  Especially during the summer, it's quite popular, yes.
Yes, I was there in the summer, about fifteen years ago, what do you think about the subject. Couples that break up
We must have made a mistake, I believe that it's something personal or a decision of each couple, some find it easier to break up with someone
Mmhm, yes, mmhm, yes
I don't know, I struggled with that a lot, even when I really wanted to break up with someone, I had a lot of problems doing it, I really didn't like to make someone suffer or whatever, I do think it's a difficult situation.
Yes, it depends, I think that if they make a huge mistake, then it should be easier or if she finds him in bed with another woman, it should be easy.
Sure, that's easy
When it's not like that, when it's because the love is gone or, it seems to me it's a bit difficult
Sure, you are right.
Also, if they have been living together for many years it is also difficult
Yes, and if there are children it must be even more difficult
Sons, forget it, that's completely different, but when you live together for many years,  you get used to the defects of the other and often, there is a saying that is better,
What is known is bad, that is good to know
Imagine you say alright I know the defects of this one. What if I find anohter one and he is worse? You say, alright I'll keep with the first one because I know the defects and can handle them.
Sure, and convenience too, right? You have the home mounted, your routine, you go along, I don't know
Yes. That happens. That happened to me; I was married to an Argentinean
It's not nice, but it happens, I know it
Yes, I have a son thirteen years old who is now with me, this weekend, but it has been a bloody battle because
She didn't want to let him, she wants to punish me because things didn't turn out fine and we were married for nine years
None
I saw that love was already over but I tried, I told her what she wanted to hear, but she, she already had me, because we were married she thought she had me
For ever
Yes, unfortunately it has been very hard and difficult, because she has used the child to try to punish me
That's disgusting, no, to me that is, I guess when you are inside the situation you don't realize and you do it, I don't know, it must be, we shouldn't judge people
Yes, no, right
You have act right, because the poor child has no fault, he loves his mom and loves his dad, and that you two can't work as a couple doesn't mean that
Yes, I have tried, I've had to fight hard to achieve the time I have him with me, every Tuesday and every Friday
None
Every two weeks, on weekend yes the next one no, I have him almost all of the time, it is a miracle that he is, he is upright
She puts a lot of garbage in his head and thank God he has come out straight and knows
Sure
He is on the right path, but on the inside he has a lot of wounds because of all that he has been through.
Yes and has it been a lot of years that you separated
Yes it has already been eight years, but believe me, up till December I was still in court because every time
None
Every time that she feels like it she takes me to court for things that she invents. She suffers unfortunately, from bipolar. I don't know if you have
Yes, I don'n know what it is.
None
Changes in the mood, like that
Yes she changes, yes she gets depressed then she gets very excited she was, was under medication already for like fifteen years she's been under medication
None
That also I think that contributed to that because at the beginning one realizes and but already with the years it seems that disease develops more
And well ah yes, that has been one of the parts that has affected us a lot
As a couple, sure.
To all of us and I've tried but every time I try to be nice or try to have a dialogue with her
Yes, that's so bad
She waits for the moment to hit me, no and then that has been very hard and it hasn't been hard because we are already divorced and all but it has been hard because she has not wanted
To move forward and I pray to God to give her a good man so that she's calm and doesn't bother me anymore
Sure
When I got married, I have a two and a half year old daughter and we are so happy, the kid and my current wife
The boy is, she's with him since he was six years old and she treats him like he was his own.
That's nice
She says I am not his mother, but I love him as if I were his mom'.  They get along fine.
That's so sweet, isn't it?
Yes, I honestly have had to really make an effort and he has too, he's good to my daughter, when she was born he and my wife
Would spend the whole night by her side because I had to rest since I work and they would stay up all night and on the next day I'd find the three of them sleeping in the same bed and with the baby between them and
None
Thank God, I've worked so hard.  I've made so many sacrifices and
It's hard.
And efforts because it's been hard. What made you go to Philadelphia?
I came here to work, I actually study biology in Argentina.
Yes
I had the opportunity to get a job for two or three years in here so we came here
That's nice, yes, Philadelphia is obviously not like New York, have you been to New York?
Not yet, I'm about an hour away from it and I've been here for a year and I still haven't been there.
Yes, you should go visit and you'd see how much energy that city has.  You should visit the Argentinian neighborhoods
Yes, there are lots of Argentinians and Uruguayans.
There are lots of Argentinians there, yes, oh that's nice.
Yes, the neighborhood has changed a lot.
How is the neighborhood called? Jackson Heights.
Yes Jackson Heights and the wave of Colombians was in the seventies. After that their way of living got better, in the eighties came the Argentinians, Uruguayans, Ecuadorians.
Took the place many of the Colombians went to the outside where there were better houses the neighborhood is not bad it is very good
Are they apartments
But if you improve your way of- economy and then you want something better
Of course
And then there are now all Mexicans in that area, but they're still Argentinian restaurants that have steaks, yes.

There was a question I didn't understand, that if breaking is what?
If breakin is hard
Okay.
Yes
I understand the topic regarding the breakup of couples
Sure, yes with the age, if when you are older, is easier than when you are young, or the opposite.
Okay
For some reason, sometimes it is easier to break up with your partner.
Yes, as far as the breakup.
This,
That, if one gets married, has to
Yes.
For the whole life
None
Even if there are exceptions.
None
I say about the exceptions, why? Because, nowadays, ouples get married easily, and they divorce even easier.
Totally, I agree, yes.
Then I think it doesn't make sense to get married, promise each other
None
Love for the whole life. In wealth and in poverty, in sickness, in health, in all. What the notary, judge or priest says,
None
Or the pries, or the pastor, whatever,
Yes.
To later easily say no. I mean it's not a game, because there are lives ahead.
None
Starting with the life of each one.
Yes.
Second if there are kids, there is even worse.
If there are kids, yes, for me it is quite complex, the issue.
Sure, yes, and even without having kids, is, is, is hard because there are broken hearts, wounded feelings. I think that, that is a commitment, right? is a commitment
None
I don't agree with it breaking. Now, what does one get with 3\
None
Tomorrow we will need another one
None
That other person will also have problems, because there's no perfect person.
No, that of course yes.
Exactly. is changing the good thing that one had , or the bad, another person will also have that good or bad.
I tell you depends what is the bad thing a person has. if you tell me, excuse me
Yes.
That suppose your husband or your wife has been unfaithful, for example,
Yes, of course.
Or if has has a problem that is violent
Yes, of homosexuality.
Or that he's violent
Yes.
Or of drugs, or of alcoholism
I agree, yes.
It all depends especially if you have kids.
None
Was with someone, I don't know, who's an alcoholic, or that, or that is violent.
It's a problem.
Do I want to give my children a home like that, have them grow up with a father like that? No,
Yes, and with a bad example. That's why I,
Exactly, exactly
I don't agree with that, with some exceptions, for example, the ones that you just mentioned
Sure, yes.
Certainly, because
Yes.
If there's violence. A woman can't, they shouldn't stand to live like that.
Sure, exactly.
A drunk man, or a criminal
Sure.
Or an immoral person, or a cheater.
Absolutely.
No, we are not subject to
Sure.
To live having to carry the other person because the other person is not
Exactly, yes.
We can forgive them.
Well,
There's the option of forgiveness, as long as the other person corrects its path
As long as, being
I'm sorry?
Yes
As long as the other person corrects it's proceedings, right?
Yes
It could have, made a mistake, right?, but, yeah, in case of adultery
Yes, I understand.
Asks forgiveness, and corrects its, its, its proceedings, i think it's worth taking that opportunity
Yes, what do I know?  There's also people that don't, for example.  I don't know if I could forgive that.
Sure, that's why, but it's only a choice.
I don't know if i could forgive
You take it or leave it, the person
No, yeah, No, totally, i concur, i concur, yes, yes
Yes
I don't think I can forgive that sort of
Yeah, it must be hard
It's very serious to me
Yes, it must be hard. But there is people who do
Yes, I respect [them].
For love itself, right?
Yes
For love itself. but, no, I don't agree and I don't share the the idea of a light break up.
Yes
Maybe as far as the old and the young people, I think the older people are more stable.
Yes, totally.
That have been around in life, the experience. True?
Yes.
While the young people no.
Yes, there's more
The young people easily break relationships and they don't care about anything.
Yes
Though, there must be some mature young people. Right?
Yes, is because of the inexperience, the impulsiveness. I believe you must have patience in love.
Yes.
You have to have patience with the other, because we all have flaws.
Exactly, we are not perfect.
Exactly. if one wants to be with someone, you have to cede.
You and I agree that is not easy to break up, it shouldn't be taken lightly, right?
Mm. No, no, no. For me it all depends, but it's not easy at all for to go through breaking up.
Oh no.
I believe it's easy to break up with someone, for example, if you don't love them.
Yes
If someone doesn't love the other person, if they don't care, they break up.
Yes, I agree.
Yes, if you are in love. It's a complex subject
Yes, sure but so, that's where love comes in because, if you are in love, that triggers a lot of things that
None
Takes you to act in a correct way
None
Although we can still fail, right? But,
You do your best
Occasionally, exactly, that's right.
Breaking up, I think that it shouldn't be taken as lightly
Lightly
It's not like,
Yes, it's,
It's not like changing one's clothes.
Yes, I'm sorry. No, exactly. Not at all.
It's not easy
At all. yes, likewise, I mean, one things is to break up a marriage and another thing is to break, for example, I don't know, a courtship
The courtship, of course.
Let's say a short time, right?
Yes, those are two different areas
I think that
The, in the courtship, the people are simply getting to know each other and preparing
Is
For a step ahead.
Exactly. You still haven't committed one hundred percent with the other.
We are getting to know each other.
Exactly.
We  are getting to know each other.
None
And, is a process. I think that  there is the option to break up
None
Without becoming enemies. Do you understand me?
Yes, absolutely. I agree, yes.
Yes, without there being a need for
Yes, because one, sure. Is that one, precisely, because one has a courtship, before getting married, to have the chance of deeply knowing the other person.
To say, yes
None
I am going to really choose this person to share my life with, and then I get married. Figure
Yes
I want to form a family. This person doesn't get along with me.
None
And well, you leave, let's say
Exactly, and, in a good mood, just not
That's it
We are just not made for each other
Exactly, I didn't work out
It is also an opportunity where the relationship turns closer.
None
For instance, I don't like this, I feel like  the other person tries to correct and, and you can go on
So, it is a process of knowledge
Absolutely, yes
Where you can, you can break the engagement
None
Right? who are somehow getting ready for marriage. if they realize during that stage
Right
That aren't, they just break up. But i imagine they must keep being friends
Yes, likewise, i mean, in the way that, because you get attached to people
Yes, sure
If love a person, then it's hard to break up, because you miss the other one, but if you know it's gonna work then maybe you should breakup?
And, it is going to hurt. Yes, it is better to put
What for, why would you go on gor?
Colorado [red], like they say in my country, getting red [blushing]
None
A few days, and not your whole life thereafter
What, what?
It's better to be embarrassed for one day, one moment, than your whole life after that
Yes, totally.  And besides, if tomorrow
Yes
You'll be forming a family, what picture of marriage do you want to give to your children?, the picture of a really happy marriage
Yes
That you want to be with each other. So, you're not gonna marry someone that
That's everyone's wish, because, i think no one is going to get married thinking tomorrow
Sure, yes.
I'll get divorced, i think that's a mistake that many people make
None
Precisely, because, can't they see it, they have no consciousnesses about this being a real commitment.
Yes, exactly
They easily say I'm getting married and if it doesn't work, I can get a divorce.
None
That's where the problem comes from.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
That's where the problems start.
There's people, I believe that some people get married thinking that maybe, not thinking, yes, I'm going to get divorced eventually but with
If it doesn't work out
Sure, yes.
I can get a divorce because, there's people, you know, the ones that sign prenuptial agreements?
Yes.
It happens here in the United States
Oh, yes.
They divide their assets before getting married?
None
In the event that they get a divorce
Yes. That's right.
They live with, did you see? They get married but,
There it is, they are taking precautions.
Yes, they already have a foot in the divorce.
Exactly. The first step, already, backwards.
Sure, exactly. I mean, I respect it, each one. see? do in their life what they want
Logically, obviously, yes
Of course. But, is strange, see?
We are here. simply, a very personal concept, and very personal.
Yes, But, is strange, I don't know?
Every person has the freedom to think what they want.
Yes, totally.
Yes, there are people that lack that, so to speak, the ability to commit.
Exactly, yes, yes, yes, yes. Totally, yes.
None.
Hello how are you?
Fine and you? with whom
I'm very good, I'm Sylvia I live in Chicago.

Silvia, I don't know if we've talked, my name is Lourdes
Lourdes, How have you been?
From Texas
How nice.
Listen, What was the topic? I didn't understand
What?
What was the topic that they gave us today?
I didn't understand either because I was busy eating and talking.
It was something of part-
It seems like it said that the system of
The couples are breaking up.
The couple breaking up, I don't know anything about that
When it ends, you know when the relationship ends
What do we think, that if they remain friends or not?
Yes but and there are some relationships that are easier to end than others.
Yes, there are relationships that are easier than others, I imagine. Especially if there are kids, they have to talk to each other, be civil, not count
Girlfriends you've had, either of the two.
Yes, many people stay in the marriage when there's kids despite being very unhappy
No
With the marriage
I did it, and got quite hurt, because staying like that was a bad example for my kids and, now they tell me, that seeing, that they weren't blind, that they saw that
That I did need a partner and that for them I didn't want to. Then they fear that they're going to get
A bad man, that they don't know how to choose because they couldn't
A stepfather yes
Okay no, they didn't have the chance to see, have a father in their, in their home.
Yes I mean How long?
But
How long have you been divorced already?
No well I've already been, divorced seven years but, I separated immediately after three or four years of being married, then
None
Almost, I would see him and he wouldn't give me the divorce, I said what do I want him for.
Yes
I wasn't going to look for a boyfriend, nor anything you see I stayed with my daughters.
That I was married, and I would always say that, so that my friends wouldn't bother me
Yes
My mom said, Marry again so that you'll have at least two incomes.
Yes
But no, I didn't listen to her. I was so dumb, better
Yes, it's just, now, your kids are older, you can
Yes, they're twenty five - twenty six years now.

Seven zero five
Four three zero two
4302, I'll call you.
Yes and it's my cellular
I have other little jobs. It's true, we were talking and they disconnected us and we didn't get the numbers.
Yes
You were talking to me about another study.
Really?
Wasn't it you who was talking to me about another study you participate in, it wasn't, boy
It wasn't me, it wasn't me. I found out about this one by chance.
No
It was very boring at work and I looked for websites
These too, so I did it.
But if you know of something else I want you to tell me.
In Chicago there are several and put you to try new foods such as when it left the KFC
Did you know it really changed the coleslaw.
Yes
I wanted to change but we did try it for 45 minutes and we got paid 200
Wow
Another was the tomato soup I wanted to change the can of slip.
Okay
Also told us about the different stores
Okay, it may be national or local level.
You're always on the internet marketing studies.
Okay
For example, when you work in the afternoon, you get paid 150 to 170 for food.
Always test for example, when the ice cream came out again
Okay
I asked if it was too sweet or if it was the correct portion
Yes
And
What do I have to get
Okay, but, especially because when they have those requirements they want one to have a certain age.  A certain income that you have kids.
You have to qualify.
None
Yes I also if they ever send you to Texas call me quickly, we'll meet to eat or something.
How nice, yes
You already have a friend here
Where in Texas?
In Houston
I have a brother there in Houston
Really
Well in Kaydi Texas how far it is from there
Oh
He bought a little house two years ago.
Yes, if you come to visit, you call me and we'll get together.
Yes I'm going to call him tonight to tell him that I'm already making friends there
We go to eat or something
I beg him to visit us. For seven years, since dad died, he hasn't come
Yes
I'm already fighting with my brother because he doesn't want to come.
Listen and your mom is with you.
She has No mom doesn't want to live with me, I have asked her to come because she's already eighty years old
Where is she?
Here very near my house, but she has her own house.
OK
She's almost eighty years old now, she's almost loosing her mind. yeah
Yes I lost mine, I don't have any family here, I'm here by myself with my two kids.
Yes, with three kids.
Yes two kids, my daughter is thirteen and my son is nineteen
Nineteen?  He is still very young.
Yes, there he's giving me more trouble. He doesn't want to go to university, he doesn't want to do anything.
So
There he's playing at home, playing video games at home
It's annoying right.
Yes but what can I do, I cannot throw him on the street
I'm sorry
No, but my mom
With my daughters from, tell me
I lost my mom on the year nine eleven
Nine eleven
She was watching TV in Puerto Rico and she had a heart attack that day.
No
She died, yes, so imagine that.
Poor, yes, I'm really sorry
I need her, but I do have a brother who lives in Puerto Rico.
Wow
Yes I'm here alone
And you go to Puerto Rico often?
I go there, I try to go I used to go a while back every year but since my mom died
None
It took me five years to go, but I went last year.
I've only gone once to San Juan but it is so beautiful.
Yes and I found it, I found it more hot that anything I said, I saw my brother and I told him has it always been so, so hot here he tells me yes, and I say, I don't remember being so hot
Wow
Yes, but
Is like that because in the summer
The summer yes, is in June
Now already now we are in the office in a hotel and we are realizing that we have to do a little work. But yes, let me repeat the number, two eighty one
705-4302.
Yes and that's the cellular, you can find me there, forget it, is always on.
Lourdes, What's your last name?
What is your area what is your area code.
Is two one nine
Two zero nine, because sometimes I don't answer
Okay.
If I don't know who is from, I don't answer the call.
Yes. Want to write down my number? Look here when you come to Chicago if I'm here. Jot down my number.
I can't because I'm driving now
It's okay then.
Yes, when we talk next time I'll try to be home and then
Yes that is fine, here are the hours that they will call every day, can you confirm that?
Yes there are people, not me, I've stopped because I've been very busy these weeks so I stopped I said that only Fridays and Saturdays.
None
You are receiving calls every day.
Every day I ask them, but they hardly call me.
Yes, the first times they would call me, they would call me, but they couldn't find anyone to pair me up with so I said that this is a waste of time
Many times, I would wait twenty minutes
None
This topic like I tell you I can't tell you much
Yes what I think is that in the couple each one thinks separately, each one decides according to the situation of each one
None
Then there are men that it is easy for them because they are with different women it is easy for them to end a relationship and there is another one waiting.
Yeah
When you are married, the women wait for the children
That is true
Yes unless that, unless there is, that you are in a relationship that the husband is beating her or something. and then yes, the the thing gets serious.
But
I have seen many couples that get more friendly, they are best friends and because of that they get married
Yes, yes the best partners are those who begin as friends
None
You have met him for a long time and you get married.
Yeah, that is like that
There are people that get married too fast without knowing each other. Later they begin to know features of the other person and say, Hey, who did I marry, because I don't know you.
Then, the again when you reach our age
None
And you know someone, you don't want to lose your time.
It is true
Dating for years
When Dad died
But listen, and do you think that you will marry again?
I think
Hi, my name is Miriam
Hi Miriam, how are you?
Fine, and you?
Fine, too.
That's good
Where are you from?
I am from Lima, Peru, but I am speaking from Toronto.
Right
Where are you speaking from?
From Washington
Wash, I think we have spoken once
Yes, we have, yes
None
I think it was immigration
I don't remember, immigration? How have you been? What do you think about today's subject?
Couple's breakup
Right
I think that it depends, right?, if it's hard or not, it depends on how much in love you are, that's it
And do you see the couple they don't get along
Yes, it could still be that, it doesn't work and you're still in love, it's hard to make that decision
Yes, and it won't let you, yeah. It's, it's hard, right?
Yes
Has it been hard for you in your past relationships, in your experience?
I have had both experiences. It's been hard and it hasn't been too hard
It's
You?
I've had four experiences. I've never broken up with anyone, more like they've broken up with me, because with the relationship, I've been
A coward, and always like I grow used to it, I think it is
You wait for the other person to take the initiative
None
To break up
No, I feel bad, I feel bad about breaking up, I feel bad, I mean, I grow used to the other person
None
And then, when I analyze the situation later, the past relationship was not working.
Sure
Because we didn't understand each other.  There was a lot of indifference, but I didn't take the initiative, the other person saw that and took it.
Right?
Sure
I've never left anyone. I mean, yes, I think you should take up arms, and when the relationship is not working
Didn't work, you have to say, this is it
Yes, I have the case of a friend that, she has, she had, she already finished not too long ago, she had years, years, probably ten years, with the person, perhaps
Eight years living with a partner
None
Once, she ended it with him. What happens, that apart from not getting along they have very different objectives.
None
For example, she wanted to get married and have kids, and not him, he didn't want to get married, he didn't want to have kids.
None
She knew, for many years, what her partner's stance was.
She thought he would change.
She thought that at any minute, things were going to change
That's the problem.
Was going to become more mature, and was going to want to have a family. But, before that time, nothing ever happened.
It never happened, and the woman becomes older, and later, she's not even going to be able to find
Exactly, yes.
And the man doesn't make a decision, is true.
I think that sometimes one makes the decision when it is too late.
Yes, is true.
I would've made it much sooner.
Is that, you know? I saw once, the syndrome, in a book I read the syndrome of Beauty and the Beast.
None
In which says that the women, since little shouldn't be taught Beauty and the Beast, yes, nor any, of those fairy tales. Right?
None
It says that all those fairy tales, they teach them, and already since little, for example, Beauty and the Beast. Beauty expected for the monster to change
Change, and the monster, how they portrayed him, he was bitter
Yes.
He was bitter. he rejected her and all of her beauty and love. He says that he will change, and finally, she gives him a magical kiss, I think, and he changes.
Then it says that the woman is born and grows up with that ideal. When one knows that the human being is already a monster, the monster will become more monstrous as he grows older
Exactly, yes.
Is very hard to change him. Would that, be the syndrome that many of us have?
Yes, I think that it's true, I think that women think that they can change the man
That cost us. With my love he will change in time.
Exactly, I will make him change, I will make him stop drinking.
Okay, is a mistake, it cost, such a big responsibility, one has to change one's self, instead of trying to change the other
Yes, or find another person
Find another, is better.
Yes.
There comes the question, Do you think, that it's easier to break up when you are younger or when your are more?
I think that only for the fact of the age, that, I think that, the women think they have more possibilities when they are younger.
Or more.
Easier. And, in fact, I think that there are more available men. Because, since they are young, I don't know, they haven't been married, no
None
In general, let's say. There's more
None
Availability
Also, when one is younger, one thinks differently. See?
Yes.
Right? Is younger. Is more adventurous, more adventurous, I don't know, more possibilities.
Yes, you don't think things so much, so to speak.
Sure.
Yes, I think that. And, when one is mature, on one hand, also, knows what they want, And, on that part also is a little easier.
For example, if one meets someone and spends some times with that person one realizes that no. I think, either way, because one knows more what one wants,
As a woman. Right? But, on the other hand, is the thing of the age, and all that, there are women that think that they won't find another partner,
Right? And they stay there, in a relationship
They stay with the monster
I, What can I tell you? Already, the monster, the monster is made but. I tell you also, because my children's father, each, each year that goes by, he becomes more of a monster, doesn't change.
Finally, we have left each other several times
Sure.
We have left each other several times. We've gotten back together. But, just last week, I made the decision and told him, You know what? This is over.
Perhaps, he takes it as a joke. Because, we have broken up so many times
Sure.
That, I don't know. But, I want him to change because not I'm changing, I mean, in my maturity, I'm becoming Christian, I go to church
How old are you?
I'm forty.
None
You?
Thirty five.
You seem young. You remember what I told you? You sound like a young girl. Then, I'm becoming very Christian. Oh, I met him when I was thirty-four, see?
Sure.
My monster doesn't change. And I, we had a son, and he, nothing, he alone, like he wanted only not even the boy's responsibility, is only mine.
Sure.
He just comes and that's it, and later, bye. And, me suffering there with the boy. I cut him loose twice, because of that. I told him, no, if you don't want to get married and have the responsibility of the family
I don't want to be never living together.
Okay.
He would leave and come back, and I would accept him, and again, and we've been like that. But, right now, I've told him that no, I don't want to.
Do you think that breaking up is harder when you have a kid?
Is very hard.  Is worse.  Is not even about age anymore, because,
You think of the kids.
I've seen, already honestly when you are already a mother, unless the man really smokes, drinks, and not even I've seen
They receive the fathers.
Only for the kids.
Yes, yes. It is really difficult. You think of your son a lot
You know what? I think there is a, there is a difference, because you, even if you want to, you can't change the fact that, that he is the father of your son
Even if you I mean it is fact, that's all. And although you end the relationship, I think you must continue the other relationship
From a father-son point of view. Because the son does have a father, and he will always
None
Be his father.
None
I think that, when you have sons, you are right. Breaking off is much more difficult because there will always be a a relationship between the son and his father
There will always be.
The Father is always there even if you don't want to see Him.
He will always be there
Present
Those meetings, the couple doesn't actually break off.
Right.
You know what I mean? Sometimes you live a love-hate situation Optional Comments:
Sure
You are together, then you split up, and, and it's an ugly situation for the children to see. That's ugly
Yes
Really ugly, really
You, let's say, it's a little, I think
But,
They don't know what it's about.
Is a vicious cycle.
They confuse a little.
It's a vicious cycle.  The children are born very confused.  They don't know.
Yes.
What do I tell you? We have been separated for many years. I mean, I with him, we have been more out of the relationship than inside the relationship
And, when you were out, he saw the kids,
What?
When you are not in the relationship, does he still see the kids?
No, because that's what many men have.
Yes.
Many men are like that, vengeful and hateful. That when they don't have anything with the woman, sometimes they don't see the
Sure.
My kid's dad, is that type of man.
Is he Peruvian, also?
No. He's Dominican.
Okay
Unfortunately. But, he, yes, of other fathers that the relationship breaks up and, and they continue as friends and see their kids. See? Not this one, this one, if the relationship breaks up, gets away from everything
Yes.
And doesn't even want to look at the boy.  Doesn't that hurt?
Yes
Sometimes, yeah, he tells me, i want to see the boy, but it starts to
You have to talk about it. If you're talking about it clearly.
None
It would get better, right?
I have never seen a man so tough, so hateful as him, my child's dad, do you have a boyfriend now?
I have a husband
Oh, are you married?
I have two kids
Oh, that's nice, that's nice, well, I'm glad, I
Yes
You're outside of a relationship, and still, my situation is very sad
None
I go to church a lot, and that has helped me a lot.
Do you have two or one?
One, one
Yeah
A little man. And yeah, i go to church a lot and look for support. And people is really good, and it's very nice to me. It's a different environment
I have gathered more strength, and i put an end to him
Sure,
And, I want him to change, he seems like, there, he sometimes wants to.
Whoever changes first, we talk.
Who changes first?
Then you talk, let him change first, and then talk with him
None
If you want to, is true. But, you need a group.
Yes,
You can go to church. A group of, that sounds bad.
Hello?
Hi
Hi, good afternoon, my name is Mayra
Wood my name is Leticia
Where are you talking from?
From Philadelphia
Oh really? Me too.
Yes?
Yes
Oh, look at that
Right
Where are you from? I'm from Argentina.
Where are you from?, I'm from Mexico
None
None
And, what are you doing here?
Here, I'm studying, I'm on my third year now
Where are you studying?
In the University
Of Pennsylvania?
From Pennsylvania. yes.
None
Yes, I've already been three years.
None
That the thing comes out
Okay.
What do you do here?
I'm here because I'm also in the university, but working, because my husband came to do a post doctorate
Okay
I also started working in the university so but I haven't been here long, it's been eight months
Really?
Yes.
Alright, how nice.
No is
Okay, and what are you working in?
I'm working in a laboratory that does research
Okay.
In the University of Pennsylvania.
Alright.
So what do you think of today's topic?
I don't know.  I have a lot of opinions regarding things about religion.
Yes.
I have strong opinions because I do feel that to live in many things, I mean that it creates a lot of conflict between other religions and between people and
There's a very long history, right? of religious wars
Yes. yes.
And it bothers me a little that they are always excluding people, I know a religion has to exclude some, and that other have another religion or other things to do.
Yes, that the people
I don't know.
They differentiate themselves by the religion they practice right?
Yes, exactly.
Yes.
Or that one can simply not accept the other, I mean, is not necessarily that they accept it but rather that they can't leave them alone
Maybe it they would leave them alone, it's good.
Yes, as is.
More peaceful the thing.
Yes that they can coexist, last that they respect each other, right?
Yes, exactly, at least that they have tolerance.
Yes.
There's a religion that I like a lot, it's the Buddhist.
Really?
And that's not against anything
Look at that
Yeah, it doesn't, it has nothing to do with that, so, i like it because you tell it hey, but what, and catholics do, that's ok, i mean, that's how things are
They have a philosophy of life, well, look, just be, like it ended up.
Sure
They have no interest in fighting with others
Yes, i understand, uh, that's the religion that's practiced in Japana, i mean, in China, right?
That's right, yes, over those places
Yes, it's interesting there's another way of looking at, i mean, seeing thins, because the truth is that besides, there are lots of extremists in religion and
Yes
They take things too seriously
Too much sometimes
Yes
I don't like that. For example, here in the university, i think that you haven't felt that, because you're in the lab, but in general, there's a huge difference among the Jewish in college, that deal with jewish
Yes
I can't even talk to christians, so many are very extremist and orthodox. I prefer to not hang out with them.
Really?
Yes
The christians, but no catholics?
Well, Christians from here.
Yes, the protestants would be.
Kind of alright,I don't even know from where, I mean from some that, but they are, you see them and by there
That the religion was like that one hundred years ago, I didn't know it still happened.
Really?
Yes, the people continued to behave so closed up
None
I have a friend who lives in a little town where many couples either get married right after high school or during high school
Yes.
They already don't go to the university, and he says that nobody has a boyfriend before getting married. Nobody kisses another person, even if they are boyfriend and girlfriend
Yes.
Until their wedding day, yes, is like that because
No.
I thought that was a century ago, I don't know
How incredible, I didn't know that kept happening on that level.
It's still happening, at least here in the United States, I've met many people that are like that and I'm really surprised, I never thought
I mean you can't interact with those people, practically.
I can't talk with them, we can't talk about anything, because they don't do anything and I don't want to offend them or anything.
And in turn, the Jews also exlude themselves. hey don't interact.
{}
Sure.
How nice, they're excluded in any way
Yes, apart there, there's many judges.
A lot.
Yes, yes, yes, it is incredible what happened, right?
None
No, the truth is I didn't know what the level of the university people was and all that, I didn't know how it was, I thought that
That everyone respected each other, that nothing happened, that everyone has their own religious but got along with everyone
Its like how the whole world does this but the problem is that they aren't related those who are really strong believers in a religion
Have problems relating to us
Sure.
From other religions.
Sure.
So, but
And with the rest of the people from India, people from Asia
There I think the thing is more cultural, like, there aren't problems, I haven't had problems with them about beliefs
Yes.
Nothing more than since it's cultural, they have their role and they get together with each other, and go to their parties and everyone for himself
Sure.
Yes.
You get along more with, with Catholic people, in some way, or, or with
Tell me. I think, yeah, I relate better to international people, I try to go out with international people.
Right.
Of course the majority of them are Catholic, but none of them are super, super, super Catholic, that is, they're very relaxed people anyway
Right,
Almost all of their friends are international, so we're a little more used to the same tolerance and what we are saying
What yeah, the truth is that I didn't think that that meant so much, I thought that, that that existed, well, religious differences because, in fact in this country there are a heap of religions but
Mmmhmm
I didn't think they segregated themselves that way
No, it's really interesting, it surprised me a lot too when I saw it, I couldn't believe yeah, it was like that, like wow, I never imagined
Yeah and in some way you should believe more, right?
Yes, they just can't or, I have a friend who tried to go out with a girl who was Jewish and he was Catholic and they couldn't because she didn't want anyone to see her giving him her hand
Because then in her community they wouldn't accept her
None
So yeah, it's pretty complicated.  The thing where you can't shake hands with your girlfriend.
Yes, and more than we
I don't know
There, we come from countries where there isn't so much religion, or the other religions are very much the minority, right?
Yeah, we don't have those problems, I don't think.
There is, it's like there's an impressive mix.
But I don't know. I'm thinking about an example of when religions unite a people. I think it does have
Inside a religion
Yes.
That is something that unites people, right? I think
Yes. it unites within the, the same ones of the religion. And with Muslims, for example that, do you also have Muslims colleagues and that?
I know a few, not many, honestly.
That's interesting what you are saying because i always notice that the Jews help each other
None
And that if there's someone whom to favor, they will favor, the other Jew.
Yes, it works like that.
That definitely
Yes, that's a fact.
That is already like that, but I didn't think they expressed it like that so openly.
Is funny, maybe they don't do it on purpose but no, is more cultural, with that of having to go every Saturday all of them
Yes.
Well, they get along really
Sure
There are many events that are just for Jews
Yes.
I don't know and maybe well they are the ones relative to the religious days they have.
Yes.
I have felt it a lot like that. I have a couple of Jewish friends that I take to once in a while, but good friends, none.
None, sure.
I'm sure that there are other people that do.
I understand.
It's only that I have not met them.
What part of Mexico are you from?
In the city
From DF
From Mexico.
None
Listen, and in which laboratory do you work?
It's a laboratory that works in the part of the of lipyd matabolism
Come on.
This like that good this, and related to cardiac illneses and all that I don't know, do you study something related to science and with medicine or something?
Yes, I study chemical engineering.
Look at that.
Yes.
That's good
Where is your laboratory?
It's in the BRB
Where is that?
In the building that says Penn on top, you can see it from afar
Oh, I know which one it is.
That building
None
It's so high
Yes, it's amazing, I love it. How much research is done here?
Yes, a lot.
The university is amazing
Yes, it is amazing the amount of research done in here, you can't believe it.
No.
There are so many resources.
Yes, that's it, that's one of the reasons why I came here, yes, this is where the money is, right?
Yes
To do stuff, it's so much harder in other places.
Yes, what do you have? Are you on a student visa?
Yes.
None
Yes.
Sure.
But, well, i work here, inside the university too
Oh, you also work?
None
Oh, well,
Of, work study, i mean, for undergrad's
Yes
There are always work studies, you can find several jobs
Oh, that's interesting
None
Ok, i mean, you can, help, help support yourself while you study
Yes, that's precisely what it's for
Sure, and yes, sure
Yes, they check you, the package you have, and most of us get some kind of scholarship
Yes
They don't give you as much and you have to work to get that much
Sure
For example, the university makes me pay a minimum amount, anyway.
None
Plus my own expenses, there's still enough for my expenses
Right
None
Yes, not he truth is that pretty good, because if not it's impossible.
Yes, yes, because, like, for example, if I were working in Mexico, they wouldn't take out the money to pay my expenses, I think.
No.
None
No, here education is really expensive, and
Hello
Hi
Good [afternoon|evening], yeah, good [afternoon|evening]
Hi, this Martin
My name is William, how are you?
Fine, very well this week
From Miami
From Miami
The city that never, the city that never sleeps
I'm in Baltimore
Baltimore
Maryland, yes
No way, there's going to be a hell of a cold there
No it's been good so far, now the temperature has started dropping, it was too warm for January
Look.
We had fifty six degrees
In Miami, when the temperature is over sixty-five degrees , itâ€™s like a snow stor was up there.
Sure
I have a leather jacket on in Miami; that's unusual
Right
That's something rare here in Miami because you can't wear leather jackets like if you were in New York.
Sure, the weather.
And the weather is around seventy five degrees
Sure but not
That's why I'm asking you, it should be so cold up there
We've had moderate weather but so far this year had to be
Twenty five, thirty
Oh shit you are crazy!
Yes, it's now around fifty degrees, it's just going down.
Now yes, since the sun has gone down, it seems like it's going to get worse
Yes
Come here, where are you from?
Argentina and you?
I knew it that you were from Argentina. I'm from Cuba brother
Yes, I can
From the poorest part of the Caribbean
No, but it's a beautiful country, I haven't been there
I didn't listen to the girl because I was watching a movie so I don't know what do we have to talk about.
Religion. If religion unites or divides people and to give examples, for example if Christians and Muslims would be close to each other if it wasn't for religion
For example if homosexuality is discriminated because of religion
That's so boring kid, lets talk about
We can talk about that or we can talk about something else, you can tell me what you are doing there in Miami
Yes we can talk about something else because I really, I don't care if you are Catholic, I don't mean you, but the people
Yes
If they are Catholics, Christians, Muslims, as long as they don't do anything to me, I don't care what type of bird you are, I don't care.
Yes, neither do I, neither do I, I'm a believer
Yes, no
Anybody can believe in whatever they want
Yes, no, all the problems that this world has at this hour if this or that
Yes
Look, lets talk about something else, you know that here in Miami
Yes
Here in Miami it's all good, picture that, most of the people here are Catholics or Christians and once in a while, you can find a
As I said, a Muslim or an Hindu, those are crazy, the ones that have dots in the forehead
Yes
And they start to talk to you about the Bible. I can't stand any of that. Tell me, are there many Hispanics in Baltimore?
How?
Are there many Hispanics in Baltimore?
A lot of what?
Hispanics, Latin people.
I can't hear you Hispanics I don't know just, just yesterday we moved we are, are living in Philadelphia and now we moved to Baltimore in Philadelphia there's a bunch of entire neighborhoods that they are all Hispanics
Here in Baltimore, I know there's a neighborhood that's quite full of Mexicans
Yes
Is a small neighborhood, is not, is not like Miami or New York where
You have, you have
There's a bunch
Have you been in Miami?
Just passing through
You've never stopped there in Miami?
But
You know that in Miami they have some tremendous Argentinian restaurants with, with some delicious meat
Yes
I don't remember what they are called because
Yes.
I haven't gone there in a while, but I have been to two little cities called Hialeah and Kendall.
Some delicious restaurants really.
Yes before I take a trip to Argentina by there I'll pay a trip to Miami and I'm going to eat there
How are the Cuban girls there? The Cuban girls listen. I don't know if you've been with a Cuban girl, but the day you get with a Cuban girl
You will forget that the world exists because these girls throw themselves on you as if you were something so delicious, I at this moment I'm in Orlando, but I'm going to Miami tonight, I live in Miami.
Yes
Here in Orlando there are not many Hispanics
Yes
Almost ninety percent of the Puerto Rican population, there is not people of other nationalities
None
With the damned Puerto Ricans
No, itÂ´s just
It is incredible
I think most are Puerto Rican in Philadelphia too.
You do not see
There is a dominican, a Cuban
Okay, there are not many of us.
The majority
ItÂ´s only us.
Yes, In fact I only know one Cuban that works near my job.
In fact everyone I know are from Argentina
Of course
I know most of those who are almost all Puerto Ricans
I believe that among Puerto Ricans and Mexicans make the Hispanic population in the country
Yes
I came to Orlando two or three times only.
Yes
I've never stayed more than a week and I spent like a month here on vacation
Yes
And, I say maybe I move up there, let me see how things are, a very nice city. There are a lot of people, the people are very nice but,
Damn when you don't find people from your country
Yes, is
Come one feels a little, excluded, you understand me because one likes to have the
None
Though you are Hispanic and I'm Hispanic, we have the same blood you could say
Yes,
But is always nice. Is good finding a person who understand your jokes,
Yes because
To talk to you clearly
Yes, besides, even things like the food there are different some customs, is good someone like from the same country
Sure
Yes
In, is very interesting to know the customs of other people, but I always in Miami wake up in the morning that I'm going to work, and I always stop in a little store, any store I stop
There are two or three different people, but at least there's a Cuban, who can talk, drinking a coffee.
Yes
This one saying that if my wife was unfaithful. You understand me?
Yes
It's the, no, I take her and I push her against the wall and I'm like no, but fuck, you can find the Puerto Ricans upstairs and I have nothing against the Puerto Ricans but fuck they are all criminals.
At least here in Miami, the Puerto Ricans are nice people but the ones upstairs are all a bunch of criminals.
Yes
They have gold teeth and their pants are showing their asses, come on bro, are you showing me your ass? You are wearing the pants in your knees! What's up with you? Are you crazy or what?
Yes, I see
Yes, they are dressed as if they were black people with golden teeth and with your ass showing, look, I got up the other day and I told him, bro can't you pull your pants up or what, or wear a skirt then or something.
If you want, I can buy you a belt because every time that I see him in the morning, his pants are half way his ass.
Come on, what's your problem! Do you want them to stick it on you or are you selling yourself for twenty five cents? What's your problem.
Sure
But oh no, they are nice people, fuck you don't have their
Yes.
You are from Puerto Rico you are Hispanics, you can have your own personality, why do you have to act like the rest, no, I get crazy, I can't live like that man!
Yes but Puerto Rico is a very particular case because they have so much American influence.
Yes, that's true
They have a mix of traditions
You know, you are so right about that.
No
They think they are gringos, and they've forgotten about the fact that they are not gringos at all.
Yes
They are Puerto Ricans.
Yes they exaggerate some things there
Let's say that I generalize too much, but well what I've seen here, is like that they believe that they are gringos and they speak to you as if they were gringos
No is that you are right
I see them I tell them listen talk to me in Spanish because I know Spanish and you also know Spanish.don't come to me with the English that you are are gringo that you are a dumb ass okay, be still
Yes
I the only gringo that has blue eyes and was born in Baltimore, in California
In your little country don't come pretending to be a gringo, no is that they don't even want to talk to you in Spanish brother
Yes that's happened to me.
You understand me? You talk with them, and you tell them a word in Spanish, and you have a conversation with him and he keeps talking English, brother, talk to me in Spanish that I understand you.
Yes
What's wrong with you? Did you forget where you came from?
Sure
Don't mingle here, these gringos will break your head.
Yes but And how long, how long ago did you arrive from Cuba?
I came from Cuba when I was five or six years old.
Very little
No, I came here when I was a little boy that couldn't even read yet.
Sure
No. I, yes, because although. And, you, how long ago did you arrive from Buenos Aires?
Yes we came almost four and a half years ago, five years more or less
How did the country seem to you?
I got accustomed after awhile. At first I was shocked because it was so different
It's very different that's true.
Yeah, big cities they seem like Buenos Aires a little but, like a city but no, the people are very different it's a lot more
Truth that people are kind of dry, they don't
It's drier, it's colder, yeah
There's no, there's no warming like the Hispanic kind that comes your way.  How do they say?
Yeah
Your neighbor greets you in the morninf and you sit down over a coffee, and asks how it's going, how's your life? Here, everybody just leaves to go to work and they forget about the rest of the world.
Sure, of course you can drink some mate with a friend
Yea
That doesn't exist
I think that it's a very developed country but the, the people they're like brainwashed that they're like zombies, You know what I mean? I
A little and that is the other impression. They are always going to do the same thing and they don't ever stop to consider the rst
Yes very cold, let me ask you something, because I, I enrolled in a program it's, this, it's was like the second call that I got and I didn't ask them
The other girl, because she was Chilean and I didn't ask her. What's the point? of why you all talk to other people in Spanish, what is the
Getting to the bottom of all this
Hello
Hello
Hello, what are you doing, Veronica
Yes Carina.
How are you
What are you doing?  How are you, Carina?
See that we go the topic of religion.
We got the topic of religion, I tell you that I had a friend who was a priest.
No, I can't believe you
Yes he was a priest, and it turns out that later he got married but ended up a faggot.
I mean that, but I thought that the homosexuals within the religions  have a better time. I thought that all the ones that were in, in the monasteries like, kind of like
Had those tendencies.
You know that what he says is that in some way, he discovered his homosexuality
Inside the monastery.
In a monastery, precisely.
And you think that unites people, instead of
Sure, I think thatn the long run, the religion is like a screen towards the outside, of laws and of
I  think that the religion is very open.
Can connect and this of the spiritual ties, wait that another phone is ringing, what a thing right.
None
This to getting a spiritual connection that also takes you to look for a physical relationship, because the whole religious topic is really
Really abstract.
It's really abstract. It's like platonic love, and really transcendental. So sure, I imagine that you must want to communicate in another way with people, no.
Sure, so the thing that makes more material. So no, it calls my attention
That they sometimes use some objects, really cult to the religion like almost as toys, like sexual toys or for these kinds of ends.
Uye, we have to ask your friend, because the truth is it makes me really curious but, I don't have informants inside the
The experience that they have through these, things to ask them, no.
Sure, look. What called my attention was this, I tell you that what they think at times
They can repress the homosexuality, this, entering a religious group, or in some religious order, I think that in this case, the same thing happened to this boy
And I think that in the end he repressed his homosexuality, entering in another institution
Until he left.
That is about marriage
Repressed his homosexuality getting into marriage.
That's another
And when did you he discover that he was homosexual?
I think that he discovered it when he was in the monastery.
In marriage how did he fake it?
Sore, what happened well after, since he had created his, his sexuality,
It didn't work very
He got into a religious crisis, because he said that he didn't see God anymore, and so,
I couldn't see his face.
After that, he decided to leave, quit, leave the monastery, he met a girl and he was younger than him, a lot younger than him
And he got married, the touch.
It's like, how?
He married and then I don't know.
Sure, he got hooked, he was married, and all of that. After that, he realized that that's not him. Do you understand?
I believe he should see this
And
Try the religious diversity too, he should try with a Muslim or a Buddhist or a Catholic or a Jew
But always from the opposite sex?
They could change and mix, no, we are talking about if religions unite or dived people, I mean,  we have a pretty good catalog
I had a friend that was trying zodiac signs, a Gemini, a
Sure
Cancer, Libra
None
I don't know how did it go or if she got the twelve zodiac signs, but I don't
Sure.
It was a pretty interesting experience, I'm sorry, I interrupted you
Sure, no, I can't think of, there are so many forms of, you have zodiac signs and then you can have
Constellations and then other horoscopes that always have. You have constant resources to keep on trying.
Sure
Or looking for alternatives right.
The homosexuality is something kind of fascinating, right.
I think that the interesting thing is the transgression.
Sure
I ask myself sometimes, if religion can't be a transgression,
None
You don't talk about that. Until it comes out in the newspapers, no, the
Sure
The terrible news, of what they do. But generally everything is covered there right.
Now in other religions do you know if homosexuality is allowed or do they discriminate against the homosexuality?
I have no idea, that's why I was imagining how it would be a a religion that would have as one of its selection criteria, the homosexuality.
I mean that, for, that- hello
Hello? I tell the
To belong to that religion, you have to be homosexual
Sure
As a value no like a
Sure
Is there any of that? We are already being delirious right.
No, no I don't think so, no, but I think that like sometimes, I find it contradictory, right, because there's a very discriminatory facade, I mean this whole issue of homosexuality
They let any kind of ideology, that goes against the values of my own religion, and if
Punctually the Catholicism, the evangelical values. Like for example, for me it doesn't have a lot of this,  much feeling and seems like they're
Absurd, like other things, the thinking of Catholicism and the liberalism, you know.
None
Or a neo-liberal doctrine, and what do I know, in Argentina, for example, this, education, no, in the religion to be a good person, and recently
Sustain a neo-liberal doctrine and screw with people to me seems more absurd than a homosexual inclination.
And it's much worse. Well, if you go to the priests, I don't think that this is prohibited or anything for the style. I don't remember if I saw this in a movie, or where it came from
This, it's a passage of the bible where they read that there were perturbing things. I don't remember very the world that they translated and said that, that these kinds of relationships are prohibited for this.
Since it appeared written in a part of the,
Sure
I don't remember if it's new or old evangelical.
Sure but these prohibitions. I also understand them as a way or a necessity of understanding of human beings to procreate
To sustain the system.
Sure
That has more of an economic connotation if you want.
None
That,
More than moral
But a large or big part of the economy ends up constructing the moral finishes. Building a part of the economy because
If you don't have a family that procreates and you have kids today, and society grows, then how will you sustain the system?
Sure and the marriage is also about that right. Is kind of
None
An economic pact. Let's live in just one house so that we both don't spend, let's
When I think deep down you end up spending more.
Really
I think so because you share expenses but you also do other things.
Sure
And if then you procreate there you screwed it up, because you spend ten times more.
Sure, the finances transform into something much more communal.
Sure, and I think that's why the topic of homosexuality is so difficult, and I don't know if it will get to be institutionalized.
And until it's institutionalized it won't be accepted, right. But
No. They are more conventional than I don't know what.
Sure, because there you have all the tradition that weighs more than any other thing.
Sure.
Yes.
And how is it going with your friend, since he discovered he was homosexual. Is he happy or?
Sure, I think that now he feels, he feels better. as it happens my friend shares the house with us. And sometimes look that it worries me because since I have a boyfriend.
Is like I'm scared that he gets the club,
You're scared that he falls in love with you? God, how complicated.
Yes, yes. But well, he can keep himself, he says he can separate things. But well, they are like, or that respect
That also, like one always stays like that with the idea and I believe that also is cultural that one stays with the idea and the doubt.
Regarding what, the homosexuality or
That no, like you always have that suspicion there, and what happens see if I go to Argentina one week, and I leave them alone.
No. It's like a challenge. Yes, I would be doubtful also.
I don't know if it's a cultural issue, no, that deep down the repressive thing emerges from me, understand
Would you leave a girl friend in the same situation?
I think so.
You wouldn't be scared to leave if a girl friend stayed in your house, however with him yes?
I think that there yes. I don't know.
There you would leave without any fear because your girl friend is loyal to you, or what's the deal?
Yes, I don't know, I don't know because in, concerning homosexuality there's also much of an issue of how, behavior like it, it's labeled
The homosexual is like someone more, more frivolous in the relationships, of more unstable partners
They like to try everything.
Sure, you understand, like they don't have a moral limit
None
It already transgressed everything, they don't care to transgress even the loyalty of the friendship, you understand.
Sure
So then I think that, that, and that.
You distrust, of that
Sure, look, and, I don't know, like I'm realizing now that I'm talking to you, see.
And what are you going to do on your next vacation?
I am going to match it with his vacation. I prefer to let my boyfriend alone.
You don't want to travel with your boyfriend.
See it No no no no. No no no.
That is a solution too right.
No, because it is when we travel,
It is to keep a
We are free, do you understand me? We consider an open relationship, it is like we give freedom to each other, to do good things that could interest us, and later
Could enrich the couple, do you understand?
Of course, I think that have a homosexual one can enrich the couple because you can ask a lot of question that others could not answer.
Of course, totally
I'll be back in like twelve minutes.
Hello?
Hello
Hello.
Good night, how are you?
I'm fine, how are you?
My name is Marco and I'm in Philadelphia.
I'm Roman, I'm from Argentina and I live here in Miami.
In Miami? I grew up in Paraguay.
Paraguay, have you been here for long?
I mean I grew up in Paraguay but I came to the United States about ten years ago.
Good, kind of, I came here seven years ago, I lived in Tennessee five years and a year and a half ago I came to Miami.
Okay.
I've been more
Religion, lets see. What is religion?
Which religion do you follow?
Oh, I really do not practice any.
Atheist, so.
Excuse me?
You are an atheist.
Not necessarily, Atheist is to not believe in anything, in any case, I would be more agnostic that basically means more, I believe in the possibility that
There's a superior being but I definitely, don't believe in the Catholic version, in any way it's certain in no way.
It's a little, yes I've seen, there are several different, I've seen several different
Culture, religions.
I've been to religious services on Sundays including the Unitarian services.
Yes.
It seemed really interesting to me at the beginning but, I went to the, during the summer, and during the summer they didn't do the
In the cathedral, in the bigger church
Yes.
They did it in a smaller place and it was more.
Where? This is in Paraguay or in Philadelphia?
No, here in Philadelphia.
Look at that.
It was a place that was more closed, smaller, with a small group of people who seemed fantastic to me. except at the end of the summer
We went to, they returned to the bigger church
Yes.
It had the feeling, the same as the Catholic, basically, obviously of being from Paraguay all Catholics, always, the first communion, everyone
After a time you see that the Catholic try to convince you every Sunday that we're all going to hell.
Each religion, no, yes, each religion
Everything, yes.
None
Yeah
I studied, and even more I studied at a high school in Tennessee Tennessee is a a very religious state and they were all baptist, baptists, or all kinds of catholic
Yeah
The truth is that each one that talk to you would want to convert you to their paths
Yeah, exactly
They wanted you
That you realize that it's they are the Christians that are trying to convert the whole world
None
Normally, there are other religions that you don't find yourself in the street with Buddhists who are trying to convince you
Of a, of a, or a Jew or anybody else that is trying to, only Christians
Yes, exactly
Yes, they are in every bus station they are handing out  pamphlets saying, you have to save your soul
You find your salvation in the church, please donate your money to 1-800
None
On, so on
Exactly,
It's
That's what bothers me about all the religions that
Yeah
My family is Jewish but I in reality, I participate in all the holidays but I'm not much, much of a follower
I really, what I remember in Paraguay, that the people are in
But
Theory, in quotation marks are big believers but, one thing is that you never see them behaving in a way it would be if they were really believers
They are going out, are sleeping with the wife of another, are drinking, are all, all my friends and the people that I knew
Were Christians there and of course, all are have sexual relations before marriage that basically means going to hell according
Exactly
According to the Catholic religion
Yes.
All those things, and now to top it off I had heard, I was reading a few months ago that the Vatican is
Is talking against the use of the condom
Exactly
Even getting to the point bold enough to say that the condom is not a way to
To prevent AIDS
Yes.
Maybe they are trying to go back to the times.
Old
Past to say
Ancient.
Ancient in no, the sex is bad, the you should never have relations with anyone except with your wife that doesn't happen, that doesn't happen since one hundred years ago.
The truth is that I don't know, it's a subject but I'm telling you, each person that is a follower try to take you take their
Opinion, to their path
Yes.
And I don't know if this happened to you
My path is best
But
Sure, my path is the best one and you don't know what you are talking about
Exactly.
Obviously you are not reading between the lines of your Bible, I don't know, I don't know, it seems to me that the worse, it seems very
I mean, they are two-faced,  they speak about the people,  that do things that they shouldn't be doing but you know that they are also doing that exact same things!
Exactly.
In, it's very, they are two-faced, very, yes, in the end the laws, you listen to all of it, you listen to what they have to say
Oh, you basically go to hell.
Pretty much
Oh, why complicate things? Let get straight to the point. We are going to hell. We are going to hell.
Yes.
Okay, I already understood
Yes.
We sing. In my opinions, it's just stupid.
Yes.
It seems important.
It was necessary, and it divided the world into several sections.
No and if you remember how it happened
We are
All the religions started with just one and then each prophet began to express his own opinions
Exactly
And they started to differ from the others
My God is bigger than yours, my God is bigger than your God.
Sure, but in reality
That was
We all forgot there's only one God.
It's really interesting, to me, it makes me, I remember that it's easy, the Christian and the Jewish God, for example
Is Jehovah, it's the same, the only difference is that Christians believe that Jehovah had a son that became human and he was God himself.
Exactly,
Theoretically, I like the same things. I met someone from the Bahai region.
Where's that religion from?
No, I don't remember, I don't remember where Bahani's are from, it's somewhere outside Chicago, I believe it's here in the United States
Yes.
They believe in the nine biggest religions of the world. The nine biggest religions have the same God.
Yes.
That because we are depending on the places that geographically and on the h, that's why they have such distinct appearances but if you look at the rules it's rather, ra, basically it's the same.
Don't kill; don't sleep with another man's wife; don't steal; don't lie. They are basic rules.
No, all the basic rules are followed by the majority of the world's religions
Yes, they are basically the same thing, the, what's different is that, that, how they interpret the edicts that simply depend on the
The geographic region that changes the appearance, the kinds of
Look at you
None
I didn't know that.
That is very interesting, it's a very interesting idea, that at least, the thing is, I don't I believe I believe a lot in the power of the
I believe a lot in the power of the human mind in creating a good story.
Yes,
To create a story, that's
And well.
A while ago it was a lot easier to convince people that if they didn't do what I, the king, said
My
Yes.
My boss is the superior king, go is coming and is going to burn your house and is going to send to the
Hell to all the family that's in the, in that way it was useful, religion. It's very useful in order to keep the rules
Yes.
To the people, to the simple ones, to the poor,
Yes, poor people as they'd say
Yes, it's
In reality it's more like a, the destiny that we all have.
I believe we create our own future
Yes.
I believe that we, each one of us, depending on the way that we live our lives, that's what comes up, what turns out from, the result of
Obviously.
Yes, and that's seems obvious to me. How is it that it's so obvious for, but at the same time, it is possible
That with this, with this Fisher thing, that they connect you with someone that so strongly believes in religion
Hi, my name is Eliana
Hi, what's up?, my name is Federico
Hi Federico, how are you?
Fine
Where are you from?
From Argentina
Oh, I thought so, how are you, is everything fine?
Fine, Where are you from?
Argentina
Where are you?
In Boston
In Boston, look at that
You?
In Philadelphia
Oh, do you know Mariana and Lety?
Who?
Mariana and L-
Yes, Mariano and Leticia
Mariano, Mariana, and Leti gate my friends.
Yeah, i know them, but they told me that, i started calling because of Martin, do you know him?
Martin and Soledad. You talked to them.
No, I talked to Soledad
You talked to Soledad right?
Look, and you?
It's been a long time since I saw Mariano and Letti
A long time since what?
Since I saw Mariano and Letti
I got Letti this week.
Hello
I thought it had cut off
No, Letti makes the best pasties
She cooks great
In the world. No, besides she makes the paties
I was saying the same thing.
Spectacular
Here I buy the pastry from La SalteÃ±a
Yes, here it is also sold in some places, but you have to go a supermarket quite far away
But hers are spectacular. It's more than the party, whatever it is.
Seriously, so
She fries the pastry, it is spectacular
I have to ask Letti for the recipe. They are divine. They came home. I was with an Argentinian friend of mine, doing an internship in the laboratory.
None
The twentieth of February which is a holiday, we are going over there.
Really good. You will love Philadelphia
Really?
No
Beca-
I don't know, maybe yes.
But
No, is good, I don't know.
Letti and Mariano told me that is more is a line to Boston, but you have it cleaner
And yes, Boston is much nicer and cleaner. The people are more pleasant.
Really, so much?
Nothing happens. Is not serious.
Obviously, no, sure.
You'll have a good time.
And also to know it
No, it is not Boston.
Know another place also. What are you doing there?
I'm a biologist
In the same laboratory?
N the laboratory below Mariano I did my PhD
Yes
I already know Mariano, because up there there's a bunch of Argentinians. In reality, there aren't a bunch of Argentinians. No, because there some Spanish guys live.
Mexicans, and, Paula friend also in common, works in, in that, in that center. And nothing, that they all know each other, we all know each other there from Argentina.
Sure
The only bad thing Mariano has is that he's a supporter of Velez
None
That's a very serious problem that he has.
Wait a second, let's see there if, no, because I'm here with a friend
Yes
That was chatting with her husband in Buenos Aires. Poor her, my computer turned off. So ihave to put it to
Man, and how long did your friend come for?
She came for two months
My sister also came for two months to do an internship
Also biochemistry or biology?
She's studying biology, she's in the process of
Sure, wait.
None
Wait five minutes.
Yes
No, I tell her, to wait five minutes to turn on the computer.
None
Well look, and you are married, because I also talked with another girl, who was married with a biologist, and I don't know if it's your wife.
No
From Mar del Plata. No.
From Mar del Plata, with Ines.
Guadalupe, something like that.
No, Ines is from Mar del Plata.  But Ines, is the biologist.  She's not married with a biologist.
Yes, it's true, on Mar del Plata, she was a biologist.
Sure
Soledad, is the one that's not a biologist, and she's married with a biologist.
Exactly. I, now I'm doing the Post Doc in the laboratory where Martin works, Soledad's boyfriend.
And what is it about?
Embryonic develoopment in mice.
Yes
More or less.
Look at that, that's good
What do you do?
I do pharmacogenetics.
No, I did my thesis in the pharmacology department here in Penn
Yes
No, and now I moved to the embryonic development.
What do you like more?
No, in development, that's why I moved.
Really?
Yes, there I pulled about the pawn of my thesis I had done one
No
A little work with zebra fish, but I worked with some proteins, and some receptors of
Yes
And then I did some experiments on zebra fish and, and I moved to the embryonic development.
Not me--my approach is more clinical than anything. No.
Okay.
Population studies, some control cases, and measure some Nipps variation, in the genes
And where do you do your work?
In TAP, TAP University.
Yes.
There, in a building dedicated to nutrition
None
More than anything, my thing is pharmacology. Since pharmacology is where the drug that decreases the cholesterol is more than work in the laboratory
Of, cardiovascular illnesses
It's all right.
So, we've met for sure
Do you know any more Argentinians in Boston?
Yes, a lot of them, for a moment. He's a boy from Philadelphia. He's Letty's and Mariano's friend. Oh, yes - lots of them live with a friend
Yes
We met in school and, we have a lot of biologist friends
Who, for example, biologists?
Estani, Miguel.
Estani? Oh, yes. I know Estani.
He's my best friend, yes
Really?
Yes
None
Why
I don't know if Estani will remember me.
I don't know, lets see, and Miguel too
I didn't, I met him at some meetings, I'm friends with one of Estani's friend.
Who, Barbara?
Gabriela
Who? Here in Boston?
No, here in Philadelphia.
Stani is leaving on February first, he's going to live in Buenos Aires.
He's going back?
Yes, he's going back.
That's fine.
Yes
And have you met Sebastian?
Sebastian?
Sebastian
No.
No? Sebastian
Sebastian, no. I don't know any Sebastian
No? And well.
Maybe I do, but well, I'm so bad at
There are many of them
None
Argentinians
Yes, I Paula, biology, Laura biology, how old are you?
Twenty-nine
She's thirty four, thirty six, Stani is
Sure, they are of different generations
If you are twenty one, biologist, do you know Nicholas?
Yes
Nico is here.
Yes, look at that.
I worked with here with the monkeys
Luciana, but where is Luciana?
No, she's in Buenos Aires but she's working in the lab that I used to do my doctorate in digital genetic prints, in the pharmacy and biochemistry school.
Luciana does population studies with monkeys, primates.
She wanted to start doing paternity tests to those monkeys.
Yes
She came to my lab to, lets say, my,
Where in Boston was she?
No, no, my lab in Buenos Aires where I did my doctorate.
I see, yes, I was a good friend to Luciana. When we were studying
None
Yes, in fact, she was my best friend's girlfriend.
I see, which one, I know everything about Lu.
Yes, really, Nacho's.
No, I don't remember that one, I'm Marley, so bad. She's now married to Maxi
No, is she married?
Yes, she got married last year, I was at her wedding.
Oh wow
Yes, it was  huge.
No, well, I didn't know, no, no because I haven't seen here in a while.
You see.
I came here six years ago
Sure, you left as soon as you graduated.
So, yes
Are you staying here? What do you think?
I don't know, I'll see what happens
That's fine.
Where? I don't know.
I really
I have no idea
I want to go back.
Where? To Buenos Aires? And do what?
To bueno- yes. I have no idea, but
We are all in the same
I came to a conclusion.
Yes, what's your conclusion?
This new year. I'm going to, we have a, hold on, stop
Yes
It's incredible how with the Argentinians, the conversations I have here at Pennsylvania are much deeper.
Why?
I don't know, for something we Argentinians have, we can talk about deeper things, you know.
What do I know.
Well. It doesn't matter. This is another thing. But, anyway, the new year. I stopped and decided that my life, I wasn't going to be ruled by work, you know.
That where there's work I'm going to live.  I'm going to live where I want and then look for a job from there.  If I don't have to work in biochemistry or science anymore, I won't.
I don't want to live in a, for example, Boston gives me all the opportunities, but it's really cold, it gets dark at four in the afternoon
I have to live with a roommate because I don't have enough dough.  I can't have steak, and all these things.  Why do I have to live in this way?
But how long have you been in Boston?
A year
A year and you already complain so much?
No, it's not that I complain, it's that I don't end up liking the rest of my life, this style of life
Well, in Buenos Aires it's good, it's not cold like crazy to the end of the month.
They don't pay you, no one
The subsidies too, and they are three thousand dollars, for years, to investigate, that more, they work you in the street,
No but this is why I say, but you
You get kidnapped, express
Sure, oh yes, that's
You are there, and I follow you
No,  but oh well
They catch you and they put the money in a corral.
No, there are thousands but
The devalue three hundred percent.
Okay, no that's the
No, so
That's understandable, it's like you decide what to do, I rather feel a little bit of a danger that to the weather, my friends, my family, my people
And the warmth, all of that, but did you see? I'm saying this today but I might not
We miss a lot of things
In the end, if you'd still be there you'd be complaining and here you have covered all your needs, do I make myself clear?
HOW?
No, I didn't. That you now miss things that you left back in Argentina.
Yes
Those are small details that you miss
Yes
I don't know, the people in Buenos Aires, they spend their lives complaining that they don't have enough money to reach the end of the month, that money is not ebnough, that
They can't go out to, what do I know! They can't the last week of the month, they cant' buy anything, they can't
Go out to eat,  I think that the economic topic, bothers.
Yes Sure
I've been here already six years
Hello, my name is Mirian.
Hello, Mirian How are you doing?. My name is Karina.
Hello, Karina. About the topic, Do you think that we women are abused?
Well, in my personal experience fortunately not, I have not gone through that experience, but I think it is a problem of
Contemporary society right? And, how good,like many times there is a taboo or an education in relation with certain things that we donÂ´t talk about
It is a little bit complicated, to find a solution right?
But there is a lot of information, about the women should not be abused, police force now protects a lot women, before it costed a lot
It costed a lot for the police for example the domestic violence it costed a lot for the police to intervene there were trials and lost of money and all that.
To take into account women rights right?
Of course.
Do you think that even so, women are abused? Even with all that information, with all that
Yes, I think so Because the, the
Yes, right?
The training and education in relation with the laws that, that now act in a more direct and efficient way. No, what they do is to protect women
Women but I don't think they avoid it to happen. No, so is like the defense law give to women, a security, that if she makes the report
She is going to be heard, but I donÂ´t think that will prevent domestic violence So it looks to me that women are less afraid, they go to make the report, time ago it did not worked that way
The legal system, or the police turned a blind eye. The woman felt like, if she made the report it was worthless
It was worthless, of course and gave the man more power
Of course
They were afraid.
You thing that anyway this is somehow related to the social starta
I think it is. The pure American hits his wife, it's often seen, he hits her. The Latin hits his wife.
None
Third world people hit their wives also, but now we are going to see in the ... I think it more often seen in the
Third world countries. They take women as second class or something like this
Sure because you think that in culture there is a big gap
A bog what?
A big gap, I mean there is big lack of education in the Latin countries, there is a lack of
None
Of conscience of that problem, maybe because the Latins are more chauvinist, it could be so,
Yes, and not only because they are chauvinist, the culture is like that, women is intended to be in a second term
Because in those countries women are, submissive to men and have nothing to say
Right, it's like she is educated to bear it
Poverty as
Not just, a marriage that may not be due to love or whatever, but everything that comes along with that man, right?
None
I think it's hard to revert situation because it's a cultural matter.
Promote new laws being created, about it, but you have to sensitize women, right?
Yes
I don't know, like educative programs or something like this, that
I once read a psychologist that said: The woman in any part of the world
None
Have the Beauty and the Beast complex
Beauty and Of what?
In the
The beauty and the beast complex
The beauty and the beast okay, because she says that with our love we with that story and all the fairy tales
Yes
Believe
That we can change
That, change my love she will give, I'm going to give the beast a kiss and the beast will reason as
Such a beautiful prince. Like we expect but doesn't know that, in the real life the beasts that we have become more beasts when they are already old, Right?
Sure, one
Also with so much abuse that the woman has put up with, sometimes she looses her spirit and all that then she says that: they shouldn't teach those fairy tales to the woman when she's little
Fairy tales, of The beauty and the beast
Yeah
No, I stayed thinking about what you were saying of... is true, the woman woman perhaps has this illusion that even though the things are bad and
She can change him right
Up to, up to what limit accept Right? Something that is bad.
The matter is that it is not about up to what limit you accept, what happens is when the woman
They are not doing it anymore, women feel they have no value and she knows that she has rights but she doesn't know that just for being a human being she is worth
None
Her self esteem is low.
Sure
She doesn't know when if she's going to say no, sometimes, women I don't know, in our mother's years, they had to withstand this until their deaths.
None
How many of them left their husband, just a bunch of them got divorced
Sure.
Women are more rebellious now but they still accept those things, the abuse, maybe men can't abuse them
Physically but they emotionally abuse them
Sure, that's why, there should be some limits
It's tough
No? sometimes it's not that much physical violence, yes
I see
A bunch of other things that the husband does, what do I know!
I see.
Cheating or lowering her self-esteem, no?
Yeah
She should set a limit, that's why you were also saying, no
None
You think that with her love it is enough to make a change in attitude or you think that it's something fleeting or momentary
It goes on building the relationship. That cannot be. I also believe that another of the problems in relation to the issue of Family Violence is that
That also, it's like a social marker, right? At times you are a bit ashamed to make that sort of complaint.
I think that perhaps if the woman thinks that this is wrong, I think that this was before
None
Not now, it's that the woman is more aware and will say, If you abuse me, and that's as far as it goes.
Of course.
You didn't see this information before. The police have the right to protect every citizen, including
The woman in Female Violence of course
Of course it's more the obligation, no, to defend
The obligation is
Yes
We have the right to be protected.
Of course
Every citizen, children everyone, right? So now there is a lot of information. I see lots and lots of information, I see community centers, I see pamphlets around, so then
I don't know if it's fear, perhaps one of the questions would be, should the Government make some law?
None
But I think that the law should be regarding little ones. The law should be educating, teaching men that this is not good, and teaching women that
Of course
When a man, when
It shouldn't let you
Grow up and if you are abused by a man or attacked by him and he says things to you that are not valid then, it should end. It's not love.
Sure
It's not love, you need to leave and don't let yourself be treated that way.
I don't know how the legal system works around here, no, the truth is that I have no idea, I don't know if there's a law or something that protects women against
That's it, yes, I guess. If a woman goes and reports this
There should be
The police should follow, they should investigate or something
Yes, the police have been in trouble for that.  There have been movies about it.
For not answering to this reports.
They thought that's just domestic violence and they wouldn't do anything, but there have been women that have been murdered by their husbands when the women tried to leave them.
They murdered them. And the police was not there. Why didn't they arrest that man if he had already been reported
They had reports about that man.
All of that so, as I was saying, they took the case, and the policemen are forced to protect the citizens, including the
All the members of the society, including the ones within families.
Sure, yes.
There it goes, in which State do you live?
I live in Washington DC. I work in Maryland.
Is it far?
From where?
Is where you go far from where you live?
No, it is close. I can take a train and it is twenty minutes from my house.
Very
I'm pretty close. And you, and where are you from?
What do they say?  I live in Toronto, Canada.
None
Yes, like I told you there's a lot of training, but I worked with a girl and she was really young.
They were hits from her husband
And she didn't want to recognize.
She didn't want to, she was scared, she was scared
And in the end when she trusted,
No because I don't know where the issue stayed
No
Even if she went out, but I told her: Do it, do it, do it. But, I also gave her pamphlets and all that, but after, there was one time here
Here in Canada it's often the case, around when a girlfriend leaves a couple breaks up. The woman left him from India.
Yes, and he?
So the woman went back to her house and the father received her and so the society, the man took it as a big offense.
In the Indian society, yes it's that.
Sure. Other cultures have other consciences, No?
None
Ideas that are a little more advanced and beyond his daughter. Want that it's his your daughter
Sure
He had her in his house, so the man said tha the felt really humiliated.  He went and bought a revolver.
Went to the house.  No one expected him to do it.  And, bam!  He killed at point blank!
The father, the girlfriend
After the father of the girlfriend died, the other sister died. I don't know how many were there.
How horrible! This was in Toronto?
It was a carnage. This was in Quebec, I think.
None
It was a horrible carnage. When I advised the girl, I told her: better not to put myself
No, sure. You made the association
It won't be that the husband. Yeah. It won't be that the husband says, she was telling me, and so I'm going to make carnage
Same. I have the impression that in Canada it's a little more community, that there are more laws than here in the United States.
Yes here still, for the moment everything more or less the police respond. They've seen really few cases
Yes it's like everything works pretty well, right?
There are some small cases they've seen. There are cases they've seen of corrupt police.
Not as much as in the United States, because I think that the United States has a lot, right?
Yes, I think so.
But a few cases have came out that really strongly resonated
Have you been in Toronto for long?
Ten years now
Ten years, do you know how long I've been
Yeah
I'm going there in February because i want to work there
That's good
I'm going to Wester Ontario University
Right
Which i think is two hundred kilometers away, right?, from Toronto
Ontario, maybe, yeah, inside Toronto, in Ontario
Inside too
Right, it should be outside of Toronto
In Ontario
Yeah, i don't think it's too far, and where will you reside?, right there at the university?
I'm visiting now, and I have to pass the interview, I don't know if the job will work out, but I'm very hopef-
Right
Regarding Canada, I have been there several times.
Right
Good evening, my name is Maria
Hi, my name is Maria too
Oh yes
Where are you from?
Nice to meet you in Pennsylvania.
Me too
No
From Philaelphia
Philadelphia, and, where are you original from?
From Argentina
Argentina, i am Puerto Rican
From Puerto Rico, look at that, are you also in Philadelphia?
No.  I am here in Allentown.
It's near from here, right?
About an hour away
An hour
None
It's nice, right? Smaller.
Yes, it's nice
None
Well this, she said the topic is crime against woman.
Against women what do you think? I don't know what the laws are here in the United States actually
In my own experience
Look
I was married for awhile, with someone who was very abusive, I tried to call in the law, so that, I could help myself
Yeah
The law covered me but it didn't cover my children, or because the judge according to him thought that this that he never would try and hurt his children
Sure
Or rather, it's not covering us sufficiently, because the easiest way to become a mother is to have a child right.
Yes, and yes.
The laws do not offer enough protection for women.
Sure, but What is the law ? It covers or rather does it protect you, but it puts, the children
Well, let's go
He can continue being with the children, you say
Yes, nobody if they don't control, if not it has been.
Of control
Violence against the child?  In his opinion, no.  He would never hurt a child.
None
I understand but
Yes. But it's not like that, no, a person that's violent
It's not like that.
Sure. Sure, how terrible.
Always
Look. No, I didn't know anything. No, I'm not familiar with the laws here. I've been here for a little while
Compared to years before, yes it's
I didn't know
Gotten better, but there's still room to improve.
Sure.
Always yes, but So, how long have you been here?
I've been here for a year.
None
For a year, yes. But, I'm also here temporarily, that, I'm going to return to Argentina. I came for
None
For work. It's a two or three year job and
Well
After I'll go back, yes
None
For how long?
Always, since I was little.
Since you were born  since you were sma
Yes, I was in Puerto Rico, I studied there for two years but we have now returned.
I see.
Yes but I don't know because she doesn't have any options in the law here. She doesn't know them.
I don't know them, sure
How is it back there in Argentina?
In Argentina, I haven't met anyone that has that same problem. I think you can report it, and you have some protection but
I don't think you get too much, you listen to stories
None
Of violence and also of
Yes
You might, if it doesn't really hit you that hard, you get used to it, in fact, many people like the cold, they like the
Yes, because the consequences are always for the worse
Sure, they have to take a decision to leave
None
Because
Yes
I think that if you report it, then you can't go back to live at your house with that person
None
It's much more, but I think that it's pretty common, it's pretty common.
None
No, but the laws, actually the laws are like that, no, I don't know how they are
Doesn't know.
If they're very strict or not. I think that yes they should be able to accuse, and that yes they can protect you, to put an order, so that that won't get near, I don't know the name. Those orders
Yes they don't talk about protection, it's like the ones there are here.
For protection.
Yes
Sure.
But like I told them, the order of protection cover women
Just the woman and not the children
Not the children.
I have no idea how it is over there, either.
None
I think that we should be a lot more progressive
Yes, I would guess so because that
How is it in Puerto Rico? Do you have an idea?
It's more or less the same.
More or less the same
Yes it's more or less the same. It seems to me that the laws protect the man much more than the same wife
Yes, and it's that it's hard no, I guess, also to legislate it. Because how you do it, what do I know. It should be, where you put the limit, no, I don't know it should be
Those domestic things are very difficult to regulate.
They are difficult
It must be terrible, I don't know, so, it's not easy, they are playing with, what do I know, people's feelings, I don't know, it's weird.
None
It's weird, what do I know.
Well
I'm leaving and which part of Puerto Rico were you from, from San Juan?
Oh no, I'm from Fajaldo.
None
Yes, San Juan is the capital of Puerto Rico.
Sures, yes. I
Yes, it's a small island. It's one hour away from San Juan
None
Yes,
Sure, yes, it's tiny. Its surface is
Yes, pretty
Do you visit sometimes?
Oh well, the last time I was there was year.
That's nice.
I so like to visit. I have family there, so I do visit often.
Look, one of my friends is from Puerto Rico and she visits every year, she's been her for a lot of years, like seventeen years.
Everytime he returns, he wants to go live in Puerto Rico, because he says it is so nice and the people have so much vibe.
Yes, beautiful.
Is another history that here no
Yes, but now one goes, and it seems as if you were here because everybody speaks English.
None
Almost the same.
Sure
You don't notice the difference much.
That's true and how is that issue, because now the situation exactly of Puerto Rico, how is it, Is is a state?
That there's always been that deception that they have there, there are people, the old people of Puerto Rico that think that it shouldn't be made a state
None
The younger ones say that yes.
Sure
Let's say that they see it as a state now
They are comfortable like that.
Okay. Yes
They have certain privileges, but they continue being quite independent.
None
Yes, is weird. What happens is little by little the American culture is getting in.
None
Go, like you say, that everything
The culture has changed and affected us
None
Already is not the same as the one before. Before there was more culture, though that always happens when one gets out off
Sure
There goes another country
None
Whatever, but now Puerto Rico itself is not the same anymore. The culture has changed a lot.
Sure, the young people must be totally different to what they used to be Sure
Before I remember that my mom or my grandmother would talk to me, and one would lower the head. Now the five year old babies that look one in the eyes, and tells you, what?
Sure
Yes
Good things come in, but also the others come in
It has changed a lot.
What are you going to do. And the English like that, everybody speaks English.
Yes, in the school, in the street.
In the street. Look, how strange that, right. But they keep speaking both languages right. Spanish also.
Yes
None
That is just more, is quite modernized
None
It's modern.
That there are words like that
Yes.
New and that, but how is it?
What?
Modernized?
Modern, yeah
None
Modern
How funny, look at that. It must be a very interesting transformation. You seeing that you go once a year right, or each whatever.
Well yes, it had been a while that I hadn't gone, and I went last year
None
Before that, there were three years that I hadn't gone. And each time I go to the island, I see some incredible changes.
Sure
I stay
To come here is also much easier now right? Is like they have, much more rights to work, and to
They have papers. If you get out of Puerto Rico
Well yes, because we are citizens, we are born citizens.
Sure
None
Sure, yes, because you see a lot of people from Puerto Rico around.
Yes, it's very different.
Around here
Because you all have, you need pass papers and passports. Even though I have, I have passports for my children.
Sure
But because I've always liked having one; but that hasn't been necessary like other Hhispanic countries because they need
Sure we need a passport and visa
Papers
Or rather, in order to get a visa, you have to go there, in Argentina, Buenos Aires, to see the consul, they sign it for you
None
They check into your past, it's a whole process, it's not easy, they will give it you, but you have to do a
Yes, I imagine that
A week of trials.
I would think that if Puerto Rico becomes independent, we would arrive at a point where we would have to do the same--to get a visa. I don't know how it would work.
Sure
But in the meantime, nope.
How many years, was it like this, with the visa?
What?
Way back, before all of this, being part of the United Sates, was it like this having to get a visa, like everything
No, it's always good, to my knowledge, it has always been like that
None
I don't know, yeah, no. They've never been completely independent, they have their flag, this flag has a...
Sure
A star right? Like the United States one
None
But their, the two
Look
Yeah
I didn't know that, i thought that they had been for some time
What?
They had just become independent, but I thought they were before.
No, no, not to my knowledge
None
I don't know that much to bring history, but never
They never were
Or from my grand mothers, i never heard anything different
None
It was because the United States went into Puerto Rico
Sure
Yes,
Look at that, right?
Yes, it's interesting.
It's very interesting
I'd be more about finding myself, my past
Sure, but it shouldn't be
Because, what?
So hard to find a littl about yourself, right?
No, it's just going on the Internet and looking
Sure
Yes
Are you with your family here in the United States?
Well, my mom, my dad and my brothers, my husband, they're all here
None
My aunts, my grandparents passed away. They were all in Puerto Rico
Sure
Lets say the rest of the family
Sure
It's all there
The closest are here and the rest there
Yes
They are all there in Allentown?
Almost no, almost all of us are here, but we are all scattered in New York
None
In different parts of Florida.
They are warmer
Yes every once in a while I tell my brother to send me a little heat.
And now the cold started. I don't know how it is there, but here is really cold.
Let's see if it comes. Yes here is cold. Yes.
Yes, yesterday it snowed a little, and it already started.
See, we still haven't gotten the snow.
No, here, like some wind with a little bit of snow. I don't know if it will pile up but yes, last night it snowed.
Is cold
Yes the truth is that the ones that are in Florida
None
Are to be envied.
I can imagine
In Puerto Rico also.
Yes, in Puerto Rico is hot too.
The whole year is hot, right, there?
Yeah, it's tropical
That's nice, that's nice
Yes, it's tropical.  We're great there, the frog that only exists there in Puerto Rico.
Look at that
Yeah, it's called Cosqui
Coqui
It is a very little frog.
What color?
I imagine it's green or brown.
None
Because sometimes they show it as brown, sometimes they show it as grey
Look at that, they go around the houses? Everywhere?
But it's very little. You can hear it outside, when it's raining and at night
That's nice
You can hear it singing all night
Luca.
Hello?
Yes.
Hello, Jorge from Los Angeles.  Sorry, whom am I speaking with?
I think we already With Luca spoke once.
You, Luca
Tamara is my name.
Yes, how are you Tamara?
Fine, what happens is that I have a nickname.
A pleasure talking with you. Well, the topic is all yours - the violence against women.
Yes, exactly, but I don't know how the laws from here in the United States are. You, you, have been here longer.
Okay.
If you ever came across with some kind of trial of those
No, but, I've never come across one of those trials but the laws are very  tough in general
Yes.
When you talk of all types of discrimination or whatever, especially against women.  Isn't it true?
Yes, I can imagine.
What are the laws? I forget the questions that they make, if the laws are tough enough and that's it basically, isn't it true?
Yes, I also don't know how it is, since here the trials are by juries.
Yes, okay, yes.
I know what you see in movies
Is very similar
Of course, so
Is very similar
And what you see in the movies is not so beautiful but
No, no, no, no
And it is also the whole issue of sexual harassment and it is very
That one, is it the subject of the day sexual harassment against women?
Yes, the subject of the day is the law: if it defends properly or not the women, but the truth is that, no
None
But what I do know is that when you go to work, let's say. All the training courses and those things that you make
The first day of work, they include a lot the issue of, the sexual harassment
Of course, yes, very serious.
The, sexual harassment and harassment and all that, so I imagine that all the men have it below the surface.
Exactly, yes, it does not looks that there is more emphasis here than in Argentina, that is what I see, right? what I remember
Yes in Argentina the issue is that there is not, there is not much justice in general, whatever, that is the whole issue, I donÂ´t know if you
Were in Argentina or saw the news what happened was the Maria Soledad case, do you remember it? Right.
I donÂ´t remember that case.
Fine, The Maria Soledad case is a case, a very known case because it was involved the governorÂ´s son or the intendantÂ´s of
Catamarca that, so the girl was taken, they got her into a black party and, they drugged her and everything, and then she was raped by many
They killed her
Yeah
They left her, and all that obviously happened not, not unnoticed but they did silence marches, there all the topic of the silence march which didn't exist before started
A nun was helping her parents try to do justice, but it was the son of a governor.
The Saadi family was involved
Your friends?
I don't know if you heard the yes.
What did you say the family was called?
Saadi.
Yes
Well.
Okay, is, yes, okay, finish and then I'll, I'll ask you a question
No, and all that then it was a known case but, but the laws are not for, for the women, they are for the one who has money in Argentina, but is a topic in general
Well, unfortunately, yeah, yes. In what year did it happen, do you remember?
In ninety three, I think.
Ninety three
Yes, and that was a girl from a family not at all powerful, but it was sort of middle class
In the Catamarca society
From the Catamarca society.
Then
No? A girl, was finishing a private school tell her I'll call her later
What happened was that the son of the governor in the party said he abused her.
Yes, and it was a big party.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. But, basically all the, all was, was basically directed to mainly accuse the son of the governor.
Yes, because he was the one that was there.
The girl said she died at the end, right?
Yes, the girl died.
The girl died because of the Argentinian law.
Yes.
No. At the end of the case, was the governor's son accused or not?
The one that was locked up was the one that, let's say, her ex-boyfriend, who was like the surrendered
Okay, yes.
Some of the governor's nephews, but no the son.
Sure, sure, sure.
Not all the people that participated nor the cops they caught, because the girl was in a hospital, because she had decomposed
Sure, I mean. She got to
And
To testify before dying?
No she didn't get to testify but the, the place where they took her they knew how to cover up the tracks where they took the girl to a hospital to
Since they couldn't revive her, the doctors or nurses that treated her said, throw her in that area.
None
Since there are many people put in this
Yes, exactly
They did not all fall
How incredible, good
So it's good,
So, this is very regrettable.
But well, yes.
It's terribly regrettable, unfortunately, sometimes injustice happens to whoever or also against whoever with, with people who are more powerful in the United States too
Yes.
The United States is not an exception. A few years ago, I think it was two or three years ago the trial
Decided and declared guilt if I remember right the details, it was a member of the Kennedy family
When I was a teenager,
Yes.
The, it's a cousin of John and and and, of John Kennedy, from the family
None
When he was young, a lot of years ago he had abused a young girl too, his age, when they were both
Teenagers
None
This issue was suspenseful for many years.
None
You know that the Kennedy family is a very powerful family in the United States.
Yes.
Then it was a few years ago this topic resolved itself,  and they were found guilty in the end.
Really?
In that case, yes.
He was imprisones?
It seems to me that they sent him, to the, to the jail, it seems to me that he is in jail, etcetera.
None
That was quite a few years ago.
None
It was many years to obtain justice, and basically it was, it was a case of, of, of sexual violence.
None
All because he was young, because he was a minor, they argued that he was a minor.
Yes
And, that, because he was basically a minor in the United States, it's probably the same in Argentina, they have other types of rights, and besides the
Yes, yes
Being a Kennedy he had a lot of money, and he had the best
Yes
Defense that he could have had and it's very unfortunate.
Yes, sure.
The reality of the sexual abuse against the women and the injustice exists nowadays.
Yes.
And has always existed. The reality is, when the person sometimes has more money, the law has more money.
Has more power.
Means more power, then the law I don't know, is bought, is bought, is bought
Agrees with him. Yes, sure.
And there have been many cases like that
Yes.
Apparently those things are changing nowadays.
Yes.
Nowadays each time the law is being much more and more and more hard against
The violence.
Against all types of people and especially those against sexual violence
Yes.
Against the women in the United States.
None
Luckily that's changing a lot.
It's good. No, and another thing that I saw. I don't know if it has to do with the day's topic, but is since
I work in a hospital and I always ask the girls that have kids what they did for, because there's not a lot of vacation here
None
And, no. The subject of pregnancy license isn't there
The what subject?
The one about license for pregnancy, for giving birth, for maternity,
Exactly, OK
No, they have to go back to work after one month
They can go for three months  to nurse or something like that, but no, it's without payment
That's, it's really, it's pretty crappy, a very complicated subject, yeah, it's true, because, because a woman
They have to give her the right to be with her.
Of course
Son for at least three months to immunize him.
Of course.
With breast milk
Exactly
But no, i don't know if that's a subject of the day, but yes
Well, no, but it has something to do with the discrimination part and all that, I'm not very familiar with laws in that way
Yes
I know that. I don't know how long does the law grant. I don't, I'm not sure.
Yes
I know there is sometimes, right? Of course
Yes, but for what I heard
It can be taken before or after, but I don't know how long it is
SURE, I'VE HEARD THAT, NO WAY, THE WOMAN WON'T GET PAID IF SHE TAKES THREE MONTHS
I don't know how it is in Argentina either, but I lived in Israel and when a woman had to give birth, I stayed the three months with her.
Son, the first three months she got paid
Hello!
Matias, how are you?
Hello, hello.

Everything fine Carlita?
None
Everything fine?
Yes, I'm with a little girl that's going to fall off the stairs. There she is
Everything calm?
Hello

None
Everything calm?
There, I'm going
Carla.
Hello, what have I found here.
That you are with a girl?
There she is. Hello.
Is she your daughter?
Wait, i have the baby
Is it your baby?
Here we are, Hello?, how are you?
Is it your baby girl?, Is it your baby girl?, Is it your baby girl?
None
Is it your baby girl?
Present her
Your baby girl?
My baby girl
The one you're talking to?
It's not my baby girl, it's a friend's baby, my brother's
Look at that
It's my baby
Everything fine little girl?
Yeah, where are you living now?
Hi!
What's up Emma?
Carla
Where are you living now?
Hi Carla!
None
Everything ok?
Where are you living?
Philadelphia, in the Five Hundred Ten South Forty Seven Street. You, too?
Me too, what a coincidence, right?
We're in the same home
Aren't you living here? You're away, right?
I'm, yeah, you got there and here i am in Penn, I'm doing a
Uh huh
A sort of internship
Hi
The baby is crazy
Yes, she's laughing.
Let's talk about the matter at hand
We'll proceed to the subject, it attains us
Is that violence against women?
Violence against us women
And it's, i think it's completely justified, all these
Everywhere
And that
No, no, no, that seems to be pure maleness
They came out, but if they came out of a spank is because they deserve it, if not, we'd hit them.
No, i don't think so, i don't agree
Sometimes they make you mad, you want to slap them
Oh, no, because you don't
It's just a take your place slap to help you find your place.
No, because you don't
None
You don't
Yeah, it could be. Why not?
We have to kill you too
The thing is, no, you don't have enough strength, you say, right?, you're the weak gender, that's the problem
Listen
You'd do that too.
What?
Hit the man, if you were stronger
But men are evidently stronger than women
Sure,  that's the thing, right?, don't you think?
I do everything a man can. Let's see, sure.
Hello!
Hi
Yes, i got bored
It's just the baby comes on
Yes, yes, you bore me, baby
Tell me, hi
You bore me, I'm talking to you
There's a lot of people in this house. That's why the conversation is complicated.
And, could you go somewhere else?
Do you really cook?
The laws were good
No, I was saying that men are stronger than women. That's why women can't hit them, but we don't lack the will.
What can you say about violence?
What can I say about what?
Male, what can you say about male violence
Towards women?
Yes
None
I don't know, the laws are good, the laws of the United States too
I don't understand the question
Baby, what's wrong with us today?, what's wrong with us Argentinian?
I'm hearing you. I don't hear anything.
We are crazy.
You are crazy.
Crazy,
But what do you say of the violence?
Nothing that  what it said is, we discuss the laws,   I know that that in United States also the laws that protect the women.
I don't know the laws of the United States, I don't know them.
No, then give me your opinion about the ones in Argentina. You don't know them either.
I don't know them.
The Argentinian ones also.
The truth I also don't know them, but also I don't agree with the violence.
No, but of
Of the laws or not laws.
Sure, no. We don't agree?
I don't agree
We don't agree.
Do you agree? or no?
No, me either. I was proposing that for
To whom? a man that hits me.
Sure. No, for some law, yes.
A hitter?  I'd take him to a psychiatrist.
A hitter, a psychiatrist
Yes, he evidently has a mental problem, because hey, to hit her
To jail, right?
To hit someone weaker.
No, to jail, right?
Yes, but a mental problem. People who beat and kill have problems.
They've got problems, right?
... murder, they have psychological problems
Behavioral problems
The problem here is that they're leaving and you have to say hi
I think what we should do is
What
Let's say
What
The system should make it easier for a woman to report an act of violence like that, there must be places where a woman can call and have
There are in fact places
Assistance, right?, emotional
There are places
None
There are places.
Really?
But it's not very spread out
Sure, and it seems like it, no?
None
It will have to spread more,
Sure, this yes
No, battered women.
Sure
And
Sure, Wait until they're coming and I have to say hello. I'm also going to download some downloads
Yes, it could be this
It could be this, it could be this
It's really important. There will be a lot of battered women? That you're saying hi to someone? For me it's important a little bit since I don't know the battered women,
It's a difficult topic. It's a complicated topic.
Totally.
No,
Emma caught a cough.
She caught two
Yes, it doesn't matter. Tell me, have you ever hit a woman?
Tell me about your life.
Have you ever hit a woman?
None
Have you ever hit a woman?
A couple of slaps, but
Yes.
Yes
And you, And what you think that's right? I mean.
Have they ever slapped you?
For
Slow. One thing is a little hit, another thing is a beating. That, one second
I don't think any of the things go.
None
Now yes
Okay, sorry
There was a lot of interruption here.
I was saying hi to some people
Sure.
So, what else I hear you?
Today I had nothing. I went walking. Here in Philadelphia a beautiful day. Very cold, but a beautiful day
Nice day, right? Nice day God gave us
It is a nice day. A spectacular day.
Nice day God gave us
I live with my brother right now.
None.
We cooked rice croquettes
They are good
With a couple of things more, a lentil stew.Everything very tasty
American food is tasty
And now, I am having a beer that was left
The classical beer
Now I am the model
It's alright, good
It's a good thing
The black I like a lot
It is good
Black women, yes
You like black women, alright. I am black
I mean, I'm talking about the beer, are you black?
I am black
What a goddess
I'm a fine black model
Describe yourself
One meter point sixty-nine and a half
Seventy nine and a half
Sixty nine and a half
Oh, you could be seventy-one meters, right?
Almost seventy
You could easily say one meter and sixty
Sure. Black hair and skin, brunette
It's more
The truth is I'm beautiful
More
I'm beautifu
Beautiful
Yes, yes, yes
And lower
I'm very good. There I have a hundred
Go ahead, you like it
Yes, ninety five, a hundred, sixty three
Warm, it's fine, and I'm greedy
And they gave you a ninety-seven.
We went to hell
Oh, ninety five, around there
In front of the, I'll go back there.
That has a remedy,
You get love handles right in the side.
That's cute, a bit fat at the side
No, it's ok.
Those things happen
You get a belly, love handles
No, no, my belly is not that big because I exercise a lot.
You are doing a lot of excersise.
Sure, now that I'm here, you know, I was living in Argentina and there I can be healthy but since I'm in this country, the food is
Yeah, lots of fast food.
I don't really like the food
Junk food.
Sure, oily, very greasy, lots of fats.
You eat wrong
When I'm in my mom's house, I eat right. But when you eat outside, it's like that.
She cooks fine,
It's complicated
SURE, WHAT DO YOU EAT?
In my brother's
Yes
I eat noodles, meat, escalope, lentils.
And do you cook?
I cook really well.
That's nice.
Oh, my brother is a better cook than I, and he likes it
What do you cook? Do you know how to make cheesecake? I like cheesecake.
I cooked a tejero
Was it good?
Yes but the last time I cooked it was raw and stodgy
Shit, so, it came out wrong
It was by chance, I wasn't familiar with the oven
OH SURE, HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE?
But, well I'm on December thirty.
When

Yes, more or less, for the same date
Look at that,
More or less, and you return

None
Nor do I miss her, nor do I stop missing her much.
None
It's a normal feeling.
And is she alone? live, how many sisters do you have?
In general or here in the United States?
What,
In general, or here in the United States?
No,
In general
Yes
We're not five brothers
Sure
The oldest one is
You're the youngest.  You're the little one.
I'm the little one.
The most, also the prettiest
The aliens [...] Yes.
The prettiest
I already told you
And, what else?
I have a sister that's thirty, a brother that's twenty eight, another sister that's twenty six, it's her birthday today
None
A sister of twenty.
It's her birthday
Two and one of twenty one, i
You have some
I, Chiquilinda (pretty-small).  What a nice nickname, they
The cutie girl, because of being the youngest and cutest.
Look what a beautiful nickname you gave me
Right? How? What others nicknames could you
Good evening, I'm Joe.
Hello, how are you? Good evening, my name is Soledad.
Soledad, where is Soledad from?
From Baltimore.
Baltimore, I was born in Puerto Rico, but I live here in Colorado.
In Colorado,. I've never been there.
Are you from Argentina?
Yes, Argentina
Yes, I've had the chance to talk with several people from Argentina in this type of program.
Yes you are the Puerto Rican with whom I'm talking. I've talked with quite a few Colombians in reality, up to know.
Yes, yes
Yes. Yes.
And how are things there in Baltimore?
Fine, in reality I moved here not too long ago. at the beginning of the year. So like I'm starting to get used to the city, I'm not
Familiar still so to speak.
None
But, I like it for now.
Are you a student at the university?
I'm going to the university, that I still haven't started. I'm about to start in a few days. I'm with my husband, that he works here and well. I go to the university.
How nice.
Yes, we are, for now we are happy.
It is curious, because people from Argentina whom I had talked to, the ladies all of them, are at the university, have something to do with an university career America
Have their husbands too studying there
None
Yes, some are from Massachusetts, from Pennsylvania then now you are from Baltimore
We were living in Philadelphia. we lived there for Four and a half years.
Is there a?
It was time
An Argentinian population there? In that part of the United States?
Yes, we know some Argentinians around there, in Philadelphia, yes.
How good. the subject of today, is delicate,yes and I think that in, the law in the United States, protects a lot women, but there are some places
That, or some States that donÂ´t protect them as much as others.
None
Maybe they donÂ´t respect them. But here in Colorado women are very protected.
They are abused and nothing like that, but when those laws come for example, there are restrictions, like not being near them and that, but
Sometimes they have to base on things, little details, like the man has not done this or that.  They don't put pressure on criminals.
NONE
Sometimes things end in a tragedy.
Yes, it could be. I am not, I am not familiar with the laws related with violence in general. I know they are stable in all the States, but
It looks to me that many times, the, the major problem too, when there are cases of violence is the woman making the report, not, the
In the beginning, most of the women don't want to accept that somehow it is happening, or that they somehow believe the other person.
Will change, or won't do it again, not even once. Whatever excuse the other
Is using to manipulate them, right? Because usually, women are psychologically manipulated by another person somehow.
None
I think that they come from, that maybe one goes to where there have been violence, and maybe they consider it normal
None
Yes, and of course it is never normal but what I mean is that sometimes serious things happen.
It is that they have not been well educated about the matter
None
Ant the other is because of feelings to their wives, because I have seen cases in the TV about
The very tolerant wife doesn't want to break up the family because she is afraid of her husband. Unfortunately, those things end up in tragedy
Sure. Yes, you are right. Yes. About the laws. I am not very aware, but
About whether the woman dares to report or not, I think that after all, they usually have the chance here in this country
Of claiming for respect, and get someone to defend them
Well, one of the countries where the rights of women are more protected.
Is
I know, for some friend's experience and from my ex-wife who is from Mexico, that in many parts of Mexico
None
Women are usually abused and even now not given their rights.
Is it true, I heard in Mexico the women
Or
It is not easy to ask for divorce.
Society is very religious.
It is easier for him right.
Yes, it is very religious society there. It is like Mexico Catholic, and to get divorce there it is very difficult for a woman
But yes, there is divorce of course. What happens is that it is more. It is a mixture of that family, the church, the culture, all that stuff.
If not, the truth is that I donÂ´t understand, because it is not that I am religious, or that the church could defend in the sense that
Even with the divorce it is easier for a man that for a woman. So that is, I don't know, it looks to me so weird, no.
That yes, but here not. Here and it is, when there is a question of divorce
None
The other parts because they donÂ´t agree to be together, well it ends, and if there is a part that does not agree, and the other one wants, anyway
It ends. Here what they do is to send them to a class first, before taking that final step,
None
To see if they change their
Yes.
Of,in some states that is a must right?. Here in Colorado that is a must. if one of the two parts disagree, does not want the divorce well
They take them to counseling. They take the counseling as an obligation, to see if it is possible to do something. If not, well then it ends
The divorce proceeded
I have never heard about a problem of that style, how interesting.
Yes. I does help sometimes. but unfortunately anything can cause a divorce in this modern age. A
Fight, but not a physical fight, but an argument,
Yes
Can end up in a relationship. It is very easy nowadays giving up to anything. I am already tired, I don't want to keep
Married, so they divorce.
None
That, is too easy nowadays divorcing
Sure, I know what you mean
When you marry, the relationship is very deep.
Yes
It must be based on love and principles
Yes
Things must be based on understanding, respect, loving each other, and when these things don't work fine, then
Come all the other problems
Sure
But in a marriage, in any marriage, there will always be a problem. you have to get over it. I guess that you, with your husband, you can't agree with him all the time. Maybe now you have a
...harmonious relationship. Maybe in the past you had some fights, but you learned to work together?
Yes I think every couple has their own Code book, right? For instance we, I don't know, we never
Yes
No matter how angry we are, we never insult each other.
Right
So, since the first day we were boyfriends, that was eight years ago, so, we tried not to insult, so, I think that never was, never made such an insult, never.
Respect is very important. If you don't show respect for the other person, it's difficult.
Let's say Love without respect. No, no. I don't know. It is not love. No.
Exactly
If, also other things were watching at, at the university, I remember that in a class were seeing that violence was not only
Only the physical, but also the emotional.
Yes.
There is for example, the issue of insults.
Very destructive
None
There are many women who abuse men. There are even many women who physically abuse men.
It is fine.
For example, the typical teenager movie, whatever, that the girl saw the boy doing something she did not liked, and suddenly hit him, to me that is violence, physical.
Of course
It is that, and yes, if you see that the woman hits the man, it's like it's not so bad.
What happens if the man hits the woman.
Exactly, I see it the same way.
I don't see any difference. Even if you see with different eyes, the action is the same
I think the same. In this case, both should respect themselves, and if one of them break the rule, the two of them, are as guilty as the other
It does not have to see sex. If the person is male or female, the one who did it, in the modern society and also in the past.
Yes, the man does something thats more condemnable.
None
Yes, what the woman did. But, it's true. The, I've been in relationships where the woman has been, really insulting
And this demoralizes you a lot, and, it's destructive. Very destructive.
Yes, yes. It's very d- Never, I don't know, I think. I try to, I hope I never do it. I don't want to be in a situation either
Very limited, with my husband always. I don't know how to explain it. I never knew, I don't think I've done it. For example, to be with the other person.
I don't know. There are situations sometimes you can with a little limit.
Yes
That if an insult escapes. No, I'm not saying it's justified, I'm saying that it can happen and well, nothing happens.
The topic is that here, especially the young people, in this country, I see a lot, and in Argentina too, and from there we go and try to very
Very disrespectfully. So how it loses the value. I don't know, it mixes
It's a, something that contaminates
The things.
The relation between marriages and courtships is what's included in the business.
Inge
William Hello
Christian?
My name is William
William, how are you?
Fine and you? What is you name?
It looks like we are talking again.
How was?
You are from Miami, right?
Did I talked to you before?
Yes, I think so.
Are you Chilean?
Yes
Thanks to God I remembered Unfortunately
Inge
Inge, How are you doing?
Very well and you?
Fine, I am cooking, a bread-crumbed steak, tutun, rice, black beans.
Look how you punish yourself
Sure baby the more greasy the better, more energy.
The say so
Alright. What are we talking about today? because I was cooking my steak and I don't even know what the girl said
The woman said the subject was, where would you like to live? Do you like the outskirts, or the city? Where would you rather?
Where do you live now? Is it city or country? Basically that. I live in the outskirts, near Washington. In a small town, but not too big.
I have never been to Washington, but I've heard it is very uptight
None
It is very uptight up there?
I live close to Washington but not near.
Yes, and I never
I live about one hour from there
Have you never met President Bush around there?
No,
Hasn't he knocked on your door asking for the vote or something?
Not at all
Shit, what a bad guy!
Yes
With all the Hispanic votes he got
But
Was the name of your relative, Camila?
Camila?
No, I was wrong, It is that I have spoken to two or three girls
Really, have you talked to someone else from chile?
Yes I talked to three Chilean, that never happened before
I think I have met only offer a Chilean in my life, and by phone I have known three
Where do you live?
You want to talk about that I live in Miami
Do you live in the city?
Yes, the truth.
Do you like the city?
I love the city
Why?
Because there are many things, there is always something happening, there is people from everywhere, but well what can I say
Yes
I truly love the city because the beach clubs. There are beautiful women around the world in Miami. I went to New York and I went to Los Angeles.
I've been to Tennessee and many places in the United States. But everyone is in Miami, where I have never seen such beautiful women.
Women are very sexy. The only girl I met from Chile, a very pretty girl, of German descent
Okay
But she was very pretty
None
You should visit Miami some day
Yes I've gone a couple of times
You don't like it?
Three times I like the beach of course, very pretty, but I don't like the cities I prefer to live in the outskirts.
Three times. You like to live in the small towns
Yes I like to live in a small city, not too many people, not too much noise, full patio, full garden. I like that, I'm not a city person, I don't like it, I lived all my life in the city.
None
When I was little, the traffic and the people, no.
From what they tell me Santiago de Chile is quite a big city
It's very big and very nice, not that ugly, but honestly, I prefer the tranquillity with nature types of things.
Listen
I like to have my garden with flowers and such.
Then you like, spending a lot of time landscaping putting your little flowers and making them grow
Yes, exactly.
What a thing, that's a very nice thing in women, is a very feminine thing.
With my husband we are into peace and not night life
No
No, we were when we met, but now
I will ask you.
We do other things
Inge, I ask you something, How old are you?
I'm thirty five,
Twenty but you are young girl, you can still go out every now and then.
Yes, true. Neither of us likes to drink. We don't drink much. We are not too fond of it.
No, but you don't have to go out to drink to have fun. A couple can go out to dance from ten at night until five in the morning
Yes, but you know we have two small kids. then
But one, is what I tell you, every now and then when you can get a babysitter or whatever you want to call it. And you go out, because I think a fundamental thing in a couple.
Would be every now and not also do it like we used to do it when we were twenty years old, no but every now and then go out, and dance, and have a good time
Yes
Go out a lot.
Yes we have a good time
How long have you been married?
Five years, no, six years.
Six years.
None
How is married life treating you?
Very good
Very good, Where is your husband from?
Yes he's American.
But you made out good girl, just so you know.
I was lucky, because he's a very good person,
You know, we the Latins with the Americans, I think they can with us
Why?
I think they are a they have a more passive mentality
None
The Hispanic have more liveliness, more blood, we can beat them if we want
None
But no, if you are happy, it doesn't matter if you are American, Peruvian, Chinese. Nothing matters
I think it depends on the personality of the person. Because, I have never had a couple who was not, like, stranger, but I never had a Chilean or Latin couple
Never
No
No, I never
And
I had a lot of friends, yes, but as a couple it didn't work out
And so
Lets's say I never had
In other words, you always liked the Americans
No, I always liked the foreigners, They weren't chauvinist,which is important to me.
Now, tell me something, what is chauvinist to you? because every woman, or most of them have a different concept of the meaning of chauvinism
What is chauvinist to you?
It's not just one thing, I think it is a way of thinking, a way of seeing life. It is not one single thing
Explain it to me me so I can understand it.
For example, in my country men think that, having much experience and many women, and going out with many at the same time, they are a very macho man and they talk a lot this way.
Much dirty language, many things
And the foreigners.
What happened is that I studied engineering, so I was in an environment of men,
Okay
Then, after a time, you know them, they are friends. You know how they think, and how not everybody is alike.
But most of them are a little bit sexist
Then, I would not stay
Less flexible
Yes, okay. I would not be wrong by saying to you that American people and foreigners are much more flexible in treating a woman.
My experience is that it could be that not
You know
I would say that American and European women are in general, much more emancipated than Chileans.
Well see, I am going to tell you a thing, my wife, is American,
None
She is an American from Minnesota, now I am going to tell you a thing, I am going to give you an example,maybe. Two, I am going to give you an extreme example, see it.
When I was with Cubans or Nicaraguans, or with any Latin Woman, I told her I am going to go out on Friday. I'll come back at two or three. I am going to go out with my friends. We are going to go around and dance.
You are crazy, what do you think, do you understand me, that crazy thing, they broke a stick on your head.
None
My woman is American and I always tell her that I will come back in a few hours.
Well.
OK, I will wait for you until 3 o'clock. You know what I mean.
Yes
The problem for Latinos is the way we are raised as children, that it is not good for men to have a lot of women.
The men can have many women, as long as none of them has dreams of being wives, A man could have all the women in the world as long as they know it.
And you?
Is only a concept because I believe in my country. I cannot talk much about other Latinos because I do not know them.
None
In my country the men are individualists
What are women like?
They are the owners of the cows, in that sense
How are the women over there in your country?
Women are always trying to please man, dress nice,there is nothing wrong with that because everything is a game between women and men.
Okay
But the man is usually the King and the woman tries to please him.
Yes. My country Cuba is the same, but there is more equality
Yes
You see how things are in your country.
I believe that. I have been to many places in South America, the United States, and Europe
In the Latin countries women live as in the 50
Yes
You understand something like a trophy.
Exactly
When women leave their country and come here go all the freedom that women have here
What do you think about us when we watch TV shows such as the following:
Hello?
Hello?
Who am I talking to?
My name is Vilma
Where are you from Vilma
I'm from Bolivia and you?
Bolivia, I'm from Puerto Rico, but I live here in Texas, where do you live?
I live in Maryland
Way up there
Yes, on the other side
How did you end up there, man!
Yes, a lot of years ago. And you?
I've been here for over twenty years now.
Okay I've been here for about fifteen years
Yes, well, almost the same
Yes. Do you live in the cit or far away from it?
I do. I live about twenty minutes away from the city.
None.
I'm a bit close but not that much, and you?
Yeah, me neither, I live far away from the city. Where I live there's no public transportation.
Oh, how is your work?
I have to drive all the time.
OK how much time do you take to go to work?
Yes, it is about 20 miles and when there is no traffic I take about 30 minutes.
You like to live out side of the city right?
Yeah, well at first, when I got home from Bolivia, I would have loved to live in Washington because I used to live in the city.
Cars, people and everything but living in the city could be dangerous
Yes
I used to drive in Bolivia and then I came here.
The roads are the same. The truth is that I didn't want to drive.
I had to wait for my husband to take me to places, such as the market and things like that.
Yes
Once I started to drive, I began to work outside of the house. Now, I love it, because it is very simple and calm.
The neighborhood, it is truth that when we arrived there were not many Latinos , until now there are very few Latinos that live here.
Really?
None
What about you house is it closed or very far away?
THERE IS A LOT OF HOUSES IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD BUT THERE IS NOT PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION NEAR THE HOUSE.
Well it is an old town, which is why they don't allow public transportation.
Yes
To, like five minutes away from my house, you can take the bus that leaves at like six in the morning and that takes you to the metro.
Yeah
There's only one at six, and the other one is at night, at six. And that is all
Do you have children, Vilma?
I have three
How old are they?
My children, the older is already twenty-five, and the other, small one, is twenty.,
I wasn't going to ask you to move to the city. That is what keeps me outside the city, having my children. My kids right now are
None
Now my girl's thirteen, and the boy he's already nineteen, but when they were smaller,
None
Influenced me a lot to live outside the city.
Sure that's the truth. When we came here at the beginning, we came to Virginia, the first year that we were here.
None
The truth is that we were a little scared,
None
Well, to move us here, far enough away from the city, more than anything it was for my daughters, because they were just so small, and I didn't want them to have to grow up in that kind of environment, that
You know, that sometimes they go out and you lose your influence.
No, sure, sure. Exactly. But and everything, not that they're already older.
But
If the opportunity presents itself of moving closer to the city would you move?
Don't think so. But you know what. From what you say, it seems to you that it was far, but is not, because Washington
The capital, driving is thirty minutes from my house.
None
Yes, i could find a job in Washington.
But not move to live there. No
Yes, when I moved to this house, the things were very remote, but now is like the city is catching up to me.
Exactly.
So
You're right, because here the same thing is happening. When we had just moved, there was a lot of space, I even think there were mere farms here.
But now if you see, everything is construction, It has totally become populated, that
Yes, yes.
Imagine that perhaps from now to a few years, they will decide to put, public transportation
Yes, yes. They most probably will. They are progressing so much
Sure
The street before mine is where the transportation comes up to.
So you don't drive there in Texas?
I don't go on the bus anywhere.  I've always driven.  Although it is the next street, it's quite out of the way.
It is not like that in the neighborhood
None
It's like ten minutes.
OKAY
In, between street,
I see
It far away to go by foot.
Okay
For example, my son, he's looking for a job but he can't go there until I buy him a car.
None
I'd have to drop him off pretty early in the bus so that he could go somewhere.
Are you old enough to drive?
Yes, he does drive but he does not have a car
None
Yes, he had one, I bought him one but he had an accident and he totaled the cars son, no, I haven't bought him another one. I told him
Yes
I thought he wasn't ready for another car.
Sure. You live in the city's outskirts because of the danger?
They were born here but since I got here I'd always tell myself, oh
Stay out of the city.
None
Because of the schools I'm used to it, but it is quite far away. It takes me around
Thirty, forty minutes to get to work.
Driving, yes.
In the morning, driving. Yes, it's twenty-seven miles away, but with the traffic
That's the problem.
Yes, it makes it
That's why I leave super early. I leave my house at six thirty. Then I avoid all that traffic, and that
Yes I leave late because I take my daughter to school at eight and then I go to work at nine.
So you live, you work in the city?
Yes
In the center
I work near the downtown area of Houston
Oh okay. I can imagine that the traffic there must be terrible.
Terrible. I've had to learn all the little streets that go by the back
None
To be able to get to my house, when I leave here. because in the morning there's not much work arriving because I already, leave quite
Late.
Yeah.
When I leave at five, five-thirty from here to get home, I have to look for other little streets that take me
If not ,it takes you two hours.
And sometimes those streets because everybody starts to learn about those streets and then continue.
Yeah
Going out to other places
The only,disadvantage is that when it snows, you can delay any quantity, it can come up to the house.
Yes, here.
Above all if it's a heavy snow.
We don't have snow here, but we have a lot of water when it rains. It floods
Floods?
We have a lot of floods. Yes, and they don't let us go out because of the floods. It will be two in the afternoon and I don't get back to my house until seven at night.
Wow
Where I wanted to be, the water was really high, so I couldn't. In the end I had to.
You're talking about the recent ones that they had this, this past year?
Yes. And this month we haven't had it like this, but last year we had a lot like this. And I gave myself up in the last one, stopped in
A gas station, and I stayed there until the water went down.
Wow. And tell me something, and once your
Yes, but
Your kids get out of high school, will you move or do you want to keep living there?
I just bought this house six months ago.
Yeah
So,  I'll stay here until I die. Because I hate to move.
Yes, truthfully, I feel the same, I don't like it at all
And the thing with this house is that the elementary school is
None
It's behind the house.
None
I'm thinking about the future, when my children get married and have children, they can bring their children to go to
School there, they can come to my house.
Yeah
I've thought about all that
You're really thinking about the future.
Imagine that, my daughter's thirteen, and my son doesn't even have a girlfriend.
My oldest is twenty five
She's still
She bought her house last year and she moved out
Yes?, that's good
That was sad.
That's good, and what do you work in?
I'm sorry?
What do you work in?
I work for one of the counties here, of the school
None
Yes
You work directly with schools or
We work directly with families. We sign up all families that come from all over the world that speak a second language
People born in another country signs up on the county i live in, or the one i work for
Oh, so you're practically with the government.
Yes, for the government. Do you work for the government, too?
No, I'm with a private company that rents tanks
Ok
The tanks that carry beer or
NONE
Or
Yeah
Chemicals, or different places, so, it's a private company, European
That's wonderful
Yes, and how did you find out about these studies?
One of the counselors at my work let me know and i signed up. I find it interesting, because you meet people from different countries
Yes
That are in different states
Yes, i have been talking to a lady from Chicago
Oh yes?  Can you get to talk to the same person again?
Yes sometimes the person that they put you with.  they pair you up with a person, but I've gotten the same one twice.
How nice.
You know
No, the truth that I, this is the second time, because the other times that they've called me just happened I was doing something important, and I can't talk
Then
Yes
The previous time I spoke with, that I don't even remember his name, a guy from Paraguay I think, I don't remember. Sorry, what's your name?
Yes, Lurdes.
Lurdes.
Lurdes, yes, from Houston, Texas
Okay.
None
Hello?
Good afternoon
Yes, good afternoon. My name is Gloria and I'm from California
Hi how are you? My name is Mauricio. I'm in Charlotte City in North Carolina.
Nice to meet you
How are you?, fine?
Fine, thank you
The subject is cool
None
About the city
Right
I like to live in a quiet city more than a smaller city
None
I'm out of the gym now and that doesn't have a lot of noise.
Right
I would like a smaller city. I think that the one I'm in is a pretty small city. The part I know is quiet.
Although I've seen other cities like that, around Charlotte, that are of a more like, more country-like style, right?
None
None
None
I was even living in Miami, but we decided to come here searching for peace also.  Searching for peace.
None
I think that the best for me and my family is a small and peaceful city.
None
I don't know for you.
They used to live in the country and more isolated from the city.
Yes.
Because of the studies and all that, as I grew up I had to decide already, so to speak, to be in the city where there are more opportunities, right?
Where are you from?
I'm from Guatemala
Is that Mexico?
No, Guatemala, in Central America.
Guatemala
None
Guatemala.
Aha, and for the studies, I had to go to the capital city.
Yes.
Where everything is very different.
Yes.
Up the kind of people and everything is different, right?
Yes.
They go on adapting themselves to the environment and to social frictions. The house of my dreams doesn't have any.
Illusions because I know that maybe it will be fulfilled sooner or later, but I don't like wealth, let's say it that way.
Yeah
No, I like emotionally, sentimentally, and economically, not like a millionaire, but enough to pay for the necessities, right? And, yeah my dream house of course I would like it
Yeah, of course.
That way in a remote place like in the country
Yeah.
I don't know, I imagine it like a paradise.
That's cool.
None
My house and my dream, in a little quiet tranquil place like a field
At the same time close to the city where
Mm-hmm.
You suppose is the source of employment, right?
Yeah, it's like that.
That's my dream.
Mm-hmm.
I had it in Colombia, but because of the problems there with public order and threats of guerrilla warfare, we had to leave for the US with our family.
None
Because we lived in a city, or in a town that was near a city as we called it over there, about thirty minutes from it and it was like that
I've seen, here in North Carolina, very beautiful sectors.
What happens is that everything is very expensive.
None
BUT THAT WOULD BE MY DREAM, TO BE ABLE TO FIND A HOUSE, NEAR THE CITY,BUT AT THE SAME TIME, AWAY FROM THE CITY
None
Away from the noise but near, where there's vegetation where there are trees, where one sees green, nature
None
And that would be my dream
None
I think God will make it a reality. It is my hope.
Yes, that's worth dreaming
None
None
The big city - I don't like it, or I would like it as a vacation for a while.  For example, a city like Miami.
Going on vacation and returning.
Is more hectic, I say, here is more complicated I say. The running around of every day.
Yes. That's how it is.
None
That's how it is.  He runs. He runs every day.
None
What we want a peaceful city a house in the country
None
Where there's not a lot of noise and that we can that we can also work. That is near work. And where we can raise our kids
None
God give us the place where we live.
Yes.
Where we want to be
None
Well we want to be
It would be very nice.
And I'm now in a gym because the city leads one
To not exercise or even walk, because everything is in the car.
None
Everything has changed for us since we arrived here in the United States but there are many places where one can
Go and exercise, is a matter of organizing your time.
None
Be organized in your things because also walking is good.
Yes, is like that.
It's very useful, and sometimes you don't look at that but it's a matter of getting in order
None
Managing your time.
None
Do you have the chance to exercise there?
Oh, yes,
Are you in California?
Yes, that's how I go. I have forty-five minutes to go there and forty-five minutes or an hour on the way back.
None
I go to school
Yes
I'm studying
Yes, yes, oh, yeah
Because all the comfort here. Everything's near, so you stop exercising your muscles
Yes, and how long have you been in the United States?
I have what, i haven't been here for long, like eight years
I've only been here for a year.
None
Yes
But you do have to get used, right?
Yes, it depends on what one wants, because it depends on if there is opportunity to exercise a job.
But one can get organized, one can look, let's say, the way of finding the ideal place little by little, right?
None
Little by little I, for example, up to now we are coming to exercise with the kids, to do sports because in life it's necessary
Is necessary
It's true
The same the dream we have of a house is usually something peaceful, rural.
None
But that at the same time is near the city.
What happens is that yes, no, just not so far from the city for the same that sometimes there are emergencies and all that
And for work also
Here in the place where I'm at, there's not much demand of work. There's not much work and if I found one, that it pays too little.
No? yes
It cost a lot
No, yes.
They pay too little and I was telling my husband to immigrate to another place
Yes.
There's not a lot of work. Bring some applications in several place, one calls immediately, and, they have one like that
Yes, sure.
None
The question they asked is if you would like to go to a place like that.
I think I'm in a place more or less like that.
None
Everything, where there's vegetation, where there's nature
I would like a place like that.
And there are many little towns or cities nearby.
None
Where they are thirty minutes, twenty minutes away is, is the possibility, right?
None
We are happy here, we're good
That is the, the important, thing is being happy in the place, right? where
Yes, we are happy thanks
None
We are happy and we are
None
Are thinking in settling down also, right?
Yes, that's it.
None
Yes, I would like to change course because it is not good here.
Okay, yes.
The truth is that the outlook is not too good.
Yes
Things are getting more complicated that they don't want to give licenses.
None
Everything is getting complicated, each day the doors for people are closing more, then there are less jobs
Yes, sure.
There are less jobs.
Yes, sure.
None
We, thank God, have the blessing of having the papers.
None
We have a work permit and like that well
None
It has been easier, so to speak although it's been hard, but, but all in all it's been easy. It has, it has been easy.
That's how we are  on that part.on that part we are fine. That's what I tell my husband, why stagnate in one place
One has the opportunity to progress That's the most important thing
Yes.
For one, to have something which to rely on, a good social and all that.
Sure yes
Since he has already been eight years with that company, he doesn't want to leave anymore.
That's good too.
None
To have stability in your job and all of that
He's not earning that much money, he just works.
You know them, no, you shouldn't experiment with, how?
He earns too little and he works so, we are never going to be able to get a
I see
We are never going to reach our goals, right?
None
None
Yes is the lady not working anymore?
No. I don't want my girl to. She's just eleven months old.
She's a baby
So he doesn't want me to because of the girl.
She's more important.
Yes, the girl can say if she is being well treated or not. You know, some people here treat children very badly.
People that are caring for them.
No, she's our priority
He says no
Hi, my name is Miriam
Hi, what's up?, my name is Luca
Hi, Luca, how are you?
What's up?
I never find you at nine
How are you? How is the weekend?
It's been quiet
Yes, you had a holiday there too
No, not a holiday
It's a holiday here, Martin Luther King's
No, there's no holiday here
How's the weekend?, how was it?
Quiet, church on Sunday, swimming on Saturday.
Yeah, where?
It's a community center i take them to
They have what, a closed pool, right?
Yes, a closed pool and the water is a bit cold, but you have to move, otherwise, you'd freeze
Don't you get sick, you get a cold after that don't you?
Yeah, there was a terrible cold, but thank God I have a car, so we get into that old car
It's OK
But you have to take the bus, imagine the, on Saturday it was very, very cold, a horrible wind
Did it rain there?
No it didn't rain, but there have been other days when it has
None
We can't complain, on saturday... it's cold today too. But no, we can't complain because i don't know, winter's usually cold, like today, like saturday, but
Yes
However, it's warm. It even went up to eight for a day.
Wow
And it's supposed to raise tomorrow.
Yesterday it was freezing cold. Terrible
Yes, it's very cold here nowadays, but it will get warm again, right?
I hope so, but yesterday they lent us a car and the door handles got frozen
None
You couldn't open it
What did you do?
We had to. We were waiting like that.
Right
There was a sort of icing on the glass.
Right
We weren't used to it because we didn't have a car until now, so we don't have a stick to take the ice off either
Right.
I don't know what it's called, my husband went there and he brought one of
Right.
The bath dryer we use to dry the floor
I do enjoy my rum when its snowy outside.
Yes
That little brush you're talking about
Yes
That one takes a lot
Yes
It's smaller
The snow was a frozen layer of ice
Eight
I don't know, it probably would have been better to get it out with hot water.
Later, but it's true
And how?
But i see now that in some stores  I'm sorry to interrupt
Yes
I've seen some commercials in stores now that I was watching TV
Yes
The defroster seems to be instantaneous
None
That you have to buy it or put it
But, it's like a liquid.
It's like a liquid.
That, you put on the windshield.
Yeah, but you put it inside
None
The hood and you plug it to the tube
None
And it says it's very easy, that you plug it I don't know where
Yeah
They tell you it's just a matter of knowing where to put it, and it says it gets defrosted right away.
Wow
I haven't dared yet
Sure
Yeah, and when the door doesn't open, you need to have alcohol at hand
None
They also sell that at stores, it's cheap
Yes
Sometimes they get to settling down, I saw a boy in the Church who couldn't even open the door and a gentleman loaned him a quarter right there
I didn't know that
I told the gentleman that it's that, and he told me, its like a liquor that warms your gut really quick
But they threw it out into the street
He look it
None
Prum, they threw him. They tried to enter the handle, so that he would move
And your son doesn't like anything?
The only thing he likes is having a good time.
None
He loves it.
And nothing good?
He learns when he's with me when I'm at his side, he gets into everything because I support him
Yes
I tell him sometimes, I don't want to tell you, yes you can like that, you already know, getting the kids all excited
Yeah
It's very important,
Are many children in the pool?
No, there weren't many around for us; two families more but that's it.
None
But when it's summer, you have not even a space in which to  move.
Sure
Already in winter is nice because not that many people go
In summer, are there outdoor pools?
Also there's plenty of outdoor pools,
How nice.
In summer we go here to one nearby. And speaking of pools and all and that the time gets cold and all.
Then you live in the city or outside of the city.
Is a city, that i mean,that has the name of a city I mean city no. is not, as big as a city, let's say there's city of Boston which is big.
None
Also is not as big as the cities of South America.
None
This would be like a suburb.
None
But it's called city and it's not like country. We don't need a car.
None
There two blocks from us is a big supermarket. four blocks away there's another, five blocks away in the center, with restaurants. Then there is not country.
And I don't know. How is it where you live?
Also like that
Yes
It's the city, Peru, i lived outside the city
Houses very far apart from each other.
No, the houses were together because they were like organizations
None
But anyways, you had to go to Lima to find the most important things, to downtown
Yes
Yes, but that was in my time. I've gone there too, in 2002, and it's more advanced. You can find everything.
Sure
Having your money
Sure
Work, you don't even have to move from there
Yeah. Would you like a place less central in Canada?
No, I'm very much the city type.
Yes
I don't know how to live in places, far away like that, i don't like that
Yes
I don't trust loneliness
Sure
I like things closer.
Yes
For example, you see the pools. I don't know if places like that will have them
Yes the truth is I think that you are very dependent of the autos
And of the electricity
Yes
I'm very dependeny, I like the light, and the heat, the microwave, all those electric things that work without effort
Yes no sure
You Luca?
And me, well in Buenos Aires I lived in a city, and I never had the chance to live like that in the country, but since I always liked the animals I thought that I would like to live in the country.
None
When we lived in Israel, we lived in a city that is more rural.
None
City or no city is the same.
Yes
Let's say, there are people that live close to farms, but they live not to far from cities, then if you need something,
None
There's always a supermarket nearby
None
I always thought that I would like to live in a city
No
I don't know how I would get along, I think that perhaps to raise the family, it must be nice.
Okay
But it also depends of the places because in Argentina is like, The countrysides don't have very good education around. The schools are like rural schools and are not as good like,
Don't worry in emergencies.
, yes, it could be, perhaps since I never lived in the country, it's like a hope that one has.
Okay.
And
And why don't you try?
Because here in Boston, the country is very expensive, no.
None
In the United States is very expensive and in Argentina you live, if you have your family in the city. I think that they city is better.
The majority go to the city because imagine
So that they help you, yes.
So that your expenses are less
Yes, being a veterinarian, it would be more useful living in the country perhaps closer to the cows and the horses and the sheep
None
I don't know if other people have much work in the country.
I think that being a veterinarian in the United States would make you good money because in the United States, they charge a lot for even a consultation.
Yes
The veterinarians are really expensive.
Yes, that's true, but also there are many that are very pressured with the issue of
Okay
Of the trials.
Okay
The horses are very expensive.
None
If it is true that one performans a treatment that does not go well, one may have committed malpractice.
Affects the horse. There are some that are susceptible and one doesn't know.
None
Then there's the trial, and trials are so expensive that
None
All the veterinarians have insurance,
Their body of veterinarians
Yes, you have to, but one gets out of college and has an attorney and has to be insured. Same with animals
Small animals
None
If there is a bad treatment or the dog has an allergic reaction the owners may take you to court, and you will be paying them for life.
That is not malpractice, that it has no reason to be malpractice.
None
I know three people that were veterinarians of horses in Argentina.
None
After coming to the United States they have worked about ten years at a horse veterinary clinic, which they say is very stressful due to the pressure that the owners place on them.
Oh, the owners.
Then they left that on the side and started to do small animals.
None
They say that it makes a lot of money until I see the money, I have to give all the and that.
I don't know anything about that, and I've never heard anything. The only thing I know is that people complain that they are expensive.
Having a little dog or animal is very expensive in Canada, or in these countries.
None
Not like our countries. They are sometimes left there. Poor ones. They just give them a shot, I think
Yes here a lot of shots are mandatory every year.
Okay
You don't have any animals.
Today, no, almost almost I was in the store, I remember ready to
Yes
Buy some birds because my son wanted.
Yes
I said that to tech him responsibility. My mom told me to start with a plant. He let the paint dry out
None
Hello.
Hello, how are you? My name is Karina.
Hello, how are you? My name is Leticia.
What
Are you from Washington?
How are you? Yes.
I spoke with you the other day.
Really? I can't believe it.
Argentina.
Yes, Are you the girl from San Martin?
Yes.
And could it be they connect us on purpose?
How funny.
I can't believe it, it is the first time that this same thing happened. It hasn't been that long that I've been using the system, right?
That you talk twice with the same person.
Yes. Has it ever happened to you?
Yes, it happened to me, but not that many times. I think it happened just once.
Girl, that we should I don't know, play the lottery or something. But well no.
How funny.
Terrible. Well, we have to talk about where we live and that possible and if you want later we can keep on talking about San Martin.
None
What does it have to do with that?
You who live in the center?
I have a story appropriate to this question of where to live. When you change
None
The country, first you don't know where you are going, you meet the truth when you arrive, and then
Yes
I came to Maryland university and thought it was inside a city. I never imagined that the outskirts here were so different
Different to the outskirts in South America
Yes
I imagined that I would walk the streets, or get off the metro and I would be in the University
Here in Maryland
None
How is it on, what city are you in?
In Philadelphia
In Philadelphia, I wonder if it will be the same, but the outskirts area is for people who have a house, car, garden
Yes
And obviously there is no sidewalk to walk
No, yes
It's all roads and highways, even to take the bus you have to cross through dangerous places because it is like stopping in the middle of the road
Yes. yes. yes. yes.
At the beginning I lived there in College Park near the University of Maryland.  During the first year, I felt that
I wasn't living in the United States that I imagined.
How far is the University from the center of Washington?
If you take the subway to the university, in twenty minutes you are in the center.
Sure.
In twenty minutes you are in the area so to speak of the bars and the cafes. If you want to go to Downtown which is where it is
Yes
For example, the White House
Yes.
You take a little longer, but not more than half an hour.
Sure.
How long would it take me from San Martin to the center?
Sure, as which
Then I.
Yes, but here in Philadelphia the suburbs are different. The suburbs are prepared for the people that have cars.
The same happens to you.  You want to do things on you own or even use the public transportation which is another issue
Yes, that there isn't much besides
No. The truth that no
What did you do? Did you then move?
Sure so, well, I stayed there the first year because
Yes, I didn't know yes
You really don't know anything and right away I didn't know where to look for a yearly contract, I was near the school that year.
I came to Washington around five times.
Sure.
To visit the museums but it was just so hard
And yes.
The subway station, for example, I lived in an apartment that was about five minutes away from the subway station and I could even walk there
It was about eight blocks away , you had to walk through.
Yes
None
None
A freeway, it was impossible, really dangerous, it was
Yes.
All very lonely and
Yes.
Dangerous, so I was angry! The station was right there, but if you wanted to go downtown,
You couldn't walk there.
Yes, if you didn't have a car you weren't able to do, you understand? So I moved to D.C.
Sure.
I prefer to take a subway since it takes twenty minutes to the station
None
Have a shuttle, too.
Yes.
That takes you by the different buildings in campus
Yes.
Then there's one that goes from College Park station to the university. If you want to walk is fifteen minutes walking if not, well take that shuttle
Very good.
Then
Sure, and now that you are in the center of D.C
Sure, and now I moved. To the area of Columbia Heights, no it is not the center because the rent is very expensive in that city. I don't know.
Yes, here too
Is terribly expensive.
Yes, here is also expensive.
That's also an issue because each neighborhood according
Yes
Here they call that centrification, and they are renovating neighborhoods that were of old houses
Yes.
That many families lived in the same house and they were destroying all, it is being renovated, increasing the rent
None
Companies that buy houses cheaply, fix them, raise the rent, then the Afro-Americans and Latinos have to move out of the neighborhood.
Of course
This is what is happening in that zone. If you can, I ended up moving as well for that reason, how they were raising the rents, right?
Of course, let's say you aren't right downtown but you are in, let's say, D.C.
Of course, no, what happens is that I lived there before, to go walking from the bars to my house, if I
Stayed out till two in the morning when they closed the bars I could go walking to my house or take a taxi that wasn't very expensive
Of course.
I moved to where a metro station was before , because then I can return to my house.
None
It's more residential where I live.
Of course.
There aren't many cafes, bars, or that kind of thing. But all those who come to the university,  I recommend that they try and move as well because in reality
The rent, if you look in a neighborhood like mine, is the same as what you would pay to, for a rental near the university because they take advantage of being near the university
None
The difference isn't great
None
The only advantage for students is that nothing is closer to the university, it depends what you want to do with your life, right?
No, I understand you. yes, here there are cheaper ones but you also have to have a car in the center, in the center of the city.
Uh-huh.
But if you were to live in the suburbs, you would have to have a car. I do because
And what is the advantage of living in the suburbs? Here in D. C. rich people prefer to live in the suburbs.
If you rent in the center for the same amount in the suburb you can rent a house with a gym.
Of course
With a little park, I don't know.
None
For the other part, I understand that people who have children say that schools are better, but
It is said that schools in downtown D.C. are bad
Of course.
Because of that the suburbs have their rent with respect to good schools around the area.
It would be more expensive to have a car in the city.
None
Don't pay in the suburb. If I had to pay for parking, it is very expensive and if you don't pay, you have to park very far.
Yes, the problem of parking here is terrible too, yes. And how is that?
Many times from where you live.
Do you use public transport?
Yes. Inside Philadelphia the center of the city is good. I like the center of Washington
The paths are a very normal part of a city
Yes, yes
And you have a lot of
Those are not the suburbs?
Yes, yes, yes, there is also a trolley and the trains go to the suburbs but overall it seems like a city in teh United States that normally does not have much public transportation, here there's a lot
How nice
It's not same as here in Argentina obviously
YES, THE DIFFERENCE IS, HOW PATRIOTIC, BUT I'M NOT THAT WAY, WHAT I SEE HERE IS THAT ONLY THE YOUNG PEOPLE USE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION HERE
Yes
Sick people and me or people like us
Yes
However, in other countries, you see a mix of things in public transportation.
Of course
Subway and a there's a kid and a guy that asks
Yes
But the people mix in that area
Yes, as such.
On the other hand, not much in the subway, but I would say in the shared transport more than anything else
Yes, no. You also notice the difference here, yes
I don't know why.
It's like big difference with what they went through at least in Argentina
Of course. And you think
But
Do you consider if you want to go to the city? Or that is, in regard to where you would like to live?
I don't know
You have never lived in a the suburb in Philadelphia?
No, I don't know. The decision is like complicated. I mean yes, I like to live in the city, but I would also like to have a house. I mean
Sure, in the house, fine.
It's both things. It would be good to have a house and not live in a small apartment.
Sure Well I here rent a house with two roommates because we don't have enough like to rent a house for just me in D.C. no.
Sure.
None
None
The apartment is a lot.
Yes, that's why. It's like that contrast. On one hand it's good. Plus I don't know I travel a lot
Sure.
In the daytime but I don't know
But there
On top here in Philadelphia is between the center of the city and the suburbs. There's a border
Head
That surrounds Philadelphia is horrible.
Is like you are in an impassable belt.
Is terrible, ugly, belt
None
Dangerous, either you live in the center or live in the suburbs, you have to
BUT IS NOT SUCH A GOOD STATEMENT.
I don't know. You cannot live a little closer to the center because you already get into that area
Sure.
No, then
Like there are no places like those that are not in the center
None
But they are neighborhoods.
Is much smaller I mean.
Sure.
It's not of having
No. Yes.
Those neighborhoods.
Sure, but here you do have dangerous areas. They say that here the statistics
Yes.
There are really very dangerous neighborhoods in D.C.  They tell you, don't rent by there.
None
Supposedly where I live is good because of recycling. There are some students of mine for example that are living here.
I don't know because the people from the suburb think that the capital
Yes.
Know, but the neighborhood would be like the collect
Right?
I don't know, it's all very...
Yes, they're afraid of a lot of things, but also the suburbs
They're not so safe either.  There's no
Yes
Yes, t's a matter of paranoia
The, the nice neighborhood there is Georgetown,
I haven't been in that neighborhood. It collects for
Right
For us, right?
Because it's beautiful
It's beautiful, it's one of the oldest there, there's where the Jesuit's university is, Georgetown University
None
And the most expensive stores and cafes are there, for older people, teenagers don't go there, there aren't any disco's there, so
Yeah, sure
Teenagers, right? The nice neighborhood called
None
It's a gay neighborhood, but the elegant gay trend, it's more artsy
Yes
There's a bunch of
Good evening!
Hello! Good evening, my name is Paulo.

I live in the city. Really deep in the city.
Did you live in the city there in Argentina
Yes my life yes, but what happens is that the city where I lived in Argentina is a small city
Okay
It is not as big as here, like Philadelphia then Eh, it was more kind, kind of a city, but kind of a village also I mean
Okay
Which is a city, but also it was like a forest outside a village.  It wasn't such a big city like here.  Philadelphia.
Yes,
We had the ocean. It makes it all a little warmer. Everything was smaller. Not like here where all is cement.
Okay
Many people, but at the time you are here is good no, is not the house of my dreams where I'm at, the apartment of my dreams but
Where in Texas are you living?
Well, I'm in Houston, Texas.
None
I live in an apartment. I really, well, I like Texas a lot, basically I mean being from Puerto Rico, well, is like
I run from the cold, for me whatever is cold, I don't like too much
Sure
I can go. I have traveled to many different states but most that I have been to have been
I don't know how and well that well, I liked a lot but even so
Is it nice there?
Yes is too cold like that like saying Pennsylvania or Canada, or something like that no not at all

Sure
I need to have buildings near me. I need a lot of stores by the apartment. I like to go to the bars.
That's good sure
And also more for the social life. I like to go out.
For the social life
I like sports, going to concerts,
Sure
That's why
A real city dweller
That's why I wouldn't like to live in, like to say in a rural area
In the country, in the middle of a mountain alone
Exactly, not but I like, yes, I love to go Camping things like that so yes, for me when they say the house of your dreams well
What I would like to have? My house
None

Right
But that, that's
For vacations only
Exactly, right?, like
Just for a few days
Not to live
My dream home. I would like to have money and buy a condo in front of the sea. That would be
OK
A condo in front of the sea.
I remember
I would be the happiest man in the world there, I wouldn't, i don't ask more, just a condo in front of the sea and that's it
I remember watching on tv, hey were doing a report about a surgeon's home. And, well, he had a beautiful house, but the thing that caught my attention the most
He has a pool. You basically open the door and the pool is just in front of the door.
Beautiful
The pool is basically at the top of the window. You can open the window and the pool is
Right in front of the window
Right
I don't know, it's like a tall pool. I don't know if you understand me. You basically open the door .
Yes
And, and goes directly to the pool,
Beautiful
So it was extremely beautiful and How they built the pool was the same level with the house
How awesome
I don't know if you are understanding me, but it was.
Yes
I saw that and I like that
I think so.
I would love to have something like that in my house
None
But, basically, I know that is a
None
My winning the lottery is not going to happen.
You're far right.
A little
Well, no, no, no. You have to insist, have to keep dreaming anyways is
Yes, exactly
I also keep dreaming with my floor in front of the ocean and up to the last minute I will be, determined is that,
For me, being from Puerto Rico, the beach is not a big deal. I always lived five minutes away from the beach, so that
As beautiful as it is, for me is like wow
None
Well I rather have a house here in the mountains, where I could camp in the mountains and things like that.
I see.
None
Me too. In Argentina I used to live by the sea and I miss it a lot.  You see.
Yes
I'd love to, yes, have you gone camping a lot here in the United States, no,
Here in Houston you really can't do it, there are no mountains; so I go camp in Handsville, Texas.
It's about an hour away from Houston, to the North of Houston.
None
When I was in Tennessee, there was a bar with a lake, where you can row.  I really like that.
I used to go camping often, we would go to the river
That's so good
We used to go do all kinds of stuff.
That's nice
To me, yes. To live like that, I have to be in the city. I need to be able to have contact with music, theater, all of it
Beautiful. Sure. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes, you need to.
Yes, once in a while, I like to be in the woods, but I wouldn't really like to live there
I really like the city and I also believe I could live in the mountains, by a lake, in the middle of the woods. I could live a quiet life.
I'm a loner, yes, even now that I live in the city and when I used to live in Argentina.
No, I don't go out much
It all depends on the person. I think
Sure
I was born and grew up in the city. I'm used to having access to all these things.
Going there and going to the country and not having access to anything, this is why I don't really like the attention
It's a suffering, sure.
I think that the person is born and grows up in the country
When he can go to the city and get used to having many, many people and the buildings
And the traffic
The traffic
Sure, yes. It's in the personality of everyone. There are people who live in the country, but love the city.
Yes
And well, they want to live there, I, no, I feel good in the city, I'm comfortable, I'm not suffering, but, the house of my dreams wouldn't be here, if I had a lot of money, I won the lottery
I would buy a good house in the mountains or by a lake, or in front of the sea.
Really? I think that this is extremely difficult to decide on. How to, say, a house of your dreams,
I would love to have a really big house, many rooms and more
Where you can see the whole city from there
Nice,
I think,  suppose
Sure, depending on the money, but no, with how time goes
Obviously.
Has it been so long that you don't go to Puerto Rico?
SINC OCTOBER
How's over there? Was it nice?
Yes I was only there five days because it was basically all family
Sure
I'm going to stay here and I really like Puerto Rico.
Will be like visiting family

None
And California; if I had to choose a place of the United States, I would go to California without a doubt, I wouldn't think twice.
Well, I'm a bit scared of it because of the earthquakes that happen there and that
Well, that's true, you can't have everything
Yes
Yeah, it's true. I lived there for four years and I had like three earthquakes that I noticed. Like whoa, this is moving a lot!
Well, Florida has tropical storms that occur there and earthquakes
Sometimes you can't have it all, but it's cold up there

They'll remove it but life here is too peaceful.

That is interesting because the United States and Canada are very different right and here the planes are very
Yes.
Very expensive.
Yes that
And the salaries are not too high.

The salaries are quite low but there is another advantage right? But i don't see any greater advantage.
That's the one I can have in my country.
Yes.
I'm here because my husband is here, and I obviously won't be here forever.

None
Regarding everyone else, I say they can pick Spanish any time. And now that they are, they can speak English pretty well.
Yes
They speak it like any american, now I'm trying to get them to learn Spanish
They don't want to?
None
That's good, do you talk to them in English or in spanish?
Yes. My mom always talks to them in Spanish and they understand her. They're getting it now
They will, because it's so important to be bilingual or trilingual
None
Later all that in the United States here is not so important.
Yes.
Here one that speaks good more because really the majority of the people that live in Canada are more immigrants all.
Yes. There but they talk
It depends where you are, but it has not helped me
No. Look.
At all.
I thought yes.
No. I get here saying, oh I don't have a problem. I speak French, speak English and no nothing very bad.
None
No, because is the west coast, in the coast a lot of Asians
None
The market is very concentrated in Asia.
I see already.
No, French is not so important and of course Spanish has nothing to do with the United States. Here, there must be by the
Ratio of Spanish it must be one percent. The ratio of Chinese thirty five the city where I live is like that they call it how do they call it
Hong Cocer is full of people that came from Hong Kong.
None
There are many, and what that has caused is that they've increased the prices of everything.
I see.
Because they were coming with a lot of money from Hong Kong because in Hong Kong they don't pay taxes.
None
Then they bought the houses and the prices increased a lot here.
Wow
The salaries don't increase.
The price on everything is increasing because the economy is very bad now.
None
Yes, the prices are, of the gas cost
Yes.
Gas costs $2.35 a gallon.

The way of living for
Hi
Hello? Good evening
Who's this?
Nancy
Hi Nancy, this is Maria Ines
Maria Ines, how are you?
Fine, where are you from?
I'm from Colombia.
From Colombia, I'm from Argentina
How are you?
Fine, everything's fine, where are you calling from?
New York
Close, I'm in Philadelphia
What do you think about today's subject?
About today's subject you caught us talking about, a few friend are reuinited here, and we live in the city and say, It's so nice that you live a little bit on the outside.
To feel a little bit of the smell of the grass and all that stuff
Nature, everything
Yes, yes, yes, that sometimes you feel like you live in a little box of shoes
Yes, because there's no building and that's it. You go out and you see the same everyday.
Do you also live in an apartment?
In an apartment. Then one becomes too immersed. You need the trees
None
You need the trees
Yes, right? Even if it's having a little garden or something.
None
Having a garden in Colombia is very common
Yes, that's very common.
Is more common than here.
Yes, because you have your house, and garden and the garden in back, and all that.
Sure, yes, in Argentina is the same even if is, if you have an apartment, the apartments have a balcony, or have a little terrace
Is more here?
You live in that apartment.
There in Argentina?
No, here in
Yes. we live in an apartment. And nothing, it has no garden, nothing, we are floor, then, we look at the trees through the window.
Where would the house of your dreams be?
Ah, let's see. How would it be? It wouldn't be too big,  I don't like the houses too big. But yes to have a very big garden to be able to have a lot of dogs
You like them.
I love them, yes. I like white houses a lot.
None
What else? I would like it to have a place to watch TV, and to listen to music, that is separate from the rest.
None
And, nothing else. I'm not very ambitious. How would yours be?
Well, I would like it to have two bedrooms, have them, separate .
Yes, yes.
For it to have a very nice garden.
None
Something that maybe I can put a swing set or something like that, to be able to go out with him there.
How nice.
Yes, it's a TV room, and of one being more peaceful, right? More relaxed.
Sure, yes.
I would like it, also not so big.
One here has everything together.
And not too big neither because then you have to clean a lot.
I thought the same thing, if it's too big, you have to maintain it, it has to come, with someone who helps you, the house of your dreams.
We need the people that live in the country and all that.
What
What do you think of that?
I think I would like to live in the country for a short time, but I think that long-term I would get bored a little.
I didn't come from a very big city anyways, but, it was a city, and living in the country, a little bit, I think it would be kinda boring.
I like to rest a little.
No, I would like a month or two in the country, but I don't know. I've never lived [there] so, i don't know
Right
I'd love to later, but I'd miss the people and the noise.
You miss all that
And would you live in the country?
No, maybe for a week only
It's nice to go horse-riding, take a walk
Yes, right? For short vacations
Sure, you have the theater,  i don't know, bars, restaurants
Oh, but cows, horses, that's different
After a while
Yes
Everything's very nice, but you have to be very [...], well, get used to it, since you're little, right?
But kids also get bored when you take them to places that
None
That are too quiet, right?
You have a son, right?
Yes, I have a son
How old is him?
Six months.
Oh well, he's so little.
I can still take him wherever I want.
He doesn't get bored yet, he doesn't care.
No, he does get bored.
Yes.
Yes because they get tired, if you have them sit they get tired of being laid down, if you change their routine.
You have to be sure.  You have to entertain them.  It's harder to entertain them because you can't make them watch television or anything because
No, they don't like anything, they watch it for five minutes and that's all, they are not excited anymore. But he does watch Dora The Explorer during the mornings and that's it.
Yes, does he like it? Does he recognize her?
Yes sure he likes the colors, he hears the voice and he turns around to watch it, I think
So little and he takes notice, that's so sweet.
Yes, yes, so thats it. To live in a building is hard.
I mean, I can imagine that there are buildings that have all the services right? But you live in an average building.
No, I don't have enough money to live in an apartment.
It's expensive if you go live in those buildings, the ones that have
None
It's an average building, it's not that fun even with the gym.
The rent is expensive.
Sure.
Our budget is not enough.
Is better not to. More in New York.
Yes.
There besides, I think that is much more expensive than here.
You've never lived here.
No, I'm very close, and I never went. We are an hour away. But, we have gone to much further places, and still not to New York.
We don't have money. Something always happens and we never go
Yes, now is quite cold. It started yesterday. They are the coldest days.
Yes, Mn. What's the temperature?
Yes. We are in twenty two, twenty eight.
None
Before, it was decreasing more. One prefers to stay home.
Yes, no. Better to stay peacefully, eating something,
Yes, even if the walls bore you. There, one starts to do something different and gets entertained.
What? I didn't hear you
That one starts to do something and in the meantime is being entertained,
Sure.
And how is the climate over there?
And here is cold, it must be thirty - I'm not too used to the Fahrenheit yet.
You're used to celsius
Yes, it's, let's say there's no, there's no snow, but the puddles on the street are frozen, i mean, it's cold, it's cold
None
I think it's not as cold as New York.
Yes
Here
And, is tenement expensive there?
You can't find a one room apartment for less than one thousand dollars
Right
And here for three hundred dollars, you can find one
It's cheaper, more accessible.
Yes, pretty much. Even in some neighborhoods, since I work at the university, I'm close to the university
Right
And well, it's convenient for me because of that, i go walking, everything, but, if you want to go further, you can get them cheaper, so
Yes
It is more accessible.
Yes it's a good idea
Have you been in New York for long?
Five years
Oh, did you came straight from Colombia or where you in ?
No, direct, so no, I've traveled that way but, a short, no no that no, I don't know much.
Did you come with your family
Here, yes.
Or alone? Yes.
I'm here with my husband and a baby.
None
All in Colombia.
Have you returned to Colombia? Have you been able to go visit?
No I haven't.
None
We are asking for asylum. So, you can't go back there
Have a baby, it's kind of complicated.
Yes, but we will see.
Maybe you'll be soon able to go visit.
Yes, maybe in five years. Maybe that will happen when this shameless guy has a girlfriend.
If he marries a rich girl he could take all of you there.
God willing it'll be like that. Do you own any dogs or what?
What?
Do you have dogs
No, not here. I used to have some in Argentina but, I can't have them here since I live in an apartment, so,
Right
Without the kids and the dogs, I'm alone with my husband
None
Until we go back there, we're here for a while and when we go back, we're gonna have dogs and children, both
None
I don't have that because it's very expensive.
Babies, that's the good thing, they help you with them too
Sure, it's true
At least they give me milk for my fatty [baby]. So, it's a lot with that, because he eats a lot
It's a little budget
Yes
They're so cute
Yes, they're very cute, they're gorgeous, and that amuses him
What's your son's name?
His name is Julian David
Leon
Julian David
Julian David, that's so nice
No, and he gets bored when we're in the apartment for too long, he gets bored, he needs to go out
When you're on the phone, for example now, what's he doing, is he sleeping?
Now he's taking the pacifier.
None
He's suppose to sleep.
Wait till he starts to. Is he already crawling?
Yes, but, he has to start, I have to start crawling with him, to teach him. because he's very fat, then, I have to teach him so that he doesn't
There he's going to start driving you crazy, when he starts moving. Right?
There I'm going to roll around with him, but I have to take him out, because he gets bored locked up in the house.
With the cold, how is it? You have to bundle him up or no?
Yes, but he goes out and sees the people in the street, and is like his environment changes.
He likes to look
Yes. Because Saturday he was sick the whole day yesterday, yesterday I took him to the clinic, and how he looked around, and he got happy when we went out. We came and he's already fine.
Yes. and he gets bored, poor him, he's a little social
And I tell him, you need to go out. Don't these four walls bore you? And he just laughs. I say, yes they need it.
Yes, the same as us, we also
While you're at it, you also have fun and get out for awhile.
Yes. There little by little we socialize more.
Sure.
None
Do they work there?
Yes, I work.
None
Right now I'm just working two or three days,
None
It depends on the person that babysits my son, but, I'm not this week, I don't work this week.

Do you like to live here?
Yes, of course. I am Cuban, I am excited, no it is not that
Of course.
It is not that,
Why did you leave? Were you in disagreement with the regimen?
Yes, my parents. Right?
You, of course, were very young.
Yes, I was two years old.
There was a disagreement, lets say it.
Tell me.
Right? For sure you still disagree, let's say it.
The
Then now it is bigger, and you are older
None
And,
Yes, I, I donÂ´t think the problem of the
Fidel Castro
What helps him is that it's an Island, right?
Yes
And, it's completely
It helps him
Exactly, that's what helps him
That's the problem,yes
If he was in the mainland,
It's yeah
It wouldn't
It would be different
None
In which way?
I think there would have been more
Oh, they can go more. Do most of them in Cuba disagree?
I think there are a lot of people.
More of less.
They're very resilient, right? is resilient Spanish or not? People are of very hard skin, right?
A lot of experience.
Yes
I believe that if it happens to you, get a life but if you look for one I think that it's not that much, there are no disagreements, but
No, it's
None
They have lots.
They don't like it.
I don't think so. No.
It had good and bad things.
I believe so
Yes, definitely is has.
I believe it's more like,
Good things for example, the people.
I believe they are isolated, they are completely,
Eat
Separated from the rest of the world.
Of course.
I believe that if they had contact with more countries and if they could see,
After that, it's better.
I don't believe so, Castro wouldn't be there now.  If they had realized how the rest of the world is living.
Sure.
The technological, social advances. There have been many cultures that have been. England has the
None
They have you covered.
Industrial development.
No. France they have a health system that is completely free just like in Cuba
Sure.
You realize that they aren't poor, am I clear?
Sure.
Lots of countries survived. And what
No.
The reason is that if Castro had done something. Illiterate people
Sure.
Illiterate.
If there weren't any illiterate persons.
Yes, if there weren't illiterate persons, if there weren't any, if it was just a free healthcare system and free medicines
The good things have not been mentioned.
Yes, lots of countries have an illiterate rate
No, I believe that those things, for example, the cultural, educational, and health areas
None
He did good
Yes.
Poverty comes from a blockage from many years ago, and that the United States made it
Right?
A very [...] blockage
Do you think?
Very strong
But do you
Commercial
Matias, do you think that? The American people you think that? Don't be so naive.
And, it affects it's economy.
Do you think that Mexico doesn't have a half a foot there, and the same with Japan, I mean Holland? There are many countries that already have
Oh my
They have helping them a lot, the blockage is only
Yes, it affects the economic and commercial part of the country.
There are many other countries
?
Don't be, naive, I don't think that Cuba is where it is now.
Yes
Because the United States hasn't bought, raw materials, or
Yes
Or other, the only thing they produce at this time is tobacco.
Sure, yes.
There is no sugar, there is no rice, there's nothing, there's no basic. They import today even sugar.
Sure.
Do I make myself clear? H- he could, if he wants to
Hello?
Hello?
Hello. How's it going? My name is Seledad.
My name is Christ, a pleasure. Where are you calling from?
I'm calling from Baltimore.
Baltimore.
And you?
I'm calling from Houston.
Houston
We are a little far.
You hear me better there?
Yes,
Good.
Yes you hear me?
Yes, I hear you.
Okay. Perfect.
What's your name?
Chris
Okay, Chris.
Yes, What do you think about the topic?
The topic was the place where we would like to live. I like
More the city, more than another thing, to live. More than the suburbs. I like the city more, the buildings, the people,
None
I like to be able to walk everywhere if I want, these kinds of things. Like, and you, what do you like more?
Yes, I like everything.  It depends on what you want, what your job is and what you think during your whole life.
Obviously, if you go to work as a sales agent, or something, No? Well, in a city. If you're going to be a farmer, well, in the country.
I like the city more
Did you live in the country before, at some moment of your life, or have you always lived in the city?
I've always lived in the city.
None
None
Sure.
When I was I was boy. And yes, liked it a lot. The animals, the horses, all that, the river, it's pretty. But well
Yes, I like it. But, I also think that after a few times I couldn't like. I couldn't live in the country all the time. It seems it would be hard for me to adapt.
I was born in the cities and, and I've always lived in the city. So, I suppose that it would be difficult for me.
Yes.
Where are you from originally?
Yes, I'm from Mexico.
Mexico DF or Mexico?
From Cuernavaca
Cuernavaca. I have never been to Mexico, I've heard it is very nice.
Yes, there are very nice places. where are you from
I am from Argentina, Buenos Aires.
From Argentina
Yes
I've had to talk to some people from Argentina. Two weeks ago I was talking to two, three people from Argentina. They say it is very beautiful also
Yes ,it is nice.  Argentina has so many places, if you like cities, Buenos Aires.
Yes
It is very interesting and nice to know. But we also have glaciers, waterfalls, mountains. The truth is that there
Are some landscapes, it is a very beautiful country. All Latin America, the southern part, Brazil is also precious, and Chile has nice places, the truth is that it is a
Nice place
Yes.
The other questions they asked was where would you move if you had to move.
Your dreams?
And get the house of your dreams
Yes
What would worry you
Yes
What do you think? Where would you? If you had the chance to go somewhere else
If I could go anywhere in the world, it would be Buenos Aries, where I was born and my family is.
To, me it looks like a good place to raise children, and
None
I like the environment. If I could choose, I would choose Buenos Aires. If it could not be Buenos Aires, I don't know. The truth is, I don't know if
If I could well and have all the comfort, I would like any city in the United States. I like the cities that have diversity, and don't
None
That have more people, not only Americans buy it there, but from all places. Because of that,
None
New York, for example, I love it. I donÂ´t know if I would live my whole life, but I love it. I would love to live there for a couple of years
Yes.
So, but I think that, if I had to choose today, today, I would come back to Buenos Aires.
Having all the comfort.
Yes, of course. And what would worry you? Any preoccupation?
I moved two weeks ago. I was living in Philadelphia.
None
I lived there four and a half years. And, now we moved to Baltimore.
We were worried, mostly. was to see because my husband was going to work here, but I was going to the university. Then, to choose the city
An opportunity to go to New York, but he was going to work alone. To live alone in New York looked to us a little bit risky.
None
Because it is very expensive. And being in a city like that, and not having the possibility of enjoying anything it was not the life style I wanted,
To go there.
Yes
The reasons why we chose this job was because of the cheap cost of living.
No, we were mostly worried, when we were searching for a place to live in. We wanted to be in the city but in a
In a safe area with no crime because  I don't know that much but I believe that Baltimore has a couple of dangerous areas.
Yes
So, that was, we were worried about that and safe places and to be in the city, near downtown, also
That it's easy to reach work from there, in my case, to be close to a train station or something like that.
So that I can go to the university  if I don't want to take the car. we had a lot to consider.
Our number one priority was safety, number two was to be located near the city.
To have a comfortable life.
Yes.
I believe that those three things were the ones that we had to take into consideration when we had to move
Yes. It's very important.
I don't know how it is in your case. Would you have to move, have you been living in Houston for long?
I've lived here for seven or eight years, but, I wouldn't want to stay here forever,  I'd like to go to Mexico,
Which one.
Or somewhere else, for example, Spain.
Yes.
None
They say that Spain is really nice.
I really haven't gone. But, they  say that is very nice
I would like to go ver there.
Yes, Europe. Do you know any part of Europe or no?
Pardon?
If you know Europe.
I would like to go there
None
The truth
You work there in Houston?
No, yes.
You are in a university.
Yes, I'm in the university, full time.
None
Yes, in Houston. I'm going to graduate already. I have a semester and a half left,
How nice
I'm thinking
What are you graduating?
Economics.
Economics.
It is nice here but the lifestyle is different.
American style is different but the style is more Latin.
I don't know. I do not feel so comfortable.
Yes. Right? Why, what bothers you the most?
That is what I ask myself. I have everything, but I don't know what is left.
Of course. Do you live alone, or are you with someone here, as your family?
Yes, with my parents and my brother. I have a brother who is nineteen.
None
Since eight years ago we have lived here.
Eight years and you still feel different.
Pardon me?
You have lived here since eight years ago and you still feel like, like you donÂ´t, you donÂ´t like, lets say.
I am used to everything. But, well, like I donÂ´t. I would like to know other places right? Other places.
Yes.
Other cultures, more than anything.
Yes, I perfectly understand. This country has a lot of goof things and on the other side, I don't know if you have gone through the same, it happens to me sometimes. It does not seem to me
It is like they always make you feel like a foreigner.
Yes.
I don't know if it happens in other countries that are not your own.
I can have a life, I even have friends and all that stuff, well, in Baltimore not yet because I recently moved, right?, but in Philadelphia, I had friends, so,
Latins, and I have friends from Europe too, and I had American friends. But, when you think home, you think back in Argentina. Right?
Yes.
Most of our friends are Argentinians or from Philadelphia.
Yes, other pair of Italians,  we get all together, is like,  all the foreign  I donÂ´t know
Some couple from Europe, Latin America and we all got together. We have a lot in common.
Yes.
I donÂ´t know what it is and neither how to describe it
Yes I understand. Yes, with friends, classmates, from different nationalities. But I don't know.
What was I going to say?
Hello, yes, Martin's speaking
Hello. With whom do I have the pleasure?
Martin
Where is Martin from?
From Philadelphia
How are you, I'm Federico
Where are you calling from?
From Philadelphia also
Look at that.
None
You're Argentinian?
How did you know?
Yes, by the accent
I could've been Uruguayan
But you are Argentinian?
Yes
You could be Uruguayan but you are not Uruguayan
Sure
How is it going?
I'm seeing something very interesting
Yes?
Yes I was, I was reading on the Internet about
Yes
A thousand texts that, they want to teach in intelligent design in science classes
Yes
It turns out that there's a new theory, the theory of the flying spaghetti monster
Not really
Flyer, and spaghetti monster basically says that everything was created by the magical touch of the noodle/spaghetti monster.
No
That if they include intelligent design they also include this
What have I heard?  That sounds delirious. They wonâ€™t do it. I understand the purpose, but what they said is that if they include design
Intelligent the question, let's say that they include from the side of the Navajo beliefs that, you see, they have their mystical delirium too, I mean
None
I don't know what the Navajo Indians believe.
It's a mess there, obviously they don't want to do it either they're not interested
Yes
I like the one of the spaghetti monster.
It's great,
You have fun, it's not bad
It's great pal, no, this one
That, when, who and what is it, a magazine editorial?
None
Is some editorial in some, in some magazine?
Yes, no, on the  internet, Paty they are calling on the internet
Look at that.
It is brilliant. The theory is very good and super logical.
Sure
You say no, because in reality all the proof that there is about evolution the spaghetti monster put them so that we don't get confused with his magical
He did it all openly, he didn't need the things all, all the illogical arguments he puts them all in a very logical way
Yes, sure.
And
Very illustrious
See that why don't you go arrest him, but the camera was also? they are always, see the camera? I was going to tell you that the microphone is in the camera
En tool etc.
With whom
Nancy, I'll show you tools, options you have to put. What where we talking about?
The spaghetti monster and I don't know what the hell more
What do you think about the locations?
What?
What do you think of the location?
The city is very important.
For instance, do you like living in the citadel?
Not the citadel
None
I prefer living in
Do you prefer the west zone?
Yes the east zone, but I can do nothing about the citadel
Right. How was the journey? Fine?
Fine? everything quiet?
Everything is alright, even the dogs?
What? the dogs are alright, the male is studying Hebrew
It is studying hebrew?
Yes, and the female dog is washing the dishes.
It washes the dishes?
None
That's incredible
Alright, this has to be a model family
Alright, and you will be the puppy
I want a large puppy
Wow.
Over-feeded
And the doggies don't want to
None
We are afraid of the system because we are illegals
I told them, Paty, I'm telling her not yet, we're not
Don't tell me, we spoke
Yes, I know about it. I'm going to tell her that
Tell her that we congratulate her for her election as president.
She is.
The woman won
That's very good.  Look at that.
Yes
And Paty is Chocha
Hut?
Marcela here, with whom am I speaking?
I'm since
No, she likes it more than the other one, but she doesn't like it
No, tell her very good
None
I sent an e-mail congratulating them and they didn't answer, i don't know what that means
They didn't go to work
None
Marcelo probably, no offense, I'll ask him later
He didn't like my love message or he preferred Chilean.
What did you write?
No, that I congratulated them on the presidency
Very well. Do you think that Philadelphia is the city of your dreams?
No, far from it.
Do you prefer to live in the country?
From Philadelphia are here in Baltimore, the dumbass
Baltimore is a
Baltimore is the worst.
Baltimore is a mass
No,  it's the president
It's very good. you can go walking on the bay with the, with the son right next to the
You think?
The bay and the aquarium.
You don't look like the Bay type.
Everything's fine at the bay.
Is it true that you liked it, where you're going out all [night], where you going from one bowling to another?
It was, no, we went for a walk, i mean, on Saturday night
What happened?
We went to eat
The canas
It was good
No, you can't because they have to download the new version of this
Are you talking to me or not?
Some grains were made with more things that today
We ate some grains and lambs.
Lambs, how many?
Yeah, about three of them. Afterwords on Sunday we're doing a mini brunch.
We ate near home
Where?
None
Is it the place where we went?
No, it's another one
How's Sole?
I don't know, she's fine, she got a little down, but well, what are you gonna do about it?
Poor thing, you're so mean
Yeah, he left her alone
Yes
We went, yes
It is good
Yes but it, it bothers me as my friends would say, it bothers me
Why?
Changing now.
No, what's more, if you change they should first give you fifteen days free free
Yes
If you change they give you a free month
Yes but it bothers me
None
And when it comes out then
Pinch it, tomorrow we see it. Also, they have
Tomorrow
They have movies plus video games that you can rent.
None
For playstation, xbox and all that
Video games
All types of movies.
What are you referring to.
With all the series that reminds you
Not me
I have compared some graph tables and ended up winning.
Even so, would it still be as reliable as the others?
What?
Will it be as reliable as the others?
If on the Internet, you put DVD rental, there's a page comes up, the third or fourth that
Yes
A table that compares between DVD rental
That's good
The on ly thing is that netflix and blockbuster has four thousand titles
Yes
They don't say the number
None
It doesn't say the number, but it says that they have, that they don't put the number, it doesn't, how could they not publish it
The price is a lot cheaper and if you get into the other place, you see the movies that they have and the new reviews that they have. They are always the new reviews of the other
Sure. but over there they only the newest, they don't have international movies
Pay attention
You have to see it
Not sugar, but I'm sure that it'll come out, I can't explain it right now
Did you get Net Flix?
Yes, because I have fifteen days for free
Yes
And i almost change to the other, i have a free month in that one
Sure, what was I going to say?
Playstation and I rent
We rent the same game and we play online
A little bit of that, that could be
What was i going to tell you?
Everything is possible. When you score a goal against Cuba, I also celebrate
Toly is a half-breed
Yes, it said something about teaming up with Jan. Janis and I also played against Toly, and we bested them.
But Toly goes backwards
No, Toly goes backwards, but the girl makes an effort
She makes an effort, she does, but
She makes an effort, she makes an effort, but well, she still doesn't stop going backwards no matter how hard she tries
Cuco is having a son
She still can't
Is Cuco your son already?
Poor Cuco only
He's not bad, he has a defense
Yes, what?
Has little defence
Little attack but in the TV with four inches televisions
I already explained to you that this is wrong
Why?
That has three or four plays
No, that's why the old ones
What does all this mean?
Sure my king
What definition does a four inch television from the seventies has?
Those old televisions, see those that came real little
It has good definition for a four inch TV from the seventies
I think, yes, what happens
Go, yes
Yes, you want to go to Canada?
Hello
Yes hello,
Yes, how are you? My name is Veronica
Veronica, what a pretty name, my name is William.
Okay, Why so pretty?
Fromwherno is a very pretty name. Veronica, a name like yours is place on top of the chimney, with one of those exotic paintings.
Then is exotic, but the exotic can also be pretty.
Damn, if it's a Picasso painting, it's beautiful.
William, why do you have that name?
Yes
Why do you have that name and a Spanish accent?
What? Spanish accent.
None
I'm Cuban, I'm Spanish.
I didn't recognize the accent. With the damn, I thought you were Spanish from the Iberian peninsula.
No, I had to say that I was from Spain.
You gave me a false damn. Sure, that's why, I thought, I told you Spanish accent, I'm from Argentina and we say Spanish accent means from Spain.
In general every time we refer to the Spanish.
Well
If we are not referring to things from Spain, we use the Castilian language.
Is that look you are very right, but my grandmother and my grandfather in Cuba, they were born in Spain and since very young they went to live in Cuba.
I would say that when they were 10 or 15, they went to live in Cuba and there they had my parents. And from there, I came out.
And from there you left to Spain.
I prefer Cuba over Spain, even if I have been there two or three times now.
Where are you here?
I'm in Miami.
Okay, I'm in
I'm visiting Miami, regularly I have my apartment in Miami.
Okay, I'm in Washington.
Where do you live?
I'm in Washington, Maryland, next to Washington D
Are there a lot of Hispanics in Washington, DC?
There are a lot of Hispanics in my area
Yes
It was an interesting topic of the housing, here in the Washington area.
None
Accurately in the area of Maryland There's a very big community of Central Americans, but a little bit more, not of the islands, of the continent, of Salvador and of Guatemala.
And
There's a very big community.
I wouldn't thought many Puerto Ricans are in Washington and Pennsylvania, places there in the North.
There are many Puerto Ricans and many Mexicans.
Mexicans yes, I think that there are Mexicans all over. So, I don't know where I would say that more in the west you have.
Much stronger communities, more formed.  Here you have a lot of Mexicans
None
But the majority, a great percentage of the El Salvadorian immigration, are settling in this area. In the state of Maryland, and above all in the state of Virginia.
This is really good, because in any case the Hispanic where we want to be
Which is in the south,
And any little word that we get wrong here or there, we're all Hispanic and speak the same language. and we all understand each other in the end, right?
We understand each other in the end, sometimes we don't understand each other, or sometimes we make a mistake, your cono was tricks for me, because Cubans don't use cono, believe me.
Girl, without this word we don't exist.
A look at that.
We put cono on everything, cono mommy, cono my girl, cono, what's up?
You know I didn't know this, look at that
Yes, so, it's a really integral word in our language, let's say the street Cuban.
Sure, of course.
But I came here. One, if I was going to move up there to the north, I wouldn't have any problem either.
Tell me
In buying some good black beans, white rice, some tostones, good bananas, you know, a steak empanada. I can go to a store and buy this, I don't have to live like an American, let's say.
William I'll tell you the store and you go and you buy everything.
Hopefully I'll visit there one day because I remember when I was
Look, this is,
Tell me.
There are difficulties for Hispanic immigrants, especially for those that are undocumented.
I can see that.
I believe that you can make a living here, with the food, music, shows, and going out.
You can really keep in touch with your culture.
That's really important because I want to tell you something. I was raised here in Miami, but
None
In Miami are are lots of Hispanics
Lots of people that come from our countries forget where they came from
Yes
I've never forgotten how to say, fuck, or about eating my beans with fried steak, or how to treat a woman like she was the last one on Earth.
Ha ha, that's so,
They are confused here, they think they are gringos. They forget where they came from.
One of the things I find really interesting is that in our countries, we are not used to this consumerism system, so you go shopping,
And I mean, I'm sure that when your parents were in Cuba, they'd only buy the things they needed.
Sure
And if something was broken, they'd fix it.
None
But I've been here for four years, and it's really interesting to me to see that I'm thirty five years old, I've lived most of my life in Argentina
But it attracts a lot my attention. Like here, this is one of the ways. I wonder if he has a cultural or identity question,
Since the consume levels within the Hispanic community are so high
Very high
Just like the American, the whole system here, the debts and credit cards, all those things.
It is a system that works against Hispanics.
Who don't have the luck of having born here
None
Who gave us a lead, who left us something for us to start with
Right
We have the bad luck coming to a country to improve, because I consider myself Cuban American. Because I can't say that I don't consider myself a little American
The consume of everything for instance
If your vacuum breaks down, why will you go buy a new one when you can fix the cable or the fuse? That will cost you twenty or thirty pesos.
Right
It is true what you say because you see a commercial on the TV that says 'I bought a new vacuum and bla, bla, bla'
Right, and the same with cars and every thing
It is the American culture, that even if you don't want to, you just get used to it. But I talk to a lot of people, and when we talk about this subject, I say, don't forget where you come from brother, we are Cuban
And if something breaks down, my brother, fix it. Why will you take one hundred dollars and waste one hundred dollars to buy a new one, if you fix it it will work just as fine as before
Sure
The country's the same: amazing with a diverse culture
None
I don't know how it works there in the north but I suppose that it's not too different down here
Well I think that those type of things are the same in all places.  you don't have a lot of Puerto Rican community
There's a lot of Puerto Rican community in New Jersey.
In New York and New Jersey.
In New York, I have seen. But not that many Cuban people here.
No, we always stay in the south, we basically
Look
We stay in Miami, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach.
You guys need to be closer to the Caribbean.
Yes since we are not allowed to visit the place where we were born,
None
It's like a reflection but we don't have the same laws
Pardon the word, when we have to be screwed.
None
You came five years ago?
Yes, four years.
Four, five years.
Yes
What is the difference in your opinion between this country and your country?
What I can tell you is that there is a difference between what I saw, of this country, the United States, from outside, from Argentina.
You know that was what I was asking you, which I did not specify very well.
A thing is what I saw from this country since Argentina and another thing is what I see in this country being here
So they are two totally different realities Of course United States as an economical power on all. So, it is an appearance, like an ideal paradise.
Of course
Do you understand me, and as the idea of well to come to America
None
So, reality is very different.
Very different, right.
The reality is very different and, and it depends, yes I think that Hispanics here suffer, we suffer, many realities I came here to study
I am in a very privileged space, but its not like the situation of other people who come here.
No, it is not what you thought it was in your country, right.
No
Nothing. I tell that to many, many brothers. I say brothers I am talking about my Cuban people that they,
No, no, no.
I visit Cuba once a year.
None
Every time I go they tell me, no I want to go there, and I tell them, I know that you want to go there and there is a thing that only you have heard about and you have seen pictures.
Wait a second, when you arrive there, money is not going to fall from the sky.
You are not going to be in your house having a coffee with your next-door neighbors, or something like that. Things are not like that there, there you are going to have to get up early and break your back every day.
People like us have to study and prepare more than others
I believe that people come here, they really want to work and do well
They have no other options and they can't progress in their countries and that's the reality, I don't deny it, but the problem, in my opinion, is more serious and
They come here to join what I call
That's, and yes
I laugh, but I think you are right: I had never heard that expression before.
It's not
Honey in Florida.
Manuel is also un Florida.
What was the topic?
The housing. yes renting versus renting, yes Pros and cons.
Actually, I'm almost in both situations because is with option to buy.
Really.
But that's it's a house
None
Your apartment. You know that is the big difference.
Why? do you rent a house?
Exactly. Okay I'm renting a house but with an option to buy in a year.
I keep renting or I move to another place.
Okay.
The advantage that I see of one renting is that at least you have someone who comes and fixes everything if something breaks.
Sure.
You are the owner of the house
None
You are the one who has to do that, you understand me? If the air conditioner breaks, there's no maintenance.
None
You have to find the money one way or another or else you stay without an a/c.
Sure.
Is lower when you live in your own house
None
The water is more expensive
Yes
The city goes for him since they have so many people who leave or don't pay the bills.
So the city takes all that into consideration.
To make the charges.
Exactly. They charge the people that are there.
None
I work with a company that handles the water bill of the apartments
None
And is one of the things they take into account.
None
You know that you have a house that is bigger than an apartment.
None
The way they see it is that if you buy a house you will probably be there a few years.
Sure. You have more possibilities of staying longer.
Exactly And that the price of your property goes up. They know that you are not in a place.
None
That another
Sure. I think some also to buy to later sell them, right?
Also, you are paying for what's yours.
Here, tt takes to long for people to pay their house, right?
Exactly.
Twenty five years.
The only disadvantage it has is that when you buy a house
Sure.
You already don't have the same advantage if you are renting in a place and I want to go to Miami or I want to go to such place, is like as soon like look I'm leaving.
You just leave, well right,
Exactly. In a house or in something that's yours, be it a condo or whatever, you know you have to sell it
None
Not as simple as if you were renting, I left.
That's how it is right.
You know that's the only disadvantage, I exactly would recommend a person to buy better than rent
Would you prefer to buy?
Buy it than renting it.
None
Because when you are renting, you are like you say, paying to another jerk.
Yes, well, no, because if you have a little bit of money to send a down payment and rent it to buy it, later you can sell it
Because of this option
None
Leasing option
None
They give you time to do what you pay rent with
None
You know, you go paying upfront what a regular rent will be, but that percentage, when your is over, I did it for a year.
None
A percentage of my rent is going to be saved for closure
Look at that
You know, i don't have five, six thousand dollars to buy something
None
You know I'm gonna have to do something, but that's not a big amount
It's not so much
And on top of that, you mind your business because you know that in the end you're paying rent, but it's going to be yours
Because here In the United States you have the big advantage that a lot of people buy with re-financing, I mean that you.
None
Without being full owners,you aren't right?
None
Because you're still paying, many times you have only paid twenty percent of the total cost.
None
They can sell it, right?
Exactly.
It is afigure that doesn't work too much in other countries of Latin America because the property is different right?
No, because, first, I don't even think that the refinancing exists.
No. There's none.
I haven't heard of those options nor those facilities. If you don't have the money to have it built,
None
None
Sure, many purchases are on contradict, and also there are some financing with the banks
But you have to plea that they didn't leave with your money that
NONE
Don't belong to the government,
None
You know that is not the same.
None
When you are for yours.
If you know that you are going to stay and all those things.
Yes, that's the advantage that I see. I don't see any sense in renting.
Finally you have
Yes it can be avoided
None
But is also like you say that not everyone has that amount
None
Or credit, because here in the United States the problem is not even the money.
None
You can have all the money in the world but if you don't have this fabulous credit,
They don't give it to you right?
They don't give it to you.
It's true.
For example
I don't get, what?
I don't like my check to go in bills.
Sure
And I've seen myself in the situation that when I go to do something what jumps out at me is that I don't have enough credit history.
Sure if you haven't bought a lot on credit you don't have credit.
To hastily be picking up a microwave in Kmart and i stayed at the man. And how do you say something like that if I already have a microwave in my house?
Yes, I think the credits are built in any part of the world. That is true.
You have to.
Is always better why do you want to ask you have to pay whatever you can with credit.
And that is what I don't like because I've never liked that. If I don't have, better not to buy it.
None
I've come across the case that
Sure.
Look what a strange thing.
Sure, they recommend what the man says. It's not precisely a good example. Doing the daily shopping with the card and paying at the end of the month.
I even turned in all my credit cards and everything, because I saw myself in a situation where I was paying for what they put on the card.
That if something happens to you, or you stay without a job, supposedly the insurance
Yes, it covers you.
It covers you or it stops until a certain time
A year, I think, yes.
When i went to activate it because i had a car accident they told me no.
That no?
That no. I told him, how can it be possible that you are telling me no?
None
For a year and a half already
No, you've paid it.
I've paid it.
Sure. That are like yes.
Then, that no. I had to have notified them thirty days when
After the accident.
After the accident.
None
But, you wanted me to answer in thirty days if I was in the hospital?
None
That's the least I'm preoccupied with.
Sure.
I have to call a credit card to tell them they have me hospitalized. Three broken ribs, a leg by here
Sure.
That's already impossible. No, then when I did that I got the card paid it and cancelled it.
Sure.
I use my debit card.
None
That it's the same thing but I'm only using the money that's in the bank.
Sure. Whatever there is in the account right?
And that has affected me you know for the purchase of the house. I have to wait a year
Yes, that's why they give you that lease
Exactly. Because I have to increase the number of my
None
My credit
None
I have a bit of a history
None
Where they send you, what a mess.
None
They should be living check to check.
That's right.
When they are not supposed to live like that, understand?  They are trying that people shouldn't get that much, to have a better quality life.
Sure.
I was shocked.
None
Only in America.
Yes, No
But as long as, it's I
But
There are some thing I miss.
None
If you are leasing an apartment, there are people that do that.
Sure
At the same time you have to wait for them to come out.
Yes well sometimes they also don't do it.
No, so I moved,
Yes you have to be in a place that is more or less expensive so that they give you everything fast and you are good
Goodness we already are paying almost an arm and a leg but for everything it was a
Careful with the other You see.
A drop
None
We lasted three, four months with water coming out of both
None
By the corners of the house.
Yes.
Because the apartment had a leak.
None
You know who it is, it's also not that easy.
Yes, not like that. No you have to close it very fast.
I that I. For me is better, for you to buy it.
Is always better, right?
You are already on your own, you are paying for yourself.
None
You understand me. When you already have enough time you can get a loan against your house.
Isn't it?
You know it's not like that, it's not the same as when you are leasing. You don't own anything.
None
You know that it'll take a toll in the short term.
That's right.
But, that has been my own experience and I particularly wouldn't recommend it to anyone, if they can
None
If they have other options, there are some programs that help you buy your first house.
Yes it's well there are some.
Exactly.
None
For people that are buying their first home, I think it's called the FHA loan.
NONE
They help you.
Look at that.
And they give you a certain percentage if not all the money.
None
With the income tax and that, the mortgage company has gone mad because they know that everybody has two thousand, Pesos.
None
They are going to be sent to the government.
None
And they all lower credit
Sure
That's the best time to go out and find,
Yes
But that's been my experience, i don't know yours
Since I'm not going to stay here to live, I just rent here. If I were able to buy and then sell
I would have done that too, because I'd be making some money too
Yes, that's true. And here in Florida, the prices of properties
None.
Properties in this area are going up
Yes, exactly. That's what I've seen through comments from other friends, right?
Because unfortunately, this is the country, the state where everybody wants to come
None
It still hasn't
Yes, that's true.
They just come to lead twenty miles per hour
That's ultimately better
They don't
If you finish paying it, it's yours, right? If not, you can
Right?, if you have, you know, any emergency
Negotiate, earn some money for yourself
Exactly. And in any emergency, you're forbidden to get a student loan. Do you know what I mean?
You have a mortgage, you're right
You're going to find your mortgage and how much you have in equity, you have money now
Yes
You know it's not the same when you're renting
When you rent you lose a lot of money too. You lose a lot of money a year.
I barely heard that last one
You lose a lot of money renting, you lose a lot of money annually.
None
Matías
Hi! My name is Martin
Martín
Yes
Martin, how are you?
Fine, you?

Of Neuro-. look at that, that's good

Look at that.
You studied at the Uva
Yes, I'm at the U
In Buenos Aires?
Yes
Oh, it's ok, exactly
Yes
It's OK, but you graduated long ago
I spent some time there. I'm about to get a doctorate.
I'm a student.
None
I haven't graduated yet
None
I have a few more years left to go.
Oh, well
For that
Well
I'm in third
Good look with that
Thank you very much, I came here to study, I'm doing an internship, I'm not working
Look at that, that's good.
Here in Penn
That's good
What?
I said that's good
The truth is, I managed to get laurito here, through a contact.
I'm at Penn University now but
Here in Penn too
Temporarily
Maybe you'll even see me on the hall
Maybe
While you're working?
That could also be
It could be, right?
Yes, do you rent or?
I
Are you an owner?
I've been here for two weeks, and i'm leaving in two months from now
My girlfriend's brother's house
Look at that
None
Look at that.
I don't even rent, I'm just a guest here
Sure, is loaned,
You?
I've rented a while, since
Here it is common, right?
And yes what happens is that buying is very expensive now.
So expensive.
Yes, is very expensive especially in the cities, now is getting too expensive.
Every day is more expensive.
Yes,
Okay,
Philadelphia particularly is very expensive now. Comparing it to how it was five years ago.
And Baltimore?
And Baltimore is starting to increase now. But also, they are increasing the prices of everything
It's getting Top
No, but
But little by little
But yes, as the city grows, the prices are increasing
Is Baltimore nice?
Is small, Philadelphia is nicer, but
It is small.
Yes, there they go, the crash is right there
And, and are you renting there in Baltimore too?
Yes
You were renting here and there too
Yes
What's cheaper, here or there?
It's a little bit cheaper
A little bit cheaper
Yes, it's a little bit cheaper
But it's almost the same
I don't know, maybe ten or five percent cheaper.
An apartment or a house?
It's an apartment, yes.
Apartment
Yes, houses are very expensive
Yeah, right?
Yes
Also, better than the one here? Than the one in Philadelphia, the apartment is nicer?
The same money you can rent something a little bit bigger, with more services
Does the hotel give you a lot of services?
It's
I'm sorry, the department?
It has more things than here.
Sure, so the subject was housing, right?
That's why I was talking about that.
He precisely said something about a witch [a burbuja, bubble] What did he say?
What the witch means is
I didn't hear
We throw the witch [a burbuja, bubble], that properties are overrated. The price is higher than what it's really worth
So they call it the witch bubble because at some point it will get punctured and the prices are gonna go down again
That's why
Yes, I mean, the witch [bubble], they say that in New York and Los Angeles it's about to get punctured
The witch [bubble] started growing fifteen years ago.
It began ten to fifteen tears ago.
However, here in Philadelphia, on the other hand, five years ago it started like that, so they say that prices might go rising for a while until
The witch [bubble] breaks. I don't know if it's a witch [bubble] or not, but the prices went up a lot during the last times, that's true
And they keep rising in New York, in Los Angeles
Yeah, they keep rising for now, right? Right
Or are they holding up?
They keep rising, so i don't know if it's gonna get punctured at some point
Sure, each time is harder
What?
Each time is harder to rent, to live in an important city let's say big
Everything is super expensive. The Bubble anyways refers to buying, but obviously if it's more more expensive to buy the prices of the rents also increase, yes.
The rent of house is also speak to person
Sure,
It increases also, but it's okay. Have you been here in the United States many years?
It's been four and a half years
Four years
Yes a lot
And is it good living here, or no, more or
Yes, one gets used to it
But there are many differences from Argentina.
Yes, obviously there are differences. I mean to start your friends are not here, your family is not here. Things of that sort,
Sure
Some things are hard to find.
Hard things of what?
But of finding food, or things that you are
Sure
Used to eating over there, that here don't exist or well and the treatment of the people is different all those things right,
People from here? Or from other countries, are there many people from the other side who came here, who met?
In the University area, do you know many people from outside
Many Latinos
Everything is easier, easier to meet than in other areas. Meeting Latinos or Europeans.
There are many, no? Those who work in the sciences are very few, no? Americans who are natives from here
And it's forty percent more or less, and the rest is all from outside
Forty or more foreigners than that.
Yes, I think that there are more foreigners than
Than natives.
Than natives, yes,
And did you make many friends? Your friendships, how are they going?
Fine, I have friends from everywhere, in reality, like friends from Latin America, from Argentina, from Chile
Friends from Argentina who you met
From Brazil
Are they in Argentina?
I met the majority here or in Argentina. Simple acquaintances. And, I made friends here, simply by, well, I didn't know they well. I knew them more from sight or from the faculty
Yes
Or from
Yes, they're studying the same job.
Sure
Scientific
Sure
None
When we were of American people also Simpl
You became friends with American people.
They worked in front
Sure
Or also Europeans
Sure,
Well.
And are there things to do?
No, here in Philadelphia
Yes,
Yes, I think so is peaceful.
Is it fun?
Is peaceful
Peaceful Right?
Yes, is peaceful.
There isn't
But Baltimore is more peaceful.
Baltimore
Even more quiet
Baltimore is very quiet, right?
Yes
Very quiet
Very quiet, we're just getting used to it there, but I'm under the impression that
And, but it's
It's a lot smaller
A little town compared to Philadelphia
Yes
And there's not much of anything in philadelphia, there is no party like in buenos aires, the crazy partying
You need to go to the Old City side.
I don't know Old City
It's near the wide river
What street is the river?
Front
You have to go there first, let's say
Sure
That's nice, i have to go there some day
It's nice, right? It's filled with bars and restaurants
Nicer than the center.
You have the rivers, what happens is that the bars are not on the river. That's a design problem of this city
None
They are near the river, but not on the river.
They are like a block away and the riverside path is like to walk, like a boulevard to walk but there's nothing else.
Is picturesque so to speak.
Is picturesque, Like there's nothing, they could've made some little bars, something nice to drink a coffee there, but no
Is just a path with
None
Like the one here in the river that takes you to the musuem?
How the boats go by.
Of art
Is a little wider, is like the boulevard in Mar de Plata.
Is nicer than that one right?
Yes, it is a little better.
Because that path kind of sucks, there isn't a lot
No
That path goes to the museum and there is the park
Yes, No, but it's good. If you go to the museum, there, it gets nicer.
When you get to the museum.
Passing the museum.
Yes, where the ducks are.
Yes, the tracks are full of ducks but
Yes, I was there once, I went there the other day
Yes. Oh, if you go to the east side you will reach a place in which there's another river.
You have to walk a lot.
And it's nicer.
You have to continue, where the nautical houses are
If you take your bike
Forty minutes,
By bike, yes
By bike.
Yes,
Oh, they give you
A LOT BUT, IT'S OKAY, IT'S FUN AND IF YOU CAN, YOU SHOULD DO IT.
And, what's there?
There's another river but isn't this one similar to the South of Argentina
Yes,
I mean
Kind off
Much more precarious but it's good, right? becuase there's like a forest andd the river crosses the middle of the forest
Sure,yes
And the people, yes, people fly-fishing; it's good, it's nice, it's very different, because it's also in the middle of the city and it's like
It's in the middle of the city
Yes
Because it looks like a forest, in fact there's no cellphone signal
But it's in the middle. It's in the suburbs, right? In the middle
No, it's still in the middle of the city
This city is till there, you can go on
Yes, it's very crazy.
Look at that.
Yes, that's a nice place
That's odd, the only place that I met was up until the museum and afterwords the center, the streets where to do shopping
Oh, you saw everything over there.
Sure
Old City, right?, and all that you told me too
Right? you have to go
Sure, all shopping for now
Sure
GAP is cheaper, GAP is very cheap, I'm buying some things in
You're in on the American consumer wave
I still have more left
Sure
I want to buy an iPod
Yes, those are good
They're cheap
I have one
They like to buy a pair and send them to Argentina.
I don't know how much they're selling, do they sell well in Argentina? Or are they expensive to?
The iPod or any MP3 player?
I mean the iPod's.
This is Vanessa
This is Victor
Hello
This is Victor
Victor this is Vanessa,I live in San Diego where do you live?
I'm sorry, yes
This is Vanessa from San Diego.
I'm from Puerto Rico
I can barely hear you.
From Ponce
I'm from Rio Piedras too
I came here in eighty seven
Yes, from Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras but I've been here since eighty five
I'm living with a friend here in the Bronx
Really.
In the Bronx
Where
I like it now, I love the Bronx
None
I've spend here so many years
It's cold right,
I get called, they tell me.
It's fine here
People call me Chari. I can't understand you
Have you been cold there?
Yes, there's a lot of noise
I can barely hear you, Victor.  There's a lot of noise.
It's so expensive
Yes, well today's subject is housing. Are houses expensive where you are from?
No, it's all right.
Yes, how much does a house or an apartment cost there? How much does a house or an apartment cost there?
You can buy them from seven to eight hundred dollars.
How much? Oh, the rent
The rent
But if I wanted to buy one
I can't understand you honey, I don't understand what you are saying.
To buy one?
You wouldn't want to buy there.
Hello, what if I want to buy one there? How much?
How much? I don't know honey, I've never bought one
Okay
How much is a rent over there
Here in San Diego, housing is very expensive, but it is cheaper renting than buying. Here, to rent a room, is like nine hundred dollars a month.
My God
To buy like half a million at least.
Then you must have a good job
Ye,s a very good job. And here, the people buy houses, but, I don't know how they do it. They are not so good.
Can you believe that they are selling something out of a base.
YOU ONLY PAY THE INTEREST
None
But many, many people buy here. With five hundred thousand dollars, you can hardly buy anything.
Never
Nothing, in a good area
How much would it cost in a good area and then in a poorer one?
In a poor area a room and a bathroom, nothing for less that three hundred fifty thousand.
My God.
But I am talking of an area with crime, horrible,forget it.
Drugs and crime
Things of housing are very bad here. Yes, then you are in
Like for the renters
Yes
It was great for the clients, and for those who live in the area.
Yes for everything, but here I moved to San Diego in 2001. Since I moved, the housing prices have more than doubled.
But you can pay this, it's true. They never bought anything for you.
Yes, we're with the Navy and we're living from the Navy. I don't know if you can imagine.
A million dollars, so, how long will you wait to buy something for you? How long will you want for at least an apartment or an apart
How much would it be?
An apartment for you.
I have a family with three kids, we need at least three rooms. This will not be less than $700 and we'll not be able to pay.
Right
We won't be able to.
You've never been to Ponce.
So,
Ponce is really beautiful
None
Yeah but you go to Taplado to Taplado beach the coast, it's really pretty, many artists, they go and say beside the sea, the tabloid says
I haven't been to Puerto Rico since I was little.
And your family never went to any place that you know.
Yes yes yes, no no no, yes when I was little we went, but that was many years ago.
Can I tell you something personal?
Yes
I am gay
None
My life is that, when i was younger my mom never showed me the love i wanted her to showed me.
None
I am frustrated because of that my mom never, at thirteen at fourteen I was raped, two people raped me.
None
People who, I trusted, I felt in love with one of them and and that one raped me. Do you understand me?
Yes it has caused you a lot of problems obviously.
I am talking that at fourteen years old.
There is
Because of destiny, the people who raped me, One of them is at jail for being a raper, I never knew that Juanito,
Was a raper
None
I have been here for twelve years and as I am gay
I was afraid that someone could kill me from behind, Do you understand me?
Yes,of course
Then when I fell in love, I fell in love with him, he took advantage of it, as I never wanted to do something with him, only kissing.
He was eighteen and I was fourteen
Yes
Then with one, we were in some Patron Saint parties, and we left
None
What's wrong? Excuse me, are you okay?
None
Then we were in the Patron Saint parties and then he wanted to go out with me. He invited me somewhere.
None
Then how was I to know that it was a park? Suddenly Chachi's friend, may he rest in peace as well, appeared behind me
None
And they hit me with a rock on the head. They beat me, and I tell you the truth. Can I speak straight with you?
Yes
While one raped me, another one was giving me hickeys, would kiss me and I was running, nobody would hear me. I mean, me running, nobody heard me.
But when I ran, they collided into me, I fell to the floor.
No
That was horrible, now I'm forty
And how old are you now?
Forty four I take off four so no one believes me
WHAT A THING
But, if you see me, I look thirty eight, thirty six years old.
What luck, atleast
Thanks
And so, everything is going pretty well or
I'm homeless now, and a friend of mine is letting me live in her house
And a year ago, my husband, with whom i was with for nine years, left me for a woman
None
Yeah, he left me for a woman, even though, she was a woman that doesn't even have teeth, a woman of over fifty years old, a drug addict woman
So it didn't last even two months, and now he's in jail
Oh no
I was born on nineteen sixty one
That's horrible. Youu have lots of problems.
On October 17th of 1961
None
So, according to, according to me, my mom never supported me, my mom was
Well, yeah.
Was always away from me. If I went out, she never said God bless you, and that makes me feel bad.
Sure
I really think about that
Yes
I get sad because she has never been a mother to me and I'm telling you because I want to let it out
Do you talk to her anymore?
I talk to her sometimes but
That
My family is not united as I would like.
What a shame
As it would be united family, understand that, in Christmas, we hug each other; in the birthdays, would tell me happy birthday
None
No, my life is like that
You have someone there with you
Thank God
Yes is hard really, withiout the support of the family.
My sister's family doesn't want to talk, I told her to go visit me I was, I got out, yesterday I got out of a program of
I was a drug addict where a program
None
I called so she would see me for Christmas and my sister didn't see me.
Well.the
In what sense
Yes, maybe she doesn't understand no. Maybe she doesn't have any trust yet.
I've never done anything bad to her.
That may be, maybe she feels so bad and thinks she doesn't want to. She doesn't want to suffer anymore. You understand that maybe she doesn't want to suffer seeing you a certain way.
Because I know that brother is also like that, I suffer a lot. And sometimes it's hard seeing him.
Really
I'm sorry for you maybe I don't know if you have faith in God, but. that has helped me a lot.
No, I have a great faith in God, I'm very religious
So,
I was raised in the Pentecostal church
Yes
I know there's a big God.
There is.
I know that I believe in the holy spirit
Yes
I believe that some day God will give me a sentimental prize. But I've always believed in God, because he who doesn't believe in God, is not worth anything.
Yes because there's no way of living without having a
None
Yes, believing in God, you have to have trust and believe in God and do all the good that you can.

Eighteen years.

Very well, from where, Buenos Aires?
A year, no, I'm from Mar del Plata
Mar Del Plata, I lived in the city
Really,
Unfortunately just for a year because it's one of the most beautiful cities in the world
None
Oh Mar del Plata is wonderful, well no, yes, I just lived there for a year and then we went back to live to Buenos Aires,
And where are you originally from?
I was born and raised in Buenos Aires
I see.
In the West Nuz, Valentin, yes
That's huge
So, are you now living in the United States from Mar del Plata, did you come
Yes,
Very well
No I moved to Mar del Planta until I came here, well someday I'll move back to Mar del Plata
Mar del Plata is a wonderful city
It really is,
It's so beautiful
None
I haven't been there for a long time so I can just imagine how beautiful it should be now.
It is beautiful,
Well so you are now in Philadelphia.
I'm in Philadelphia
Then you are renting, or what
Yes,
You have your own house
Im renting, the idea is
Very good.
Came to Philadelphia to make some money and return to Argentina to buy my own house
That's the idea.
That's the plan or part of a house at least.
Very good, so that's the idea, I think that you will be able to achieve it because basically, in the comparison how it is
Let's say the market here of the United States
None
The cost of living Argentina, yes, you will be able to achieve it
Is terrible, the cost of living in Argentina seems as if it was Switzerland, but they charge
Is the cost of housing going up a lot in Argentina?
Yes everything is super expensive, especially in Mar de Plata.
Because it's a tourist city
Sure
More del Plata
And now is in fashion again because there was a time nobody went.
How is that? Since there was a time where no one was there, no one went there
Yes, there was a time when, i don't know if you remember when it was , one peso was one dollar
Yes
In that time, people
None
People were to Punta del Este because it was very cheap.
Exactly
And they didn't go to Mar del Plata, so it dropped a lot there, but it's activated again. And the truth is it's all in, but we Mar Platences (those of us from Mar del Plata) are affected negativey
The way that properties go up.
Mar del Plata is an incredible city.
Where did you live in Mar del Plata?
I forgot the address
None
I lived there and I went to elementary
Look at that.
For one or two years. I enjoyed it a lot.
When you were little
Yes, you were little
None
I enjoyed it a lot,
Yeah, Mar del Plata
Incredible
It's really nice.
It's beautiful. I remember we always went with my family to the restaurant
Los Angeles
That probably isn't there anymore
Do you remember the name?
None
La Marmita, sounds very familiar
Sounds familiar, maybe it's still there.
It sounds familiar, I don't know
It doesn't matter, we're going to talk. And speaking about housing,how
Speaking of housing
How much would it cost in a good neighborhood. Generally all neighborhoods are good in Mar del Plata?
In a neighborhood, I'm telling you the price doesn't vary much from one neighborhood to another
No.
No, it's another thing that amazes me. I'm still looking at it on the internet, it's not like I've gone there and spoken but
None
But no, the price doesn't vary much
It doesn't vary
An apartment
You want to tell me yes, something not very luxurious, Let's say a bedroom only
With a bedroom like that normal
Yes,
And between twenty five thousand and thirty five dollars
Well but is completely yours
Yes,
You can buy with thirty five thousand dollars
Compared to the ones that come out here, it really is cheap
Here you buy a bathroom.
Yes, there with that money you fix the roof of a house see, here is incredible
Exactly, but with twenty five or thirty five thousand dollars in Mar del Plata you can buy a one bedroom apartment, in any part of the avenue colon,
And there is for twenty twenty few, I would tell you in the avenue colon for example
Oh, when you are talking of twenty five, thirty five, you are talking
Of nicer neighborhoods with an ocean view or with
None
Yes or the center
How much it can cost if you go to buy a one bedroom apartment
They're in Philadelphia. Where you are now.
I don't know.
An apartment in Philadelphia, it depends, because I was talking about, you know, now that I am doing this
Yes
To a lot of people in Philadelphia.
Oh, really?
I have talked to a Paraguayan and one or two Argentineans.
Really?
In Philadelphia, and they say that basically it depends on what area of Philadelphia you live in
Yes
Everything is expensive
Yes
But how much will it cost, an apartment in Philadelphia may cost you, depending on where you buy it, it may cost you
I don't know, I have a
More than a hundred and fifty thousand
Exactly, three hundred thousand dollars
Yes, I have a friend who bought a house here. It is a big house, it's nice and it is in a wonderful area but it costed her three hundred thousand dollars
Right, no way
Yes,no
Happy.
Yes, we are happy. I'm the one who is more homesick. I don't know,I like Philadelphia.it's nice, it has interesting things.
Sure, because most of your family is in Mar del Plata
Sure
In Argentina
Yes in Argentina more than anything, in Mar del Plata well are my parents, my siblings and the rest are
You miss it the first year here
None.
Besides, in Philadelphia the climate is so extreme, you said that it's been like a year that you are here
Yes, yes. It's cold and hot
Basically you have the extreme heat and cold.
Yes,
You have snow.
Yes,
And a lot of snow in the east coast.
Yes,
Here in the California area is not like that, is not like that
It's very nice.
In the California area, where I'm at, you don't see snow.
Sure
It could be that it's cold,but it's a cold that doesn't kill anyone do you understand?
Sure. Yes.
It has change temperature for a contrary.
Your winter is very mild?
No, is very mild
Like a Buenos Aires winter.
What the buenos aires winter has is the humidity and much more intense that the ones in california
None
Because the cold you have in Buenos Aires, that you have in Buenos Aires is a humid cold
Yes
That generally,  I think is, basically, well the one from Mar del Plata is a little different But in Buenos Aires you have that cold that gets in your bones
Yes, well Mar del Plata yes also, terrible
It's like that, but not here. At most, there is a jacket on top and nothing else, it's not much.
No, here you have to buy thermal socks, thermal shirts, hats and gloves.
Yes, Philadelphia, the snow and have
Everywhere cold No
Perhaps you have to go out to shovel the snow from the door of your
Yes, you have to
House and
Me because since it's an apartment the person who manages it does it.
Yes the building managers,
Sure, but if not the people that have a house have to go out, they sell the shovels in the supermarkets
Okay
They also sell some things to get the ice from car's windshields, that's very funny
How did you end up in Philadelphia. Do you have friends, known acquaintances, etc?
Igot a job here
That's why, i understand now
Sure
There's a positive reason
Sure, the University of Penn is big
University of Pennsylvania, exactly
None.
Well, very interesting, what else can I say?
And you have to tell me
So you work at the University of Pennsylvania, where this study is
None.
I'm sorry, what were you asking me?
Tell me, do you have a house of your own or do you rent?
No, I was thinking of talking about the subject. No, I don't have a house of my own, and I don't think I ever will in the United States.
It's not my style and I'm not interested.  If I had a million dollars or more,
I would buy a house, but I'm really not interested
Yes
I'm not interested, I rent, I don't know what we would say in Argentina, it's just an ambient.
Yes,
Here in Los Angeles, California, they're called Bachelor's. It's a room where you have the bathroom that's complete and a kitchen.
And everything complete, I don't know how to say this,
Something like
Exactly, something for style.
How nice
I don't know how, well in Argentina we would call it
Yes it's like one big room
It's just one room. It's big enough for me
And for just one person, you live alone?
With it's private bathroom and private kitchen complete and close to everything, and the price that I'm paying
I'm paying three hundred and eighty three dollars a month.
Ah, that's very cheap
It's basically what you're, what kind of place are you renting in Philadelphia?
WE WITH, IT'S A TWO ROOM APARTMENT, IT HAS A BEDROOM
Igor
Yes good evening. Yes, my name is Ever and I'm speaking from Pennsylvania
Me too I'm in Pennsylvania.
What part?
In Pittsburgh.
In Pittsburgh, I'm in Philadelphia, we are four hours away.
Yes driving, driving more or less yes
Yes
I don't know it, but tyhey've told me that there are a lot of people who are also cold.
Yes, I think that Pittsburgh is a lot colder but yes, here it s cold and it's a pretty big city.
Yes they've told me there are a lot of Latins, Hispanics there
And have you been in Pittsburgh a long time
Yes more or less, I've been almost five years here, And you?
No, now I'm on my second year here.
You don't have much.
But, previously, I lived in Maryland
You moved to Philadelphia
Yes we moved up here
That's good
A little cold here
Today's subject appears to be about renting or being an owner
Housing, I rent, sadly I haven't had the chance to be an owner yet, and how do you say it.
IT'S SOMETHING  I THINK DEFINITELY BRINGS YOU BENEFITS
Where are you from?
I'm from Guatemala
I'm from Venezuela
Venezuela, nice, nice. I've been renting for several years, one of the reasons why I haven't managed to buy a house is because I've been moving around a lot, I haven't found
A long-term place
Yes, a long term place, the buying process takes at least a year and then it's not worth having something
You'll stay in that place a couple years to be able to
Yes
Get something out of it
I agree.
But definitively, I think it's a great benefit, first because when you rent all the money goes away, but when you buy a house it's a kind of investment, and eventually
You get it back
Yes, that's true. The only thing I see, since they ask pros and cons, well, it's always better to be an owner rather than, as you say, throw the money to the garbage
Yes
The pros and cons. It has to do with maintenance, because at least you're the owner
But when you are the owner, you assume all the responsibility of the property. I think that's the only advantage of renting
It's that for example, maintenance, it's in charge of the renter but of the owner, yes. Keeping the property maintained and paying the expenses.
Is the only advantage that I see of renting, no This
Yes
I agree with you that it is better to be an owner.
Yes,
And I put this example, because when one lives in a building complex or something for example, the one who rents doesn't have to worry if something gets damaged
To remove the snow, or mow the lawn, nor pay for those things. The administration of the properties is in charge of all that.
In fact I seen that many elderly, retired people who are already alone, who don't have enough for their expenses and their things at the end, rent.
They have their property and they rent it that way because they can't even be mowing the lawn nor removing the snow anymore.
Yes
Then they decide to rent
In reality, is perhaps.
I have very little time left and would not like to spend it cleaning the snow and mowing the lawn.
Exactly
FIXIN THINGS IN THE HOUSE, FOR EXAMPLE IN MY FAMILY THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE HOMEOWNERS AND WELL USUALLY THE HOUSES ARE NOT BOUGHT NEW, IS MORE COMMON.
Exactly
Is more common buying them used and what do you call it, always perhaps that the water heater breaks and that is a big expense,
It takes quite a lot of time to fix it.  a pipe breaks because of the cold, especially in these states
It's expensive to repair it.
And it's costly and I'm not sure how the law here in Pennsylvania is, but in Maryland they implemented a law that when it snows.
If the person who is the owner of the house doesn't clean what is the sidewalk where the people walk.
Where you walk, yes, yes
They can sue them and they will probably win
Yes, here is the same.
Smae, that I didn't know, and how do you call it? I always thought that law is somewhat strange, because if I see that it's not too good to
The person is not an owner anymore, rather it belongs to the government.
Exactly
Something you have to be careful about because I know many friends that when it snows say, I have to clean before someone falls and tries to sue me.
Yes one can get in a lot of trouble with that, even here, when you don't mow the lawn, here they also fine you. when it's too high
Really
The lawn, they also fine you, they come and give you a ticket with a warning.
That it should be cut and shouldn't be so high, even for that
In places where there are a lot of trees for the autumn a lot of leaves fall and that's another job that you have to
Exactly, maintenance and all that.  You have to have time and all to do it.
You have to take
That's why I think when I see the retirees they decide to rent because of that.
I 've seen a lot of older people and I've always asked myself what the purpose of advanced age already to be renting
Because the prices are the same, no, if you buy a house as what an apartment is sometimes. But in reality, when you analyze the situation well, those must be the reasons that they simply avoid
So much extra work and they live peacefully and don't have to worry about repairs.
Yes That's without counting any problem that there is, like, you were mentioning, like some bad pipes, a damaged plumbing here is very expensive to pay,
If an animal gets into your house whatever. they have to be able to pay, bear those expenses
You claim and they have to answer.
Yes
That would be, lets say the advantages, and the disadvantages, I would say, it is not yours it is a money that you are investing in something, in a property that you will have in the future
To give security to your children. well, and how good, I think that always in someway, to rent, against be an owner, it is always good to be an owner in someway, because at the end you are investing money month to month.
Instead of not habing it.
Yes, it is very true . No, I am not aware of the market here, but in Maryland In the last.
Seven years, the housing raised a lot and has become impossible to find a favorable house, but for those who bought in in, appropriate dates have made much money, because people who have bought.
Who have bought houses seven years ago for one hundred and fifty thousand dollars the houses now cost three hundred and fifty, four hundred And those are not very big houses and it is not necessarily
It is a very special place, but it has rise a lot, and they sell, and maybe buy something more modest and get a big profit that can be used for
ChildrenÂ´s study, personal savings, or investments and yes, people who have their time because they are helped now.
Yes well here in Pittsburgh. well there are many opportunities, the reality is, I have seen here, that people even when you do not believe it are investing in that
There are many houses like you say that are old. and that are not so bad, some are regular. but there is an evident business here
That dedicate to invest in buying houses and then repair them no, yeah, I have seen many people that are dedicated to it, even when there is an auction.
Yes
They make a business out of times when there is a very low down payment, and I have friends who repair investors' houses.
None
They put the money and buy houses, they repaired them And the sell them again here at a good price, no
That aspect, of course, there are of many prices.
None
There are different priced houses. Yes, you can still find regular houses. Not at a good price here too.
And they are making money, well
Yes, no, I knew that a while ago. in Maryland, the houses were really pricey, they'd call the HUD, the HUD were the ones that the government was reselling because of foreclosures and because people hadn't been able to pay them.
None
They were selling them at a really good price. Maybe the value of a house was one hundred thousand and they were selling them in seventy thousand.
Exactly
They would even give them an extra loan to invest in repairing the house with a very interest rate, that's what you were talking about, that's what they used to do
The ones that worked on that, the contractors, they would buy a house and they would repair it and resell it and they would easily make fifty thousand dollars.
In about three or four months.
No, it's like, that's happening here too and it's okay, it's a good business because I know they are doing well
Yes
It's an investment to buy this type of properties.
Yes
My name is Victor
Hello, Carla
My pleasure
Hello how are you?
My name is Victor, I am gay
Yes
Talking about couples,

Yes, he got a vice of drugs. I put him into a program. No, I didn't put him in action. Then, no
I haven't seen him again. He started to dance in the parties with the friends in the street I would let him go out, I would let him go out with women also.
I don't care if he was with women, he was bisexual.
Sure
I don't know but after nine, after nine years he left me for a woman and that hurt me a lot, and
He left with a woman one year.

And what a miracle a quick call today

It's different women who answer,  when I call

Yes, it depends who was near the phone, should answer.
You work in your own house? The job is in your own house?
None

I'm at work now
When repeating the couple thing, it was hard to break up to me. That couple broke up, something that didn't
I know, i can imagine but, what do i know, enjoy who you're with now
The truth is: I'm with a guy there
Is he there with you now?
Yeah, a twenty eight year old one
But is he there in your house now?
Yes
Oh, yeah? And didn't you live with a Chilean friend?
Yes, he lives with a Chilean friend of mine.

He's eating there. I can hear the dish.
Do you eat at this hour?

At this hour?

She's having dinner?
None
None
Yes, she's eating now
Hello
Hello? Good afternoon. My name is John, I'm calling from Vancouver, British Columbia Canada. What's your name?
Miriam, from Florida.
From Florida, nice to meet you.
Yes, a little far
Yes, where in Florida are you talking from?
Orlando.
Yes, like Orlando.
Yes.
I lived a few months near Orlando because it's an hour
Yes
Is not so far
And what do you think of, of today's topic?
How to break up with your partner?
Yes.
Well it depends is for example, I don't know, in how old you are but it depends on, the age of the person
Of one is like seventeen, eighteen years old, well is all natural to have a relationship for six months, a year and to break up and keep on again with another person. And it should be like that
None
I say twenty eight
None
How old are you?
Twenty one.
Twenty one.
Well.
And
I thought a little bit different at fifteen and sixteen years old.
They have a lot of differences then they broke up with the boyfriend, they start to cry but after a month, they forget about everything and have another boyfriend
None
But this also depends on the situation I for example, my parents meet when they were sixteen years old continuing up to now they're together, they've been together for about twenty three years together
It depends on the relationship of the couple
It's true because you learn to love other people at different ages, there are men who don't mature until twenty-nine years
How their family's relationship was
But remember one thing, that was a different world right? It was another time
None
There wasn't a lot of opportunity like one has in the world of today. I say that's why
None
Yes, today the world is more liberal
Yes.
The kids are much more liberal now. They like the fashion world, they like to wear this, trying new things. But, it's still the same, at sixteen, fifteen years old. In my opinion yes, they didn't know what they were doing
Yes.
But i think that after nineteen, twenty years, they have some, not everyone, some of them already have the idea, of what is that they want
I've been with my boyfriend for three years and it would be hard for me if we separated.
Yes
But i also have friends that are twenty two, twenty three years old, that have never had boyfriends and that don't want to have boyfriends
Right
Because they don't like being in a relationship, I mean, they like to have friends, right?,so to speak
Right
Everyone is different, and not everyone that is twenty eight or less is immature, they don't know what they want, it's easy to end the relationship and everyone
After twenty years, its very hard for them, it's not easy to categorize people by age or gender.
Every person is a different world
Yes, but I can only talk about my experience, I am thirty four years old.
None
I got married at twenty one
Wow
I separated two years ago
None.
In my situation, it was a mistake to get married at twenty one. I got married because my girlfriend got pregnant. I have a daughter that's
Twelve years old
NONE
The twenties were very hard for both of us because neither of us had the experience required
None
We were not mature enough
None
To achieve what we wanted to achieve and that is something that I see more, that the
What is the big rush to find a couple? If in
None
I think it is the fear, you think if I loose this one, if I break off with this one, I won't find another one. I had that fear too
None
When I broke off with my wife
None
I thought I would never meet again someone I would like, and specially that she likes me too
But, that is not true.  There is always someone else, other chances come.
Yes
But when you are young, you only think of
Yes
The very moment, that's what I saw. It was a problem because if hadn't been for these
Experiences, that you need to have in life, you need to have this maturity
Yes, I understand that I wouldn't marry even now
None
I know him for three years already, but anything can happen in one month, in one year, you never know.
No it's also all life not bad.
She has three children by different men, so far it has not been able to overcome that she is very impulsive.
None
We must take time to do things.
There is no use to rush things to happen.
You must know whether they will be together for a long time.
When I turned 21 to 25 I will be a little more mature.
It's good to make a mature decision
Yes
For example, IÂ´ve known my partner for 3 years
You never know a person one hundred percent
Yes
It is better now because when you are married everything is more difficult.
For example, I don't want to have children now
Yes, right?
We are
No need to have children after marriage
Yes.
At least for four or five years.
Yes
Do you live with your boyfriend or not?
Yes
Yes. And how long have you been living together?
We've been living together for two years.
To years? and
None
Why were you in such a rush to live together
Yes, it was, it was a rushed situation
Yeah
I was moving to another state, and I met him in New York, I was moving to Michigan
Then I told him that we cannot be together anymore even though I love him because a long distance relationship isn't going to work out.
Yes
He said, no, he wants to follow me to Michigan, he wants to be with me, this and that, and well, he convinced me.
And until now, since then you've been together
I don't really know. I cannot recall. They say I will get to know him in 4 or 5 years.
You will, now that you're 21, until you're 30, you're going to change a lot
You change, every year
Your desires are going to change
None
You change a lot. Yes, if a couple gets together when they're 20, the desires, the
The desires of each person changes too much between the ages of twenty and thirty, and it becomes harder if one already has, for example
If it already has a commitment, right?
None
I say that one that not have kids during that time.
Yes, and I, totally
And  when is, yes and that is what, continues with that, because
None
None
Yes. One is very well informed.
Yes, and that is the thing that unfortunately within our community, sometimes excuses are made, right? They don't educate themselves, but
There's so much information in Spanish
None
The same as in English,there is so much information about the controk
None
In every language, don't you think?
I'm Mexican, and in Mexico they still don't have all that information in all the places. There are still places that the people live in their ranches that
Their electricity is
Yes, I am half well
A candle
What part of Mexico do you come from?
Hello?
Hello?
Yeah
What's your name?
What?
What's your name?
My name is William
William, we're both here again.
Let me be perfectly honest, i have spoken with four or five people, i don't know exactly who's this
Inge
Inge, just like yesterday
Yes, just like yesterday, how are you?
Here cooking again, because I always cook at this hour.
Are n't you married?
No, I'm not married and i don't have a girlfriend or anything
None
I like to be a twenty eight year old man.
You have to cook for yourself
No, and I love cooking.
What are you making?
I am preparing a coated steak, with croutons
None
Beans today, because I think yesterday I didn't cook the beans too well. But I think today they are fine
The last time you were also preparing a coated steak
Yes, I love coated steaks. That's my favorite
How do you do it?
I think I don't do it like most Cubans do it, who use one of those thin steaks. I buy a sirloin steak.
What do you call it? It's like a cookie that is squashed. I put it on top, coat it and leave it.
I put onions on it, I put little green peppers and I cook it for at least half an hour.
In the oven?
I place it
None
I cook it in the frying pan
OK
In the frying pan. I had a bottle of wine today, because today I have to celebrate that I made a sale
A twelve thousand dollars sell. So
What do you sell?
I think I ca
What do you sell?
I sell fabrics
And so much money?
Twelve thousand dollars with a commission. Yes, a lot of money.
None
I sold a fabric of I don't know if you know much about the European designers how can you say
In the United States they know Gucci
None
There in Europe those people are nothing. In Europe what is known is Roberto Cavalli, Valentino, Emanuel Ungaro, people a little bit higher right. I sold a fabric,
Many yards. I sold like one hundred twenty, one hundred thirty yards at basically a lot of money. I'm very happy today. So, I don't care. Talk with me about whatever you want
Well, the topic is if it's easy or hard breaking up with the partner
Let me
You've had several partners right, of different types, of different ages, or no?
Yes, I've had several. let me ask you because if I'm not mistaken, you are married with kids.
Yes
What do you think? If it's hard, a thing, not very easy breaking up with a partner. You start.
You know what William? I think we already talked about this same topic.
Then, let's talk about something else.
And I think I talked it with you also.
Then let's talk about something else.
Yes
What do you like to cook?
Because i'm vegetarian, I'm not a very good cook. I don't know how to cook meat so that's why I asked you.
Yes
My husband is a carnivore, so I think he suffers with me
Your husband is the American, I remember now.
Yes, he doesn't cook either.
So, what do you do? You get only McDonald's, you go to McDonald's, you go on the road, where do you go?
Teach me,i don't cook, but, it's i do chicken and turkey and, but not red meat, no, because it's too hard to cook to get it right
Chicken, and that sort of stuff.
CHICKEN, THAT SORT OF THING,
The American eats that chicken.
Fine, a little cold, nothing else. I got a cold, i don't know where
Yeah?, what are you taking?
Just Vitamin C
Vitamin C?
Yes
Orange juice
What juice?
Orange juice, that's what has most Vitamin C, i guess, right?
Yes, i have gotten sick a lot this year, you know
Hey girl, what a coincidence we have... like three times
This hasn't happened with anyone though it has happened so many times?
No. I've talked with many Chileans, I 've talked with two Argentinians, one Puerto Rican, and a Mexican.
None
The only one I've talked to two or three times you could say
And I think that this is the third time, that we talk.
You've been the only one I've talked with three times so I don't think that we should talk about the same thing
Maybe you have something different to tell me.
No, truthfully
I live the crazy life like Ricky Martin, I work alot so I can make money for the weekend.
We go to the big parties around here.
Ah. How nice. Yes, well you're still young.
Well, you can't say very young. I think that in two years, I'll be in my thirties.
None
So I don't consider myself to be very young, but well, yes, I'm not married, I don't have to answer to anyone
And do you think in some moment?
What will I do.
Do you think you'll stay single?
I don't think I'll be single for a long time. I fell in love with a girl from South America. She was Argentinian.
I fell in love with her, but things got complicated, she wanted to get married for the paper and it was more for me.
Was honest with me, but I had to get it myself, you know
None
I had to talk to her, and get it out of her, and she didn't want to tell me, that's why I didn't do it, but to a good girl
Cares more about the interest than about love, so, you know
None
There are problems. I have met many like her in my life and believe or not, I grew up in Miami.
Know Miami well, Miami is exactly like New York
None
You must have more street than life. So I didn't fall into her trap. But never mind, women and men, we must go on, and
What can I tell you? I don't want to be alone. I know that someday I will find a girl or a woman, or a lady, or whatever
I'll marry her but i can't take it too hard
None
It's not easy nowadays to find a mature woman
Yes, I think so
We are really bad, right?
Yes
Between men and women
I think that sometimes men look for women much younger than them. I knew a couple who
She was Russian
None
The husband was thirty years older than her. Yes, I think that
Wow
Thirty years. What have in common?
Wo
My parents have about a twenty year age difference
Hopefully they use a lot of viagra.
But, thirty years. Look that she is
Tell her, tell her that I am going to send her three bottles of Viagra.
Look that she is twenty and he is fifty.
Oh, my God. But well
Yes, I say fine, sometimes men look for younger women because they are more beautiful, or more
Is that
But they can, they can, like, mold them, they are more, a little manageable
Let's generalize for a second: when you have that much money, you can do what you want with most women.
And there are many woman lend themselves for that.
Yes
As there are many women that believe in love, in the feelings,
That is true
But  in this country, when somebody offers you so much, is difficult to say no.
None
At least, me, I try to avoid that. I I am a six feet tall man, I have green eyes, black hair eh, I am neither fat nor thin, you understand me, but
That isn't either throwing the money to women, because after all, what woman doesn't like going out to eat to some fancy restaurant?
And this and that, but not setting the trap, you know, of 'I have a lot of money' no, not at all
And she is interested in something necessary because you are, more or less, buying her
Sure
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Tell me. I thought you were talking to me, excuse me. Tell me
Do you live with someone?
I am visiting my cousin and my grandma who live here in Holland
None
Do you live in?
We were in Holland not long ago
You came to Holland?
We took the children to disneyland
I don't live far, I live about fifteen minutes from there
Yes
Well by now.  In the next two, I've been two holidays here.  I think in the next twenty or thirty days, I'll move to Miami.
I think that something is going on between Mickey Mouse and Pluto, anyway.
Mickey Mouse has always his hand in Pluto's pocket. I don't know, I am a little confused with that. But anyway
My life is nice in Miami, because there is so much beach, so many people, so many Chilean girls, Argentinean, Bolivian, people from everywhere. Every nice place
And what part of Miami do you live in?
In a city called Cando. It is not a very big city but it is a city. I won't say exclusive, but
Not downwards
But that is near Miami, downtown Miami, isn't it?
Well, downtown Miami can be considered in many ways, but I am about ten or fifteen minutes from there
OK, not that far, then
A very nice place, really nice, already. and how are your, I wonder if it is sons or daughters
A son and a daughter.
HOW ARE YOUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS?
The big one is five
Everything fine?
And the small one is, he just turned four
And your husband, what's his name?  I guess he has one of those gringo names, Kenny or Jenny
His name is Daniel
Wow, Daniel
Yes
And you, you call him in English, Daniel?
It depends, if I am talking to him in English, then I call him in English, and if I am talking to him in Spanish then I call him in Spanish
I have never heard you speaking in English, how do you pronounce the name?
Hello I'm Alfredo, I speak from New York
How are you? You're speaking with George also from New York
Hello, George. How are you? I think we spoke once on another occasion. How is everything going?
There putting up with the cold a little sick
Yes and I believe that the topic also we've already touched on it look how things are
Seriously
If i remember well you it was another person that you had married a couple times something like that right
Yes I think that it was the same topic
The
Well for me is easy
I mean is not so hard finding more topics
Yes is hard
They should hire to do the topics.
Yes, there aren't a lot of topics. I think that a lot of topics
This
There are lots of topics but well let's talk again of the same topic that matters.
Okay
Like that we change opinion
Okay, have you changed your mind perhaps while thinking about it?
No the same and really for me it's been relatively easy
Yes.
There are some traumas. when you switch houses everything else, the relationship hasn't been easy to me
No, it has not been dramatic
I believe that you are still in love with someone
Yes, that's important, m
I believe that it makes a difference. It's not about getting used to a new house, like any other change of lifestyle.
And the pain goes beyond that, it's an emotional pain and
Yes
It hurts a lot
Yes it does but I think that I mean, in my opinion, I know that it's not the same for everyone
Like suddenly, I don't know, I spoke about this and I think he was coincidentally from Canada, about this same subject
Yes
A couple of times ago and they'd say that they were in the process, it was the third time and she told me that it was easier but she couldn't put up with it
The best thing was to end it, yes? She said that to me, I mean the process is going to end soon but it's not that easy, we are not prepared to
None
And I don't know if some break ups someone goes like one day in the morning they decide they don't want to go on, it's just screwed
Any of your friend had a big shock because of a break up
Which one has been more dramatic, the one that you've seen in real life?
Yes, I know of a man, some of my friends but the one that was worse was that of a man, he was in the military
None
And he was very bad tempered, the military style, those in our country who think that everybody is at their service, right?
There was no feeling
He recognizes all he has lost.
None
I think it is dramatic in these cases, specially when one of the persons has been unhappy with the other
And finally takes the decision, right?
Sure
So, maybe the other one never expected that reaction, right?, he always thought he had the situation under control
So, he discovers he is actually affected, that's some case, do you know any?
Well, mm, I think it is very interesting, but you made me think of another thing
Yes
Wait. Let me see. Wait. It's gone now. Let me remember. It was about
What? what?
I just don't remember now, but when you were talking I thought I'll say this
Oh, I see
Now I don't remember what I wanted to say, something you made me think of
About breaking off, of some friend, the situation is that someone had the other dominated, but the other broke off, right?
Yes, now I remember, sometimes you think that you are the one who broke off,
When, when they want to break, some people to avoid doing it themselves
None
Start to behave, start a behavior that is intolerable for the other
None
I mean that will provoke, will provoke fight that will obviously end in that it ends
None
But sometimes, sometimes it starts like the opposite of what the other wouldn't think
Like this situation
I have seen that move many times.  If someone wants to break up, he will start not saying where he's going, or behave badly in other ways so that eventually
Yes
I mean that ends is another way of doing it
Yes the other person is the one who makes the decision and takes the blame, right
That is exactly what it is
Something like that right? yes that is also look that is perceived in some cases, or maybe they do it voluntarily, right
Yes
And maybe in some cases one doesn't decide and suddenly starts to fall because the other says no no let's go see you later
Yes, it's hard that I don't think that mate the ten percent of the
Of the couples I mean some are let's end with this issue that doesn't work anymore
What percent?
I don't think that more than ten percent, perhaps twenty percent. I think that the majority (don't) put up with it.
Each ten or twenty percent
And that are honest in saying no, it's over
NONE
I don't know if you agree with me. I don't think the percentage is very high. The majority of the people put up with hope
I think a lot economic situation for the kids or for excuses
None
I think this, no, I think
You think that marriages are really not what they seem in the end.
Yes I sincerely think this, I've seen a lot that people hold on
Yes but so that
And sincerely, I've seen it
Yes
So I think that it's difficult but I don't know, ten years what do I know, I don't know if I'm wrong, no, but I've seen many people, a lot of people
Who play you
Yes
There are like hmm, yes, living life, that's it
None
I don't know what your opinion is.
Well I think that speaking on this topic that they gave us
None
I think that we were also talking about this and our time ran out
Yes
It's a variable like too much. They say that it gets harder or easier with age
I think that we have to take time, the age you have
Yes
Two, the length of that relationship, because, for example, it could be very difficult
None
For a fifty year old person that's been with someone since twenties
Yes
A sixty year old person divorced twice and has a one year old relationship
Those are very different cases, but I think age does influence in the way that when you mature there are more things that have happened to you
You're also more emotionally scarred in life
None
I think break-ups are easier with age.
Is long, but the length of relationships is almost the same as age
Yes
That's when, that's when i think
Yes, i agree, lets say there's more experience, right?, hello?
An experience that
Hello? We have that with age there's more experience, right? I don't know. Suddenly I'm thinking about the woman.
Suddenly it's harder because of the age, I don't know if feeling lonely or in a completely different situation..
Yes
Unprotected but,
Lets say that is the change of life, we were talking about change of life, so the difference is that if someone has not changed his life style or his way
Yes. It is difficult.
For so much time and after that, it changed drastically, that shock is very strong
I think there are the two of them.
Yes
A part for some that lets say have experience and all could be more easy, for others that really rested on their laurels it is going to be very difficult, I donÂ´t know right
We have hit the mark.
Yes
If we have the same topic the next time we are going to be masters in beginning all the different parts that we could
Yes of course
Without notifying of this encounter
Yes
THE
Really I hope another topic for a change
I was just going to see how many studies are left for me, How many are left for you?
I have not seen it the last week I was something sick, something busy and I think it was really like four days and
Without talking
Yes. No, I have more. I think that.
Yes
Yes, i got
And I really haven't even had the time to look out how many
YOU HAVE SEEN SOMETHING CAME, IF YOU HAVEN'T STARTED THE CALLS, I NEVER START THE CALLS
Yes
But if you start five calls from five different phones, it seems
Oh yes
And they pay you fifty more dollars
Yes, there's a special bonus or something, besides i'm very busy
I was going out now

I don't think so.
I don't think so well, i don't know
None
I, no, last week, I don't think so
Well, it's
I think
This is the first time we speak
No, i don't

Because, it's the first time I got the same subject.
Oh, do they repeat them?
None.
I didn't know.
Me neither

Yeah
At the same time, I really don't remember.

Yeah, i don't know. it's all the same
Uh huh
So, what are you doing, what do you work in?
I'm an insurance agent and i help the employer, he employs us for two or three weeks
Yes
To explain them their benefits.
The
And we go to different states in the United States, and we explain them to them, here i am in Virginia
Yes
We're over in three days, and
None
Since the company pays for everything, I took the chance to travel and went to the capitol.

Sure, of course. That's also why they need you, to
To be able.
Or, is it all in english, what you speak there?
I speak only Spanish.
In spanish, right?
None
Look at that. That's good
They give me a computer and i explain it to them; but i have notice that more often than not, they don't want any of the opportunities that they're offered, whether it's because the papers aren't there
They're not citizens, they don't want to because they'd have to leave. They don't want to pay for all the benefits, but
The people. The employees.
They need it very much, the employees, yes
Yes
Because they offer them life insurance, insurance
None
Really cheap, twenty cents a week.
Oh, that's not cheap.
Yes, where do they want them?
None
I explained to them that there has been a lot of cases where they dies because of an accident, and their family could
They're left with nothing.
Yeah, nothing
Sure, some understand and get it
NONE
They listen to you
They will at least know the others
Sure
Because they push them a lot
And, yes, sure
None
Later thay can have problems apart
None
With those things. And from what, from what city, at what age did you come here
Yes.
At what age did you come to the United States?
What? No. Yes, here.
Has it been long?
Third generation.
Okay.
Yes, my grandparents.
Your grandparents had already come.
Yes, they had come young, and have lived in Texas since they were children.
You that was born here, let's say.
My parents are also from Texas
In texas, sure.  they went there first, and then went
Yeah
Look, look at that, look at that, look at that.
Yeah
Now that you tell me, I don't know. I'm not sure.
None
Are you? I'm from, from Buenos Aires
Yes?
I don't know if
That's nic-
If I already talked to you, maybe. I don't remember
Yeah
It could be. I'm here in Philadelphia.
You live in Philadelphia.
No, I don't live here. But, I arrived here about a month ago.
Yes? Group meeting, okay. okay, Okay
Yes
One moment
Yes, no problem
I don't have
You're working, they're talking to you
Yes
And it's good to get a little time off for this
One minute, yes
It's good talking here, they  pay well
Okay, pardon.  Yes.
Are you going to return to your house now? You work until much later.
No. No. No. I left work. I'm in the hotel and we are immediately, the rooms where my coworkers, my friends,
You are in the hotel the whole time, right?
They've called me, yes.
Since you travel so much, you are all in the hotel.
Yes, I like to travel with them. Because, the assignments that they send us where I'm alone, I don't like because it really is cold
Sure
That's what scares me a lot
SURE
But, this topic of the, the couples and the break up,
Ah, the topic
My opinion is yes
And you, what are you? Are you married?
Because, I'm, I was married  for twenty years. But, not really married. Yes we were legally married, but, he had a drinking vice
He liked women. And we were separated for a long time. For almost fifteen years.
For fifteen years separated.
Separated, yes.
How bad.
Yes he was
None
And I was stubborn. I was saying, he's going to get well. But he wouldn't get well, and I had two children
Sure, he's going to stop drinking, he's going to
So I said,
He's going to
I said he'll get better and he'd go and drink with his friends like he was a young man
Sure, and was he also cheating on you? Do you know.
Excuse me? Hello?
I was saying that if he had cheated on you
Oh yes,  he had a lot of women, yes. So,
What were you thinking,
I don't want to have a relationship with a man, i'll stay single forever and they used to say marry
Bother me I didn't want a man, oh, well I didn't want them near my daughters because I was so scared of them.
How many girls do you have?
Just two and they are now twenty five and twenty six years old, I'm forty four years old now.
Two daughters.
I married young, outside.
How?
None.
You are
Paying attention because they are giving us the instructions for tomorrow because they always change our time.
None
Tomorrow comes out that perhaps it wasn't the time we thought
And they are telling you, that now you have to go.
They want us to change the time, to see who would volunteer to go.
There's no drama, there's no problem.
Yes.
So, then, you passed,
None
You separated
But
Well, no, but not all men are.
Yes, I separated
Are the same.
No, it's true because dad was very nice with mom.
There are some worse ones.
That is true. And then, yes, after my kids grew up I said, Well, we are getting divorces. And I stayed,
That's it.
For seven years, I've been divorced.
Sure.
Then now, no
And now you are with no one. It's good.
I said, this time already passed.
And what do you think, that the separation is hard, that they threw in the topics?
I think that if the person gets used to having a new relationship, yes is easy one would get used to the person.
Yes that, if you are able, of those people that are always with someone you say? Something like that? That is,
Exactly.
None
None
Easy.
I think so. Already having experience, because I've known a lot of people that have relationships, they end fast, they break up.
But they are always with someone.
And, they are fast and yes. They are always with someone. some people don't like to be alone.
There are things that surely don't last long. Sometimes is that type of person, right?
Correct, then
Because is a person that is a couple of months, at most a year. Then,
What I do regret, is that
They go out with another one.
I regret that one of my daughters doesn't like Oh, really? we can go Friday Aha. Oh me too.
The flight is tomorrow and our day is ending already
You are already returning, returning to Indiana.
Different areas My colleagues come from Texas
I can imagine.
Yes, they have  we are sometimes thirty, forty. But,
Sure, are they all Spanish speaking or no? No, all of them.
Yes, all this group is,
They are all Spanish speaking.  The majority from Mexico, right?  With roots...
Yes, correct
Mexicans, I can imagine.
Well, one.
Okay. What are you telling me? That your daughter doesn't like what?
Well, yes, my daughter has a very bad idea of marriages because she saw me suffer so much with my marriage
Sure
She's scared to have a relationship with any guy and she likes many guys
Girlfriend relationship, or everything.
Relationship of girl- all complete.
Oh everything? Ah, everything.
Yes, completely. And, I feel guilty, because, the poor girl didn't see good opportunity. But, yes, her grandparents had a good relationship, they had a good marriage,
Sure. Yes.
And, the fact that they had a lot
Much
That's true. We have out things because we buy food, like that, we made a... because some of us
What happened?
Some of us, had a car assigned to us, right?
Yes, they give you a car when you go, in general
A car
That's good
A friend told me, i have a friend that's from Spain
Yes
And from work, andhe tells me, the cars are the ones you take when you go shopping?
The carts.
That's it, the carts, but it's a car, a what? A vehicle
A vehicle, sure
None
And sure, well, they call it different in every country
I feel like .
Even if they're all of Hispanic language, they always, they're always named
Yes
Different
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon. My name is Blanca.
How are you, Blanca?
Fine, thanks. Wait a moment, please.
Yes, of course.
Yes. Tell me. Hello?
I'm here, yes.
SORRY, WHERE ARE YOU CALLING FROM?
I live in Colorado.
I live in Phoenix.
In Phoenix?
None
And how are the temperatures over there today?
It's cool. It's cool.
The winters over there are not so bad, right?
No, they are not so bad.Not as horrible as over there in the east.
Where are you from originally?
From Colombia.
From Colombia
Yes
My favorite singer comes from, Shakira.
Shakira, but i'm not from Barraquilla
YOU'RE NOT FROM BARRANQUILLA, WHERE ARE YOU FROM, CALI?
I'm from MedellÃ­n
Medellin, imagine that.
Right, from Mede
Your land is beautiful, it's a shame there are so many problems there, right?
Yeah, like every country, i think.
Of course
The same problems happen currently in every country
It's everywhere including here
Exactly
What do you think about couples break-up?
There are times in life where it's easier to break a relationship than others
Yes, it's true
Yes, i think so
And have you experienced that in the past?
Yes
Yes
I think that when you're young, it's easier to break up
So,
When one has already gone through other relationships and there's more maturity, one faces with more maturity and more sense a break up.
Is
They are going to cause pain
Yes, I think it helps you overcome because I went through that experience a few years ago when it was my divorce
None
WHICH IS A GREAT BLESSING?
None
It was hard for me, and I think that it was hard for my daughter to see her parents separating and,
She has to be going from one place to the other all the time. But, she had adapted quite well because the parental relationship
It's quite good and that helps my daughter a lot.
Yes, when I was young, I had a boyfriend for a long time, and we broke up, and for me it was
Horrible. I wanted to die. And, after, I had a boyfriend, a long time also, I was the one who broke up the relationship, and for me, things became easier.
Yes. Is true
I think that before, it was kind of hard because I was young. But now, later it was easier because I already had experience, I was more mature, already,
I already knew what a relationship that didn't lead me to anything and that wasn't good for me. Then, it was either stay in a relationship that wasn't going to lead to anything
Or end it.
Exactly.
One already looks at things more objectively
Makes one be more careful, in my case, since I'm still single,
At the moment, right?
None
It would be much more discerning, careful
Right
On things like that, I wouldn't be impulsive, I wouldn't get carried away by beauty and stuff like that
Yes
But i would analyze other more mature aspects of a relationship
THAT'S TRUE
And, you have children, right?, a little boy next to you, yes
Yes, and, i have two
That's good, it's nice.
I have two little children,  i have a
Yes, how old are they?
I have a girl, one and a half years old, and a three year old boy.
That's nice and cute.
They're both little
Yes,  they get better as they grow up,  my little girl i have so much fun with her now compared to when she was little, although she has always been lovely
I do so many things with her and she asks so many questions. She's hungry for learning.
None
The experience is nice
Yes, that's true.
And is your husband from Colombia also?
No, my husband is from Guatemala.
Oh, from Guatemala, and the
My husband is from Guatemala, yes.
You met him here in the United States?
I met him in Massachusetts.
I've received many calls from that part of Massachusetts, and from Pennsylvania also.
Yes.
People that live there from the Fisher program. It seems like there's a lot of people in that area, especially Argentinians.
There are a lot of Argentinians in that area.
I have received many calls from Argentinian people.
Yes. And you talk to people of the opposite sex. Have you talked? Yes?
Yes.
Yes, until now, this is my second, I'm starting another.
Yes, yes
Well, up to now I've only gotten to talk with ladies, and the great majority, is funny, they are from Argentina.
Oh really?
Yes.
The work with this agency is good?
Working with them?
Yes
Yes, and did you start the program recently?
Yes, not long ago
I'm still waiting for them to pay me the first term. I ended it like two months ago.
Yes
The thin is that they extended the cals from twenty lives to thirty, but they made a mistake.  They started calling me home again.  Well, they added even more.
Yes
I have thirty five calls completed, and i still have four more to complete, that's what i think they haven't payed
None
I'm starting another now and this one I believe when they're four.
None.
Yeah, it seems like a long time, but there comes a time when it ends, you have twenty five, right?
I haven't been able to finish
Well, it's a know university, Penn State and yes, they will pay you
None
I also like the experience, that I can talk
The
With people from other countries too
Exactly, the cultural exchange? that's the best.
You don't have to be talking about it all the time.
The people who want to see it, like we interact. How do you say it, interaction.
These are the forms of expression and interactions of different regions.
Exactly.
None
Like that, they study all .
None
There are all these issues to talk about, but I notice that I can take any issue. For example, the issue of Colorado, where I love and live.
I already have twenty-six years here.
In Colorado.
IT'S A VERY BEAUTIFUL PLACE, I LOVE IT. BUT I SAY WHEN
Does it snow there?
It snows a lot but in the city it doesn't snow as much. The mountain that I've been to, the winter is up to now more than a hundred and twenty inches.
Oh, God.
Here in the city, a very small amount of snow has fallen. But, in December there was a cold spell that was below zero.
None
And that's terrible cold, but
No, tell me, I lived in Massachusetts for five years, and the cold
Because of the humidity and because of the cold, Colorado wins on that count.
It's humid and it's cold as fuck. Last winter left me like terrorized because we stayed inside, closed up, my husband
With my babies.
Yes.
We had just arrived from Colombia, because we were spending Christmas over there.
Yes.
And, there was a very strong snowfall, a storm. And we stayed locked up in the house, isolated, with the snow up to the top of the door, that we couldn't couldn't go out.
Don't tell me.  yes, we've had.
No, not anymore.
Ah, times like that here, that it snows and one can't go out anywhere, the planes can't take off from the airport. yes, it's bad. But, on the other hand, here we have one of the most beautiful summers that you can see.
They are very sunny, very clear blue sky
Yes
And at night, because of Colorado's elevation, which Denver is like a mile of elevation, well the stars look very beautiful, I love them.
Yes
And, my daughter likes it, I tell here, you are a Colorado native, because she was born here.
None
Her mother is from Oaxaca, so she has Puerto Rican and Mexican blood.
Yes.
Is the funniest thing, because she from one house to the other,
None
Change the accent. She starts to try to talk like
According to the place she's at.
My accent is pretty well .
Talks a lot Mexican. Kind of strange
Yes it's that, because you told that you were Puerto Rican, but I felt the accent was like Central American, almost Nicaraguan.
I don't know how it is these days but I've been here about twenty six years. I'd think that I wouldn't been speaking so much like a Puerto Rican.
There in Puerto Rico, i know that I talk like a Mexican when with my family and all that
Yes.
Because I have, but nothing, I think that I have a little bit of everything, because I have friends from everywhere. I Colombian, Mexican, Puerto Rican friends, from everywhere, Cubans
MORE THAN HALF OF THE TIME, I'M SPEAKING ENGLISH ALSO BECAUSE I WORK IN A PLACE WHER THEY ALL SPEAK ENGLIGH.
I don't talk about that
Why?
I SPEAK ENGLISH
That shouldn't bother you, that comes as you learn it. The most important thing, Blanca, is that you have the desire.
Well, I'm interested, and in fact I, babbling here
That's the most important, that I lost the fear, and even though you say disparates in the beginning, but, little by little the fear gets broken, and after that, you're learning even more
I spoke terrible English when I arrived here in the United States. Now, I'm pretty fluent in both the written and oral language.
I speak it very well. But, I don't think it was easy at first.
And how is Colorado for finding work?
It's good, but you know the laws here about immigrants, they are getting tougher everywhere. But, it's a place where there are a lot of immigrants working all around here.
Here the pay is awful.
Yes, here.
The salaries in Boston are competitive
Yes,here they pay more than in Arizona, definitely.
We moved here, but I keep repeating, I want to go back to Massachussets.
You can go to Massachussets, you can try Colorado is a nice place to live, there are good work opportunities for Latinos, do you have all your papers in order?
Yes, yes, yes. I'm a resident. My husband has been a citizen for eight thousand years.
Yes, that's good
Hi?
Hi Fede
How are you?
Hi
Who is this?
What, who's this?
What's your name?
How are you?
Fine
Fine
What's new?
I'm here dude
It's a coincidence to find you here.
What a coincidence
What a coincidence
Are you fine?
What's new? where are you right now?
I'm here at home now.
Very well.
Yes, i just finished having dinner.
What did you have for dinner?
Martin, he left a roast he made the other day with
That lamb?
Yeah
A gross lamb
Right, i just finished, I've been eating that everyday until today, so
It wasn't tasty?
It was good, it's porotos, that lasts a couple days in the fridge
Yes
Well
Whatever you want
A week it's fine.
But, what? you cook-, do you heat it again every time you take a little?
I take a little and heat it up.
Sure, yeah.  You heat it up, again, so it can last a lot.  Every time you boil it, it lasts a week longer.
NONE
Three or four days have passed.
But
And you're not sure, there's not much time, so you boil it again and that's it, but the problem is when some bacteria or something grows there
Yeah, i put it in the freezer.
Yes
And got a little bit every time he had lunch or dinner
No, it doesn't matter.
Besides he
A week doesn't do anything
How much did he cook and when?
Excuse me?
Yes, Martin cooked it on the weekend, so
Yes, it's OK
None
You want more and you want to store it for longer, you boil it again,
And then it's like it's new. If something grew, you killed it by boiling it
I killed it, okay. Okay.
You killed it
But I already ate it all, so
How's everything? The cat?
The cat is all right, she's ok, sleeping
THAT CAT IS REALLY MEAN
No, she's calm
Very mean
I downloaded all this stuff from the PC but I still don't have internet. I'm going crazy
Why isn't the internet on yet?
This looks like.
They're giving us internet at six in the afternoon
But to me, when I installed it here, they gave me a date and it was going well long before that
Yeah, i mean, i tried it yesterday, today, but, there's no thing to do. It'll be on around the twenty four but i really don't know
That's odd.
Being without internet sucks, i swear, even more when you have nothing else to do, I'm telling you
Yes
If you were studying, that would be something different, but
And, are there any internet cafe's there?
I don't know, i didn't find any
Some place where you can connect in?
There aren't any
Library in your faculty, have you gone to the faculty?
Yes, i went, the thing is that, well, i have to go all the way to there if i want to, it's ok, i mean
When do you start class? You don't have to leave now, do you?
No, I'm just starting on the thirty, it seems
That's late, isn't it?
Pretty late, why?
I'm cooking some pierogis.
Did you buy or make them?
I bought them
You bought them, yes, Martin would buy them at the beginning.  It's  been a long time that we don't buy them, but yes, at the beginning we would buy a lot of pierogis like that, just oil and onion nothing more.
Yes, olive oil which is healthier.
Like that Olive oil. How yummy
If you want I'll give you some to taste through the phone.
Well, if not today, I'll be there tomorrow.
I'LL SEND YOU A FAX OF RAVIOLI, MAN TOMORROW YOU'RE COMING?
The pierogi. Yes. Yes.
You're coming in the car or in the Chinese?
No, in th car.
You are driving
Yes
Very good, because
Yes, because the Chinese leaves you in the middle of nothing
None
And I don't know well from where to where it goes, but I'm not sure where it leaves from
None
Is not there, is that here inside the city the stop of the Chinese.
Yes. And the greyhound?
It's in the outskirts. The Greyhound is also closer, to see the football stadium, or the
Yes
Baseball, or any of those two is like behind that. And but, it comes out let's see, it comes out twenty to go and twenty to return, it's forty.
And with the car I don't know, with thirty I go and come. I think.
Is like that.
So I think I'm going in the car, for now,if I decide that no, tomorrow
I don't know, I say, why drive alone well it's a downer.
Yes. Is kind of a downer.
It still is not that much.
No.
Besides that Juancito for one year that was here in Philadelphia would go three times a week to Baltimore because he was going, going to the university there.
Really?
Yes, Juancito studied there he did the -M-B-A in, in the university of Baltimore, Where? In
University of Baltimore?
The University of Maryland, I think
Driving up to here.
Yes.
What desire.
Yes. He would travel three or four times per week.
Look at that
Very funny, in a peugeotite, Juan's peugeotite, you didn't met him
Why didn't he do the MBA?
None
Uh, closer to Philly?
He did a year there, and he got transferred after that, transferred to
Oh, sure, but i don't understand why he didn't do that from the beginning
Because he didin't know. And besides, Maryland was very good and
Sure
I don't know
It's ok
Well, the thing is that it was good too. But I don't know why he decided like that
Yes, sometimes when you don't know universities well
Yes, besides he signed up from Argentina, i don't know how he did that
You don't have a clue, you go where you think is best
Yes, but
Is everything OK with you?
Everything's fine
Work?
Are there any novelties around Baltimore?
No, walking a little bit, no, everything calm, the truth is I don't have, I don't have a lot, just these days, like I finished doing everything I need to do
Very good.
So, for now, since I'm half
With this, did something happen with the truck?
No because you know that the cars parked there, two blocks
Sorry?
IT KEEPS BEING PARKED IN THE SAME PLACE.
With the same crash?
Yes.
Look at that.
It doesn't have the ticket you see, the ticket that the police left it doesn't have more
Yes.
I imagine that someone has taken it, they didn't move it, I don't know. I went to look for the report.
And called those who needed to come, and all the options, and everything, but no, it came back the same money that if we had to return it
Nothing more happened.
That's good to eat
You have to eat, what are you doing now?
No, I called because it takes him fifteen minutes to come here.
That's good.
No, the little onion is already getting black. It's time to put the pierogis on the casserole.
In the pot
In the pot
Dude, and are you not going to see Juan this weekend?
No, I don't think so
And
No, the weather's crappy.
DID YOU TOLD HIM YES? I HAVEN'T ASKED HIM YET
Tell him you spoke to me and that we're going
Why are you mean to Martin?
Tell him, Oh, I'm sotty, i can't..., tell him, Oh, it's a shame I won't see him because they leave on Friday morning and
Tell him that, and I won't see him.
Why are you so mean?
I'm like that, don't complain
Oh, that's sweet, i want to
Really good, yesterday was
I miss the
Exceptionally good
None
I said let's not order at Japollo because sole is there
There was no agreement.
It's good at Japollo
Without Sole being there
Very well, very well, it's OK
I saod, well, i don't know, it's something that Sole eats, but no, it seems everyone liked Japollo's
It's very tasty
Yeah, but yesterday
I liked it very much
I went there and it was delicious
I think you didn't ask for that anymore
Delicious, the squid?
That's at the hot peppers.
Not the ones from hot pepper, no, not the ones from hot pepper because there were less people there
Yes, but
They're very good.
And. but they have those really spicy things
Very noble, at least it's equally noble.
It cleanses your whole
If you have any sin, it removes it
Is that true?, that if you eat something spicy, like if you have something
Frightened
I won't ask you, oh this thing that I'm asking is so stupid but I don't know
Yes.
If you eat something spicy or hot, does it clean your system from some types of bacteria?
No.
No, it has nothing to do with it.
No, what do i know
And why does people
Yes but, no.
None
I don't know, which question.
It's all right.
I have no idea.
How is Caro?
She's saying, Hi to you Caro
Send her one.
Yes. She says it's a shame that we can't see each other. How are we?
That's silly
Go skying
When are you leaving then? You still have to use your new skates?
Yes, what do I know, you see? I don't know, I don't know, we'll see how much
Do you own skydiving clothes?
Four minutes, I give orders from my phone. It's always a good thing.
Don't you have a timer in your kitchen?
We did, I gave her orders so that she would
None
It's very important for me to give the orders, otherwise nobody would do it.
Yes.
And that's a shame.
It gets out of control.
It's sad, as they say it.
So, you like to give orders.
No, I don't like to. I like to give orders but if I don't do it
How?
They would all do as they wish, it'd be a real mess
How is your sister?
You really have to control her because she
She's nice.
She misbehaves
She does?
She misbehaves, a lot. She does things that she shouldn't do.
What are you gonna do about it? Nice people sometimes behave badly
In the ass so it will behave
It likes it there
How much time do we have left? No. Just finish
You ask me all the questions.
What do you want me to talk about?
What do i know?
Well, I'm in the lab today. Sure that's finally finished. Yes, Grant
None
And just as she finished her grant, she submitted it, and came to the lab to mess with me
To ask results?
Yes, to interrupt, it's nothing to do
None
Everyday, but well
Well.
We have to freeze to death for some particular reason
Could you justify that you didn't do anything, or how was it?
Hello, good evening
Hello. Good Evening. My name is Veronica.
Hello, how are you? My name is Ever
How are you Ever
And where are you calling from, Veronica?
Well, the couples, where are you from
I am from Guatemala but I am calling from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
I am from Argentina, I am calling from Washington, DC.
So we are nearby
We're fairly close. what can you tell me about couple break-ups, have you had to break up a lot.
I believe that if one of the topics that they said was that if you changed your age, I definitely think that while
When the person is older I believe it is easier depending on the relationship, no?
It seems to you that is is easier, I understand that it is harder. Yes, I believe that the more you mature to be able to think about some things or to be able to
Become independent? What do i know thinking about longtime couples don't function and stay together, this is the story of a family if there are children and other things.
It affects you negatively to be able to make a decision to break a relationship
When you are talking about already having children, it's not just a couple. We are talking about a marriage.
That is much more distinct than what I thought the topic was. I imagined that it was perhaps a boyfriend / girlfriend thing, or something like that.
Than a prior relationship let's say less formal.
If in a marriage I believe that there are a lot more things to analyze and it is definitely more difficult to break it up, it's not a matter to just say it and
She left me and at some other point I will meet someone more appropriate for my lifestyle
For your project, what are you doing in Pennsylvania? The breaking of couples is not a topic for me, but I am going to make a question to you. Do you think is more common here
Couples in the United States than Guatemala.
Yes, it seems to me it is a lot alike because here you wait first, and people do not get married righ away.
The person is going to get married
I THINK THERE ARE MANY BREAKING IN COUPLES OF A LIFE, AVERAGE AGE OF BREAKING HERE
Is between twenty eight years old
Yes, in the university campus where I work, there are some American girls who are twenty four, twenty three years old.
They are worried about getting married or finding a partner to get married
Yes
Yes, I don't know because of the age.
It is like they are not interested in crossing the twenty-five years old with a definition. I even have a workmate that
She is fine in her relationship, but she is twenty-five, with almost three years as a girlfriend, and as the boy doesn't want to get married.
She is thinking of ending the relationship and find someone who wants a marriage
The truth is that it sounds very
No it catches my attention because if you tell me Argentina I can tell you that if
It happened.
But here I have an image well but it is that what happens to me not sometimes I have a more liberal image and I live more conservative behaviors
Yes for the truth is not the experience I have had in my case regularly I have seen more liberal people but how is it called definitively is going to be everything right?
But when it comes about your friend I think she has the reason because I think if she has been with a boy for three years and is twenty five years old and there are not plans to
A marriage.
Formalize then, and I think that in your case i would do  the same.
Are you in a couple?
Yes I'm married
You're married. Has it been many years?
It's been five years
It's been five years.  Do you have kids?
Yes I have one who's two years old
It's hard thinking of breaking up and there being kids in the middle
Yes, it is quite hard because not only do you think of yourself, but you also  think of them.
In the style of life they would have in the in how hard it would be for them because they are used since babies right? of being with the father and the mother and suddenly
They are not together. Besides that, they are separated as far as the economic lifestyle also becomes harder.
Sure
For the kid, right? Then I think that there are many factors that should be taken into account.
Yes that's true
Are you married?
That's true. Although, I see many of my students, undergraduates of the university, working on some family issue.
At least 80% have parents that are separated.
Yes
And then like in reality that really grabs my attention right seeing twenty four, twenty five year old with this of yes yes I want to get married
And the other face, a seventeen, eighteen year old that with one of the parents
Yes, it's correctly
When the kids are around ten years or more, and the parents get divorced
None
I think, when they are three or four years, the parents get divorced
When they are teenagers
Yes, when they are teenagers they struggle a lot because they can't move on, but when they are babies, they accept it.
Yes, it's like when they have a style and different family structure, so they don't miss the image of their old family.
They don't long for that old family.
Yes
I don't know, what do I know!
Sure, I hope, my advice would be to do it quickly, right?sure, my advice would be to do it quickly, right?
Sure, well I too have, for example, two of my mates, no, I'm thirty five years old and the parents got divorced when they were already adults
My friend in Puerto Rico is separating and believes it should have happened a long time ago
They value the efforts of their parents to have kept the family and home structure
The reason why they stayed together is because they are waiting for the kids to
To reach a certain age in which they will go to university or about to leave the family home and
They decide to divorce then when it won't really affect them
Sure
I don't know if you friend is in that case but
I think so, yes.  They are all adults and it'll still have some impact.
Lots of questions and abvove all, my friend married her partner and it changed her a lot.
Sure
She is married and doesn't have children yet, but she questions her own relationship and the way it affected her. I believe that it does affect the experience that you are having and what you were saying
That the hardest thing has to do with the role-models right, the parents at that time
Yes
I don't know
In which university do you work or study?
I'm in the University of Maryland.
I graduated there!
You graduated here?
In two thousand and three
In which department?
I was in biochemistry, and in
None
Cellular biology
One of my friends works there; I believe she enrolled in 2003 but I am not sure I remember.
So you are from this area
Yes, I was raised in Maryland. I came here when I was seven years old and I grew up in Maryland and
And where did you live?
It was close to the university, I used to live in Highs Bill.
I'm in graduate hills, this complex next to the university
Yes, I know where it is; it's the university garden
The other one is in University Boulevard.
I know which one it is
It's just at the exit of the university, but the other is closer
Yes.
More to the east side. What are you doing in Pennsylvania now?
I'm in third year of medical school.
Medicine is a masters, right!
Yes, it's a major, you have to do a masters and sometimes they get one, they finish, and they get to go to med school
That's different, i don't know how it is in Guatemala, because in Argentina it's three, straight with eighteen years, the medical career
It's seven straight years here, right? It's the same in Guatemala.
Is college public in Guatemala?
There are both public and private ones
Is the public school prestigious?
For medicine, I believe that the public has a better prestige than the private ones, but
The same happens in Argentina
But the problem with the public one is that when there are what they call huelgas, like strikes
Yes.
They lock down the university indefinitely.
