In the beginning
Sure
How do i tell you, they are better than the rest and don't take care of their clients
Already, they don't receive the people like before.
Yes,
They have the luxury sometimes of picking their clientele
Yes, you have to know how to be humble.
Go back to basics  if a situation made you succeed right in your business
That system must be used, at least once a year, that means, go back to the basics, at least once a year.
And say my business is faltering. I'm going to do what
None
What I did at the beginning that gave me good results, I mean, there's nothing to lose. But, no, they don't want to because they feel,  how can I tell you.
Humiliated
Yes, there are people with too much ego.
Exactly, because look, for example there's a, there's a person this, that, got me for master of ceremony in the inauguration of a branch of his business
None
Then since I know the history of this person, I know that he started his business with five hundred dollars in the pocket
Hello Vanesa's speaking from San Diego
Hello Leticia's speaking from Philadelphia
How are you?
Hello
Is it cold there?
Yes very cold very cold the truth is that today, is one of the coldest days this winter, of autumn
It's already snowing?
Yes it already snowed last week
I lived near Philadelphia long time ago in New Town Square very nice
Really
Yes I liked it a lot
Yes the truth is that it's nice, but they say that San Diego is very nice too
Is beautiful and here is for now at night in the sixties degrees and in the day it's wonderful and it's always
How nice, I really want to go to San Diego, it must be really nice, they say it has one of the most privileged climates
Is incredible and especially the closer one lives to the beach the cooler it is. When one is closer to the mountain,
It's hotter, but where I am is always wonderful
How nice
I would like to stay if I can.
Why what do you do there in San Diego?
My husband is in the navy and in
In the navy,
When the contract ends we will probably have to move.
Yes, it's a shame that you were in here before for the same reason
I was here already when i was in college, before i finished college i was a nanny taking care of some children
That's right, where are you from originally?, from Puerto Rico
From Puerto Rico.  Are you from Spain or Argentina?
What's that?
Where are you from, Spain or Argentina?
The Argentinian accent is very different from the Spanish one
Maybe you know more about that than me, but i knew it had to be one of those
Yeah, very different incidentally from Argentina
You don't have
Oh, yes, I still hadn't taken the risk but Puerto Rico was one of the options .
I do most of my work through the computer with virtual companies and I can't live without it.
I have never been in person, and they
Yeah, it's part of how you earn money, let's say, using the computer.
Exactly
Sure, but yeah, me too partially, but aside from being a work tool, I am completely dependent on it for my every day life.
Yeah?
Since the internet...more than just for work, right?
Yes
No, I go directly to the Internet if I want to make a trip or look up information on anything.
It doesn't occur to me to look somewhere other than the internet
No is true, I basically do it too all my shopping for example Christmas shopping I do it on the internet.
I get the impression that is life already beyond what is work.
In the computer already passed from being just a work tool to being something I communicate with my family through the computer
Yes true all the-mail and all that
Yes, we even see each other through the video camera, we talk on the phone through the computer I mean is like
Wow
The most important element of the house for me
Yes
Yes
And we, our computer got damaged and it's like one is all disoriented, you don't know what to do
Yes the same happened to us we were sometime without internet and we super lost when you are far from your notice it even more right?
The media is something that keeps you communicated with many people and well
Yes, I like it. It's also a shame because at work, I do in the computer also.
We are so dependent of the computer that when we don't have computers practically we can't do the work because one already doesn't have the resources to do the things in
Paper or in another way and it's a problem for the productivity also
Yes, I understand you. Yes, that's also happened to me. That means the system is down and we all go home more or less.
Yes
Is incredible
Yes, and it embarrasses me a lot because I have three kids
None
Fifteen and sixteen years old then they for example they have access to the internet in school sometimes, I get scared
Sure I do understand that when one has kids it must be different. I don't have kids. I don't know, but there's also a lot of information that sometimes is also dangerous right?
Not only controlling what things they see, because there's everything on the internet
Yes I don't know if you know what my space is
The what?
MySpace. That is MySpace on the internet which is where one puts one's pictures and things you like to do.
Yes, in the messenger, in the hotmail is
None
None
To join this pyramid but by the internet. One communicates like that.
I really don't know what the site is.
Myspace.com, so then there a lot of teenagers.
None
The girls are in clothes provocative poses then they put in what city they live what school they go to
None
Anyone can be provoked by that and then it brings problems
Yes no I don't understand, yes that's true and it's also an issue with one's personal information. yes, the credit cards
All of those things right? That sometimes one buys so many things on the internet and don't know to what extent a person can take that information.
That they use it in a bad way. There's a lot of fraud I figure through the internet
Yes of course
Something that you have to be careful, but
With credit cards, you have to be careful in the stores because they have stolen my identity. And it's been people that when I go with my card in a
Store then they get my number and start to make purchases and things
None
I haven't had any problems with the internet.
No yes I mean me neither but the truth is that many people advise me to be careful that instead of putting the credit card to put there
Put the debit to the credit one.
That's true that's true
Those things but for now I also haven't had any problems
Yes
Have you been living in the United States a long time?
Since eighty five but I've returned to Puerto Rico for a few years in the nineties and yes since eighty five and you?
No, it's been seven months
DonÂ´t tell me thatÂ´s directly from Argentina
What?
You came directly from Argentina
Yes directly. It's been seven months that we've been here because my husband is working in the university. I'm also working but we came because he found something
Just arrived
He's a professor?
He'd doing a post doc. I mean he did a
None
PhD in Argentina and here he came to do the post doc at the University of Pennsylvania.
In what topic?
So he's on the side of reproduction
None
In teh so it's interesting he is, he is works with spermatozoids
How interesting
They always laugh that's why I laugh before when I say it
That's good are you thinking of staying or will you try?
And we'll see because our visa is for three years only so that limits us, but we don't know all the same, we're just arriving
We don't know very how everything works here either, no?
Yes
We'll see when we're closer to the three years. Maybe there, we'll have to make a decision about what we do.
Yes
Now we're thinking it what do I know the truth is that it's good it's a nice experience
Compared with Argentina it is not the same, obviously
No it's very different but there are things that I like more and things that no that I miss a lot I mean the food I miss a lot
I can imagine
The food, I think that's the things I miss the most, well there are things that work better here. There are more possibilities.
That's true
People are different here too. The American is very different to the Latino, right?
Yes
You have to get used to it, that you have to love them as they are, right?
Yes, they're not so open and warm and as good people like we say in Puerto Rico, as the Latinos are
Yes, you can tell the difference, and that truth is that's a shock, but we're having a good time
I think it's a country where you can make a lot of progress, much more than on Latin American countries.
Definitively
That's what brings you to live here
Yes
None
Definitively, and, is it easy with the english, are you having trouble or is everything fine?
I knew English, but coming here and listening to people is very different than the English I have studied my whole life
It's something different, i still have a hard time understanding some people, the pronunciation is the hardest for me, i mean i understand most of it, but there are some things that i can't understand yet
Yes, a lot.
Puerto Rico has many English speakers.
They teach it like that, they teach it plenty, like we are more or less from the United States, you grow up with the culture and watching television shows in English
Sure, that is a big influence
Ingrid from Philadelphia, how are you?
Aurelio from Washington DC very good Ingrid, how have you been, everything good?
Yes, everything, very good
How nice, I'm glad. What is the most important electronic device for you?
I think that it's the cellular, yes the cellular
The cellular phone has become indispensable.
It is a necessary article.
Is an article of necessity but it's a staple. It's incredible ten years ago almost nobody had cellulars, now everybody has a cellular
Yes had none, there was none, there were no cellulars and they didn't need it
Exactly
How much time went by without need it? Now that we have them it's like we've had it all our life.
Exactly true, you're right, yes
Yes.
What type of cellular do you have?
The telephone itself?
None
I have a Samson with camera, the one that opens up. And you?
I have a Samson, too, but does that one have a computer included?
We are supposed to discuss the system
Okay yes I've seen those, I like those
Yes, I have it because I need it for work. I need a phone where I can access the Internet
Also you understand me for work matters and that
Yes
Yes and to have the phone agenda, to also have the calendar you know that type of thing that nowadays are essential so
Yes, and my second device would be the computer.
Of course
Then i imagine that with one of those phone like both things are included
Exactly
It becomes much more indispensable
Yes, exactly. The computer is indispensable. Can you imaging nowadays to be or live without a computer?
I couldn't, and I lived in Maryland
No, sure
Now I'm here in Philadelphia but then here I have my DSL, and my laptop when I go to Maryland is like, like after a day I already need to come back home
I don't have DSL and sometimes where I go is like like they only have dial up
Imagine that
And then is so slow. It's already like how the television was before, that one needs the
Exactly true
That computer with internet access
The fast access to the internet, by the way where in Maryland? because I live in Maryland
I lived in Silver Spring
Imagine that you're very close to here
Where?
I live towards the South towards Acopeach near Fort Washington
OK
Yes, that is downwards.
And how did you find out about this study?
About this study I found out through precissely speaking through the Internet
Yes
I always look for things like that on the Internet
None
I found a site called Craig list
Yes.
There I found and I got in to see and I said listen theis sounds like interesting because I with I have two professions, I have been a Spanish teacher
None
Graduated in Spanish literature
That's interesting
You are. This study I liked. Let's get into it and see what happens.
None
And until now everything went well. I receive and make calls, and I speak with all sorts of people.
That's interesting. I by chance, have to make theses calls all the same, because I am in charge of this program at the university of Pennsylvania.
Really?
I have to do my part for reasons to check everything is running in the platform.
You also have to do your, exactly your calls
Also at the same time I check where it's working the ads and and all that
None
I sometimes hear the conversations
None
And are very interesting, I mean there are people that even become friends
Imagine that
One gets the same person sometimes.
None
And then they already know each other and
None
After they even exchange phone numbers
Sure
It makes
A connection
Yes
Yes, you know that I was able to receive calls for a week because I was out of the country
None
I had to go to Italy, and now that
That's good, for travel or for?
No, on work, because I'm an Opera singer, and so i had to go there to
Really, that's good
Yeah, I had to go there to give some concerts and that
That's
Anyway, talking about electrical devices you need
Yes.
The phone i brought there, i have Verizon, the company
None
Do you know what i mean doesn't work internationally
It doesn't?
No not this phone, how can I say it? The system from here doesn't work in Europe
The Spring one does
I think Spring does and T-Mobile, I think it works and
Yes, spring does work
Yes, but Verizon's doesn't, so, look, i was there
Desperate
Well, yeah, a little desperate, because i needed to go on the internet. But i just bought this phone new like a week or two ago
Yes
I bought it three days before leaving for Europe
Yes
The computer, the side of the computer of the telephone
None
Connects to the Internet also not only through the telephone line but also
It has wireless
Exactly it has that wi-fi.
OK
See I got connected over there in the hotels that have free service
Yes
It was perfect
That's good
I was impressed, talking of interfacto that needs to look at me
Yes
This really was a marvel, a good investment
Yes that's good
Yes, a good investment
So you teach Spanish over there in Maryland?
I don't teach anymore.
No , now you are only dedicated to opera
Yes, I have always been a singing teacher.
None
But you know sometimes you need more money for those things and then
Sure yes
You know you have to look for that what one needs
Exactly
At the end I teach in a music school in Washington we have one very near Silver Spring by the way a site
None
In Strawthmore I don't know if you remember where Strawthmore is.
Estrat-yes there in Rockvill near White Flint
That's it; It's called the Vincle of Music

No, I mean, we have lots of languages
None

None
I collect information, I mean, practically about all of that, I mean, the study has already being designed so I take care of
Finding people and supervising it so that everything goes on I have to transcribe the conversations
It's a lot of work
Yes, it's a lot but I like it, I'm happy, I like it
That's nice, you are so happy Ingrid
Really interesting
Tha's wonderful. That's good.
If you need anything you can find me in the website of the
Yes, I did go to the website. Several times.
None
Everything was legit
Yes
It worked fine because since my account was activated I don't know if you were the one that did it but that problem works
Oh yes, the system, we always have some little problems but like I said, we are always checking if the platform is working fine
Sure, m
We always need more people
You will need?
Here people who want to participate
I know a friend who,  we're practically like siblings but  she doesn't live here, she lives in New Hampshire, before I lived in New Hampshire
In some part of the United States and Canada
Yes look, I called a person in Canada the other day

Hello, how is it going? I'm Mariano, from Philadelphia.
Hello, Mariano. How are you?
I've talked with you.
Yes, sure you have. We talked a while back. How have you been?
How are things?
Fine. And you? How are you, you're a post graduate now, correct?
No, very cold here.
No, I can imagine. Yes, here it is cold, and it's a tolerable cold. What will it leave? You, over there, must be
Look, by here, is
Well,
Fourteen degrees below zero.
It can't be. no. I would die.
So imagine
No. Don't even say it. I would've died frozen. I swear. Not me, I'm of warm weather.
If you could see me, I'm with a really exaggerated hat and
None
I'm talking about a completely normal temperature. A little bit low
But,
Normal for the season.
Normal.
Don't even say it, look, what are you now going to do, now that those dates are coming?
The truth is that it had been in around minus four degrees.
Oh my God.
It was like that for some time but it's now colder, it's minus fourteen degrees, I was in my bike as I do everyday because I live close to it, five miles, sort of, from
Well. Okay.
College and I take my bike
None
I was in pain, my legs were hurting because of the cold weather.
Sure
It's too much, we are not used to that.
No,
I'm going to have to take the bus tomorrow
To go to
It seems to me, right?
That you keep yourself warm, it is cold in Argentina, isn't it?
In Argentina, it depends on the place.
Okay.
Argentina is a pretty big country.
That's correct.
For example, in the South you have colds like these
Ok, like over there in the Patagonia, right
Buenos Aires is warm
OK.
It was, in the winter, it doesn't, it doesn't go below zero degrees, almost never
OK
In the north it's hot. It's similar to Brazil
Ok
I mean we can choose
Exactly, but never something like this, right?, minus fourteen
No, at least not in Buenos Aires, on the south, yeah
Sure
In Usuaia, places like taht
Oh, my god, but you're gonna have to equip yourself, like find some good sweaters, some
Yes, no, we have bought ourselves... we didn't have any clothes
Some things for sure it isn't.
It was, I don't know, the cold weather clothes in Argentina, weren't good
Exactly, and what plans do you have for the holidays now?
I'm actually going to California
Is it true?
I'm moving to San Francisco.
That's good.
Not San Francisco, I'm going to San Francisco to visit but I'm going to Davis, it's there
That's good.
It's kind of close.
Oh, to the university?
Two of my friends work there, so we are going there
That's nice.
So, we are going to go visit. Where should I go?
San Francisco is a good location.
The Fisher, what's the name? The, like the, where the fisherman work
The port,  yes
The pier. What's the name? The port, like a port, that's right. It's well, the same, isn't it?
Yes, like a port.
There are lots of theaters and I like the theaters, they are very bohemians and the people is bohemian too they are artists. They also have the Alcatraz prison, the the Alcatraz prison, right?
Oh, it's pretty famous.
None
Fact that you like the independent theater, independent moies
Yes.
Correct.
Yes
Yes, i think it's going to be very interesting, because you'll be there, how long?, a week?
Yes, between Christmas and New Year, let's say, so the whole week
Perfect, excellent
They have told me that Carmel, Monterey, it's very nice around there, right?
Carlmel, that's the most gorgeous. Carmel, no, you're gonna love that, it really looks like
None
I was there for a summer, it's really different. I don't know how it is in the winter, it's very beautiful, it's like a ghost town
Very curious. Monterey is very nice. But, there's no better thing there in Monterey, i think, than Carmel
Sure
Monterey is like three, two streets
Sure
I just visited a little. I can't lie either, but i visited very little.  very nice because it has like a Spanish style
Everything from the colonial era, very nice
Sure
You're gonna love it
I'm gonna love it, right?
Yes, Carmel.
Again I'll have to go through Los Angeles.
No, you have to come around here some day, so you can visit around here. Here it's, there are many, did you know there's a lot of live here too?, night life, and the theaters too, the
Yes, what didn't attract me so much of Los Angeles, as it happens with others when they are such big cities,
Museums.
And, I like them there, a little smaller. I like nature a lot. Then,
Sure. But you will love it, then. Here there are many nice places, what happens is that, precisely because of how big it is, they are a little far.
Sure.
There are really some very beautiful places, especially places like Universal Studios, City Walk Cafe.
No, I'm dying for that. Yes,
Those types of places are very pleasant. What a shame that, because I'm leaving tomorrow to Venezuela.
How nice.
If not, I would tell you pass by here. I'll give you a small tour. I'm leaving tomorrow, God willing. Yes, I'm going to spend Christmas over there. I can't wait, yes!
How nice, you return with the whole family, right?
I'm crazy. Well, doing last minute shopping
I can imagine
Yes.
You are alone here, right?  Or do you have family?
Yes, I'm here with my husband.
Good.
He's now in Venezuela and I am in the process of going back.
You don't say?
Yes, we want to go back. We are seeing the possibility of settling down there.
Sure.
Yes.
And do you have chances to work?
We're trying, precisely. That is what we're doing, that's why he left first.
Yes. Because going back to our countries is hard.
Sometimes, I mean, And are you thinking of staying?
No. I intend to go back.
Sure.
I intend to go but, but I have a job.
Sure. Sure. Sure.
More or less decent, no?
Don't you believe, one thing, look, and I will tell you something, sometimes, sure, it's an experience that each one has, and, and I think that it's good to live it
Sometimes the that economic responsibility, certainly you can find here. But, the, that emotional, that
Yes.
That you will not find here
No.
If you are that kind of person, it will affect you.
That is true.
It will affect you very much.
Yes.
It will affect you
They're very different,
They're very different.  That's something I can't stand.  it bothers me
Yes, it's the same to me
That they're so indifferent. Yes, that indifference. They saw you today. They didn't say, Hi. I don't understand how they can't say Hi to a person they just saw.
Yes, bt sure, right, and i, i can tell that i was, it's my eight or ninth month here in the United States
Almost all of my friends are foreigners.
Sure
Right?, and not necessarily, i mean, most of them are Latinos or Spaniards
Right
Or Mexicans, or Italians, or even French. Or Venezuelan, or Columbians.
Yes? that's good.
But, yeah, pleny, the truth is
None
Very varied, but German guys, not the Americans. It's like they're stuck.
There is something emotionally wrong with them.
Yes
They have some, it's, i can't believe, understand that i get invited to a house from six to eight p.m.
Exactly
What? That doesn't exist in Argentina.
Except in Venezuela.
Of course
Why would you limit yourself that way? My God, let the thing flow. If you want to leave early, you leave. If you want to stay because the thing is cool, you stay.
Logically, and no one is kicking anyone out
Exactly, look, I go to sleep, I lie down at seven thirty five, what's that?
Sure
I sometimes feel sorry for them, because I'm with them everyday and they don't say hi. It's a very strange thing.
Poor guys, they really have it all, and they don't, they don't know how to enjoy it, everything is buying, buying, buying, and, and i don't know, no, it's something that, really, i swear, look, i prefer to have less
Exact
Have less and be happy
I completely agree
Yes, of
I completely agree, and to, and, and it happens that, things are worthless here, right?, i mean, a gift has no, it 's priceless here because, i mean, it's priceless
Yes.
Everything's so easy that I watched the birthday of a
Yes
Niece of us that lives in Pittsburgh
OK
Many gifts and so many things, and everything's so easy, they don't value it. I remember when
Exactly
When I was little, they give me a gift
Sure. You waited the whole year for that.
But here,  is like everything is so easy.
No, here yes, because, look here, is rather, the law of punishment, instead of the prize, for, for having done something good. I mean, here is that, I'm going to take away the Nintendo, I'm going to take away, this, this, because is that they have everything.
Yes, everything.
How are they going to reward you? What they have to do is punish you because the prize doesn't exist.
Sure.
I mean, you have to be a very well placed parent and not have been born here, to start by there. Because, if you were born here, well, you have another culture, you are in the culture of consumption.
You are permanently, buying.
Sure.
There's not a balance between things. Right? And I'm going to tell you, very pleasant, everything. Suddenly here you have a lot of options, you have a lot of possibilities.
We are searching where we feel happy.
Yes.
Where you in the morning, suddenly you have nothing to eat, and, no, man, look, God prepares. I don't know? Let's see what comes out of there.
Sure.
Today you enjoy when your neighbor comes to
Yes
Oh at least that is now what we feel, that will make us feel completely happy.
The people look in your eyes and you feel that sincere look.
Exactly.
They don't look at you with mean eyes.
Yes. Or, if one bumps into you he says I'm sorry
Yes, yes

Yes
And then people have to go out and get to know earch other of course. But it's very interesting, incredible how
Yes
Computers nowadays are being used for almost everything, for many things
There's  almost no area where you can't do anything with
None
Yes
None.
Yes, because I'm an assistant ah, and I, I do a lot of research
Oh, I get it, sure then for research there's nothing better than the computer, it's incredible
Yes. A lot of information
It's incredible, sometimes I start thinking, like today I was talking to this man, how our lives have changed since we have computers
When we didn't have, no
In a big way.
A lot of thins
Yes
We do with computers now.
Yes
Sometimes I tell myself, how can it be that our lives have changed so much! We used to do a lot of things
None
When we didn't have them and no we are kind of getting addicted to computers
I know people that leave work and go home and use the computer until they go to sleep.
They do this everyday.
That's a bit much
And that's a big problem, I think, because they are not living a real life, they are living
No, exactly. No
Yes
You are right about that. The computer is replacing people, other communication means that are also important
Yes
Because
Yes
Yes, it is a fast communication mean and and useful, It's a bit
Lonely, isn't it.
It was me
There's people, there's people but the world is totally apart

The last stop, the, lats stop, yes
West Chester, over there, OK
What do you think of the subject?
Technological devices, the e-mail is the device I most frequently use
Right, the computer.
I work and study at a school.
None
The e-mail system helps me get mail from work, and also the professor that we also have classes of
We have to get into the University's system when the professor sends us emails.
Right
O search for information
The technological device you use most is the computer that makes your life easier.
Yeah, exactly.  It also makes communication between friends easier
None
That live very far apart, and i can chat with them.
Yeah
Via a system like instant messenger
Right
Where i can communicate with them, i don't have to make a long distance call,
Yes, over the phone, from the phone to the internet.
I use my phone to use my phone to connect to the internet
None
That also if it wasn't for the phone it would be something else but that already they have wireless they have systems that if you already need
Yes a port you don't need a port it already has it
None
None
None
And if not in the same road already,
None
It makes our life easier, as far as the technology right now it has advanced so much, for example the directions, I'm always in the car, the phone for me is a big advantage
None
The faxes
None
The email like you say also that device of, I don't know how you can say it in Spanish but is the communication that is with
By the internet and the satellite, it receives your location and it guides you to the place where you want to go
Yes, is like mapquest, but is a program that you can with your
Yes, it has a device
Through the cellular or
None
Through a -PDA
Ah, PVA then.
You can connect it and they will give you information on where you want to go
Exactly, there are now some you place in the car.
None
Through a satellite it guides you to where you want to go.
Are you a taxi driver?
It tells you where to go, no, no, I'm not
None
I work in the streets taking merchandise to several places.
Okay
Yeah so, a lot of times I've had to travel far and that makes it so much easier, it helps me get to places without having to look for the addresses and that's the most
None
Yes, technology makes our life easier.
None
Technological artifacts are advanced
None
No, we depend on them too
Also
We depend on them every day more, and the day when we have no power, no internet, no
None
We are not going to. We are not going to be really bad.
The only thing missing is that they turn us into robots
For example the day of the blackout here in New York, that there was no electricity, there was no phone, there was nothing.
None
The elevators weren't working, almost all the technological devices operate with electricity, and there was nothing then the
None
The
It got complicated
It got complicated, the matter got complicated there
None
Even the bridge that I didn't hear of any deaths but that everybody
No, but w are so dependent of it that we forget how and how much we use
None
We depend on the technology
Yes, exactly, then we have no other way out because
None
You say the internet as far as the classes and all that
None
There is no other unless you meet with the teacher and he gives you information.
That up to now on the part of the computer you can take classes on the internet and you don't have to go to class
Ah, also
You don't have, no there's a little of an advantage and a little of disadvantage also of the advantages of, of the internet is that
Everything is getting so modernized.
Yes
We are also losing a little bit of contact which is essential
Exactly
To be more effective also
Yes
You notice that you call a credit card to talk with a person to help you with a problem that you have with that credit card
It's most unpleasant and annoying having a computer talk to you.
And wait also
When you need a direct help and
A person
A direct person and a person who in reality understands the situation and that you can manage with that person to help you and to correct that problem.
A computer will not solve the problem, because sometimes it directs me to the person.
That knows the most about the case - but is very confusing sometimes
Yes I understand because I've gone through that through there
And the only thing it does, is that it makes you madder and
None
You don't get to resolve the problem I went through that recently
What you're saying is that you get mad when technology does... makes the world smalller with it?
After instantly communicating a person thats distant, you can get pictures from that person at once, in your camera
In your phone, on the computer, you can get information about, i don't know, inventory of merchandise, i sell through the internet up to Japan
I sent merchandise to Brazil.
Wow
Only take a picture of the merchandise, measure it, have the contact and the person sends you the money through the internet.
None
I go to FedEx express on the internet, to sign... the website
None
I pick a tracking number and send it to her knowing that track number will get to the box she's going to get.
None
If this box doesn't arrive the day it was supposed to get there, I take this number and search for it on the computer and it tells you exactly where it is
Yes.
Standing, the package, so, the world gets smaller, the technology
None
Makes our life easier.
None
The thin doesn't work like we expect, we get made.
None
Depend, we become very dependent on it
None
It is something that sincerely, there is not, you cannot escape, you cannot escape
Well, and because of that, from television, radio, and the internet we are also well informed on things.
Yes, yes, yes
Sometimes very informed but it is good to know what is happening
The world
A catastrophe, a natural one I know that this time foreseeing in advance for one to take, to take precautions.
None
By the technology, television, radio, whatever it is something positive
Yes, so I cannot have a bad opinion of technology it is something that if we had it it would affect the sixth sense for example
It is said that cell phones are harmful that the radioactivity, the radiation you have to take care of your body
None
It is something that is inevitable,  how can you avoid it if you must have it in your pocket
None
It is either in the pocket of your pant, shirt, or jacket but it will always be with you. How could you avoid it?
None
I see as an example
None
Really, the easy pass right now too
Yes, technology
Technology before was the line to wait and to
And pay everything in cash
The toll in cash, exactly
Throw the have change
The bother of having change, exactly
To be able to throw
Before they did it faster, to have change to throw in a basket
None
A bucket, a, I don't know how you say bucket
None
Then you would put the change there and the machine would read it and it
And you had to
You had to have the exact change
Exactly
Not now, the monthly wasy pass
None
Collects the money that you have used and it refills it again
Is
How can you escape it if it really makes our life easier?  You can't.
If you look at it right, how the technology is, it has two sides like two sides of a coin.
The technology has changed like the metrocard or the system of getting on the, in, in
None
On the buses, and the public trains. Then you lose the worker.
Yes
Because by having the computer accessible, how they've done here in New York
No
Tamara
Yes, Tamara what's going on? My name is Eliana, How are you, good?
Good, you?
Everything fine.  the day's topic is marriage. what do you think of interracial marriage?
I agree with the interracial marriages, do you?
The topic of race is hard
Because of the cultures, because of the thing that can come up between two people. But I don't think that it is bad that there are interracial marriages.
Look, me, my mom always told me that - is quite hard for one be getting along well with a partner - a person that is not
Of your same background, right?
Sure, I honestly still don't know, because I'm not married, but many, for example, I also know on the part of my parents
That they separated. We are Jewish. My parents separated, and they remarried Jewish people and they always say that they feel like
In family. In that way, but to me
I'm married and I'm Jewish but my husband is not Jewish, so I'm more or less, we get along quite well and we respect each other
Sure, are you both Hispanic?
Yes, we are both Argentinians and we met in another country, but
Both?
We get along quite well
That's why, then, the religion is another topic to talk about, but the topic of the race for me is super important, if you are Hispanic
That's what I like about the United States. In Europe, there are many countries that one sees there are interracial couples. And I think that's good. I don't know how they get along.
No, today, I have one that is black color and her husband is Irish, and they get along fabulously
Sure, yes, that's why, you'd have to see, for example, i, I'm single here in the United States, i always feel, yes, closer to people
Latin people with whom I can speak Spanish, maybe because my English is not good, so every time they want to introduce me to someone that speaks Spanish, I feel I can
Can reach better, I can talk more, about other subjects, about deeper subjects, and have a better
None
Relationship in the future, I really don't understand how two people with different languages and culture can get along fine.
Yes
I don't see myself at that point during their lives.
Well, by being interracial it can be the same culture, right? I imagine that two people that were born
In the United States, one of color and the other not, were both raised in the same country or even in the same city.
Sure, that's true. You have to differentiate culture, religion, and race
Yes I think the kids will be pretty tolerant,which is good.
For the world, right?
Yes, that's true.
Because
Yes, that's true
None
Yes, that's good.
Yes, but, for example, you
And more than anything if we're talking about a person of color, or a white one, that's really good, right? That's going to happen and
Yes, but what do you think of that? Would you fall in love with a person of color?
Yes, I think so, but I think I could fall in love with a colored person as long as he is from my own culture, with who I can share even the same language, that's what I was
Yes
I see it limits me
And the people you go with, do you think you will ever find someone like that?
Oriental or colored, let's say.
The thing is that in my country they are, I am Argentinean also, but in Argentina or in, what you call it? There are not many Asians.
Who speaks perfect Spanish and our from the Hispanic culture?
Yes
Yes, it could be, probabably
None
Also another aspect is that, I don't know, I don't like Asians in a physical sense, for instance, but I may like one sometime
Yes
I won't say, no way, no way, on the contrary, I like and respect a lot the couples who are of the interracial couples
Yes, I also find them quite- I like them quite a lot that couple, but I don't know how they met or which are their
The circumstances how they meet each other.  For instance, I think the orientals are quite reserved, but in Brooklyn where I live, you can see many couples
Of oriental women and American men, I just can't figure where they met, right?
No, but here, in the United States there is mo-, everything is so cosmopolitan
Yes
And, right? Let's say
Yes, no, it's not where they met, but if they are open to such relations, you know what I mean?
Sure, yes, is true, in that sense is true yes, is good. And you think that for example
Yes.
Do you think interacial marriages have more or less divorces?
The truth is that at this stage of life where everyone gets divorces and an interracial marriage gets more divorced than others
Of the same race? I don't think so.
Sure.
On the contrary, I think that in that case they will be
Sure
More interesting and yes, perhaps they have more arguments because of, I mean, of political things or that happens in reality and that one agrees and the other doesn't
But I don't think that influences more than anything in the divorce.
You got married with a person that's speaking of religion now?
Yes
That is not Jewish. Did you have problems in your family?
Yes. And, yes, honestly yes, there are, are
Ah, really?
Yes, at the beginning, they didn't like him at all but since I never went out with a person of, the same religion as me so to speak, is not that I changed
From a Jewish boyfriend to a non-Jewish boyfriend. I never had a Jewish boyfriend, so they were already used to that. Only, this time, it was serious and
And well, and I got married but yes, he also was a little complicated when
Sure.
When we got married, how the ceremony was going to be and that
How did they do it?
No, at last we got married without, by civil, that is a non religious marriage and I think that in the future the problem could be the children
By religion, my children must be Jews,  because women are the ones who give but I donÂ´t know, with people of color is different, because genes are those that pass , there is not
Of course, but if, for example, your son decides to be catholic and go to church
The truth is going to bother me, but I think I could not tell him not to do it.
Of course.
If he learns something about the church, it is going to be from the friends.
The school, from his friends
Yes. We never celebrate Catholic things. In fact we celebrate more Jews things than Catholic ones
Of course, it.
I donÂ´t know, I think that with people, color people and interracial marriages the issue is different, because the, the children donÂ´t have to choose one or another religion
They were born with a color or slanted eyes but accept it. It is not a matter of choosing
Of course, you should distinguish between what is different, you are from the same, for example that you two were born in the same city
Yes.
Move in the same place . You two are from different race, it looks to me not so terrible . A person coming from.
Africa and
None
Right? and have a whole African culture
Yes, that is what I thought. My mother told me you can meet with people and say, it's from my religion but
But maybe we don't have a thing in common, right? You grew up in a big city, the other one in the middle of the jungle. There are not many things to see
Let's say if today I would go to the jungle to work
Sure.
It would be much nicer finding a person that lives there and that, to know his experiences of the place there, perhaps also, I will fall in love with that person, but not
Is living in a city one? I don't know if you can have many things in common.
With them, right?
Sure
If they are in the same city is already different
Sure, I think the same, what happens is that in the place where of Argentina there aren't that many racial problems that I know of, they are rather more economic
Yes
When, right? When one talks that if there's a problem or not on racial level, I can't find the problem.
Sure.
I never saw them, saw a racial problem, yes perhaps a problem of religion or social economic.
Yes, and have you traveled a lot around the world?
Yes, I traveled let's say, by Central America
None
South America. I was also in Thailand, in Asia
In Central America, also? Because in Central American there are also people of color.
I was in Costa Rica, I did feel there were racial problems
Really? The people of color don't mix so to speak with The white ones?
Yes, the same colors are in the Caribbean and the rest in the Pacific.
None
You can see it in the map and see that the routes in the Caribbean are, they are destroyed if they don't get fixed and the Pacific zones are amazing.
Put they can get you straight to, or they work for tourism.
They were yes no, what happened is that there used to be a port where all the slaves would arrive to
None
So, they stayed there and and since they were slaves, that's what I learned about Costa Rica.
None
Those are black people but they are kind of angry with the world, isn't it? they are angry at the white people.
Yes.
When the whites think that the others, and the blacks are angry at the whites, that's when the racial problems begin.
Yes.
For example, I was in a taxIn Costa Ric and I asked the driver how the Caribbean was since I hadn't been there yet and he told me, there are lots of blacks over there.
What color was he?
He was Hispanic.
Sure.
He wasn't white; he was Hispanic.
None
And, well, I was surprised because I had never in my whole life heard something so negative towards black people.
And you listen to it in the television,  but since there are almost no blacks in Argentina.
Sure.
To me, to me, it surprised me a lot, no, that it was
Good afternoon, is Carolina, from Los Angeles
Good afternoon. My name is Blanca, from Arizona
Oh, Blanca, How are you?
Fine.
I'm glad.
Here,
What a topic? Hot topic, certainly. Right?
Yes. Yes.
Are you married with some person of another nationality
Of another nationality, not another race.
I also disagree with that term
In my point of view, there's only one race which is the human being, there are several types of
Exactly.
No, there aren't many races. There's only one, the human race.
Exactly, I always, every time they say, no, but what race are you? And I, no, I'm not a dog nor a horse.
Yes.
Is What nationality are you, from what part, from what other? because that of a white race, black race, that bothers me tremendously, and especially here.
I feel there's a problem of colors.
It has always existed. Not only of colors, but of nationalities.
That, yes, correct. Where are you from?
I'm from Colombia.
I was almost
You from Venezuela Right?
Yes, exactly. the same.
No, that accent, I don't know. It doesn't change.
Yes, always when we talk about the topic. I know, I say my family on my dad's side are black.
I hadn't noticed
None
My family was black until I arrived here. When I started hearing that mess.That is black, and that is African American. I dont' know what, so I will say well, I'm African Venezuelan.
My mom is very white and my father is dark-skinned, but my grandmother is black.
Yes.
I started to think about that now being here.
Sincerely, I had never detailed that. What's more, I always  had more of a tendency towards my dad's family,
None
And I have cousins of all colors. Because, my uncles that are black, have gotten married to white women, and vice versa also,
Okay.
I mean that is not that a racial problem exist in Venezuela, so to speak, our problem is of classes, there.
Yes, is like, it is like in Colombia.
Exactly. If you were rich.
Is exactly the same story. In Columbia it doesn't exist. That issue of race is also not so marked. Rather is more by groups, or by social classes, right?
If you are rich, I mean you are doing alright or if you're poor, definetly
Yea.
So people are more. Look, I've got Asian friends, I have Italian friends or children of Italians. Better said, children of Arabs and, for me, they're Venezuelan. I don't see them as foreigners, not at all, on the contrary. And you talk with them.
All parent who weren't born in Venezuela, they've been living in there for more than fifty years. They feel more Venezuelan than even I do.
I'm telling you they really love Venezuela and they speak very well of Venezue
To Venezuela.
Casually, I've got a friend who's Colombian, and she's Korean,
Yea.
Can you imagine she's asian?
Colombian and Korean.
Her
My children are according to the accounts, in keeping with the subject, they're Guatemalan and Colombian. With, with, with American customs, because they were born here. So, there there's
None
They are three nationalities mixed together, but they are not different from everyone else.
Right.
That's absurd
Right, and it really depends on you as a mother, or your husband. To instill that in them from children. It's a challenge to raise children.
Yea.
It's pretty tough,  and above all because of how people here live their lives. It's something really different from our lives, no
We can have economic problems of another kind.
Socials.
This is a serious social problem - the indifference, the low respect, for example, from kids to adults
Yeah.
Listen, I remember that when we were young. No mister look excuse me, so say good night greet say bye.
My husband's daughter is like that, and she is going to be twenty.
Here
What a way to raise that girl! I don't want to raise my kids like that!
Of course.
It is, they don't have any obligation with their elders, is a total disrespect. No, is not like when you went out by car, you came home,
If an old lady, the grandmother or the aunt were standing, you gave them the sit.
Imagine that.
I think it is not a matter of, for example,those who have children grow them this or that way, is not a matter of race, is a matter of
Each couple do
Exactly.
Their own raise, their own upbringing
Exactly, because I always make him question. I have American friends and they tell me it's part of our culture. It is not that we are all like that.
None
The majority, is like an indifference,
Yeah.
Selfish so, but it is a so big, that, that, that practically they isolate themselves, is
Yes, totally.
Yes, they live in their own world and I say, My God, what a big thing, really not.  We think of coming back.  God, let us do it soon.  I think in one or two years, I do not want to spend more time.
Because I don't know. I adapt very well. I am a person.
When Chavez leave from there is another issue.
What?
When Chavez leaves, that is another issue.
See that not, see that not, I am totally in favor of him. yes, totally, totally, the truth is that what happens is that the image given to him is very
Strong, it is an image
No, the one that he shows, the one that he shows
The one that he shows what happens is that they focus in him only that part. Then the image that they project on him is not the most appropriated. Then we always fall into that topic, it is an unavoidable topic. Right?
Yes.
I am in favor and agree with his policies, and strategy and would like to incorporate them here.
We believe in that project
None
The true, I say, damn, I have only six years here
Yes.
I am going to say, I lived all the process, and I have lived, an I have years over me, and, and I live the part of the, democracy of the parties
So, the politicians of the moment. And sincerely, it was too much. It is a very particular situation, sincerely. No, it does not looks like any other. It is a situation very, very particular
Yes.
And when that man arrived, we thought my God, at least someone can stop so much insolence and corruption. But many people ask us if we're crazy. Many people don't know.
And they have an image of him that he projects in the media that is evident, they are against him, so,
Sure
It's complicated. I know one couple from Bogota.
None
It's a really nice couple, and I really love them. When I was at their home, a man from Bogota came to visit them. He was their frient and he told me,
What's your opinion about that crazy President of yours? And oh my God, I was like, Excuse me, sir, but
None
He's not crazy to me, and he was like, I'm sorry, I didn't want to say that. The man apologized to me, but I told him I would never talk about that way about President Uribe, but
I see.
Sure, I know that everyone thinks he's crazy but that's the image that they've projected of him.
And he has showed it too, because that's what he
He is real, he doesn't hide it
Sure, but the things is that
He doesn't. He's like that. He's open and careless when he speaks and says things.
Exactly, he has no, he's not a demagog he doesn't, he's not a diplomat, he's not
None
Like that, and that angers people, it angers them because they are not used to that, so, the journalists try to hurt him but he answers, no? In the beginning I would say oh God, but
I didn't understand him either but then I started to realize the truth and I visit Venezuela often, by the way, I'm leaving tonight
That's great.
Yes, and
I would give anything to go visit Colombia right now.
Yes I can imagine
A year ago I spent a wonderful Christmas over there.
How exciting.
And I came back two months ago, so I can't go back now.
How nice.
It's too high up.
None
Money only goes so far.
It is true.
We started talking about interracial problems, and we're already on political problems
Good Latin speakers
Well, one starts, and beats around the bush, until you get to the point.
Yes, is true
One goes up, and goes up, and goes up, and beats around the bush constantly.
Yes, is true, yes is true. my husband is Venezuelan, and with all and all, the same, sometimes we have our, that but we try to, to find a better way, sometimes
We get upset, I don't know? for anything. And we try to find the solution. Sometimes I tell you that,
You told me you lived in North Carolina?
No, I'm in Los Angeles.
In Los Angeles.
In Los Angeles. Are you in Arizona?
Yes. How is going, to, returning to revive the issue, how has it gone with all that over with the part
None
Los Angeles and Arizona are the same. They are cities where there are a lot of Hispanics. I don't know how it's gone with that part.
Yes.
Of, the racial aspect
That drives a lot around here. It's a question of social regression that is in the United States in general.
Here, even though Los Angeles is a city that really, that has a lot of difference
Hi, I'm Olga, who are you?
My name is Blanca
Blanca, where are you from Blanca?
From Arizona
Arizona, I'm in Texas
Very well
What do you think about today's subject?, do you find it interesting?
I find it interesting - it's just that it was picked from a long time ago, right?
They don't exist, it's just one gender, the human gender
That's right
There are several groups of that human gender, but the race is really, like someone else said, where's the cattle, where are the little animals?
Yes, i agree with you. That's right, are you married?
I'm married and precisely
Yes
With a person from another country
Right
I'm Colombian, and my husband is Guatemalan.
OK
We're Latinos and are human beings.
Right.
Not the color, nor the style, your eyes, of your physical features, makes you look like another race. You are a human being.
With different characteristics.
I agree with you.
None
Says that yes, that it's harder to live with another, with one race than another.
Yes
Like you were saying, is that it also depends on, on the couple, because it also depends on both people. how much or how badly they want it.
Want the marriage.
Exactly, I was reading a book last night.
Right
About raising the kids.
None
Is that the problem of raising the kids, is not made by society in itself. there are many factors that influence it, but basically the essence is in the couple
In how much they want to give their kids a good life.
Sure
Yes, like they say they belong to another race, the husband and the wife, if they want to get ahead in life with their family, with their home they will get ahead.
Sure
Independently of what exist or not.
Yes, because the education, definitely, like our grandmothers used to say, the education is bred.
Yes
Right. So education starts at home in fact
None
Yes it's a really solid education. yes, it's pretty strong. the exterior didn't affect them much, these kids, because their education was very
Very solid.  So, the fact that there are so many kids on drugs, maybe it's due to the negligence on the part of the parents
Or maybe they're teaching at home wasn't very solid, then.
Yes
Exactly.
This true, I think the same.
Yes
Definitely.
Yes
I think the same thing.
Yes, including a good marriage.
None
I think that in the couple. Well, there must always be an agreement. There must, like, I think that the relationship of a couple.
The problems start when one of the two breaks the agreement is shows through its agreements
Yes
You know?
Yes
That's where the problems start, in the couple and obviously start, start to involve the kids no, imagine. with a couple with problems, imagine the poor kids, all traumatized.
Yes, that's where all the problems start. And many times the one's who pay the buck are the kids
Right
Any way - it's not ingenuity, because i know many couples that have separated, and have had problems
None
...but they have had very nice homes.
That's why I'm telling you.
None
They used their intelligence in the right way. Do i make myself clear?
Yes.
Because it's not so much that we're smart, i mean, but lets see how, it's, how we're using our intelligence
It's not so much that we're smart or that we're white, black, blue, or purple...
Exactly
It's the way we get a grasp on things, the way we approach life, home, our family and our children
That's it, right
It's the love that each of us bring and the effort we put into
Yes
Everything
Yeah, sure. First of all, there's love right? That feeling so incredible, it moves mountains
None
Right, and on the other hand, being responsible, give everything its place
Right
Many times human beings, for, to do things easier for ourselves, like we kinda disguise situations a little bit
Right
No, we're not quite seeing, a hundred percent the point we should
Right
And that's also a terrible problem because we're not paying the necessary interest to certain situations
Yes
That's right
That's true
That you think, yes, I'm sorry, what do you think it's the most important thing to get along?
Trust, definitely, and dialogue
Yes
If there's no trust and dialogue, there's nothing. And with someone with whom you don't talk, you don't know what are its thought, it's wishes and needs
What they think about one situation or the other.
True
I don't know, what i think
Yes, I agree with you.
To another, yes.
I can talk a lot with my partner.  If my partner doesn't trust me or listens to me.
Well, since it doesn't trust me,  it's obviously not believing what I'm saying
None
So then from the other side it's the same. If the husband or couple is trying to know something.
Good or not anymore, not hearing, because I don't have confidence, in how I'm going to, how I'm going to take his words seriously.
It's true, if it's true, one, one thing leads to another, the, the, the
Yes, that's true.
Confidence brings dialogue.
None
Well, the dialogue generates confidence. It is very interesting
At times we make many errors in meaning in thAt times we don't say things in an adequate format because many times it doesn't matter as much what you say but how you say it.
Uh-huh
There are also, many
Yes
Many complications afterward.
Yes
It's not easy, since then, to live with someone, we don't expect to be
Eternally happy, of course, because there will be difficult situations and there are going to be problems, but also, the, we need to use our intelligence to resolve these problems in some way
Successfully.
Yes, that's true, there is, there is
That's what I believ.
You need to have a little bit of skill and intelligence and of malice. As we say in my country, native malice. When one does things and says them and the way in which they say them.
It is true, the way you face a matter, the way you answer, you express, even your gestures mean a lot
O yes, absolutely, body language has a lot to do. For instance, if you tell a, if a kid
Tells his mother, or, if the mother shows a martyr face, then the son tells her, mom are you sad?
And she says, nodding:No son I am not sad. Her mouth says she is not sad, but her expression, her body language,
Is showing that, yes exactly
Says she is
Indicates absolutely the opposite. And all those, contradictory situations are what often traumatizes the children, it confuses them
Because The kid feels that his mother is sad.
There is where confusions start in a child's mind, and that's why there are so many problems with kids
Yes
That's it
That is a part of the reality. We are out of the subject again. Right now, I was talking to another woman. I may be going off of the subject again
Yes
The subject, we started talking about politics
None
Oh my goodness
Well, not, you see, there is no one hundred percent need to talk about the specified subject. But, well, it is interesting anyway.
To stick to it slightly. Because they are daily life subjects, aren't they?
Yes, they are subjects that help quite a lot
Yes, because they are subjects that are always current, they never get out of date because, well, for instance couples will always need
You are from Mexico right?
Yes, I'm from Mexico.
We are from different countries.
Yes
We use, we use different words but, we are on the same line.
That's right, that's what I was saying, no no, there's no difference in the way we wanting and doing things
We all want to have a successful marriage but we here have
Hello?
Hello, yes.  Who is speaking?
Yes. Manuel's speaking from Orlando, Florida, who's speaking?
Okay, I'm Olga, I'm in Texas.
How is it going Olga?
How are you?
Fine, thanks.
How nice.
Look, we already heard the topic of the day.
Yes,
If you want then start telling me what you think
Yes, I think that in reality no, there's not reason to think that the interracial exist, right?
I would say that
Yes.
The different races, if they get together, there's no problem because the basic thing is the love.
Precisely what will unite them. Yes
So
Each one is from a different race, so then as adults as responsible people as intelligent people they will already work on their
On their partner to achieve the, the proper success. Don't you think?
Correct, look I agree with you
None
And it seems to be that if a partner of a different race, the two match, and love each other  and will
Create a home and some kids together this racial factor isn't so decisive, what counts are the values that they want to pass on.
Exactly
We're interracial, I have a white component from the
Europeans, the Spanish component, indigenous from the natives too
Yes.
From the blacks who came from that part of the world.
Yes.
You know that we too, the Latinos, are interracial.
It's like this.
So I don't see, this race factor. Any problem, always and when they put their part and are consistent in what they're doing, that seems to me, really, a problem
That yeah, it's not racial, but it's cultural, for example, it's the religious factor, this can be a problem
None
If they both practice different religions.
Yes. so I also agree with you, I see more problems in this situation with the religions
In the racial situation, yes.
Correct.
Yes, it is not as you image the kids get close to
This religion
Is this not what you imagine?
I would say that there is like
Contradictions
Confusion, yes, is a contradiction and confusion with the kids
Yes, yes.
That the kids get really confused because no, no
None
They don't know
Yes.
They don't know what to do.
Because it's not the topic of the day we can't talk at length about the topic religion.
None
I've known of cases, I think that you too, of families that
Yes.
That have been torn apart and almost destroyed because they start to practice different religions.
Yes, like that yes, the other day that it was precisely the topic was precisely that, the religion they were asking me that
I didn't get to that day
No, they were asking if religion that if religions unite or separate, I would say it separates
Many times but not always
Religions tear apart families, sometimes each family member.
They have a different religion, I've met families like that.
That's right and going back to today's subject, it seems to me that about that, the races always, couples fail
Of external influences, whether her's or his' families.
None
The background, for, some kind of intrigue from people that surround them and not because of themselves.
None
That
Yes, that's it.
Lots of times people from the outside is the one that creates conflicts
None
Because if the couple got married is because of something, they are were in love, nobody was forcing them, sometimes, it's because of other people,
None
Other people from outside the couple, that start causing trouble.
Yes, well, that's why I'm telling you, the couple should be smart enough and responsible enough as to succeed because, well, yes
As you say, there are lots of factors that are going to influence the case. So, that's where, there's
None
They have to be smart
Now, they were saying that the children, well, we do agree on it I don't think, I don't think it's because, if one, lets say that the couple, the couple is
He is black and she's white, it's happened before. One son is white and the other one is black
None
These were conflicts. if they two kids are given the same love if you provide them the same attention and the same
If you give them the same necessities because you will have conflicts, first it's really nice that they learn to see that
The only difference is the color.
Yes, I agree with you, there's no reason to see them differently, if they're both kids
While you treat them the same, they will see
No.
That they're equal. Now if you try to treat them differently, there you will have a problem.
Yes.
If they were conceived in the same marriage, why would you treat them differently?
Sure.
This is
Unfortunately this gives a lot, yes, from this, where, that the parents treat differently
That yes, I knew a case of a couple, but
And
The same thing happened, he and the woman, she
None
Was dark skinned and he, the husband was white
None
One of the kids came out dark, looking like her family, and the others were white.
Yes.
She, the treated her the same, and the dad really loved the little dark one too, but his family
None
They didn't love the little dark one as much as the others.
None
It has to do with what we said. The family starts to sow problems.
What a shame, because yes, I also saw many, many situations like that and well the poor kids, what fault do they have?
Not at all.
None
Not at all, this, no
Yes
What else did they indicate in the introduction? They talked about the couple, about the kids
And after, it was nothing more than that. If there are interracial kids and that
Well, the other was if you, well one
That yes
Would be disposed, would consider marrying with someone from another race, in my case yes, I don't have problems with this
Ah, yes. Me neither; like I told you, if you agree and feel attraction for this other perso
Well there's no reason to not move forward and try to well, to have something good together, no? So
Right, yes, because every relationship founded in values doesn't have to bring pleasure
It's like this
If it were only this factor of couples breaking up how, how many of the same race don't get divorced? But the would have to, to do it
Exactly.
Yes it's because the race factor is only about yes or no, I think.
That's how it is.
There are many interracial couples that look more solid than others of the same race.
Yes, that's true.
Yes, that is true.
Yes, if the ones of the same race divorce then one would have to think why
Exactly.
If they are from the same race
That yes, not always is of the same race, the same social condition, the same religion
Yes
If they can't stand each other, we see couples getting a divorce in as few as six months.
Or a program was censored in Europe, things like that, and in Mexico, that never happens, it's like, I don't know, Mexican society is a bit closed and not so liberal as compared to the Americans in showing whatever they want.
Incredible.
Goodness. And where were you born?
I'm from Colombia.
From Colombia, okay.
Where are you from?
From Mexico, from Chihuahua
From Mexi, and you've been here a long time?
Yes, I've been living in the United States for more than thirty years.
No, it's a lifetime
Yes, it is. What is the name that you told me?
Manuel.
Sorry? What is your name?
Yes. Manuel.
Manuel, okay. yes, a little while ago I talked with a Colombian, exactly, and we totally agreed also on a lot of things
There we realized, you're Mexican, I'm Colombian, and nevertheless we agree on, on many things. I think so.
Although it seemed to me that maybe Latinos, for the same that they said
None
We aren't all given to fixing on this issue of race, it's not so determinant because we're all mixed.
Yes.
Latin America counts more on social status and level.
Yes.
The race, I don't see it as so obviously yes there are cases, but not so, it's more that there are prejudices in, in the races
A bit purer. It's unfortunate because it's not the idea
Yes, it is like that.
It's not the idea to see this. In Texas, do you see a lot?
Well yes.
A lot of international couples or not?
Yes, a lots of couples, and they look happy, i mean, they don't look different to, i mean, you don't see a couple
For example, an Asian man with an American woman
Yes
It looks just like a Mexican man and a mexican woman
Yeah, exactly
I can't see a difference, absolutely
No, and look, sometimes geniuses are, for example, look at that famous golf player, Tiger Woods
Yes
Son of a Chinese and a black woman, and look
Right
He's a genius at that sport. And there are many cases like that
None
And,
Yes, it's that, i mean, fortunately, human beings have lots of virtues, even though we also have many defects
Sure
That's the human being's ability, to be always exposed to making mistakes
But if we're smart we can correct those mistakes
Right, because what must count most for us is
And, right
The mental thing. You have to act with intelligence.
Exactly.
That's what matters first
Yes, sure, yeah, yes
Yes
It's
Let's finish, until they give us the ti.
Right, yes
Here, I'm living in Florida now, but you do see interracial marriages, but mostly in the big cities, i lived in New York too
And it's very common there
Right
Here it's a relatively more... city
None
Small, the truth is i haven't seen too many interracial couples
None
I have see the Anglo against the hispanics.
Hello, hello
Hello. Yes. Who are you? I'm Olga.
I'm Alicia, how is it going.
Alicia. Very good, thank you very much. Where are you, Alicia?
I'm in Atlanta, Georgia. And you?
In Atlanta. I live in Texas.
Texas? how nice. Where in Texas?
In Keller, Texas
Where? Keller?
Keller, Texas. Is very near Fort Worth.
Keller, Texaxs.
Pardon?
Keller, Texas. is that I was trying to place it.
Yes.
I was trying to place it because my
Pardon - Oh, okay
My boyfriend
What happens is that is like Fort Worth but the area is called
None
I told you. But it really is. Even the zip code is of Fort Worth.
Everything is fine.
Yes, how is the weather over there?
There is no snow or anything like it.
Yes
It is cold, there is winds, and it rains
None
How is the weather in Texas?
For godÂ´s sake what do you think about today's topic?
It is fun I could be considered to be part of an interracial relationship because my boyfriend is white
If one want's to consider purely blacks and whites between interracional have done good too
Atlanta is a diverse city. There are many blacks, there are plenty of Asians, there are many Jews, Hispanics ect.
There is much diversity. It is inevitable.
Yeah that is truth. I agree with you, the same happens in Dallas in the Forth Worth Area.
None
It is not very big, but you can see it.
OK
A lot of couples Asians and Americans, Americans and Blacks
Of course.
You see many Arabic couples.
Yes and many more.
Arabs with with Latin women.
Yes really?
I also really don't see any problem with those unions. Because it's assumed that
Is true.
If a couple gets together, it doesn't matter what race they are. It is assumed that what unites them in the love, right?
True, yes more than the love. Also, a certain
Yes.
What is it called? a coexistence with the other person. In other words getting along so to speak, to agree with the same life values also.
Exactly. Sure
In that sense?
Yes.
One can say any race a good Christian, or be a lunatic
Exactly.
Then
Yes, exactly. I mean, to be a bad person you don't have to be of a particular racer. The same
Is true
To be a good person well neither. I mean is that there's
Is true.
Of everything in all the races. There's
Yes, is true.
Good people. There are bad people so then I really don't consider that is is a
Problem.
A problematic situation.
Bad. No, it's true. The most complicated thing, I think, is the marriage with different cultures, more than race or ethnicity. For example,
That is more complex.
Or the religion for example, even money, also.
That also
That one is poor and the other has a lot of money, is also complicated, so to speak.
Well yes. Because society is very cruel.
Sure.
The high society is very cruel right?
They get him.
Don't let just anyone in. Do I explain myself?
Yes. Is also true.
That really is hard.
Yes, is sure, on top of that the one used to the money is going to be more selfish so to speak and perhaps the other who has not had much money, will perhaps be
Will have bad education regarding the finances. I mean, perhaps would spend too much, for example, I don't know. Then there's a difference in values
Complicated.
Yes, that's how it is.
Selfishness.
You know also where I see a real problem?
None
It is in the academic difference.
That's true. That's very
Yes, that's a terrible thing, especially when the person with more that with more academic ability is the woman. is a real problem
None
The man feels terribly
Sure.
Rejected and inferior
True.
There is where.
I have a sister in Chile, for example that she has been with her boyfriend, three years already, And she went back to the university this year
None
Since she returned to the university they've had mere problems. He has gotten really unpleasant with her. He tells her unpleasant things because he feels insecure because she's not going to get a
He doesn't have a university title. He's also intelligent and makes good money, but simply doesn't have a university title. Now that she's getting one
He is being like mean with her. Is like really strange the thing.
Yes, exactly. There are very difficult problems to solve because is a made situation. I mean
Sure.
In this situation who is going to take her title away?  Well nobody, right?
But of course
WhatÂ´s good is that people learned well.
There are many problems with lack of education, many people have no education.
Of course a good education.
You have to study real life?
That is the truth too
Life is a school, constant learning
One can be in the same house for forty years and it would be a different person for the nation.
A person may or may not leave his room
Yes
In forty years you learn things.
Yes, it depends on what everyone likes, right? specially in this country. Here everybody can study.
There are economic problems here too, but not too much as in Latin America.
Yes
There is no point of comparison with Europe
Here in the united states we have to overcome
None
Loans and scholarships because they have to pay 30 thousand dollars a year
Yes
Then
Education is expensive but there are opportunities to acquire a grant.
Oh that's right the scholarships
Exactly, it is difficult because only those who persevere are successful
The worst is that there are people who do not have the necessary information
Of course.
They donÂ´t even know where to start
It is good to have associations help, for example here in Atlanta is a Latin American association(?)
They have all kinds of services where they help speak English and help you find work.
I guess in Texas there are also many of these associations
There are many ways of help. There is information
There are many ways of information and many people cannot get to it
Yes, thatÂ´s right
It is because they do not have a guide to tell people where to get help
People do not even know about these places
Exactly
None
Yes, Exactly. hay ignorancia por desconocer que existen estas cosas
Some people don't care about learning, they want to finishe their career and work.
They go to school and spend all the money because they're lazy and have no right to be in college
Yes because they are occupying the position of other people who would be much better
Yes that is the true
Yes it is needed.
That really is a shame.
Yes, because it's a drain of a drain of, yes. Pardon me?
They should ask whether you went to university.
Look I did go but in Mexico.
Good.
To the universe Yes, I mean but even though what happens is that since I lived many years in El Paso, Texas.
Yeah.
El Paso is on the border with Chihuahua
Sure.
I lived in both cities, no? In both countries.
Sure, it's true.
I was going to university in Mexico but I also had to go school in El Paso
None
As I tell you because
Sure.
Yes, because I really wanted to learn so well
That's true.
As the saying goes, where there's a will there's a way.
What did you study, let's say?
I studied a business degree.
For business, okay.
Yes, and in fact I had I had my own business in in Chihuahua.
Oh, how good
But unfortunately with the nine eleven events.
Yes.
That affected us a lot, it looks like not but affected there too.
Yes, it is true, yes. Everything changed, a lot.
Yes, then I had to close the business and I could do something else
Of course.
Once I closed the business I didnÂ´t like to be there anymore and then I came here and I am very happy here in
Is education in Mexico even better than in American universities?
In Forth Worth. what happens is that in Mexico it is more demanding.
That is what I found because me too. I had a year at the university in Chile and I have had three years at the university here
Yes.
They demand a lot, a lot more in Chile. And is
Yes. And what happens is treating students is totally different.
And the way that students treat the teacher
That too.
Here is very different completely.
Yes I know. There's that vibe of let's all be friends. That issue, a little
For example here in the United States the teacher cannot even speak loud to the student.
Hello.
Yes, hello, good evening, How are you?
How is it going? Is Marcela
Marcela, Good Afternoon, I'm Lorena. How are you?
Fine. I'm here in North Carolina.
Okay
It's very interesting what they want us to talk about because my husband is black and I'm white.
Really? You are an expert on the subject.
And, we have two kids.
Yes.
Yes, we've been together thirty years, so, No, I don't see any problem.
It has worked, right?
I don't see any problem.
No
I don't know, maybe because we are both artists I don't see any problem.
Yes.
I think that
None
If one thinks that maybe there's a problem, one starts to look at everything through those lenses. Or, this happened, and it must be
I'm white and he is black. Or, this happened, it must be, understand? And you start looking
Yes.
None
Yes.
We've been living in North California for seventeen years, but before this we lived in Los Angeles, in Hollywood. And there,
None
We said there wasn't any prejudice, but there is.
Yes.
We didn't realize.  We didn't have the experience of prejudice.
Yes, suddenly there are things, at the, the level of nationality, no? Not only on the level of color. No?
Yes, this is true.
It's true that I've read about many cases, I'll tell you directly, for example, Americans with Arabs, Americans with Chinese, and really, it's not so much the color but the, the difference in culture.
I think you're right that the difference in culture brings more problems
Yes.
Than this, than color.
Simply color.
Yes, my husband and I are both from the middle class.
Yes.
We're both from this
What nationality is your husband?
Sorry?
Where is your husband from?
From Los Angeles
Was he born here?
Yes, born here
I mean born and raised
Everything
Maybe that's why. You're Chilean?
On the other hand, I know about people. You have to dry them, I'm sorry, I'm setting the table, we're eating late.
Sure, no problem
No, i know about people that has gotten married with Arab people,
Yes
And has had a lot of trouble
Yeah, i really
Because the culture is so different
Yes, the culture on the woman's side, the submission, that sort of stuff. For example, i had a case now, with a daughter
None
She's, she has a boyfriend, a thug that's, right?, he's not completely arab, but you can tell the differences. And i tell her, keep those things in mind, right?
None
Because the way they dress, the way they speak, raise the children, all those things, those differences leave a mark, they leave a mark for life, so
To have trouble, and
They more you tell him it won't work, the more he will hold on to her.
No, no, I don't say it in that way.
Ah, we -
I talk about it. Yes, no, I don't get involved in that matter. I have several marriages that got me into my relationships.
None
No, I don't intervene in that. That's her liberty. Yes, I don't
No, it's that, unfortunately, we're humans. You see? And, the more people are against it, the more we want it.
No, and0 no, sure, no, that is, no, that I, I know that very But, I, no, I have spoken to her, no, i haven't told her, no, don't do that no.
None
No, it's her own decision, but it's well because maybe they don't know.
Yes.
They don't know the, the situation.
Yes, no, it's that sometimes that there are certain people that because of their culture they have a lot of pressure from their family to be
If you look at Oriental cultures, the Japanese, specially,  they don't mix with anyone,
Yes, they mix very !ittle.
There was a Japanese person born here.
None
She wants to marry with Westerner of any race
None
The Jap-eh, that family, it will be very difficult to open up.
Yes.
So
Sure.
This is the
Yes, I think, in any case, that interracial marriages, there has to be a very good understanding on both parts, and, and both, talking clearly
None
The same as the people
If they will be ruled by one law or another.
The problem is if you have two people who are religious but from two different religions.
Yes, this is really difficult to manage.
If you have people who aren't religious, or only one is religious and the other doesn't care.
None
This isn't a problem. But, if you have two religious people
Yes.
So, and they are from different religions, forget it.
Yes, from opposite poles.  I think it's very difficult to carry on one of these relationships.
Yes.
Color, the truth, I don't see a big problem. Today. . . it's true that many couples of different color. Right? Like you say.
Yes.
And in all ways
Yes, I don't think this is it. I think that is
Is not a myth.
It has to do with class, class, that's another difference, that also makes a lot of difference.
Yes,the education, I think that is very important.
If you have two people of two totally different classes.
None
If you have someone of upper class, and someone of a class
None
None
None
There's a total conflict.
Yes.
Because I don't care what country one is, nor how open minded one is.
None
We, unconsciously, are governed by the sense of class.
Yes,
We are all trying to, maybe we don't have much money, but we are trying to dress
None
Like we have it.
None
Do you understand me?
None
So that's what I know. That it's important to society.
Yes
Yes, and  there's,  the conflict, when you have
I have a question for you. You have a real case
None
Lets say there wasn't, there were no religious matter in any of both sides.
None
So rooted
No, because i was raised as a catholic, but I'm not a religious person that goes to church and all that
It's different
And he was raised as a Protestant but he's also not a [...] person
The children, how are you raising the children?
Well, it turns out that through our live we stumbled among Hindi philosophies...
Yeah.
And so, we followed those philosophies, even though we don't have a church or a place to go, or any of that, you see?
Yes
We follow those, philosophies and we pass them on to our children, we didn't raise them
Oh, Ok.
The, it just so happens that both kids are baptized
Yes
But, for
Legal matters
We did it for a question of tradition
Yeah
We did it for, the benefit and happiness of our family
Yes
Do you understand?, but no
Yeah, but there was no disagreement.
No, no, now, if he would suddenly start telling me that he wants to go to the church or something, then, i don't know
Yes
I don't know, I'm not gonna stop him. But if he starts bringing certain jewish-christian philosophies to our house, about which i don't
I don't adhere to, do you understand?
Yes
I don't know what would happen
Yes.
That's something I don't think that
Yeah
That is going to happen, none of us are suddenly going to
You opted for a third religion and the whole world is okay with that. What about the
We are bohemians, that's our religion
I see, but how about the food, the way you dress, the way you relate to other people, did you have lots of things in common at the beginning?
Or were there lots of differences?
What do I know, I'm from Argentina and the Argentinian culture is very European.
Yes
Do you understand? So, there's no difference I don't know about other countries because I have never been to any other Latin American countries.
I see, yes.
I was nine years old when I first arrived to New York.
Yes.
They'd say as they do in Buenos Aires.
None
Why did we come here? Do you understand? This
None
What do I know? I've learned to cook different dishes because he grandma raised him and she'd cook certain dishes
None
I got worried and I started cooking because my dad likes to cook when he got worried
Sure.
How to make those dishes.
I see, yes
I do it to give him a little taste of home. You understand me?
Sure, yes.
Is not a big, a big change. I mean, he eats everything I cook him.
Yes. There's no problem.
Yes. No,no
No, I congratulate you both. Is interesting, right, is interesting. right? it gives you the chance to talk. Because, I've seen many couple
I've never talked with a couple of about this topic. Right
Yes.
Couples that are different.
Maybe, it has to do with the fact that we are both artists, we are both middle class.
Yes,
You know? Perhaps, if we people that worked in factories, that,
None
Perhaps there would be, I don't know? more difference. I don't know. But, we have the same education levels.
Yes,
We have many things in common.
Yes, I think that in  the education is very important. I think that, more than the class and all that,
The class goes hand in hand with the education, almost always.
Yes.
I think that the education is very important. It hurts me a lot seeing people that are racist, that, for example, I know someone who has a grandchild who is black. right? And, the man
Yes
Doesn't accept for the girl to get near him. The guy is ignorant. How is it possible person for the color
Yes.
He doesn't let his grand daughter caress, kiss and fuss over him?  No.
None
It disgusts him, right? That is great
How are you? What's Up? And you? Fine. Yes, I live in New York.
Yes hello, how are you, my name's Maria, what's your name? I didn't hear very what's up, how are you, where are you from?
And where are you from, I live in New York, I'm from Panama.
I also live in New York but Mexican, yes, how long have you been here? How long have you spent here?
Yes, what's up, how do you say, I've been here for about fifteen, eighteen, sixteen years yeah
I'm in New York in
How do you like the topicand what time do you have?
Two years. But I lived in Boston before, and so I've been about seven years in the United States in total. Not so long.
Ahhh yes, I'm you're dad
What do you think about the topic
Well, I think it's a good topic.  It's a very delicate topic but yes, when they told me marriage, I said well, it's an easy question
None
Really marriage is something that's indicated by God and really all us human beings should look for the way to not only get together as a couple but really
To get to this commitment, a couple
And suddently you don't like him and you leave him and look for another, and when there's marriage it's different, it's more serious
Sure, a compromise, no
More biblical an issue more, you understand as a compromise, exactly, and ahh I think that when the first marriage between Adam and Eve because God blessed them I think that what happens when they get married, what a marriage does is
That the priest, the minister gives the benediction before all the witnesses and takes the couple and from there forward
Interracial
You know and from there forward they're a couple with interracial marriage, I tell you it's becoming a more delicate topic in the wait a moment, in the sense that, that
There are races different from ours, for instance maybe not Hispanic
Arabic, and it's not only the
Maybe the difficulty is more in the difference in culture rather than in race.
Hat's why when they say different race it means also different culture, because actually if, for instance, a Mexican marries an Argentinean it's different, it's the same
Right? it's the same race but different cultures, and that's where the shock is, you know, for instance if you tell me about
Yes
And Arab with a Christian, then there is some, Arab with Hispanic that is a shock not only because of
Yes
Culture and race, but also because of the religion. The Arab is Muslim, and the Hispanic is Catholic, Christian. So, when the sons come, there is a conflict.
When the Arab want the sons to be Muslims and go to the Mosque
Of course
Hispanic wants the sons to go to a Catholic church and be baptized as Catholics, then we enter a plane
Different, because if you have experienced that of a relation with another race
Different one, a very delicate situation, you know what I mean
Have you had any relation with somebody of another race? I said, have you had any relation with somebody of another race?
What you say? yes, I had once a relation with a Jewish girl
None
There was this question about, you know, not really the race and habits are the same, but the
Those people, yes, of course.
Wait one second, didn't you say you had a relation with a person?
Yes, no problem.
Of another race
I was with a Jewish girl, yes.
And, yes, it was different
Yes, it was different, we had different habits also. LNot only that, actually I had two relations with
None
Look, I had a relation with a girl who was a girl but her relation as far as religion is the same, the same catholic religion
Her habits were different, her culture was different, but there was not really a big big
None
The big difference is religion in my opinion. Religion makes a very big difference.
None
You know you get used to culture and so one day you married a I don't know
One day you eat the food of his country and the other the food of your country and you learn the language
You can learn a lot of things, but, converting to his religion or him converting to yours,
None
That's the problem, I think that in this sense, religion makes a big
It is bridge hard to cross, because it is a question, a tie you don't want to break, that is the question, you just don't want to
I have never had a relation with somebody of another religion but I guess it must be very difficult
Yes, for instance
The believes are absolutely different
For example, to save your Saturday for that person, if you are free and you want to do and undo, if you want to do
None
Lots of things during the Saturday. Do you understand this person? She doesn't save the Saturday so they go out on Sundays, but Sundays to you are to attend church. It's not so.
Yes.
I'm telling you, each activity in life can lead you to, really, the food, traditions
Yes
When it's something interracial or religious, I think that it's a huge problem, the same
The same racist, you know, the same subject about race that, I've seen a white person married to Hispanics and they get along fine because they share the same religion.
Yes, yes
My same beliefs but I'm telling you, when they have a different religion, then it becomes much more stronger than religion itself, that
Yes, m, yes
That the race. I've no experience with other races, have you had any experiences with other races? Have you had any experience with a different race than your own?
No, I haven't. I'm sorry, no. My relationships have always been with
Yes, you haven't had any relationship with a different race, aha!
With Catholic people, I'm white and white people, but I believe that's because I was raised around white or brunette people but for some reason
I don't know, I've always been attracted to white people so, I realized it when I had to talk to someone
It's true, yes, I
About this same subject, I then realized that I've always dated white people, I don't know, I do have friends from other races, other countries and other races and all of that but I've only dated white people,
There are, so if you saw me, I'm brunette so
My brother is a brunette, my mom is a brunette but I've always dated white people
Yes, how old are you?
I am twenty-five, I'm still young
You are young already, maybe you will change your
Yes, I'm open to anything, the only thing I feel like could stop me would be someone like
Yes.
Going with a Muslim who is very stuck in his religion I think it has to be very difficult, right? The same with a Jewish who is very Jewish, I don't know if I could
It is also related to
Good evening
Hi, my name is Ramon, from Los Angeles
Ramon, my name is Carlos, from Houston, Texas
From what?
Yes, Texas
Houston. I have spoken with you, right?, or
Yes, i think
Yes
And, what's today's subject?
The subject is marriage, yes
Yes.
None
What do you think?
I'm not married but i had eight relationships.
I've never been married.
Where are you originally from?
Los Angeles
Los Angeles?
Yes
Your Hispanic nationanlity - from what country?
From from Mexico.
Mexico?
Yes.
Is your relationships more with Hispanic people ?
It depends what stage in my life. There isn't any particularly.
Okay and what do you think then of interracial marriage?
Well, I think in this area in Los Angeles, 50 percent of the people that live here
Weren't born here?
Really?
Yes. And there's a, there's interracial marriages and that but there's social pressure that is not is not like something good.
On behalf of the people here and
Yes?
I was seventeen years old.
Like is not something bad in relation to when I was seventeen years old, socially different.
How old are you now?
Fifty eight years old.
Okay Then, ah well for me. I think there's no for me, I don't think is a big deal.
None
Maybe it doesn't matter, we already at a point where society accepts that
None
The interracial marriage. It all depends on what place one is in
Towns that were more affected than others. If one has a relationship that is of Hispanic
None
I don't think that difference is that much.
None
That if one person
There are a lot of marriages in Houston. I lived in San Antonio once.
In other words is living in Houston, the great majority of the population here is Hispanic
Yes.
None
So there are many interracial marriages between the blacks and the Asians with the Hispanics?
Mostly whites. But I don't know I don't know how much it is with blacks or Asians with the Hispanics.
Yes.
Obviously I mean blacks and Asians are a minority here in Houston in comparison to whites
Yes.
Hispanics
None
That it wouldn't be, is not that easy finding a relationship as far as that. But. Now if it's independently of that, whether is white and Hispanic, white
Black white, Asian
None
Or any other combination here I have never seen that it is something bad
None
Have you seen someone who has
It is
That has
Yes it is interesting because here there are there are pressures, social limitations here in Los Angeles and a person with an interracial marriage maybe
It depends on the social situation. For example, I work for the union.
The members are thirty five percent Hispanics, probably fourty percent are blacks and thirty or twenty are whites and the rest are Asians.
Okay?
When there are meetings there are problems, there is tension.
There is an attitude to free interracial marriage but some people do not share that attitude.
Yes. according too, that it also depends a lot in so to me
None
I do find that, The Hispanic have found themselves in a point of not being so much different in the fact that if a person wants to
Marry a person who is
No.
There are other races
Are you, are you married now?
No, I am single.
None
To me, I mean, I've always been attracted to people, to white people.
None
Ever since I was little I always was attracted to white people
And then, there was never a problem with my family for that.
Yes.
In Puerto Rico there are all types of races. Puerto Ricans can have a
We have whites, Hispanics and black people.
Yes, but Puerto Rico.  There are all types of races, and we have people that have
It's similar to Europe, since the
Exactly.
White skin is more in favor than the ones whose roots are from Africa.
We have all types not one is bigger than the other, so if you are attracted to whites, it has to be a difference too between
Whites Puerto Ricans and
Yes.
Americans as is.
None
It's just an idea I don't think that, that's a huge difference for the worse, I mean, now that we are so Americanized.
No.
I now see that other Latin American countries, oh...
Yes.
Yes they have that discrimination to a certain point.
Yes.
The fact that someone that you cannot go out with that person because she is Anglophone. Is like it is not accepted.
Yes.
Even so I think that it is more  difficult for people from Asian origin.
None
It makes to certain point for blacks I donÂ´t know how true is it.
Do you think there is a racial problem in the society? Do you think there is prejudice for different groups?
Do you think there is a racial problem in the United States?
No. I don't thinks so. It has changed a lot. In, I only
None
I moved here to Houston about five and a half year
Yes. And how old are you?
Pardon me?
How old are you?
Twenty eight.
None
I have been here for five years, almost six years and the time I have been here never, I have never have problems in relationship with race
But again so in in Houston, I think that now, we are in the fifty one percent or something like that
That there are more Hispanics.
Yes.
In Houston compared to any other race.
None
Even the whites. So it is not difficult to find the fact that there is not so much discrimination against Hispanic.
None
Well so as I told you.
Do you think that society in Houston in Houston area is there is not so much racism?
There is a little.
None
I donÂ´t think that it is, no. When you come, To, to relationships.
None
Everyday, you can go out.
None
I have found a person. white. Is going out with, is holding hands with an Hispanic or a black person and it is not a problem at all, so it is not.
NONE
Something like. here it is going to be seen. as something bad
Yes, here in Los Angeles, the neighborhoods are segregated here and most of the Hispanic live in the west of Los Angeles and the blacks on the south of central Los Angeles
There are neighborhoods that are, there is integration, but there are parts of Los Angeles that are without a question segregated.
There are many neighborhoods here that
Yes?
Most are Hispanic, most are blacks, most are Asians.
Yes.
But one like that independently of the race segregation
None
A person could be in an intimate relationship with a person from another race
Hi!
This is Aurelio from Washington, DC.
Hi, Mayra, nice to meet you, I'm here in Philadelphia
What's up?, what' your name?
Close, Mayra
Mayra, great, nice to meet you.
Yeah.
Today's subject is a, very profound subject, so, you needs more than twelve minutes to discuss it
None
Go figure
Right?, we're gonna run out of time right away
Yes
Yes
What do you think about religion?
Oh, the truth is that.
Hello Mayra, I can barely hear you.
OK
Now
Okay, but I have never liked too much what religions do, because otherwise I think that it
Gives good things, it gives moral, hope, whatever you want, but, i don't know, it marginalizes a lot of other people, for example, it excludes many others
Sure
I don't understand why it has to be like that. I think that the problem of religion has existed for many years and will probably continue
Existing for a very long time.
Sure, unfortunately that will never end.
Then yes, And I don't know And for example the Buddhist one is the one I like the most. Because it doesn't exclude any other, I mean it just
Explains in terms of the Buddhist religion, how the others also are not good people, if that's what it's about. And is that
Sure.
Yes, it is very different from the Catholic one. For example, if you are gay you are completely out of the church.
Sure, yes. They are very racist because they exclude certain groups and those type of things
They discriminate a lot.
Unfortunatley they are discriminatory.
None
I tell you something, I've never believed in any of those in any religion. I consider myself totally without any type of of
Of religiousness I think that the religions is always like they bring out the best and the worst in the individuals; each person
Yes.
The discrimination, the racism, and murder represents the worst of the human being.
None
Persecution that's a horrible thing. Just in the name of God and the worst thing of all is that in all those religions
None says that you should persecute another person. Because that person is of another religion or way of thinking or skin color.
Yes, they feel.
Is it what is happening between Muslim and Jews. That is horrible how?
Where are you from?
I was born in Venezuela
Okay
Where are you from?
I am from Mexico.
You are from Mexico.
Are the majority of people Catholic there?
The majority of people are Christians.
Okay
The majority, are like that I imagine in Mexico is the same thing.
Yes
I was raised catholic. My parents raised me to be catholic. I was baptized and everything butI donÂ´t like nothing of that sort of things
I think that religion is a fact of life, that people should have as an adult, understand?
Really?
Teaching a child religion is practically brainwashing him.
None
What they have done throughout history is, simply, brainwashing.
Yes, of course.
Yes. that's one of the worst things that religion brings human models, the best thing is art, you understand this study and all literature.
It has inspired. But, I mean, it is like it is very difficult to get the middle point, you know what I mean? something where
People accept each other. Tolerance is difficult
Yes, that's right. That's true, it is very extremist
It is hard
If they could
That's why, right now, all this is happening with terrorism, they take the name of God
None
To commit murderers, you know what I mean?  In the name of God, that is terrible.  Understand?  If you name
God, Allah as they call him. It is not said in the Islam or the Koran that they have to go kill other people
People in the name of God, to sacrifice people, understand?
Yes
It is a terrible thing.
But precisely
You know how? Hello!
The communication cut off. Mary, I hardly hear you. Actually I don't hear you at all. We will talk later. Bye
Hello?
Hello, how are you?
Fine, who am I talking to?
You're talking to Vicente, in New York
New York, I'm Paulina
Yes, and you?
And i live in Athens, Georgia
In Athens, Georgia, right, originally, where are you from originally?
...from Chile.
From Chile, I have a person. I'm originally from Panama.
And you? Oh yes
From Panama and i have a person that lives at mi house, here where i live, that is from Chile, i live in a building, in a leasing building
What's that?
I'm saying i live in a building, in a big house of apartments, of apartments
Right, and you don't know any Chileans do you?
No, there's one, there's one that lives here, he's from Chile, a lady that's from Chile, i don't remember her name but I've spoken to her a lot of times
None
She's from Chile
Right
She's a little bit crazy
Yes
Yes, they are calling me from Chile. M.ost of the Hispanics are always talking about something. I don't really understand of the Hispanics that come here to the United States, they speak as if they had already traveled
To a paradise, if they had arrived to paradise, the others do it too
Nostalgic yes
The blacks that come from the Caribbean do it too, they talk as if they had come to the United States paradise.
Yes
Do you understand? Most of the people that do are quite poor. They want to tell the other people that they live like kings
And the most reasonable thing to do, for the educated ones, is to not talk. Don't say those things.
Oh, yes.
It is different because...
How long have you been here in the United States?
I've lived here for over forty years, over forty years
How old were you?
I was about ten years old
No, so you don't miss your country.
It's like, no, I don't, I like my country but I know how the people talks
Yes but ten years, you don't really know what it's like
No, a few days, two three years, I don't know much but I cousins that are here.
What a country is
Nd when I was a child, when I was a child, three years, four, five seven years old I'd send him to Panama, to a Latin country, he likes it because they can run all over the place and they have a good
Everything, but when they reach the teenager age right the age of fifteen and thirteen and you make a request, they begin to complain of everything. This country is poor, does not have this, and complain when they come back here instead of
That country doesn't have anything. There is no hot water, the bathrooms are not pretty, and they complain about it all
Yes
None
Well, it depends where you send them.
Yes, yes.
It depends where you send them from.
Yes, yes, yes, but when they come back to other country they much more poor that the United States, that is a realty. But we do not see it when we are
Well
Older, that pretending that all
Or you move, like in my case, to study because you can pay and study here.
None
After that, you stay here because you marry an American, not because you are in a bad situation in your own country.
You are the most you appreciate the United States.
The lease refined you are, the least you know the difference between you country and, the United States the richest country in the world, see it
And nobody loose it. When I come back to Panama, I'll go to the hospital to visit sick people.
Waiting for their medication, sometimes waiting for medication sometimes given to them by the United States for free. That is a thing, I would not like to be in that situation, if I were in Panama, I donÂ´t
I would not want to go to a hospital, I would come back to the United States immediately. Because what they have there, what I see, the machines and all the life support
All that stuff, it does not exist in countries in the
No, of course that not, but it does not means that those countries do not have its beauties
In the hospitals. Although it is somehow beautiful, but beauty is not enough, beauty is not, and when I say beauty I mean the region
I must pay attention, on how to live
Well, every person has his own priorities
Yes, it's different. That's true. And the truth is that a lot of people don't want to face it. I have gone back to Panama. I have gone to
I see the palms, but all those things that people in general, especially the poor ones, they are fed up with politcs. And the rich people come to the united states
No, I don't agree, because if you, if you are alright in your own country, first of all you just don't leave
No, the most rich and powerful come to the United States from everywhere
You don't leave the country
It is an international thing, rich people and powerful people. That's international, while poor people don't know a thing, they say such stupid things that sometimes you can't help laughing
They miss their culture
Or the 'guineos' and bananas in Ecuador, the banasa and the plantains and all that, it's the same all over Central America
We should be talking about marriage, andreligion
Yes
We are supposed to talk about religion
You are not religious, are you?
I am religious, in, Christ, I am, I am religious, yes, I am very religious, I am
No, yes, 'in my own way', I've heard that quite a lot, yes
No, it is the the lifestyle you live.
Yes.
If you go to church every Sunday yet act bad afterwards.
That is very different, my way of living, I live a way
Yes, And how is your way of living?
Logical and smart
Laughing at the people.
My grandmother would go to church all the time, but my grandfather never would.
What church did they go to.
Do you think if God comes here right now that my grandfather would be the first that He would take to heaven?
Because that man never says anything bad of any person he gives to eat to any other person he lives a life is a life that, that you, is a life, How do you say it? a correct life I don't know how you say the word in Spanish
English is the word one that lives right is much more religious that a person that talks about it
No, I don't agree it depends on the religion.
Understand? There are people that talk about it but don't live it.
Yes
You understand me living means that if I'm here see
No, there's of everything, there's of everything
And you are a Muslim, you are a priest or whatever you are because I live right I respect you as a person and I say right things and
That makes me more powerful than one that only talks about their religion and talks it and practices bad things and say bad things about another person
No, I agree, but a person that also listens to the rest. That has religion or not.
That, yes I hear like that yes I also see it, because the thing is that here in New York right
None
None
And if I want to eat food from any other country, from Brazil, I want to eat meat the Argentinean way.  I have it near Ecuador, from where ever
When you can live with all the people and get along, that's the most important, as well as religion
Here in New York there are all kind of religions. And when you are, a person, right?
Just, a just person, you say just?
Whatever. Not only just but a person who respects everybody and goes, Good morning. How are you? I don't mind what is your religion.
Right, that's the word
I won't say that's bad, it is good, living this way. That to me, is more religious
Than talking, I know of people who go to the church, and when they are in the church they start talking bad, and want to do bad things, and they go to the church every Sunday, you know what I mean?
Other people don't go to church but they live honorably.  You can see right now, a lot of parents
How you call it? the people of
The priests
The priests, who preach that living honourably is much more important than just the religion. There was one, that's all I know, one gringo in California
Shula Sholo
One what?
Shuler, that's the name, he appears every Sunday on the TV, right? That man never talks about God, no, no, he doesn't talk about God much, you know what I mean?
He talks about living honourably. Inspiration, you know what
Well, that's what it's all about, religion, excuse me
To me, to me
I think that religion
Yes.
That teach to live correctly, it is a religion worth to follow, a religion that is based in preach and not practice, as you are saying, then it is worthless,but I do not agree that you should not be religious at all
No, you don't have to be religious .
I am not telling that religion will help you if you live the principles taught by it.
Yes,
If you donÂ´t live it is worthless.
Well, it is a different kind of religion, I remember once I was watching a movie and a man was diong things
He was acting like a priest or something like that, but he was not. A priest of your religion acts like a christian person.
Or a person from a religion do you understand me
None
They are telling people that he is corrupted. You don't act like a person with a religion or spirituality. No, then he is telling me I don't care what your religion is, but you are not acting like a moral person.
Understand it
None
He was correct, he was not a priest, he was acting like a priest to. steal and stuff like that, but the priest who were very intelligent told him that
I do not care which one is your religion, but you are not acting like a person of, spirit and a person that, lives correctly and you are talking and I donÂ´t care which religion is your religion.
I say that the way you act and stuff and I have always look that do you understand me. the religion as they said, they said in the question the assigned to us
That if religion separates us or helps us, that was what they told
Yes something like that
Something like that, if it separates, because many people have died because of religion
Yes
Many people, have killed for religion, I don't know if you remember, when I went to school in Panama And I was talking when the conquers , the conquers come to
Yes in the name of religion the people do atrocities
Yes, they killed many people because they asked you if you believed in God, the Indians beleived in God but they called him a different name.
The Indians were more religious than the conquistadors. but the conquistadors, would kill them because if they didn't say it they wanted, the God of the Christian.
The Catholic, but the Indian didn't know that type of religion. But they thought that a God existed and all that, but they had a name in the
Language of theirs, you understand me, and the conquistadors
Yes, I think that religion is good when one lives the principles it teaches.
Exactly.
Of how people see you, but I find that if there wasn't any religion at all, it wouldn't be too good either, because the people wouldn't be afraid of anything and wouldn't be governed by any good principle, so.
Good morning. I'm Marco
Hello, I'm Mariza from Philadelphia
Hello I'm also in Philadelphia
Well it's very cold,
We are definitely in the same city,
Yes well, today's topic of religion.
Religion
It asked it was, I think that it was that if it united or separated the people
Yes, basically, openly, and you, practice?
I'm from my family, I'm Spanish and in my family they are all Catholics and, although I, they baptized me and did the communion and got married by the church
But really I don't go to church nor do I practice, let's say that I believe but I don't practice it.
Is there any reason why you don't or is there just no time?
I do not have time because I have a little girl.
I say that going to church is for older people and it is a belief that one carries inside.
That are more used- that are more traditional and
Have time
Is optional for me, I don't think that God is going to punish me because I don't go to church, I don't know I
Is not necessary to learn there, what it's about
Okay
None
No is that tends to always be the same
Yes I grew up in, in Paraguay
None
I was born in the United States, I got baptized here and over there I had my first communion
None
It was something that I remember that the confession of the first communion was with a fantastic priest. A friend and I remember that what I had like that simply confessed that
The truth is that I didn't believe so much and, the way in which he told me that is
None
Perfectly normal, there's no hurry, there's nobody who will tell you, nobody can correctly tell you you're wrong or that it's a mistake or
It will come to you, if you are going to believe, you will believe so, it's as simple as that.
To me it seems fantastic the systems the way he put it
None
I now live with, she's not yet my wife, we are engaged
None
We live together and she has a five year old kid from a previous marriage, the famous marriage of someone who got pregnant and the family was Cathholic
None
The obligation of getting married
Yes like the same thing happened to my mom, yes
Exactly, and mine too, that now they
None
They are not together anymore
Mine neither, yes
Exactly, right? and, but they, my parents stayed together for, until, yes exactly
Yes, for the kids, sure
For obligation.
None
According to the church this would be something terrible on all aspects, of her divorce, that she's living with me in a
In a house and we are not married and the baby also, we had tried we are moral people we that's one thing that to me seemed
The church, I remember that, I saw myself in a religion that a friend in Paraguay was of the Baha'i and Baha'i basically believes that the nine religions
Major religions of the world are in reality the same God
None
Because seeing correctly, if you see any religion, what do they teach? You have to be respectful, you have to respect life, you have to be good with yourself, not kill, not steal
None
No, the rules are basically the same. Sure, the appearance of God to each one is different, depending on how one looks.
I also think an interesting way of seeing things, we tried a couple of, we saw the church
Yes, especially the Catholic church, the way that they treat the problems of the homosexuals for example
None
Regrettably, a few months ago an uncle of my girlfriend died. He was homosexual, but he was always very religious.
Roman Catholic, which basically meant that he self condemned
None
He was a homosexual and we tried to do excercise
He tried to find a way to stop being homosexual, but he just couldn't do it and it seems terrible to me for some people to listen to the church say thing like
For example, to say, for example, the idea of, that no sex, no, no, one shouldn't have sex before getting married
None
Never in past centuries did that happened in reality
Exactly
It is not respected, everybody is, technically
Living in sin, no?
We are sinners
Yes
How is it that you can respect yourself or others?
We are all sinners, we are all going to hell,
Yes, all of us, exactly, yes
I also remember when I used to go to church
Isn't the power to forgive others, something from God? Is it forgiveness something that we all should also be trying to achieve?
We should be able to forgive our enemies
None
But if one is a homosexual, or if his marriage didn't work, it seems to me
I believe that religion was necessary back in the day when there was the need of uniting people, it was very important then because there were lots of problems in the world
It worked perfectly, of course, Catholics, Roman Catholics decided to go to war to try to eliminate other religions because, suddenly, each God
That, every God is different, omnipotent, but, no one recognize neither of them basically the Catholic, for example, believe that, perhaps means that Catholics believe that
How many in the world? Most of this planet is condemned because they grew up in families who are not Roman Catholics and in that case they are not baptized
Then all the creatures that died  in the tsunami perhaps went to the limbo or to hell because they were not baptized?
It looks to me something barbarian. Something of the barbarians.
None
To think that way
It is that religion should be something of each person, something spiritual for each one, not to put some rules and tell you to do this or you cannot do this and that, and it is present between in
A part of life so important because, today, I know very few people
Yes
Really nobody is perfect and no one has to love a perfect life to go to heaven let's say, then
Everyone sins every daily.
Exactly,
It is not a
It is impossible
It is not, well I am not a saint.  No.  I am practically the devil in person
The kind of things that I do are things that all do. To me it looks like an example for the war against the Middle East.
None
A thing against Muslims I have known people, I knew people when I was young,  Muslims, they are people, like any other people
None
They believe in a ridiculous God that I say looks like our Catholic God.
Our God is also something ridiculous each one is, it looks like a fairy tale , of creatures
None
If you see how people act every day it is obvious that they believe is a fairy tale.
Yes
It is, no one follows those rules, no one no one feels bad for not going on that day no one, except of course, the sister of my, of my girlfriend
She is a born again.
Yes
She is a fanatic
I see
Before of drinking water from a water fountain she makes the cross sign and, and prays, really, literally
Hmm,
Things like that and she goes to the train station and the bus station to hand out papers, telling please save your soul
None
Have you ever seen a Muslim trying to convince all to be Muslim? Have you seen a Buddhist?
Going everywhere with
Exactly
With a big belly, with, without a T-shirt sitting on something orange trying to convince people to convert to Buddhism?
Yes, no
No, only Catholic right? No, not even Catholics, Christians
Yes, the Christians, because the Jehovah witness do the same too, they also go to
The Christians.
That's already imposing the religion, is not even that a person feels a believer or has for example, my daughter, I
Exactly
Am Catholic, but I'm letting her grow up and that she
At the same time, I had no intention at all of insulting your beliefs. I absolutely believe that.
Hello I'm Fernanda
Hello Fernanda, Alvaro speaking, how are you?
Hello, how are you?
Everything's good and you? I'm calling from Austin, Texas.
Good, where are you calling from? We were in Houston not too long ago
Where are you calling me from
Very good from Washington
None
Yes far
Why were you in Houston? For vaction?
Yes my cousin lives there so we went to visit but where are you from?
I'm from Uruguay
Okay,and from Colombia
And where are you from? Columbia?
Yes and in Uruguay. The people I know in Mexico there are many religions, they are very religious
The official religion in Uruguay is not so much Catholic, but the people are, in a way, quite open.
None
Yes rather like the older people the people that are older are like more conservative but the youth are like more open and like are not very good into being religious and that
Religion yes, in Colombia the truth is that there where quite religious not so much as in Mexico but yes.
The same that the Catholic one is the most let's say that everybody is Catholic
Sure
But let's say we, I for instance am not very much catholic but most of the people go to mass every Sunday
These traditions have
Here in the United States maybe you loose this a little bit, don't you? because here it is no that common, right? there it is
Every family for instance go to mass together, things like this, you know what I mean?
Sure
Here in the very few time your whole family is together, you have to look for a catholic church, which I hear there is a lot.
That if the father is from whatever is better, so you have to search
None
After September 11th, it's become increasingly difficult and a great change against the Muslims, right?
Yes,but it is also because for what I have observed, here there is a lot of religious fanaticism, but it is a somehow passive fanaticism
That may be not like the Muslim one, the extremist Muslims who demonstrate and burn flags and so
And are there many, there where you live?
Where? no, but I mean that here there are a lot of religious fanatics among the people that call themselves Christians
Yes
They are evangelist, protestants, and so on have a very closed mind and intolerant.
Yes I think so I think so and here if you are, catholic, then that's all you can believe, right? you can't accept anything else
Nothing
Except that
The rest is useless.
Exactly and they go against that
Yeah
I don't know much but I think that here in the United States it's more for uniting I think that  it distances us a lot more
That it that there is sorry distance
It distances you more to be of another religion, to have a distinctly different religion than to have one of the same.
I doubt it
None
Yeah
It's a lot more extreme than anything else.
Yes it's true yes this here I see that there are people that they've gotten to the point of saying that Muslims like they are the opposites of Christians
They would kill them in that way just seems ridiculous to me
Yes and the same we say with the Jews around here for example in New York that it's pretty clear
Yeah
The majority of people are Jews.
I don't know how they associate you, if you are part a certain religion, if you personally are of a specific faith.
They are like against everyone else who is not Jewish
I know exactly what I have heard, here in New York, if you're Jewish it's very difficult to get into you know
They are it, to do business in New York because everyone's Jewish, you know what
Yeah, it's as if they're the dominant ones
It's incredible that something like religion
Yes it is like a little mafia to call it somehow
More or less.  I htink that Christians are the less ones, at least here.   But if you look at Muslims, it is exactly the same.
I don't know if it is the religion or the fact that they come from the same country, and they talk the same language, right? but they are what you say, like mafias that get together
It is almost impossible to get in
I think that religion sometimes is a way of manipulating people, creating certain fears, and in many religions imposing certain dogmas
People to attack them and not do certain things and manipulate them this way
Here, because many students come, from Latin families, or Arabic for instance, which are united families
And, coming here to study, they are on their own. Yes, I think people take advantage of religion, too. You saw what happened on nine eleven, didn't you? It was a lot of people.
Students, for instance, who were not even fanatics, but they took them and changed them little by little, right? and you get trapped in religion, when I arrived here
I started studying in the university and I remember that people came to me in the beginning, and told me about some party with free food and things like that, you know what I mean?
That is typical.
And you, in Columbia for instance, you never see that
Sure
They were all christian, right? and it was like obliging you to join because it was better than the other
I think because you are never so exposed in your own country, sometimes you don't know how to handle it
It was like a kind of imposition
It is like they start putting it in you through the eyes, telling you it's better because
I don't know, for many reasons, and they keep calling you.  It was incredible.  It is really a cult rather than a
They call you.
Yes, it is like those sellers that try to sell you a product and always have a different argument
Exactly and I don't know if they, it's just that I don't know, it seems to me like if they give them money just to see how many people, it's amazing, I used to say, how can they waste so much time calling people
Saying you have to do this, it's amazing, I couldn't believe that and suddenly you are in a country that is so open
You never expect it to be so tough about those things, no?
Yes, this country is very open and some people believe what they want to believe. But there are certain groups or certain communities that are
Quite closed, and there's no way to make them change their minds
Yes. In the University for example, I remember about the Jews and Palestine
None
They would put up posters, it was terrible, do you understand? of the Jews that had died, no?
Yes
I think that if you want to see that you can go in the Internet and find the most horrible pictures, do you understand?
Yes
But they'd put them right outside, I don't know, to me that was something that was wrong, do you understand? To see a dead child, things like that
It was shocking
I was shocked, yes, I think that in the end they are trying to make people aware so that they join them.
Sure, because they would show their point of view but the other side must be facing similar things
Exactly
But they were not showing them.
But yes, the religion, you know, my family has never been too religious so I think that now that they are here in the Unite State, they won't change, do you understand
Sure
I feel like there's no middle stance, either you are into that or not, you can see the churches here in Colombia, people
You go to any church, I mean you go to the one that is closer to your house.
Yes
And you see the same people in the church, here people make friends in the church, you know, and it is
And
Everybody goes to that church. It's very intense, like they are trying to hold people in.
But here church is more a circus than another thing because a lot of people go there just to make their
Not for spiritual reasons or some kind of religious ritual, they go there more to talk and meet people
And all the churches I have gone to here that are the evangelic kind, they are all rock and roll churches
Yes, they are like rock and roll
Because they all have an orchestra with keyboards, battery, guitars and they sing, and a chorus
It is not like when you go to a Catholic church.
Yes
Protestant, it is a circus or a music show, whatever you want to call it
Yes, you know what I mean?, I knew a woman who worked with me and she started going to a church, right?
I think the churches do it on purpose because they help a lot.
Money for a living, on return she has no option but to go back to that church
Sure
The same people called her, and they met on the weekends just like I told you. In Colombia a church is a place where you go to pray
You ask for whatever you want, and you leave, you know what I mean?
To your house
You go home and that is all you can go with your relatives here they tied you to the church and if you go to other church, horrible if you understand me so is like you are
Betraying
It is like changing from one bank to another
More or least yes incredible, then incredible because of that. I am not interested do you understand me to go to church or anything
And nobody likes anyone to impose nor believes things of that style
Exactly and see so like when the movie the passion of Christ
None
So many so the Jews did not want to see it and fought with people, I told myself, so do you understand me if
Hello
Hello.
Who is it?
Jose
I'm Olga. How are you? Where are you Jose?
In Nebraska.
In Nebraska, I'm in Texas
In what part?
In Fort Worth
None
At this moment I'm in Kansas, I'm visiting but in reality I live in Forth Worth
I lived there in Sherman.
Really
Yes.
Was that a long time ago
Four years ago
What happened why did you return somewhere else?
Problems with my ex.
Goodness
The farther the better.
Yes that's true. Is like that
Already when nothing can, not even the strength
No don't they say that by force not even the shoes go in
Not even the shoes go in.
That is good
What do you think of religion?
Yes well that topic we have already touched on it before. Have you gotten it already?
No.
No well I have already gotten it in reality I think that, that the religions divide, is a religion even in one single family.
None
Sometimes there are different members of that family with different religions
Yes, like mine,
Really
No, I'm Catholic. I grew up with the Catholic belief, and my wife, she's American, and she for them is anything, they go to one, and go to another
I think, they don't even know what they want.
None
They don't even know what religion they are; how can I tell you?
They don't identify with any
They don't identify with any. And, I believed
Yes
I was raised a Catholic, but here, where I am, I'm the only Mexican, the only Hispanic person living in this small town, so, we don't have any in Spanish
I rarely attend church now.
Yes, that's true that they are divided, there's this very special religion called Jehovah Witnesses
None
I feel that religion it definitely brings families apart since it's so radical, I know that they are very strict
I was attending some of them.  I went to that church on some occasions because I liked the sermons, so
None
They are all good speakers.
None
I attended some and, besides that, I really like what the speaker said. They give good advice.
None
Advice for your daily life.
None
Little by little, they kind of suck you in, in a way, how to say it? In a very
They suck you in completely, you only work for your church, you leave everything else
Yes.
Sometimes people, they don't agree with some things, right? To me, that creates a division between them because if I become of that religion,
My children will turn their backs on me.
Are you Catholic?
I was raised as one as you just said.
Me too
Yes I grew up thinking or believing I am Catholic but actually I hardly go to church or anything, I am not excessively devote
I have noticed maybe I am wrong but the Catholic here where I live right now,
None
Since I am not married to my girlfriend,
Yes
I don't know, I notice like the father, like he, leaves us out. He leaves us out because, because we are not married, because it is a sin to them, right?
Ok, how does he know?
Well, we told him because we baptized the girl.
Ok
We have a girl, and
None
Well, I wanted to go too. I just forgot I was not married.
None
I didn't forget. It's just that there was a different father before
None
He was so kind, and such a good person.
None
But man, they brought a different one here
None
They don't want me to receive communion.
Goodness gracious
I said, no, I don't know,
Well there it is another
I don't know what to do.
Sepparation is somthing like racism, it's similar to racism
None
Right
The other priest was a very nice person, very kind. He understood that my wife was from another religion
None
He understood us in everything, but this one is like discrimination.
None
The other one was very kind said, I understand that if my wife wanted to be Catholic I agree in helping you
In anything.
None
The other new one, he said, it's a sin what you're doing, and that shouldn't be. He didn't even want to baptize our daughter.
Goodness gracious.
Because, she wasn't catholic.
None
So, I said, well, so what future, what can one expect from the Catholic Church?
Well besides, it is not for nothing, the catholic church is very discredited with so many things that have been published of the priests
The priests
Yes then so many abuses, so many degrading situations that confuses you, at least I am very confused because I say how is possible that priests
Right believers with so much faith in God do that kind of things.
Well, other thing that I have. Right?
None
Maybe I am wrong too. I think they should let priests marry, they are beings
None
Normal, like you.
If I, look that I agree with you like the the how are they called in others religions they do not say priests, the, the
Pastor, or something like that.
The pastors, like the pastors who get married, and most of the, I think that in all the rest of the churches
None
They can get married, but not in the Catholic.
And I think that - well, I don't want to sound rude, as you also have needs, I think - Do you understand me?
Yes of course. Well those are needs of the human being then. How could a person live without those things? How can I tell you? in an nice
Way or consciously consciously I think that consciously no one can
None
Can live without that kind of situations, is like if you deny totally to go to the bathroom, to urinate for example
None
Well no, he can't, it's a physiological necessity
And here I've seen, I work in construction, we've worked in several churches,
None
I've seen the difference of the parents, because, from the other religions, they really like the priest, the kids go with him, to, to the church
None
In exchange working Catholics, I see the priest there alone all the time
None
He leaves, leave the church sad, talks with someone for a little while
None
With the same he returns to putting and well he's alone.
In reality, yes.
In reality he's alone.
None
In the other churches I've seen that they're so happy, the happiness that the priest brings, because, he has family, he has
Sure
None
Yes it's true like, when your necessities are satisfied then, this, it's a situation that really
None
That should be reconsidered: he argued a lot about this, and he didn't come to any agreement
Where are you from?
I'm from Chihuahua, Mexico.
From Chihuahua. I'm from Durango.
What part of Durango.
From there where the air returns, from Nuevo Ideal.
Nuevo Ideal
None
Nuevo Ideal.
Nuevo Ideal.
I know for example Villocamopo that the snow
No, I think that it is very remote there.
None
Well, I'm from there, but I was raised in Monterrey I came here when I was seventeen. But I go there every ten years.
None
I already don't have people there.
Then
In Durango, since little we went to Monterrey
None
To study, but no.
Ah goodness God you didn't see
I went five years ago.
None
I asked him about it in the fair
None
I looked at a boy, right?, pretty square, like we say [square as in a lot of muscles]
Yes
With hi t-shirt pulled up, showing his biceps and all
Right
And i said, what's with that Mr?, and that boy, he seemed familiar too, right?
Yes.
The next day, there was a mass at the ranch
None
My fathers, they're old-fashioned catholics
None
There's a mass, come on, you have to go.
None
Well, just not to get into an argument with them, i never looked at them anymore, I said okay, let's go, this priest is the beggar that was there.
None
And why?
None
If he was walking very muscly
None
I said to mom i'm not going to mass and they called me and that i had to pick up a cousin
None
I said, I'll go then, But I was surprised. I said this was the priest that was at the fair last night. What does a priest have to be doing in the fair, and then dressed like that?
How
And no
Showing off as we say.
Like looking to see what he could get.
That the song is like that, no. Well I was also born in Durango since very little we went to.
Yes?
To Chihuahua to Juarez City
Chihuahua.
I already, I already lived in the two countries, I lived in El Paso
None
In Juarez, then so
None
That's how our life was made.
That.
That's how it is goodness God, well, yes that, that topic of the religions is a very, very controversial topic, because there are so many, and many and many religions, and,
There's another word for that, What do they call it? they are instead of religion, there's another word, sects. There's a bunch of sects that
None
Hello.
Hello.
Who is it?
How are you? Adrian's speaking from Toronto. Ontario, Canada.
I'm Olga.
How are you?
I live in but at this moment I'm in Kansas
In Kansas?
In Kansas, look only
In what state is Kansas? Where?
Olate Kansas
Okay.
None
Kansas is the name of the state.
Really? yes.
Where are you from? Where were you born?
I was born in Durango, Mexico.
Have you lived here long?
Yes,I've been living here more than thirty years.
None
El Paso and Chihuahua.
You've lived here for a while.
Yes, a long time, and they have three
Where were you born?
Yes.
In Buenos Aires, in Argentina.
Okay. And you have the, you have the little speaking.
None
You have the very special little speaking from the
The little speaking, the accent?
Accent, yes, in Chihuahua we say the, the little speaking so it's
I've never heard anyone say it like this, the little speaking. But it sounds nice.
Yes, it sounds funny, no?
And
Yes, well, what do you think about the topic today?
About religion? I don't like them.
You don't like the, the topics or religions?
No, the religions, because they divide people
Yes
There are wars because of religion and all this.
None
I don't find it bad that the people believe in what they want
None
But for me religion is a structure of power and is the, the churches and the, the pastors and the popes and or, or whatever they are called the, the Muslim version of that
The Jewish version of that, the version of whatever that
None
The religions as a structure I honestly don't like, although non really have a bad message or
That I already know. There's no religion that says, you have to go harm people,
Something along those lines.
None
And what do you think of the religions?
Well, I also agree with you, I feel that the religion divides because I was already telling Jose, to a gu
Whom I spoke with for a while yesterday, from Nebraska. I was telling him that I was in, in a family in the, the same members of the family
Sometimes parents are of one religion and each of their kids another.
Then there I see, a separation, because nobody has the same beliefs none of them, then because I know families like that
That don't get along because of that? They have problems because they have different religions?
They have problems because they are different beliefs, and even different ways of practicing the religion then
None
Yes, there is a tremendous conflict I could say that if all the religions were all the same religion I think
We would be more united beause we would be speaking the same language.
Yes.
And yes, I think that the religions would unite if we were all from the same
Yes, no, I don't know.  This is why, if religions didn't exist, if each one believed what they wanted without bothering each other, no?
Yes, what happens is that sometimes they don't leave you in peace, or sometimes, they bother you, no? the
Those of other religions, this is the uncomfortable situation, that everyone wants you to believe in what they believe
This is a little difficult.
But the religions that try to convert everyone to their side, I don't think belief in itself is bad.
For people to believe in something
None
Being fanatic like this, religion tries to convert everyone to their religion
Yeah, this too
This seems bad to me.
Yes, that is precisely where the conflicts are, because no one wants to leave the other in peace because
According to the reigion they follow, that everyone is practicing now, according to them it's the truth.
The best
Exactly. Because we're really divided for this reason. What do you think about homosexuality?
No, that is good.  Everyone leads their life as they want while not bothering others.  For me it's not different from religion.
It doesn't bother that other people can believe what they want
None
Because I'm not homosexual I wouldn't like someone to say that, that it's good and that it's bad or
None
None
None
Whether with religion or whether with the sexuality
None
That is something that I learned, after living a while here in Canada, that
None
Having the freedom or having the power of saying whatever one wants implies to hold in many things also or put up with things that you don't like too much
You have to, have to put up with it only because is the, the price you have to pay for the freedom or, or whatever
Something like that.
Yes, is true, is true that, what you think sometimes you have to pay a very high price. That is
Yes, that is one of the characteristics of the Canadians
None
Of being very respectful of the, the traditions of anyone
None
Whatever it might imply. Have you ever seen how the uniform of the Canadian mounted police is?
None
That are red and with riding boots and a brown hat?
None
Have you ever seen it in a movie or something?
Yes.
Can you hear me?
Yes, I've seen them. But like you say, in movies
Imagine that, imagine that this was
Where is it
Like twenty years back, there was a Sikh, do you know what the Sikhs are? They use the turban on their head
Oh, yes.
There was a Sikh who went and joined the mounted police because it was his dream
None
He approved the course and everything, and when it came time to graduate he wanted to keep using his turban
None
You know?
Yes
None
Yes well
So if he used the turban he couldn't use the hat.
Yes.
So, what? It was a whole topic here in Canada with people saying if it was good or bad to modify the mounted police uniform.
It's sacred only for respect.   The religion, the customs of a person.
Yes, it's
And
Sometimes I don't know!
At the end at the end, they let him at the end they let him and, and, and and if he has to use the uniform, he has a, a brown color turban
The same color as the hat..
Goodness.
That is a small story, right? - but that is the price that you have to pay
Yes
So that nobody comes and forces you to put on a hat.
Exactly.
If you don't want to or
That's how it is
No, I don't imagine something like that in the United States or
None
In Argentina or in some other countries that I know a little
None
I don't know how it is in Mexico but from what they've told me something like that would be impossible
Well, yes, in Mexico is very hard, how can I tell you? wanting to be yourself, is
The small things make a difference.
No, they don't accept it, realize that if, and if you insist in, in using that, that the majority of society didn't approve
Realize that they relegate you, they ostracize you, there is a lot of cruelty there, but that's how it is.
Yes and where you live are a lot Mexicans or all of them are american?
In the area where I live, there are only a few
Latin people
None
I have only lived here for a little while. When I was living in Arlington there were many Mexicans and Colombians there
Venezuelans
None
There is black people as well, but when I lived in Arlington I didnÂ´t see many black people
Dallas is full as well.
We as Latins do not have an open mind
About Latins
And things are different? right?
Is just that we are more quite and keep things to ourselves
Our ancestors were like that, so then this in our culture
We do not have an open mind.
We like to keep our privacy
None
That this how one believes it but do not exercise that right
The freedom of speech and things like that
Yes, so what do you think about Homosexuals?
I'm not in favor of but, well I'm also not against. I respect them the same as people, as human beings.
As citizens I don't criticize them, because I think that they, are like are their
Hello,
Yes, good evening, this , who is it?
This is Manuel from, I'm talking from Orlando, Florida. Where are you?
Manuel, hello, I am in Wilmington, Delaware, where are you from Manuel?
But did you know? well the only thing you know is that you were at a party, you got in a car you didn't know and you went to your house, so you can't give anything
I see, I am a neighbor of you, Panama
And you? Oh, my pleasure
Pleased to meet you, what do you think about religion, Manuel?
Oh, well, I'll give you my opinion, I think that, like they said in the introduction, unfortunately the religions have become way of dividing
Rather than joining people
Unfortunately, right?. I think, Manuel
Unfortunately, rigth.
The factions who have used religions with that purpose are a minority, the fanatics
Yes
No, because not everybody is a fanatic, and those who are normal in quotation marks mind their own businesses and don't mess with the other people
But then there are these mads who become destructive or who push you to the religion, who want you to live their way like it or not
That is out of place, right?
You are pointing out something very important, because we should be precise. It's not the religion that is bad.
Right
They are all good in the sense that they talk about peace, love, integration, that's alright. It's the leaders that are bad
This are those who don't complete all these precepts and more seem like zisana, they seem like a division, they seem like hate
They believe their religion is the best.
Start to compare themselves with others, that this is bad.
I like same as you I was raised Catholic
Heaven
But now as an adult who has judgment and can choose, what fits with me best, and I've become a spiritual person, I've been reading metaphysics like for five, seven years
Right
Ah, and it makes a lot of sense to me. That it's the most important for me to think that organized religion and, forgive me the term, the
The word that I'm going to sue is a chuleria.
Yes
Because they tell you that if you don't do what they say, father God with get angry, and the only way that father God will forgive you is if you come to my church and give me money
Yes, they're always talking about God, the punisher, who
This doesn't exist, this isn't right
It's sadder because we can see how many family, towns, nations are disintegrated by religious movements.
Through history, my love
Yes, all throughout history because one wants to preach over the other.
Not that for how many people, how many people have died in the name of religion
None
This is totally out of order and wrong. But we get back again to fanaticism, the confused or ambitious leadership.
This is, and
What do you think about religion and homosexuality
I think that this is out of context.
Sure it is. Church does care about what you do.
Yes but if God is good then all his creatures are God's children.
He doesn't care
They are God's children too and so I think that in this specific case, they are people that hadn't decided to be like that.
Or they have impulses or natural things
Exactly.  Human Physiology, they don't have control over that.
So, them
They don't choose it freely.
It's something that they are not hurting anybody with it and obviously if it's someone very
They change, it's none of our business.
They could be indecent and well that's another thing, but if it were by choice, then it would be different but they can't chose.
Between two consenting adults, who has the right to get involved, they are not hurting anyone.
Exactly. So, yes, why don't they try to do some research among their followers? For example, if they prohibit the entrance to the
White collar thieves, there are so many of them
They don't because they would lose money.
The hypocrites most of the so-called spiritual leaders, there are in it for business
Sure they are
It's just business.
Of course yes, in the name of God
In the name of God
That is a sin to me, to swindle in the name of God.
It's true, and, to the extreme, as I read the other day, of a movement somewhere, where the lady, the leader, had
To start she obliged the parishioners to purify with a kit of products, soaps and things, that only she sells
Can you believe it?
They could only bath with those products for the rest of their lives.
No
That was the initial business, and there is more
Look, I was getting hair dressed in the house of a black girl near my house, and she told me that her sister goes to a church in Pennsylvania
Right?
A small congregation, without a name
None
Sunday, the minister told his parishioners they had to give $1,000 because he and his wife wanted to go on vacation.
My God.
Just figure, I would have stand up, given him a couple of slaps and leave right
I guess that more than a stupid did it
I'm sure, I have no doubt about it
Give him the one thousand dollars
I would have dared, I would have stood up, slap his face in front of everybody and would have gone to my house. Can you imagine that, Manuel?
No but it's people, that's what they call alienation, alienated people. Perhaps you have lived that experience because money of us have lived it. If you tried to remove their blindfold
The get mad
No they get hysterical
They say that you are sent by the devil To change their faith
Ah, yes, to each their own, right?
Yes but is very sad when they do that with people. let's say of scarce resources, still
The elderly that are alone
In this country immigrants, people that are working hard and the
For example, I'm sure that you see in Telemundo.
They get
I don't know if it's Univision or Telelmundo Every Sunday there's a commercial of a church, of a Brazilian man
Every Sunday that is free has the blessed rosary.
The famous church
The water from Jerusalem That I don't know what crap
Universal prayer Those are absolute scammers, imagine that they there, from what I've read, they hire actors and actresses so that, eh they impress the parishioners with their famous miracles
They are actors
This is incredible
And their leader, who founded that movement five years ago, is a millionaire today. He became a millionaire with that, and laundering
Of course
Money from drug trafficking
I don't believe you
They found him in Brazil and I don't know where it is right now.
They're in Philadelphia, so you can find out
In Philadelphia?
In Philadelphia this kid, every Sunday brings a new chicherito. But they say it's free, no, you just go, but once you pass through that door
I am sure that they will get something from you.
I think that they say that they pass the basket three, four, five times, in one rhythm
No, I believe you, it's been more than twenty years since I've set foot in a church.
So
Simply because I don't tolerate hypocrisy, and I will get hysterical
Since the Catholic Church is massive, the priest can't really be in your life; this is another strategy of these small movements.
The know the lives of each one of the participants. They are small nuclei when they gather. What are the costs, the incomes
Incredible
They control life with the excess of money that they give them.
Incredible, with such a face
To the point where my brother met in New York, because I also lived in New York for a while. Two brothers from Central America, who found the check from
I don't believe you
The weekly pay of the pastor, and he returned what he
The entire check
What he wanted, what he thought he should spend in a week
Not my
They get to that point
It makes me sorry to hear these things, but there are people that seek it
Like this
What it is founded
He was one who happened, he tried to open the eyes of one of those guys, he knew them at work
He tried to talk to him, and the guy got angry.  He told him that he was an envoy of the devil.
None
How?
I would tell him thanks, I am an envoy of hell, thank you very much, bye and get disconnected And keep you row, you row your boat as you think.
What is your opinion about this last outrage of the Catholic church they say they are not going to permit investigation on priesta
To be sure they have not had homosexual relationships in the last three years
You know what they will say if you fire them.
No and what are they going to do with those they have inside
Because of that, no, that is too much hypocrisy, like you, too much hypocrisy, I donÂ´t know where they want to get with all that.
What I donÂ´t understand is why people, because like you and me
We can understand that one plus one is not equal to chair Or it is that people donÂ´t want to know my motherÂ´s cousins
There is one that goes to church Every Sunday and she firmly believes in this and she guides Your are going to, and she is not an uneducated woman, she is not ignorant, she is not
You going to tell me that she does not see the differences. That is what they call blind faith.
NO, because of that is that I say, they, that in other words it is alienation, alienated people are like that, they cannot reason, because they are dependent of their leader
In this case spiritual.
None
Everything they do they consulted with the leader. An old classmate from the university in Columbia
He is there When I went there, a couple of years ago, I saw that he was in a movement x, I donÂ´t know which one And he is a professional and I donÂ´t know how he fell in that,
I was interested in some kind of business
Weakness in some place.
Hello, Good Evening!
Hi, good evening, who are you?
My name is Niki, and you?
My name is Olga.
Hi Olga, how are you?
Fine, where are you at?
I'm calling from Florida. And you?
I live in Texas but I'm in Kansas City right now
I know it's cold there
Oh, it's terrible
Sadly
Yeah, that's it
Yeah, we're talking about religion tonight, what do you think?
Yeah, well I think religions do divide
Yes
If we all were from exactly the same religion, we'd probably be more united, but since everyone has their own beliefs, that's a way to divide. What do you
Yes, i agree, that's a tough question because i do believe that if we all were from the same religion, we would have less, less wars, but at the same time
I'm in favor of defending people's religions, and this is precisely why i really believe in my heart that every person has a right to their beliefs, but at the same time
I cannot deny that every war we have, the terrorists, unfortunately
That's true, it's precisely a part of, because we don't speak the same language, like they say, right?
Yes
The situation is the reality, although many times one doesn't want to accept reality
Yes.
We are seeing very clearly. It is impossible to deny what is so obvious, right?
Its been a top for the ages
That's it. Yes, well is a topic that in reality
Because of that
Is current right? It never goes out of fashion?
Yes.
There will always be people who are in favor
Yes.
Some in some religions they are so hung up on converting the rest.
Yes.
They are violating the rights of the other person, correct? I think
Yes.
Because no, Â who are they to assure that their religion is is the real one and in that of
Yes, I agree.
Yes, to try to change the mind of other people then there I think that it's an abuse to the intimacy of, of the other people.
Yes, I don't like how they think that religion is the only path. That is not fair. But imagine a world of only one religion, one belief.
Yes, there would be a lot of peace, but at the same time perhaps it would be better if there were more tolerance. They could tolerate more as far as the differences.
What do you think about homosexuality?
My parents are completely against it but I think that we are all God's children and of the divine holly spirit
They are too. Even if I don't understand it, as I'm happily married, at the same time I think they have a right, I think, I think, like any couple
Man and women, holding hands, kissing just like nothing matters, we are used to that but when we see two men doing it, we are not used to that but
At the same time, I think that they have a right to have healthcare insurance, just like they would if they were married, no?
That's why I think it's hard because my family is against it and they think, my family is Christian
We are all God's children.
I have the same opinion. I feel that they have their reasons to live as they do. I think they are people
Yes.
Yes they are good workers and respectable.
Yes.
Productive people, respectful, good citizens. I don't see why they wouldn't
Yes.
Why we shouldn't let them be, I mean. They have rights too, no?
Yes, I agree. Yes, what you just said is the key, I mean, respect, I think there are also lots of beautiful things that the
Homosexuals here. Lots of them are artists or painters, actors, singers, or designers, and we've benefited from that.
Sure, most of them are very talented.
Yes.
In fact, oh, we've known this for centuries and centuries, now
Yes.
It is like the society is embarrassed about that.
Yes.
Imagine that Julio Cesar was homosexual.
Yes
Also Charles the fifth. Then well many important people were homosexual. Pilate, then
Yes, yes.
Then well the truth is that these things have been always be seen but lately it is like  there has been an explanation in that sense
Yes, it is it has been a great controversy in relationship with I know many Christian Churches now have that topic and Catholic church is against it but there are many
Homosexual that are good Catholics - I think they have their believes and who am I to judge them?
Yes, we came again, if they respected the individual rights, the rest will
Yes.
They also deserve to be respected.
Yes.
As human beings because as you say in fact we are all children of God.
Yes.
I suppose that God love us all equal, there is not a reason for all earthly people right?
Yes.
To love more certain group of human beings. That cannot be.
Yes, I feel so sorry because always you hear of cases. I have seen in television maybe a male friend a female friend maybe an homosexual couple the husband gets sick, a couple who have been together for
Decades and one of them gets sick and the doctor donÂ´t let the other one to come in until he is too sick and that makes me feel so bad.
Yes, it is.
I think they don't have same rights and that is very sad.
It is like that, but in the United States they are more open in this aspect. There is a little bit more respect to
Yes.
To those couples but it is not the authentic respect that they should give to those
People right? Then it continues to be to be
Yes.
Different. They are marginalized even when it is said that we all are free, that we have the right to express ourselves freely, that we can do whatever we want.
That is only a word to say but the reality is that they don't have the sane right.
Yes, that is true
What is Diego RiveraÂ´s wife name?
Yes yes Friday, of course.
A very talented woman
Yes.
Very strong, she was .
Yes.
Very strong, we all can learn a lot from her strength.
Yes
She was homosexual too
Yes.
That's what I'm telling you. They don't stop being persons because they are homosexual
That's true, she was strong, she's, she's my favorite painter. That woman suffered and in that time
It's true.
Being homosexual was even more difficult, i think it's even harder in Latin America than here
Yes
But in that time it was hard anywhere
Yes, that's it. It was something similar to those who had a different religion then
Yes
Or catholic
Yes
There's always been wars about religion, always
It's true
Because even over there with the muslims, wars about
Sure
They don't agree with this, they don't agree with that
Since the inquisition a lot of last names, including mine that originated thousands of years ago were Jewish names
And because of the inquisition, they left, they fled, i mean, the queen, right?, how does the story go?, queen Isabel voted and I mean, she forced many Jewish and Muslims to convert
Or else... you know the story
Yes, like forced
Yes
People is unhappy because
Yes
You get happiness when you're free, make your own decisions in every aspect.
Yes
Every aspect of our lives, if anyone comes and we doesn't fit with the whole purpose of the human being
I think that many times the danger of someone being religious is when they're a religious leader and a political one too
None
Someone that has the power of both, there's always great danger there
Yes, because many people make a bad use of their power
Yes
It's a terrible problem and wars start like that, don't you agree?
Yeah, unfortunately
That's right
Yes. What country are you from?
I'm from Mexico
I met Mexico several times, but my brother got married to a Mexican in Mexico City in Mexico, and i loved it
Right. Yes, Mexico is beautiful.
Yeah and they're
Yeah, and where are you from?
I'm dominican, but since he got married, we all feel like we have a Mexican family, because every time he goes to
Yes, good evening, this is Patricia, who am i talking to?
Good evening, my name is Leticia
Hi Leticia, what country are you from?
Lets see if you can guess
Are you argentininan?
Yes
Where do you live right now?
It feels very different.
Look, you're close, I'm from Panama and I live in Wilmington, Delaware,
Yes, Delaware is very near.
Yes, tell me, Leticia, what do you think about religion?
They were giving options, and I think it unites or separates, mostly separates.
There are many religious people, but that are personal practitioners, right? , so there's this crazy fanatics
Yes
Who are the ones that make everyone's life bitter
Yes
If everyone minded its own business, minding your own, quiet
Yes
Lets be honest, Leticia, there is politics inside religions and they want to impose money related things.
Yeah, logically, religion moves a lot of money
All is money and then because of that is what they want, they want to superimpose on people and tell them, well my religion is better than others, so you must come here, of course in quotes, with your money
Yes
Right?Eh, I was commenting earlier to a guy whom I was talking with about Colombia,I was dyeing my hair dark brown, here in Wilmington.
None
This, were talking about religion, no, and he, I donÂ´t know, and he comes and tells me that his sister goes to a, denomination, to a, church, no, without a denomination
Tells that the pastor stood on a Sunday,
Yes.
The Pastor told the congregation that everyone must give a thousand dollars because he and his wife wanted to go on vacation.
No.
Can you believe that Leticia?
No I don't.
I would have stood up shamelessly, and gone home in front of everybody
Yes.
What is your opinion, about homosexuality, in, and the church attitude?
I think it is part of the old fashioned church that is in everything.  The church, I don't know is in a lot of things, not only in homosexuality
Abortion, abortion
Yes, abortion, the use of condoms, the Christian church also should let the priests to get married, for example, to me
I think the same, how could you give me, how could you give me
None
Instruction about problems I have in my marriage, if you have never been married?
Sure.
Do you have no idea of what it is to live in a marriage?
Logical.
No matter how much you study
Yes.
Because theory is one thing and reality is another.
Yes, yes, yes, logical. No that's why, I think that church is, has stayed in the past
Exactly, and I don't see what the purpose is
No, and throughout history
What they are doing is, what they are doing is driving away the
Sure, is what they are achieving, yes, yes.
For example that foolishness that the church has come out with, I, same as you was raised Catholic
None
Now that I'm an adult, I've been reading a lot of metaphysics, I consider myself spiritual
None
I've been reading a lot of metaphysics the last 5-7 years.
Yes.
I've got that one for me, it is very logical
None
No, and it doesn't have that stupidity that they want to put in your head, the organized religon
Yes.
Simple, I simply do my thing quietly I don't bother anyone, I don't let anyone bother me, but it's, is a logical thing
Yes, at the level religion is at, I think that is precisely what fails of religion.
The leadership, I believe that it's the leadership
Everybody is entitled to there own beliefs.
Exactly.
None.
The leadership
Of the religion, from the people that don't even care about the religion
That everything is related to money
Yes, they care less about that.
For me this has already become a vulgar business.
Yes.
Forgive me but for me this is like a form of prostitution
Yes. No, is, and, and they are going to lose people, I mean, is
They hound the weaker ones.
Sure.
The elderly, the sick ones for example I was talking, I'm sure because we see the same channel, you know Sundays on I don't know if it's Telemundo or Univision
That this Brazilian guy comes out and says that if you go to the church on Broad Street, they give you holy water from Jerusalem
None
That give you the blessed palm, the golden fleece, I don't know what's free, but you have a lot of security that once you go through those doors
Yes.
They're going to take a lot of money from you and so this Colombian kid was telling me, casually, there's a Colom- eh, there's a Brazilian, and I don't know if it's
That it was the same thing, and what he were doing was money laundering.
None
And he fled to Brazil because the police was behind him. this is why I say that tell them that he's in Philadelphia.
Sure
Have you seen these commercials?
No, the truth is I don't watch much television.
You have to put on one Sunday.
Yes.
It is Telemundo or Univision every Sunday.
Um. how embarrassing
Embarrassing.
It's totally embarrassing, yes in your country they're very religious, or the majority
All the great majority, I would say ninety percent are Catholics.
Sure.
Now, these Catholics who don't go to church every Sunday but just in the same church they're talking about fulanito and menganito, and looking at what the other wore.
Sure.
Sinning in the same church, no?
None
Judging others, let's stop being hypocrites here
Yes, no, is the the
Do you go to church? You don't sound to me like you go to church
I am not Catholic. I wasn't raised under any religion
I see. They let you follow your own path, to choose when you were an adult.
They let me continue by the path of not choosing a religion
I found out when I was already an adult. I found some old papers in my mom's house, my grandmother's will
None
That my grandmother had left the Catholic church seventeen thousand dollars in her will, to help a seminarian.
None
I almost had an attack.
My God.
I'm already about to knock on their doors to tell them to give me my money.
How they deceive the people.
What I don't understand Leticia, is that for example, I have some aunts, and some cousins of my mom. My mom is already seventy eight years old.
None
One lady in particular, very good with a heart of gold, goes to church every Sunday.  She goes to do her novena.
This not a stupid woman, she's educated, she was a teacher
Yes.
What I don't and it's been like this all her life, what I don't understand is how she can't discern
Between what she sees and the, and what's reality
I think that there's people who use it for themselves, like a spiritual escape, sometimes you have to release, anxieties, frustration, and
Yes, but when I was to release something inside of my spiritualism I talk with God directly
Sure.
And I tell him my problems and, and my anxieties, and what I want for me, for my kids
Yes.
I don't need an intermediary. I don't need a translator
Sure. yes, besides, they give them the title intermediaries, but
Yes, so if you don't.
Let's say, they're intermediaries
If you don't come to my church, my church is better than others, and if you don't come to my father God everything that you do gets mad
Sure.
If you don't come to my church and give me money, Father God won't forgive you.
The truth is that religion has held back civilizations and prevented them from advancing
How many people throughout history have died in the name of God?
Yes.
By mistake
By mistake, logically.
The crusades, my God.
Yes, that's why I believe that there are always people trying to take down other people.
To keep them subjugated and dependent of others.
A group of people is using us.
That is a shame
That is good but they take the word of God as if they really had it.
No, they have an schedule
Yes
We're the only ones left.
Yes
That to me is inconceivable and unacceptable, Leticia
Yes
Its been about 20 years since the last time I went to church. The new opinion of the Catholic Church is all avre the the news.
Now they are going to start inspecting those who want to be priests and they will find out if they have had homosexual activity in the last three years.
No, I didnÂ´t know that right?
What will they do with those who already are in there?
Of course, like child abusers, and
Well, thatÂ´s where I stopped going to church 20 years ago, when all of this came out and the attitude which they assumed was not good.
Of course.
Hey, Rome.
Yes
That they tried to hide it under the carpet, and you can do whatever you want to me but don't touch-- I don't have children, sweetie, because I didn't want to
Yes
Don't touch the children
Yes, logical
I don't have children, it doesn't mean... do you have children?
No.
Even though we do not have children, children are still our reponsibility.
No, of course they're helpless, they're unprotected
Exactly, it's innocence in the flesh
Sure
So, for a beast, a sick person
Sure
To come and then the church backs them up, and on top you want me to give you money? Are you insane?
Yes, and many times they also take advantage of the lack of education.
Exactly, of people's weaknesses
Yes, because we see that.
Hi
Hi, what?
Hi, it's Lourdes
Hi Lourdes, I'm Arturo, nice to meet you
How are you?  Nice to meet you.
Where are you calling from?
From New York.
You're very close
Yes, and you?
I'm in Philadelphia
Oh, near, yes
Yes, do you have a son?
Yes, and i was trying to
Well, Hello?, no
Hello?
Speak
Look, it was
Lourdes
That, I'm carrying the boy and I pressed the wrong button and I
Yeah
I put you on  hold. I am sorry.
It does not matter.
Look, I think that if we all were of the same religion
None
We always would have an excuse to fight one against the others
I totally agree.
So I won't say that religion is necessarily
Absolutely.
The reason of
It is the excuse, if something is very evident and you have a
Very drastic meetings, the extremist Muslims right now, in western regions,
None
It is very noticeable the difference a Muslim is very easy to be recognized as it could be hate in a situation like the actual on.
Of course
If we were all of the same religion there would still continue to be differences because religion is also what makes
It is the community that practices it, if you understand me,
Of course.
The feature is who is following it, the religion, at the end we are all based in the same principle
Of course.
All, that there is an omnipresent being who made all
Sure.
Even then all the difference there is essentially
Sure. And the other is that even, for example, the Christian right-wing group that
None
That put a bomb in a clinic, for example where they provide abortions
None
They are as dangerous as the
The extremists.
Muslim extremists, what happens is the
Sure
That since we are more used to them, we don't realize who they are and and they don't wear different clothes and don't
Yes, they are not so notorious.
Yes, they have, exactly, and they ask as far as the topic of sexuality
None
Homosexuality is one of the things that concerned me a lot. They base the hate
Towards the homosexual people, for example in
The motive is religious, right?
Things that the bible say is something that scares a lot.
Yes, the other day I was in the subway here in Philadelphia
None
There was a pretty crazy man there that came from the Evangelists.
None
From the evangelist church
None
He was a, i mean he was black, i mean, without racial connotation, right?, just
Sure
A black person, but he was albino, he was a black albino
Right
This man was screaming like crazy inside the metro about the bible and religion
None
He said
None
Watch consumerism, how it has distorted all our images about love, and he said love is what will save your life, love each other
And suddenly he turns around and says homosexuality is wrong, watch it however you want, justify it however you want, but it's wrong
None
And then I felt like turning around and saying, wait, I don't understand you
Didn't you just say love each other?
Are you preaching that everyone should love each other while saying that they can't love each other because it's wrong?
Sure
If they found love in another being from the same gender, so what?
Sure. Exactly.
If I think that, if I justify homosexuality, then I am defending it
None
But then it also bothers me too to see that there's also so much debauchery, you know?
Sure.
And this bothers me, because
There's a heterosexual debauchery too.
Exactly, it's similar but it's
You know
In the same way the heterosexual debauchery isn't accepted
None
If I have a girlfriend, I'm not going to go out in the street and be really graphic, you know? In my physical relation
Sure.
In the same way I hope that homosexuals behave a bit more socially, I don't know, like, like they understand, no? that
Sure.
They're happy because they finally have the possibility to communicate it more openly, but, rightly, that they're not so
That they respect.
Yes, they respect a bit, but I think that this will be something that with time it could be more smooth.
Sure.
Everyone's starting to understand. For example, a place with cities where there's more homosexuality, they're more discrete and calm.
Sure, because they don't have to be
Yes.
Fighting to find a place in society.
Exactly.
When you don't have to fight, you live your life, almost normal like
Calm.
Like everyone else?
Yes, that is what I've noticed. But, what more can you say?
I think that yes, we will understand that religions are all different paths to get to the same, the baby's putting his hand in his mouth, wait, sorry.
Take our your hand. That there are, that they're are paths to get to, to the human beings to
The same end.
To the same end, no?
Yes.
Whatever they call it, no?
Yes.
God, Allah or a supreme power.
Or simply death
Yes, exactly, or
Because there are people who really don't believe in anything. They only believe in death and so it's
They don't even believe in electric lights
Yes, who knows?
Like my mom would say.
Yes?
Yes, my mom says, those people don't even believe the electric light because since the, the electricity is not something that you can see, right?
How amusing. Sure. no, It just appears by a
Exactly, and there already
None
None
But she would tell me if
If you think about it, is more the things in common that the religions have
Is more the things they have in common than the differences.
Yes
Because they all have a code of values. They all have a series of deities or saints or people who they admire.
None
They all have a series of life rules
They all have the illusion of life after death or, or the
Exactly, or
Or the eternal life.
Or a code of ethics, you understand me
A civil code about how to behave.
There will be differences, in the codes and what the specific regulations say but in general, the religions are more similar than different.
It's something that it's not always, I mean, it's not always mentioned.
Yes.
They highlight the differences.
None
Instead of the things that religions have in common.
Yes.
So, it seems to me that up to a certain point, it's something that people that run some religious groups feel that they need to keep the power.
None
It's a way for them to control that power and a way to control
The religion.
How different we are.
Sure.
We are similar.
Yes, they cirticized the government under Bush, who controled through fear of terrorism.
Sure
You an see it throughout history, in lots of different times. It's been the same.
Sure.
The only way in which Hitler was able to get so many followers, for him to do whatever he wanted was to put the fear in the, of him
The Jews are corrupting our people, they were afraid of a foreign enemy, the Jews.
Exactly, exactly.
It's the only way in which he was able to convince everyone to do something so brutal
Sure.
No, nobody would have listened, what are you talking about?
Sure, that's crazy.
Why am I going to kill them or expel them from my country?
Sure
Any other, but not with terror, with that factor, no? Of making them look like enemies and then everyone backed him
Exactly, look that's one of the things that in my opinion, I rather talk about spirituality and not about religion.
Lets call it intuition, no?
To talk about, exactly, if we talk about spirituality, I mean, I'm I'm Catholic
Yes.
But I don't have a problem on attending an Episcopal, Presbyterian or a Charismatic Evengelic service
None
A temple to Buddha
Yes, no?
It seem to me that we have lots of things in common, and I believe spirituality is something that unites all of us
Yes, exactly, you find harmony.
No, I'm not afraid of it, I have no problem with sharing with people of different religions.
Sure. Yes, no? I agree with you.
And i think that by creating institutions and creating, those people, they're human, they're not
Yes
God came.
No, sure, No
And left them flat, but God left some ideas in the world
Yes
Every group decided to go.
They started interpreting them as he, as they understood them and they started to make the rules they wanted
Oh, exactly.
Yes and that's used now in Catholicism, as the word of god and all that
After the fall of Pope Pius
Constantine, the gate and
None
Everything, the whole Moors invasion all that  they started finding that there was too much paganism, let's
Sure
Say, the romans, right?, and so they said we have to, we have to defend it somehow, so they fixed many of the practices and many of the
The Gospels, they started fixing them to say what they wanted.
Sure, and also the omission of books.
And you have to understand, give things
And add, exactly
And that's what happens, so that's why, just like you, I prefer not to get too involved with the institution, and, let's say, being
Absolutely Catholic Apostolic and Roman, right?
Sure
It doesn't, it doesn't interest me
And the rites, too, because the rites are a way of giving continuity to the institutions.
Yes
And it was not God who one day said, these will the rites this is the agenda you will follow every time you honor me
Sure
No
Yes, and I am starting to get annoyed about a thing, for instance I come from Mexico, Mexico City, there I lived
My husband has a Mexican father.
Oh, is he? So
Yes
There in Mexico I faced that the society is very Catholic
Yes
Hi, I'm Alfredo and I'm calling from New York.
How are you Alfredo? You're talking to George from New York too, what's up?
Hi, very good
What do you think of today's subject of religion?
Yeah, well, I'm with the opinion that religion causes more division than union, it's more divided, and that's it
Most of the people die in wars
None
Caused by religion and by differences, small ones
Yes
They have beliefs, and I'm not a believer
None
In a being that wants us to pray to him
Yes
I think there may be, yeah. If there was a God I don't think he's interested in whether I, Alfredo, go and recognize him
None
I thin it's like a pretty humane feeling and it would be a weakness
None
A being so vain that wants people to revere to him, right? I'm not a believer and I feel that religion is
Yes
Harms a lot and that's not my position
Yes, all worlds religions have the same God but some call him a different name, it's basically the same religion.
But they call things differently, right?
Yeah, but for example there are also
And
They exclude people
None
The Jewish religion, that's more a race than a religion, i mean, you're a jewish
Yes.
If your mother is jewish, if not, you're not
Yes
Other religions, for example Christianty. Are you Christian?
None
Christianity, if you don't believe in God you're going to be judged by God himself, correct?
Yes
I find it hard to believe that a God will think Alfredo, who doesn't believe in me, but has been very kind
His generous life, he never lies, he's honest, he's gonna be damned when other
None
That kills someone but shortly thereafter changes his life and asks God for forgiveness
Yes
It's going to be forgiven
None
To accept Jesus Christ, that's what the religion says, that if you accept Jesus Christ as your savior you're forgiven
Yes
It is difficult for me to believe in this. I think it is better.
Yes
Since I believe that religion was created by man to also, to yes, to control
Dominate
Also to, how it's much more comfortable to think that there's this story, to think that we don't know, for example, where we come from.
Yes
Now what happens is that I would love to be able to believe and I would love to have this
Yes
This curiosity satisfied, no?
None
Satisfy this curiosity but if you tell me that God created us I have problem so, and who created God? So I can't resolve the problem it keeps being
Unexplained this part, so there you are
Yes I'm not
The large part of wars are for religious reasons, do you agree with this, yes?
Here they thank God every time they win a war and are at war
Yes yes
That's no more than killing people, invading other countries and not seeing how the criminals until they confess and give themselves to God ask ask that they pay for their crimes
It's something curious
Yes, but it's unbelievable
The greatest criminal is very devoted and pray to God, so they'll do fine, right?
Yes, it's funny
Yes.
Well, and for example, what do you think about the christian coalition with the right, the political right of the United States'
Right, that's something that
What do you think about that marriage
That's something I came to find not long ago reading and analyzing things completely.
It's called The Christian Coalition in English.
Yeah, right
Right
Yes, where it's said that every
They support each other and it has a lot to do on the abortion subject.
Yes
Since they're anti-abortion
None
They got together with the republicans, but the republicans have both values
Yes
They don't have values. For example, social programs.
None
Cut social programs education, health, things that are very against the Christian values
Basically Bush yes
The real Christian values
And practically Bush was re-elected by the most religious states
Yes, precisely by this coalition there is between the right
It was basically because of that
That Bush is from the right
None
And the Christianity
None
God knows and I think that for me that is very strange because the Christian values are not
None
For example, they are in
Yes
They support the death penalty that's not a Christian value, only God should make that decision, a man should not kill
Yes
The truth is that for me, religion is false
Yes definitely
And I respect that the people believe whatever they want but when I see that they control them and see that wars are formed and see that there's
Manipulation
That say in the middle of an AIDS global epidemic
Yes
The pope is saying not to use condoms - that really bothers me.
Yes.
That's why I'm almost anti religious
I'm atheist
I'm atheist also
Yes that is my clash with God that goes
Yes
Yes I really don't believe in any religion. I think that the religions are part of the manipulation of the state right is the way of managing the masses
Yes
Attending mass of brainwashing
Yes
And do any crime in the name of religion? Isn't it true?
Yes, listen then, you think that the homosexuals will go to hell
Yes I don't think so I don't think so and that is a double, is a double now is a double standard no because I think that
Yes
Many of the senior executives and politicians of many countries nowadays are homosexuals.
Yes
So they have to be able to keep there to be able to keep votes be covered right?
None
Yes have you noticed that? that there's a lot a lot of high officials are homosexuals
None
But well openly they don't recognize it right? because well it goes against the religious principles that they supposedly defend right?
Yes
Now I think the solutiion is not a single religion, right?  What do you think?
Yes sure and that's one of the points that they also told us to make but but let's answer the question one single religion
In the whole world, do you think there would be less conflict?
No I don't think so no I don't believe that is like if there was a single government at a world level
Right?
It would be the same situation
Yes okay
Yes I was reading last time. I was reading a book that talks about the different religion of how well, especially when one knows people of other religions
Well to not disrespect them even if you don't agree with what they practice or what they preach right?
Yes
That book analyzed that all the religions have the same foundations however they kill each other.
The differences are small
They are really very small, is more the fanaticism what leads to create great differences that really what the religion of each one is based on
You think that automatically look for example the conservatives have been associated
None
With conservative religious
Yes
Religious and the politicians
Sure
In the same way
But
Do you think the same thing will happen on the liberal side?, for example, you are a liberal person
None
Would you consider yourself a liberal
Yes
Yes or No?
Who or what would they unite with?
I mean, I want to see if the rest of the stereotype is valid with you, being active, being liberal about other stuff, for example
Yes
That you're open to homosexuality, you think you can abort a, do you thing that aborting a baby, a fetus, is murder?
It depends, the way it's done and the time
Yes
The next day pill is now up for discussion, right?, where many analyze, they say it's an abortion, many say that it's not an abortion
Scientifically, it seems it's not an abortion, because the ovule hasn't been fertilized, right?
Yes
They try to explain scientifically and give them a satisfactory explanation.
For the ones that believe that is an abortion is a crime right?
Sure me I'm obviously
But I respect the position of every person, really. Homosexuals, not homosexuals. I really respect the position of every person
What happens is that there's a type of homosexuals for example the type that is very effeminate that is very that is more woman than a woman
I say that's not a homosexual that's a degenerate.
Yes
But I think that homosexuals yes because really there are people that are born and since he was born has felt of the different sex right?
Yes
Is a very respectful person. It's a person that is not openly showing that he's a homosexual. And another that is dressing in an exaggerated way.
Are you talking about when they march in general?
The case of the homosexuals?
When they march on the street?
No, not when they march. No, in general looks for an example.  We are talking about beauty.  At least I'm Colombian.  I
They are very effeminate, I mean they are beyond effeminate are more
Yes
Are more effeminate than a woman
Good evening, Patricia speaking. With whom am I speaking?
You are speaking with James Patricia, New York
James, good evening, I'm in Wilmington, Delaware. What country are you from?
I'm from Panama. And you?
Me too.
Don't tell me.
Yes
Don't tell me
Tell me, do you think that religion is used to divide or to unite?
It depends Patricia, it depends because, I think, for example yes, if you're Jewish and I'm Christian and we get married, we will have to unify, there will always be the separation
If we get married and I'm Jewish and you're Catholic ...
Yes
I imagine that as adult and intelligent people
None
This topic must be resolved before getting married.
At the beginning for example, I went out with Jewish people and the topic never came up, until aftet the relationship had already advanced
None
I'm seen cases, for example with people who haven't ever brought this up, and when the kids come a separation forms
None.
Yes, I go, or he brought him to the mosque, or he brought them to the temple, or he brought him to the church, you know, and I've always seen this in interracial marriages
More than anything, the religion will unite us, when we are of the same belief. But when we are not of the same belief, it separates us a little
I think that the organized religion is good to unite, right, but then within each organization, within each organized denomination then there are these fanatics that exist
None
Who are the ones who cause the social discrepancies
None
Whether it is destructive like we see with the extremist Muslims.
Yes
We see with the born again Christians, according to them, that they want, they want to stick their religion down your throat, whether you like it or not
None
I'm also, I think that the religious leadership of all the denominations are the ones that are wrong because they have their own agenda which is based, first of all, mainly on the money
None
According to them God doesn't like anything you do
Yeah
If you don't come to my church and give me money God will not forgive you.
Yes
That's totally wrong
Yes
Me just like you was raised Catholic already as an adult I stopped going to church in the eighties when I saw the attitude that the Vatican assumed with these priests that were molesting the children
None
For me that type of conduct is totally unacceptable, because despite the fact that I never had kids intentionally I don't want the say that kids, my neighbor's kid, are not my responsibility also
Exactly
The security, the child is not also my responsibility
None
Then when I saw that attitude I said, until here I came with these people. I am spiritual, I am not religious, I do not go to any church
I talk to God in the privacy of my home
None
I tell him my problems, anxieties, my wishes, I want this and if it is the best for me, if it is what you want, you are going to give it to me, I do not have a doubt of that
None
I think this is more of a brainwash they give you at church.  Then you go and convert more people, so they bring in more money.
None
What is you opinion about the VaticanÂ´s attitude, with relation to homosexuality?
I really disagree with that yes
That is a dumb thing
If they want to follow the Catholic bible, it has some verses that forbid homosexual activity.
Where are we going? because there are verses there
The last thing that they said
Tell me.
Everyone who wants to be a priest is going to go through a psychological test to see if he has had homosexual activity.
To me that is the most absurd thing I have heard in my whole life. I don't know what they are going to do with the ones they have inside
Yes exactly, because they are not going to show anything in the test, the test is not going to show anything
Of course not
It is going to give the catholic church a represention of
The're are not only going to have frustrated homosexuals in the closet
Right
They're also gonna have a little bit of hypocritical liers
Exactly, and
So, what's the purpose here?
Honestly, I think religion is something that separates men.
You think?
If i had a different opinion than yours it could separate us regarding something
Not necessarily, I think that's the individuals mentality and,
I think that the belief
The degree is not necessary, although it does help a little bit. I am a person that has read a lot about
Yes
I have tried to take advantage of every opportunity that god has sent to me
Right
Right? I don't consider myself a dork despite that
Yes
If you and me, if i see that our religious beliefs, and i don't bring the subject, if i want your friendship
None
I know it's a subject I must not bring up, like politics
Yes, exactly, but there will always be, there will always be, there will always be a matter that lightens this up
Right?
Lets, you don't eat pork because of your religion
Right
And I sit at the table and suddenly we go to a restaurant, and I order that so you'll get offended, do you understadn?
The belief.
No, I don't think it's like that, James
Yes, the.
For example if you invite me to your house and you know I don't eat that, then because you're the host and you want to invite me to your house you would make an effort not to serve me pork
The belief of, for example i have Jewish friends, I have Muslim friends and i respect them in a way, i have gone to
Me too
To places with these people and, I eat what they eat, even though I don't like it
Exactly, but thank God I come from a poor house. I eat whatever they put in front of me
The belief of not only one god but a trinity god makes us closer
Religion, by submitting us to a certain
But that's organized religion, you see. They have their own agenda.
Yes, that's it
And it's mostly to get our money
An organization that practically wants to submit us to a pace they can't even
Subjugate, the word is subjugate
Yeah, not even they can
They can't live up to the standards they imposed themselves
Exactly
That they impose to the population themselves
So the belief unites us, but religion separates us
It separates us, exactly, i completely agree
That's what i think
Do you think that if there was [only] one religion, would that be the best?
If there was [only] one, no, i don't think
Me neither
But if the individual, like you say, you don't have your religion, but you're spiritual, I think I'm on the same plane. I believe I'm spiritual. I believe in God the father, the son, and the holy spirit.
I believe that Christ died on the cross for mankind
Exactly
I believe that, i believe that you can speak to him or the father without having
I don't need no translator, I don't need no intermediaries
That is it, exactly
Again, specially not one that charges me
And I read my bible, and if I have to go to the church, I go to the church. If I have to go to another church, I go to another church
The belief in me is towards, it's god
Exactly
I don't have anything against other religions, however, if they start attacking the other religions, then I do get away from that
I leave
You understand, so I say, one has its beliefs, but religion separates people.
This is the first time that I've ever heard this, and I completely agree with you.
Panamanian, you are a Panamanian. I believe I had to discuss that same subject with someone else when I first started with this. Oh, yes. He was a guy from Canada and he didn't agree with that
I believe we had to discuss this subject when I started to talk about homosexuals in Church.
None
He was the one that touched on that homosexuality subject
He went ballistic.
Yes he told me. I told him, you are Catholic, let me tell you something. Bring your Catholic bible over here and tell me. Find one verse that is clearly against homosexuality, and he told me the homosexuals
People that sleep with other men are not going to heaven
He told me that lesbians
No, no, lesbians
That's, I've never read anything like that in the bible, that book was written by other men
Yes, the bible was written by men, but it was inspired by the Holy Spirit and I'm going to tell you why I think this way
I'm sure that there were lesbians from back then
Think about those times
Why didn't they talk about it in that sense
I believe, I believe that there must have been but it doesn't mentions lesbian but it does say that people that have
Homosexuality and that's it
Yes, that has changed the natural use of women, that has changed the natural use of their organs
I see that it's not for gener, but for for
Yeah globalization, generalizing
That you have that inclination
Yes
They don't speak of men or women, but about the inclination
Exactly, so, not only, I don't know if you ever read Somos, Somorra, Dmoda and Gomorra
Sodom and Gomorra
Hello
My name
My name is Gloria, from here, California
Nice to meet you Gloria, I live in Toronto
Right
Yeah, and, religion, what do you think about religion?
To me, my personal opinion, i have gone to a lot of churches and sometimes there's a lot of racism, a lot of discrimination, right?
Racism, in churches, i never knew
Right, i, yeah, i have attended one here where i live, and they're always looking if you're dressed, how are you dressed, if you have a car or not
Sometimes it's only good to alienate you from the knowledge of
Right, that's when religion is fake, right
Believing in you, right
What church do you go to?
I have gone to like, what's commonly named christians, evangelical a lot, right?
Right
Not all of them are the same
No, no
I have gone to others too, where the love shows, just going into the door, the person welcoming you is very different, right?
It's true, like you said, I go to a church that's called Jesus of Nazareth. It's international
None
Sometimes people rather humble and too preppy
Yes that is truth
Some people don't know of humility, some people are friendly, their hearts are noble and good.
Yes
I've also had people who have differences
There are religions where you cannot say your opinion as the Catholic and evangelical.
I have not visited any other church, only the Catholic and Christian
Okay
I cannot say that all are equal because if I had the support of some of them,
Okay
When we feel bad, we always look for someone with more knowledge
Okay, yes it feels good to go to church
None
The churches have their own opinions about themselves and always confuse people.
Confuse it with that
I think one has to personally read the Bible
Yes
Some people say that it is difficult, but
The scriptures say that they will find eternal life.
Yes it is truth
More than anything the bible is our guide.
It's true because
Religions that oneself, the same man, has put a division in the religions, but God is only one, no.
It doesn't seem that, sometimes there are religions like the witnesses, the Christians, sometimes they give one to the other, they say that they believe better than the other group.
None
It doesn't seem this way to me because when God comes he won't come to religion but to people, right.
Hmm,
To the hearts of the people because I think that people in all the groups that there are who have a love and obedience and a fear of Jes- of God, right
None
So it's that on the final day and I don't think that it will be a religion but it will be in the hearts of the people.
I need to study and read the Bible more because sometimes you go to a church and they preach and you get scared. I've been one to listen
So it's good to read.
Aha, aha
I've heard many predictions that say that wolves were come dressed in sheep's clothing.
It's true, and they will say that this is who I am and not to trust them, and
Right
This why we as Christians, have the responsibility to read the bible.
We have to prepare ourselves.
Yeah, we have to prepare ourselves by reading the bible so they don't come and trick us, to know which he is
Yes
You know what's true, what's attached to the word of God.
None
Yeah And do you think that they use religion to marginalize?
No, not religion itself, but those who go sometimes to the church
The people. To marginalize groups like
I've seen many case, I'm not, a millionaire person but I'm not on the street either, thank God he has always protected me.
None
But they always say, how much do you have?  These people.  And since there's always, in a church in a religion, like a house of prayer, there are always people, always weeds there as they say
Yeah yes
True they're not doing things like they are in reality, I say better to stay at home and no one will look down on me.
In my mind I ask God to protect me, to go with me
Yeah
Everyone says that you have to clean your own house.
But I really don't pay attention to these people who talk badly
None
They can't be a stumbling block for you. Don't let them, you keep
Yes
Searching, keep looking for the truth.
None
Ignore them, say hi to them to be nice, ignore them, better to pray for them that they don't keep giving a bad example to the non believers, the non believers can think, this is what Christians are like, like you, why should I go to the religion, better to stay at home
Maybe it is wrong not to face the situation and ask God.
Of course, because even if you ask for the person or try to teach them, rigth?
None
But, do you think that the Bible condemns homosexuality in religion?  It is true, the Bible condemns homosexuality.
That's why God made both men and women
Yes, that's right.
When Adam and Eve where in Paradise, it was a man and a woman, it was not two men or two women
Come on
Here they have already approved, here in California that homosexuals can already marry,
Here in Toronto it was the first city, after Europe, Toronto has been the first city to approve
I think we are already living in the last times, the last days.
Yes, it is terrible
When even the sons rape their mothers, hit their fathers and so on, we are already living the end of times
The situation has truly become
Yes, there is discrimination, isn't there?
Yes
About homosexuality, yes a big discrimination, we are nobody to judge but it is not normal to the eyes of God
Yes, almost all religions condemn it, right? I think that Muslims, I had had the chance to talk with them, condemn it, there is no religion in the world that approves
None
I have seen that in the Catholic church there are
And there are priests who are homosexual.
Priests, homosexuals, yes imagine, how they pervert the
Yes. For example
The word of God, is terrible right. yes, so, the world is collapsing, the religion
We are seeing things, never seen before.
Religion is a medium of discrimination, the false religion will make mistakes
For all the human beings.
None
Is ruled by the human beings, and the human beings are so imperfect that
Yes there's nobody who's perfect.
Yes there is a religion in which the discrimination is very open and that then is wrong. because remember that Jesus came for the sick ones.
None
That religion is false one has to study, scrutinize, and withdraw move aside and search, but now since there are so many is quite confusing, here in Toronto there are a bunch of churches one doesn't know where to go already
There's a lot that has more humility than those who do not. They should leave it to someone who really needs to search for God
Yes, is true
I can't give my opinion about the rest of the religions as I haven't attended any except the Mormans once.
None
Then I did see that they celebrate Halloween night. They find a celebration for everything, satanic things are not normal for me being
The Catholics also celebrate Halloween
But what good is it being in church?  Perhaps they mistreat the woman.  They go to inappropriate places.
Yeah
We are fooling ourselves
Yeah. Remember that when they forced the Catholic religion on us, it was one of the first religions that arrived
None
The pastors, the priests, the parishes were those who could read the Bible.  The people couldn't read.  That's how the Catholics got used to going to mass. Sunday, we feel remorseful, so we go again.
Yeah. The only day they go is Sunday.
And then Protestantism was born
The only day they go to church on Sunday
Catholics have continued with their lives and have not entered into a full religious life and they haven't come to understand that saints don't exist.
They shouldn't
They have to worship images and it's like surrender and pledging to the enemy.
To pray to the sure, and that, and that Halloween is Satanic. yeah, yeah that's true, there's even those that
None
Hello
Good evening, this is Patricia, who am i talking to?
Patricia
Viviana, what country are you from and where do you live?
I'm from Mexico and I'm in Baltimore.
I'm from Panama and I'm living near you in Wilmington, Delaware
Near, I just moved from Philadelphia
Oh yeah?
So I was even closer
Tell me Viviana, what do you think about religion, do you think it's good to unite or for creating discrepancies?
To cause discrepancies
You think
Yes
Look, i just talked to someone who made a lot of sense up to a certain point. That the belief in god is good for uniting, but that organized religion is the one who causes discrepancies
Yes, that's what I think.  I was raised Catholic.
Me too
Yeah, we're Latin
None
Long ago i decided to move away from, to move away from organized religion
Me too, sinche the eighties, i consider myself a person, I'm spiritual, i'm not religious
Right, me too, I believe in Goc and everythin, but
Exactly
I don't have to go tell him my secrets.
Exactly, I don't need a translator, I don't need an intermediary.
Right
I do my things at home, quietly, respecting others
Yes
I talk to dad-god and i tell him of my anxieties, my problems, what i want him to give me, and i leave it in his hands
I have a young son and I pray for him but I don't want to take him to church.
Exactly
Yeah, right?
No, he as an adult can form his own
Yes
What do you think about homosexuality and the Christian church?
Look, about homosexuality, i think that, i mean, if we're all equal before god's eyes, what does it matter?
Of course we are, of course
I don't understand what's the problem
Me neither
How does it affect people
If there are two adults that love each other
None
They respect each other, right? whatever they do in the privacy of their room, if they both agree, whose business is that? My goodness
None
That organized religion is just money
Yes
It's just about money
For instance, in Catholic religion you must pay ten percent of all your earnings.
I was hair dressing a black girl here in Wilmington
None
We were talking about religion, spirituality, she was like you and me
None
She was telling me that her sister goes to a church with no name in Pennsylvania, one Sunday the father told the people that
They all had to give one thousand dollars because he and his wife wanted to go on vacations
Ha, and what did the sister say? Or the cousin or whatever
She was dumbfounded
What happened?
What a rogue
And did the people give him the money or just quit?
I don't know.  It seems like the collection event had not taken place yet.
None
Could you imagine the audacity Viviana
It's a horrible audacity for each person, where they want to go. And for how long besides but to me it's ridiculous, no, I don't
In Philadephia you have the spanish channels like Telemundo and Univision
Yes
On Sundays, there's a Brazilian talking about church services on Broad Street.
Yes
Every Sunday, they give the rosary of the thousand shrines.  It's the golden palm.
Yes
Or the water of Jerusalem, that's all free.
None
You and I know that once you walk through that door they will take your money.
None
So last night I was talking with a Colombian boy who lives in Florida.  I was talking about this, and he was telling me that he knew
Of an individual who they threw, who was fleeing Brazil because the law was running after him because he was in these activities.
None
What he was doing was money laundering, imagine. I come and I say, well, I think that this kid in Philadelphia.
Is the, is the one I'm thinking of, it could be the same
It could be the same.
What a small world
Look, because I'm open like this, don't
None
I tell them that no one is going to screw me in the name of god
No
To me, that's a more serious sin that if you killed fifty people
No, if they ask me for money I laugh very hard and don't give them anything
I get out of there, running.
Me too, besides
I don't give them time to laugh, I run out of there.
Yes, and besides it's an offense
What do you think about? Please,
And the sad thing is that Hispanic or Latin American people aren't very educated
None
They give them money
None
And that pisses me off a lot, because they're
It makes me hysterical
Because they are taking advantage.
They're taking advantage of people's weaknesses
Most of the people that give that money you can't reason with because they believe in their heart
That they're doing the right thing
And I respect them
None
But don't come asking me for money.
Listen and the Jehovah witnesses that come knocking on your house
I don't even want to know.
None
I don't want, I imagine, here they don't come, thank God, in this neighborhood but I am in Florida
None
When we lived in Florida they call every weekends, after one kills oneself
Then they don't want to leave
From Monday to Friday, that you want to sleep a little on the weekends to come knocking on the door Saturdays at seven.
None
I put a sign outside my door on Friday night that said i'm catholic look what a hypocrite in the morining
So they wouldn't come to bother me
They didn't bother you
My husband is Danish, and he was telling me that once they came to do this when he was in his country.
None
I know that he got to a point that he got so mad that one day they knocked on his door and he took off all his clothes and opened the door naked.
None
That they left running and never again knocked on the door.
It's hell there, the devil is there, i don't know, so funny, so then i tell them i'm not interested, and i close the door, my
Oh no, my husband
Where's he from?
He's American
Right
He's very cynica. He stands over there and they say whatever to him.
God, he gives, he gives back
Yes, and there's, I have seen people that I don't know, they really stay silent and don't know what to say to him.
And I laugh, and at the same time I say I wish I was like that, being able to get my own answers
The schools
My very clever answers and very logical with what they tell me
I don't have time for people like that honey, and, for example, do you think religion serves to unite or to separate?
No, i think it separates
Me too, i think, i think it's
It separates people too much
The organized religion, which has its agenda
None
And the agenda is We have to fill the chests no matter what
Yes
Oh, these idiots will sustain us no matter what, one way or the other
Patricia, remember the last inquisition.
Remember the crusades my love
Like all the people who killed
All the people died in the name of religion simply because of the ledership
Yes for
For human greed, because at the end of the day we're all human.
Yes, I don't understand because if they want to pray to their God do it in their house
Sure, and don't try to impose
I don't understand people who want you to talk with god.
For example
None
I won't subject myself to anyone because I simply won't give them this authorization.
None
What do you think about the different religions,
About Muslims.
Not only Muslims, for example the Jehovah's witnesses, the, I attribute this to fanatics in each individual denomination.
They're the
You'll find crazy people everywhere
Exactly, and there are people who are really fragile or really weak, they can be controlled really easily
They can subjugate
So there's always people that
Those are the ones that get brainwashed
And they don't let them
Because  that to me, it's a vulgar brainwash
If i told you, my mom, my mom just went through cancer
None
She was dying on us in the hospital, and i said, the doctor said if you don't give her a blood transfusion, she'll die
Right
My mom's witness is a Jehovah's witness.
None
And well, he did everything he could to stop my mom from getting the blood transfusion
I can't believe you
The doctor clearly said if we don't give her the blood transfusion, she'll die.
She dies
He said, no, everything is in god's hands
And since the husband has the legal power
Right, very smart, very Mexican of us
That
We all went and, all of the five children flew to, to where my mom was
That
Immediately we threw him out
Done
No, if you would've been seen,  I can't believe all the drama that happened just because
He felt like it
Since he's a Jehovah witness, let your mom die because it is in God's hands.
No, I can't accept that
My God, no I just hear Jehovah witness and get
God forgive me but perhaps I would've killed him to get him out
No, you should've seen poor him I even felt bad the last time, I talked to security, they took him out of the hospital, well
You have to do what you have to do, with people like that you have to go to extremes.
None
You do what you have to do, and your mom
Good evening, it's Patricia. With whom am I speaking?
Silvia good evening. Hi Patrcia, Silvia
Silvia, what country are you from?
I live in the United States, in Indiana.
What country are you from?
I'm from the United States
Your family. What are your family roots in Latin America?
I'm Mexican, but my grandparents are from, from Michoacan
Are you a Mexican?
Yes
I was born in Panama and I live in Wilmington, Delaware
That's nice
You are you called Rosa?
No, Silvia.
Silvia, forgive me
No, that's not Okay.
Silvia. What do you think about, do you think about religion, does it unite or divide?
For me, I say that it simply divides there are differences and opinions. Even though there are a lot of religions that have made the effort to unite us
And to have general opinions anyway, continuing onward, to me racism or the divide between the opinions especially when it comes to be your turn, to speak about
For example if someone believes that Jesus Christ was actually a person too, that he walked on the Earth, that God made him. There are quite a few religions. If that was all for religions then we would all be in agreement right,
I think that the basic foundation of religion, is to believe in God.
None
It unites us, but that the religion organized by the leadership, of the organized religion that of course have their own agenda that's the one that divides us.
Exactly, you've said it
That each church, say that they are the best. And that God that all you do is bad.
None
Especially the Catholics.
Especially.
We all know it's nonsense if you don't come to church and give money God will not forgive you.
Exactly
No,
Yes because, the government gives money and I realized it.
Mamma, what they want is money.
Is true because what I've seen. I work selling insurance.
None
And for us to sell insurance, the old person or the one that has little money then one has to go to church to see if the big groups that meet and have
There is where, they the organized religion seek out the weak ones.
Um exactly, because they are looking for someone,
Someone who has some weakness, whether it's age, disease, lack of education.
None
Those are the ones they go after
I agree
Minorities
Specially when you have a financial need, you go to church and they feed you, they can
I'm not religious, but like you, as a Latin American, i was raised Catholic
Yes
But now as an adult, I left the catholic church in the eighties when these things about the priests molesting children came up.
Right
I saw the attitude that the Vatican assumed, and i said this is as far as i go with you, and that was over twenty years ago
Yes
It's been twenty years since i've set foot in a church
Yes, my mom came from Laredo, Texas, she came in a winter because there was a lot of work, so she created a family on the fifties, but the first place where she landed, i believe it was the catholic church, right?
Holy...
And she heard over the heater, we call it the calentÃ³n [heater], that
Right
The heat was provided by
The
It's a heater that provides the steam, the heating
None
That building was a church
None
Yu could hear the screams.
The heating
There you could hear all the kids moaning, crying, screaming.
I don't believe you.
And my mom would notice and she would complain to the priest and would tell him
Nobody paid attention to her.
None
Were already into the thing
He, was
Imagine
He would say no, don't believe it my child those kids need, they are naughty, they need discipline, don't worry. She went, investigated and saw that they were molesting them
I don't believe you
She left at the time the religion But she attached herself to another one, but really she
There are people that have need of being guided, when I left the organized religion
None
I went through a long time, that I was searching, searching my emptiness. And since five, seven years ago I've been reading a lot of metaphysics, which is logical.
Oh, yes.
Is logical, thIs logical.
It fascinates me, the same
God loves us all, no matter what you do, we all go to heaven, because there's no other place, I'm convinced that hell is here on earth, here is where you pay for everything, that's called Karma.
That is true, here we suffer a lot.
Here is where you pay.
None
You see it daily, my dear, I witness it
Is true because what I've seen.
That the attitude they have assumed with the homosexuals?
I think
What do you think?
I think that is a difference too, in the being itself, that in one's own body, is different.  They can't
The people, that's a physiological difference.
They can't change their situation. They can't control it.
Control
They already have that
There are some people that opt for this life.
Yes
I've known people like that have been abused
None
Emotionally, psychologically, physically by the opposite sex. And in search of love, they have found a person of their same gender,
None
That they have offered this and have changed.
Correct
I think what is done in the privacy of the bedroom. If example is a couple of the same gender where there is love
Where there's respect.
None
They can do what they want in the privacy of their bedroom with the mutual consent of two adults.
None
What does religion have to do with that. They are meddlers.
Correct. Because they are people who don't bother anyone, rather
That they don't hurt anyone.
To me, they are knocking on my hotel, I work in insurance
None
I'll be right over, i'm on the phone i'm on the phone i'll come up okay,
I'm not even dressed, I have on my nightgown. One moment.
You are going to go up with the nightgown girl Knock on the door with the nightgown and say that you are a Jehovah witness
Yes, will leave right
I'm married to a European
That's wonderful
And he was telling me.
Thank you Asia
He was telling me that, you know how
Look Don't look at my hairy legs. I'm so excited look they are bringing me a refrigerator here
How nice.
I haven't had
See mama, see mama that is love
Yes
Individual, you don't need religion.
How many people
In reality have a good relationship with Thank you so much Asia, Bye, we've stayed, For me if you have a good relationship with God one goes in private to ask, ask whatever one wants Right?
Sure, and no, like I was telling someone previously
None
I do it in the privacy of my home.
Exactly.
I don't have to announce it to anyone.
None
I don't need an interpreter or a mediator. I tell God my anxieties, my problems, my desires. And I leave it in his hands, that's I'm convinced that if is,
None
For me, he will give it to me.
How many times have we seen people that comment as far as their time in need that is life or death, asking God to help them?
That they only remember God when they need something.
And it happens to them, what surprises me a lot, is that each time that in television appears a person telling that in a moment of need I asked to
Well, they say it was a death person
I think those are actors, the ones from television.
There are some, many yes, but one person from California, who has been on television, lived by the beach
It rained a lot and a mountain felt over the house, the lady asked
Yes
To God for help, then in the mind of his girlfriend that was living in city about twenty minutes outside
None
He had a thinking, he worried a lot about his girlfriend. Then he came despite what was happening. Even the police forbidden him, to cross the street and he tried to reach there.
The man went.
He saw the lady was calling him, and she went out.
Baby that is illumination.
None
See it. That was not her moment, I think that death is like a lottery, is like a bingo. When your number appears, it does not matter what you are doing. You can be having a bowl of soup
It is your turn. That is.
If, your number appears, then you go.
Yes because donÂ´t have, it is waiting, you donÂ´t know when will be your turn but, I have always think, what a thing, when you
You hurry, old age. but it is what when we need one, because I was raised in a very strict religion.
To,
Catholic?
It makes me laugh when I talk about the Jehovah's Witnesses, believe me! How rigid! None of the holidays could we
Oh no
Be invited, it was a cruel life, specially for a young person
No
Then we were many, we were seven in the family and there were quite a lot of bad moments because they were very cruel with us, but if you
Good evening, this Patricia, Who am I talking to?
Hello this is Yolanda.  Patricia.
Where are you from, and where do you live?
I am from Texas. I live in Texas.
Is it a Mexican Family?
Since many generations we are from here and you?
I was born in Panama and I live in Wilmington, Delaware. In the east coast.
Okay. Wilmington yeah, is it cold over there today?
Horribly
Yes, we
What do you think of religion serves to unite or divide?
Well, it serves for both, but divides people who does not believe the same.
Right now we have the situation of Muslims and Christians.
The Muslims
None
The foundation of all religion is to believe in God.
Okay.Mhm
It is what unites and divides us.
Okay
What divides us is the organized religion.
Correct,yes
What divides us is the individual leadership
Yes.
And the fanatics inside each denomination.
Yes
These are the things that cause problems, those who want to put their religion in you
Yes.
As a place.
Yes.
And so, the leadership of organized religion, I think that each one has its agenda
None
That fundamentally is to fill their pockets, this has become a business.
Yes, I think that religion is like the- the politicians.
Exactly, you're completely right.
Yes. You said
The only difference is that they use the name of God.
Yes, you said what unites us is the belief in God
It unites everyone.  The difference, that is what divides us.
None
The individual leadership
Yes.
Of those who are in organized religion. I, as a Hispanic,
None
I was raised Catholic, and I stopped going to church in the eighties
None
I saw that news, and when I heard that the priests were molestings kids!
Yes.
The attitude the Vatican took and I said, I can here with you
None
Who wanted to pretend that this doesn't exist, and everything that they wanted to sweep under the rug.
Yes
I've come here with you. I'm going to turn around. I spent many years during which I was looking for my place
Yes.
No? And so, and I read metaphysics, for about five or seven years now
None
And it's logical.
None
It's logical, girl. I have found mine where I pray to God directly. I don't need an intermediary or a translator, and much less someone who will charge me to talk to God.
Yes.
I tell God my problems, my anxieties, my wishes, and I leave it in his hands. Because, I'm convinced that if it is good for me, he will give it to me.
None
I don't have the slightest doubt about that.
Yes.
What do you think of the attitude of the Christians with the regarding homosexuality?
Well, as a Christian person, I think that we believe that the bible is the true word of God. What God says,
I believe it was written by man.
Pardon
I think that it was written by the man, I don't read the bible.
Yes, And, but I say that. But, like me, that I'm Christian, that, that is my, belief.
Your foundation, exactly.
I think it was written by a man but inspired by
By God.
The Holy spirit of God.
None
Then they are God's words.
None
We as humans want to tell the creator how we will serve him and believe him. But who made such a big God
Correct-
All the universe, How?
The universe.
Well, or the university. Yes. How are we going to call him, how are we going to adore him, or how are we going to believe him? And that,
He made the rules for the world to have order.
None
The rule he made
None
We should have, we let it open for them to come, as a christian, I, as a christian, I I believe that there is a God and a Satan.
I think that jell is here in the earth, because here we pay everything.
The truth is there is a God and there is a hell whether we believe or not.
We are eternal creations.
Eternal.
Yes, eternal
None
The situation doesn't stop when we die.
Look at the metaphysics, for example, I think about the homosexuality,
None
If they are 2 same gender persons, that love each other
None
That respect each other, that lead their private and personal and public lives with honor,
None
Which is the in what-what is the church role? if they are in he privacy of their bedroom
Is the only thing.
And there's two, there's two adults,
None
Consent what is happening
None
If they conduct their life honorably, with love
None
With the truth,
None
Who is to tell them their wrong?
Again we want to direct how we should live kids wouldn't have.  If one doesn't believe in, true absolutes, one can live however one wants, and for him, it's good.
How are two people going to be the same?
Of the same gender.
Gender, how are they going to procreate. No, is impossible.
But, at the end of the day.
None
The only thing that matters, is love. That's the only reality there is.
None
Really? And I'm not referring to physical love, no.
None
The tangible love, I'm referring to what you feel inside towards yourself and humanity. That's the only , and how you behave
I
Under those rules
None
If that's the only thing that counts, and if you fulfill all those, those requirements
None
What you do in your private life, if you are not hurting anyone
Well,
Who is the church to condemn you
But is not
When they themselves are doing the same or worse
That's what many people say, but is not the church.  No again is the word.
Is the leadership
Of, is God's word. Is the bible that says how we should behave, or how we should live.
The metaphysics teaches us, number one, that God loves us so much. His love is endless. That is why he gave us the power to choose.
None
Right? And that God forgives us everything.
Yes, if one repents.
He doesn't. That's why I tell you, if there are two people of the same gender, that lead their life with honor
None
With respect, they love their neighbors, they do everything right. There are people who are born this way and who have no control, because physiologically theywere born this way
None
And it has been proofed by scientist studies that the homosexuals, who are born homosexual is because they have a failure in the hypothalamus.  It is a
Hypothalamus is a gland.
None
So, there are people who are born, heterosexuals, but that for their experiences with the opposite sex
None
Whether they have been physically, mentally or physically abused there has been someone in their lives who has shown them true love and they turned to the other side.
What do you?
It's basically all about love
You say that love forgives everything, right? then
He loves us so much
But what does He forgive? What you think is wrong or what he thinks is wrong?
If you are sorry because your own conscience, God gave us an internal mechanism
None
To tell us when we are acting wrong
Yes, I think that
So that is called conscience
Yes.  But my conscience.  Some people don't have a conscience and kills and abuse kids.  But, in their conscience, that is not wrong.
Then, they have no mercy. Because, to them
This is a sickness.
But, you see? This person, thinks in their conscience, that it's, it's good to do it.
That it is normal.
Again, who will forgive, what we said is bad, or that God says that it doesn't agree with his law?
I think that in these special circumstances,
How will be special for one person and not the other?
Yeah, this is a degeneration
Special? This why
No, I refer to these people serial criminals who kill fifty people, or who molest kids,
None
Is this a physiological sickness?
Sorry? But, how, it's the, you're saying that, homosexual, is also something psychological, or something, me, that has a how do you say, medical?
None
And,
A medical situation,
So they can have the same reason. It's not my fault I was born this way, I'm this way. God made me this way.
I'm convinced that God forgives them.
Yes. so, this why I say, when you base the, your belief on different things
This is Patricia.  With whom do I have the pleasure of speaking?
Ptricia, it's Manuel.  I'm in Orlando Florida, where are you?
Hi, Manuel, You're Colombain. We spoke last night.
What a coincidence.
I don't think so. I don't know. There's no. I have spoken to some people a couple of times.
For me it's the first time that I repeat with any participant.
Yes?
Yes.
What do you think about music?
For me its fundamental. I, the music
Yes for me too.
I have it. I like authentic sounds very much. I mean I have a small collection of folk music.
None
I also like international music, modern, classical music. in my car I always have
Dancing music.
Tropical of course. In my car there's always music.
Yes, I'm a bit behind in that sense.
Yes.
I'm a bit behind with Latin music.
You don't listen to. but you do listen to other types of music?
Yes.
None
I like Jazz
None
I'm. this raggaeton has me enthralled.
It's a very catchy sound.
Do you listen to reggaeton?
What? If I listen to?
Do you listen to reggaeton?
I have not bought it until now I have not but yes of course I've listened to it once in a while when I play the radio.
None
Here's one that seems very loaded, there's one that I think it's loaded that even
It's very happy music.
But there's another one that's very nice for example the music that this guy Daddy Yankee is coming up with, I think it's good. Those sounds are very catchy and the words don't hurt anyone.
Exactly
It's good.
I listen to everything. I like to dance. I say, as long as it can dance to it.
Sure.
I listened to it.  There is a type of Jazz for example that is very like Danilo Perez and very esoteric
None
I don't like that.  What else?
I like classical music a lot
Classical music when I'm driving
None
For a long time I heard country music
I like rock and classical rock also.
Rock but the old one.
Like the Spanish one I also like.
You Know what I was reading the other day? That it's been scientifically discovered that in small children, for example, the elementary schools doing thir education well.
In elementary schools if they expose them to the music they do better in their grades
Really.
Scholastically.
Look how interesting, there are nice vibrations.
It doesn't seem real, right? I would've never made that connection.
Yes, I have heard of it. I even also saw documentaries that it seems that the plants are also very receptive.
Really.
To those sounds. It seems of the soft sound, right? Also certain animals. Also certain animals. In farms, or poultry farms. When they are chicks.
It seems they put music and it relaxes them, because that little animal is very nervous by nature.
None
I mean that it is therapeutic
For example, when a baby is in the belly
Uh-huh.
They give the mom headphones and she takes them and they put on different kinds of music, I've heard that the baby in gestation also reacts
Entirely to music, of course, and they put on classical music, soft music.
Yes, exactly.
That they react favorably, the power of music seems incredible. For me music is like an international language
Yes, it's true.
Everyone understands music even if they don't have anything else in common.
Socially it's always the music that unites us?
Yes, right.  It's universal.
None
I, personally, I'm very eclectic. I'm open to listening to any kind of music. If there's something that I suddenly don't like, I respect what I don't
Listen to. The only thing that I
No, and at least try to find something in it. To appreciate it
To know is to appreciate
If I learn something, I learn that I like this kind of music
This kind
To open my horizons more
The only thing I don't like is when it's too loud.
When we were young do you remember when our parents told us that we were going to be deaf?
Yes, even if I tell you that we never expected a lot from this.
I did
I'm at, the same volume, a high volume but not exaggerated
For example, when I'm in the car, I sing with the radio. You don't sing with the radio?
Yes. Sure. A few melodies that I now.
And have you realized, for example, when you're at a red light singing you look to the side and someone's watching you
People watch.
To them it seems like we're crazy.
Suddenly, if there's a traffic jam and they're surprised, they say why is he singing if this is unbearable? But they do the same thing no?
What's happening to this crazy guy? I definitely think that music is universal language. We all understand each other through music, in one way or another.
It's a way.
Yes, it's correct
It doesn't only unify but also pacify.
Yes, this is very true.
You see? That there isn't. The other day, three years ago I went to Panama on a visit and I rented a radio, I rented a car
From the house to the airport, when we went to leave it I heard a reggaeton song that I was hearing here. And I thought it was the most
Stupid song in the world, and the only thing it told you was reggaeton. And the only thing that it told you,
It Repeated the same chorus a thousand times
It's, look how stupid, the only thing it was saying was, chacaron, chacaron.
This, a thousand times.
It was stupid that you had to be a total Mormon in order to appreciate this. Now they were playing it. And I without thinking, started dancing in the kitchen
I was to my..
I started dancing to the sound of the 'chacaron'
There is something there, that afterwards in a theme they can put it to that association. Call it manipulation.
There's something that I don't like either, hello?
None
It is that many people see music and associate music to idols of mud. I don't think so. Music is not Britney Spears. Music is not Madonna
Right
That's another thing, and young people associate those
In that association they want to imitate
Of course
The singers and turn them into mud idols, like you said
And manipulate them.
Right, I remember the Al Gore's wife?  She joined a
Yes.
A program against violent music with violent lyrics that she said affected the children
None
In a negative way, gangster rap for instance
None
Street gangster, right? And she said that these violent lyrics affected the young people and pushed them to suicide, and to commit acts of violence
Or, will see those of the enemy and may kill each other
You know what Manuel, I think that all this is related with the home. I don't think that a song, OK I accept that young people are highly sensitive
Right? easily influenced but if you give them a solid base I don't think a song can make a boy kill himself
Or hit
Or go kill someone else, right, or attack him
Yes, but unfortunately this a fact of our time. A lot of young people are growing up without character enough
No. And the family unity we knew, the one we grew up with doesn't exist any more
Yes
The extended family already, in some extreme cases the parents are in jail and it's the grandmother who takes care of them
Yes, the grandmother
Who doesn't have the time
Yes. Or is very busy doing
Or is too old
Or both of them are busy earning money, that's another problem
Right, right. The typical family unit doesn't exist anymore, and i think that's why kids nowadays
Identify more with music and use it as an example for their behaviour
That's right
It's a pity, isn't it? Because
From that subject, from that subject there are important derivations, interesting ones
No, and they scare me
Yes. I think that these topics that they touch on this program, in this study are very interesting. The should expand the time.
Really yes.
To half an hour
Imagine that today and afternoon we were watching my mom and I don't know a program called chattering
Yes.
Which is pure nuisance
None
And then they had a Latin rapper that was singing a song that said lift your skirt up to your back.  Imagine that, right?
That I stayed like speechless.
And the worst is that the young girls delighted with that.
There are kids that go and follow Ah? no, I didn't sing. I had never heard that song but that is
No. I say the girls.
No and the
With that type of message they are happy when they are
The guys too
When there they are underestimating the woman, they put her as an object.
They think this wonder of the world would like to give them three slaps and tell them straighten up right?
No, they think those are compliments.
This is a song and it already ended.
It already ended.
What this a lifestyle, I think that they believe that this an acceptable acceptable lifestyle if somebody were to tell me to hike up my skirt all the way up to my back I swear I would smack them so hard
No, today it's any woman that should do it.
What I wonder is why, when they write these lyrics would it be good, it's just for the market, right?
That's apparently what kids like today?  Can you believe that?
Yes, and
We're getting old, Manuel.
The worst is that from a young age, from childhood, they are listening to that, dancing to it, little kids.
You see it on television
Little kids in dancing competitions and they give them prizes. You see these little kids, three and four years old
Dancing as if they were
Tamara.
Hello
Hello.
Hello I'm Marco, and you?
Tamara, nice to meet you. Where are you from?
Hello Tamara, how are you? I'm in Philadelphia.
Where?
In Philadelphia.
That's good, but from what country?
I grew up in Paraguay
In Paraguay. I'm from Argentina.
Yes
I'm in Boston.
How are you? Neighbor.
What type of music do you like?
I have one of these typical questions that you can say, any kind as long as it's good, but rock in general
More older rock, I don't really like the new music
Yes
I don't like most new music, even what is popular.
Now that you live in the United States, does it seem more difficult to find new music that you like, like, in Paraguay were you more exposed to music that you liked?
No, you know that really there in Paraguay, I didn't like the local music.
None
There were a couple of small groups that, I was friends with the members.
Yes
And the music was brilliant because I think that it must be very different when you know the people who are playing
Sure
But besides that, when I came here, I think that, in general, the music was almost the same
And did you come here a long time ago?
Yes, it's been almost ten years already.
I'm okay.
I've been here
Do you like music better in English or Spanish?
I always liked Spanish.
None
I was born in the United States and went to Paraguay when I was eight years old
Wow
Tell me that I was there until I was 20.
None
I've been here ten years
In Paraguay
In Paraguay.
Sure
But, I always spoke fluent English. When I went to Paraguay I went to the American school inclusive,
None
Then
And what are you doing in Philadelphia?
It wasn't very different. What?
What are you doing in Philadelphia?
The music?
No, what brings you to Philadelphia?
I'm studying network security
None
Basically computer things. It was always my passion
None
And, with, and that one thing of music,  I always listen with, in -mp3
You download music from the Internet?
Yes, I download music from the Internet, I put it in my phone, with my telephone, I hear it from the phone.
None
That's what I use the most to listen. I haven't used any more CDs in a really long time.
Yes, and cassette, it goes without saying
Cassettes. I have a few but I have a kid who's five and I think that one day, I can show him that there was a time when we used this. Magnetic tape and everything.
Yes
When yes, I don't know, if you don't remember but in the twentieth century we used magnetic tape. We made our
None
Our proxy, our own
Recordings.
Music recordings
Yes
Ur system of pirating music but, on a very low level.
Sure
That was really slow. It was making a cassette like being a pirate
Yes
Cool
No, I still save all my cassettes. The majority.
Yes?
Yes, they're more than one hundred and twenty.
Yeah, that's a lot of cassettes.
Yes, you know what happened to me, because I moved from Argentina to another country, and from another country here. So, I took it with me everywhere.
Yes, and you don't only use CDs?
I bought several CDS but I never bought many because in comparison with cassettes, they're always really expensive in Argentina
Yes.
I stopped buying CDs since music started to be recorded on the computer
They would record it for me.
Yes, exactly.
Instead of buying There are very few groups that nowadays I buy their compact they don't even come out good.
I was hearing about groups of
None
As you've seen with this of the with the problem of the pirated music.
Yes
Coming from a point of view of business, obviously is a problem.
Yes
Is something illegal
Yes
But is something that, and they all do it practically.
Yes, sure.
That it doesn't seem, doesn't seem like something bad. And it's hard to try to teach the younger people that's stealing. They, they already, already think
Yes
They already think that is normal and is the way that it has to be done.
Yes
Seeing the It was that before when we did It was more recording from a knowing that it's illegal, then we don't do it very we didn't do it so openly.
Yes,
When we gave a person the disc, but on a mp3, but pretty
Almond under the table.
Yes
Ao, for what could happen. But now, today, many of the, the creatures, I sure, I call them creatures, not are older
They do this and for them it's really normal. It's very rare for them to buy music.
Does your son like rock music?
Yes, yes
Does he like other things more?
His tastes are basically what we give him to listen to.
Sure
None
They put on Led Zeppelin.
Aye, how funny that you said that, So, this is particularly, our favorite group.
Yes, I also
Yes. We went to see Robert Plant live a while ago.
He was in Philadelphia?
Yes, he was here in Philadelphia.
How nice. I went to see him in Buenos Aires, when Robert Plant played with the Mittens once.
Yes this nice, and we, even
In
Still praying that they will come back to plant with Dave
With Jimmy
And to see if there's a, what's it called
The, John, Johns
Jappa John, Jappa John, Double John, this
They were a drummer and were going to play in his father's band.
None
This was about fifteen years ago, because the guy played in Argentina too.
And every now and then, there are rumors that they will have reunion.
Yes
Reunion tour of the group and we're always
None
They're tempting us.
And do you have a lot of recitals there in Philadelphia?
Sorry?
Are there many rock concerts in Philadelphia?
Yes, a lot, we go often too, and to us this really seems
That's good.
That the music groups, with pirated music, We think that the people who play music, even if they're artists, who make
They know how to do those things.
Yes
They should earn they should earn a lot, but not to the point of being ridiculous, like look, Michael Jackson.
Sure
A person that does a good song is brilliant. That makes money for the recordings and all
That for a good song that, he makes forty five million dollars
Yes
It seems a little exaggerated .
Sure
I like concerts
Yes
Is live music.
Sure
Recorded, live
Yes
Because is that I think they should earn their money doing concerts.
Yes
Yes, every time we go to a concert we are paying forty, fifty, eighty dollars
Yes
For a ticket
Sure
Yes, and they have places where thirty, forty thousand people enter.
Sure
Is good, is good money. They can make
I mean the band has a cachet to who they pay at first, when they hire them to work,
That's another thing. I I always preferred, and still prefer the groups where there's a singer, a drummer, guitarist, bass player
Yes
Keyboarder, that basically that there are those groups I mean of people that the group is basically the name of a person
A person that sings doesn't write all they music they do.
Sure
Never plays any instrument
None
No, that seems to me very created
Is a product.
Is a created sensation, a product that would be of the public companies
Sure
I think, look, I prefer that I would like to see that they make more than, because the musicians that are musicians
Are musicians from the soul.
Yes,
They like the music. It wouldn't be terrible for them to go play once in a while, or couple of years, in a small tour.
None
Yes.
Him and his family, that I think they should make a lot of money, because I like it like that
Yes.
I don't think that it shouldn't be one song, and that one song will live, with millions of dollars for
For always
Yes
I think that I really just started recently to buy music.
Yes
The music that I was buying online
Do you buy on the internet more than, more than going to a record store?
Yes, I buy on the Internet, because you can buy one song you can buy as many times a, there are few groups very few that you can count, I think with, that you can count on one hand
Groups that make albums that you can hear from the first to the last.
Yes
The majority of the groups now, especially, have a sensational song, and the rest kins of for someone

Yes, is very true yes and You go to places where, do you like to go to concerts and something like that?
I tell you that before I spent much of my youth also in Ecuador

Sure
I live with an Argentinian friend, so luckily we made a good group of people, of friends
That's quite good
Yes, but more than anything Latins, right?
Sure, like you don't know many gringos
Not too many gringos in any case Europeans but gringos, no, so many
There are Europeans there
Yes a bunch already
Look
Yes a bunch is very, this city is very cosmopolitan, since I then came to study
Sure it must be like Miami. Miami is very cosmopolitan but
There's a bunch
Especially of Latins I mean there's from all parts of Latin American
There are not as many latins as in Miami
None
In Miami you speak, you speak, you can speak the whole time in Spanish
Yes I sometimes had jobs that I wanted to practice English and they only spoke to me in Spanish.
Sure
So
Sure for that
There already, there already more English, English
It was hard for me to handle everything in English the whole time.
Yes, is English hard for you?
Yes is hard, I don't like it too much
I mean I understand everything
How long ago, did you start like that?
None
To speak since when? like in a year in two
After two years yes like at first is hard two years to, to speak and after those two years I was living a year and a half in Florida and after
I came here to Texas and married an American.
None
That was my number one English teacher because she only spoke English.
Sure is that is that the topic seems
Yes, if you're among Latins because sometimes I kind of lose the English a little when I start to talk Spanish.
Sure, that is true. They told me that the issue if you want to learn English is to get an American boyfriend
Yes just get with gringos and try not to get with Hispanics
The truth, I'd rather be with Hispanics and not learn the language
Since it's what you need and sometimes confront, even if it comes out bad, the words, and until the end since you're getting better
Yes it's good, it's true, I'll do this. And what's your name?
In the beginning, Alvaro
Alvaro, that's good
What was your name, sorry?
Iliana
Iliana
Yes
I didn't understand too well what they were saying to me when I started speaking english but now I understand more and more
Sure I realize this, that the, understanding every time more that counts a lot, at the beginning you think that it's nothing and after you're forming words
Yes, they open your ears
This is so incredible, so well.
You, how old are you Iliana?
I'm thirty one
Wow, that's good, I'm thirty seven
How old are you? Thirty-seven.
Yes
You went to thirty two
At thirty two I came here, certainly
And you don't want to go back, would you go back?
Yes I would, if I had enough money to live there, but if I go right now I'll be flat broke there
Right, that's the point, and are you still with your wife?
Sure, not the one here, no, neither the first one I had a son with there in Uruguay
And where is your son, in Uruguay?
Yes. He is in Uruguay. Every month I send him money.
Sure, do you see him? Do you keep in touch with him?
I saw him in July, when I went to Uruguay.
Good
But once in a while, it's like once a year because it is very expensive going there, and this year for the Holidays it's not easy, everything is so expensive
It's not convenient either
Sure
In low season, I can get it for half the price
None
The passage, what do you take, the Chile?
Yes, the last times I've gone on land Chile, yes
It's fine, these Chileans did it well
Yes, it has good prices
Yes, it's true
Good evening I'm Joe.
Hello, good evening my name is Blanca
How're you Blanca?
Fine Thanks
Where are you calling from?
From Phoenix
From Phoenix, I call from Colorado.
Very good
I practically like all types of music, as long as it is not Heavy Metal as they call it
Of the, what is it called, the one that is of, of Punk or something like that.
Like what?
That the one they use those, I forgot the name already let me think while you say something.
I like all types of music but it depends on my mood.
I like a lot, the dance music and the salsa. I'm very tropical to pick my music.
How nice, and what music do you listen to there that is tropical?
In my country, I'm from Colombia, the tropical music is to dance.
Yes.
Then is like dance music, but I don't like dance music.  I don't like the technocumbia nor the Mexican music.  Let's see.  The Mexican I do like
The mariachi one is romantic.
The northern.
The northen is Texmex music, I don't like that.
Me neither, and the one that I was trying to tell you a while back is that rap music, the rap music. I hate that one.
The one that they're coming out with now is new.
Because of that one the reggaeton also
The Reggaeton
I think that the lyric stimulates bad things.  For example the reggaeton demeans women, like sexual objects.
Yes
And, sometimes they use very vulgar language, I don't like it. the music in itself, if it wasn't with that type of lyric. It wouldn't be that bad, but the lyric kills it.
Yes, I think that for example I love the bachata but just as the bachata, many other types of music, for me, the reggaeton seems
Yes
We are staying without resources, I like it for a party and the kids have fun, but I think the great compoasers are staying without resources.
The great singers already don't know where to make it, because they are all making it with the reggaeton.
Exactly.
I find it sad. I love the bachata. Where are you from?
I'm from Puerto Rico.
I think that the Dominicans, not all, the ones that sing bachata in their majority they are non composers of music. Because they take a
The romantic music, the ballenatos, the music, the merengue all of it and make it into a bachata, if you look, there aren't, um, they are very few the bachatas that are
Original lyrics, written in bachata.
Is true.
Copied from any other rhythm.
Bachata is a music that I love.
I love it. I love it with everything and that is copy, but I find it very sad,
I like the merengue, I like the salsa, I like Colombian cumbia, I like Colombian music a lot.
Okay
I'm crazy about the music of Shakira and Juanez
Of Carlos Vives.
I love Carlos Vives, also, I have records of them CDs I love them
Yes
There's a lot of talent there
I'm a musicologist full time. I love tangos, romantic music, old music, and the ballads.
Me too
But everything in its time, and meaning, according to my mood, at the moment. If we are among friends, talking and having some drinks, conversing
Maybe some ballads, some romantic music something like that more soft. But for a party, well There whatever goes. Though I have my taste, and I prefer a certain type of music in my dances
Exactly yes, I agree.
Its  obvious that we play the music that I like in my house but if another person brings music we play that also.
That is a taste for everyone.
Sure.
Personally, that type of Mexican music, and that other, I find it so awful.
I imagine that in Phoenix they have a lot of that too
My God here I live breakfast, lunch and dinner is that music.
Yes
Everyday, that's a pity
Yes, we do have three Hispanic radio stations, one has Northern music, the other one plays a mix of rhythms from different Latin American countries but, mostly Mexican music.
And the other one, they play too much Reaggaetton and things like that, I hardly listen to it.
The, Mexican music is very nice, the mariachis, rancheras, romantic music, they have a lot of
I really like Luis Miguel's music, I love it.
They have very good pop music singers and Alejandro Fernandez
Yes
All of that. It really is a pity that it's not that popular here, it has so much, so much Northern music
Mexico is so big. My ex-wife was from Oaxaca, Mexico; that sate is the large part of Mexico, near the South, near chiapas,and the culture is so different
None
The culture from the State of Chihuahua, the North
None
The music is completely different, even their dialects are pretty different
I see
Food and meals are different too.
Everything is different
I play the piano and when I was younger I was part of some bands.
Yes
I used to play lots of different music, salsa, merengue, things like that, ballads, I loved to play ballads in the piano.
None
For these days I have not had much opportunity because I have just a keyboard now and it is not the same as a piano like the one I had. I had a baby grand
Piano, and the music that those pianos play, it is fabulous.  Now I am in a smaller place.  Because of that, I also teach that to my daughter.
None
My little daughter is only five, but I teach her music.
Yes
She loves the piano, she loves to sing, she has a fabulous voice for a such a little girl. She spends time singing to her grandmother La negrita cucurumbe ( the little black girl cucurumbe), and the grandmother delighted with her.
Yes, Do you have sons?
Yes, I have two children.
What a blessing, how good, how good.
I have two children and they love to dance too, since they were very young.
Yes
Sometimes the tongue is punishment.
I don't like northern music. My son, he hears it and begins to dance. He loves it. What a plain taste my son has.
Punishment for not liking the Northern.
Yeah
No, but that northern music, not all is terrible, but there is one that is horrible, because it is the regueton about the lyrics, and it has obscenities.
None
It is the same, the same sound: chinguis, quringuichingui,quringuichingui, quiringuicha, it is the same
Yes, I liked the variety in the rhythm of rap when it first appeared in the United States
Hammer and Bobbie Brown
Yes
I loved it because it had a nice rhythm, like rap, but different
I see
Now, it's all the same. It's violence, that if kills, if murders, if it's that.
Yes, look the reggaeton is the same, bum ta bum, bum ta bum
Yes, it's the same, the same lyrics, or different lyrics but same rhythm, the same sounds, I don't know how there are people liking to listen the same all day
They don't get bored, because, when I'm in work, you use the computer all the time, and we are allowed to listen the radio and after doing all our work nice, I mean, the computer radio
I listen to the music on a Latin station on the Internet. A nice variety, I love it.
None
It has variety, it's Latin, but, they have variety from all countries, from Venezuela, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Mexico, all those places
Yes
All those countries, they contributed to Latin music, there are many
Yes, here, there was a station that played a lot of music, a variety, but now, there is only romantic music and anywhere you want
You listen only (to) those Northern rhythms.
None
Everywhere
There was an station here, I think that it was called Romantic Radio, and it seems that people got tired, and it left, I think that came from California, so, all the time it was
Ballad, and you were rested, which was nice at the time, but after that it got boring
None
There's better variety, there's a more lively rhythm.
Good
Yes, here the majority of Latinos here in Colorado are from Mexican descent.
Yes
It also really influences the radio, what you hear.
It's true. It's pretty influential.
How long have you been there in Phoenix?
Well since May, only about six months.
Is this the first time you've been to the United States?
I lived in Massachusetts.
In Massachusetts, it's cold there.
Yes, my husband lived there only for five years. In the company where he worked, they laid him off
What a shame.
We decided to move because were tired of the snow.
The cold, yes here
And we came to the other extreme, while it's great here, here it's great in
Yes, but it's really hot in summer, this is true.
Only, in, only in summer, but in the other seasons it's really great.
Yes
It's a really nice climate.
I imagine that it must be very nice now in the winter
Yes
Here in Colorado it's really cold
It's a one-sweater weather
Here in Colorado it's really cold right now
Oh, yes
But during winter, i mean, a very cold winter is starting, but usually it doesn't get this cold in December. Last week it was like ten degrees below zero
No
With the wind it was like twenty one below zero
No, last year we had, I'm sorry this year, in February, a snowing in Boston were we were trapped in the house and we couldn't get out.
Wow
We don't want more of this
The moisture is pretty high here in Colorado
None
The humidity is not so high and it doesn't feel as bad as if you lived in Chicago, in New York or there in Massachusetts
Yes it is in Massachusetts.
Yeah I like it here, it's just that I've been in Colorado for too long
I'm liking it here very much, but I do worry that I see it's a city, a very insecure state
How?
There is a lot of insecurity maybe because it's a border state.
Regarding what?
Hello?
Hello? How are you?
To whom am I speaking?
You're speaking with, Vicente.
Vicente. hello Vicente. My name is Liliana. Where are you from?
I'm  originally, from Panama.

Really, in the very center?
None
In the very center?
Yes, in the middle of the center, yes.
What do you do, and what do you do there?
In Manhattan.
What do you do there?
I'm an accountant.
Accountant? But the rent is really expensive there, no?
Yes. The rent, huge. You pay, you, what I pay for a small room, for two or three rooms, right?
None
In many parts of the United States, and the world, you can have a house.
Yes.
I was talking to a Mexican who was an American Mexican
None
No, he was paying much less for a house with three
Yes.
What, than what I was paying here. But I think, I'm goig to move from here really soon
How long have you lived there?
About twenty years. Twenty give years that I've been living in a city.
In the, aye.
Yes, but blah, the thin is, you get used to many things sometimes, you know?
Yes.
In the city everything's close.
Uh-huh, you can walk on either side
Exactly.
None
And I was reading a book that said people in California get fat because all the of things that come
Yes. Uh-huh, if you don't want a car and if you don't have
Everything in the car to go to look for this, to go by car.
Yes.
The people in the city are skinnier.  Because everything is close, so we walk.
None
And we walk a lot in the city.
And you don't have a car?
No, because a car will cost me
You don't need it.
What I pay, what I would pay to park the car
Yes, that's also
It's like three hundred a month, at least.
Yes.
Three hundred a month, to park the car.
Okay, also, God.
So that's what I think,
And.
This is what you pay for a car, if you can buy a car, right?
And part if you wont use it
No, the thing is that when you have a car, this has one, for a bigger one
You park the car in the garage? This is your regular
None
But when you go to visit someone else and you go in the street and there are so many rules. It costs you a lot to park and the end
You park and there are certain streets where you can't park.
None
OK? And if you have you car there, the police will take it from you.
Yes.
In New York they take your car in a second. And only you get out of the car and you go into a shop or a bodega, as the Puerto Ricans say,
None
And you come back and your car is gone.
None
It will cost you, it will cost like two hundred, two hundred fifty, three hundred dollars
Plus the three hundred a month and the insurance, no, too much.
Yes it's too much. I don't recommend it for anyone.
Taxi's are better.
But tell me, something in New York, right? I remember before with a mine that started something like this, and the majority of people that you saw were Puerto Rican, Dominicans.
Puerto Rico belongs to the United States, you see?
Yes.
I'm a United States citizen.
Yes.
The Dominicans come here too. Now? There were Chicanos, Ecuadorians, Peruvians, from all over the world.
Guatemala.
Guatemala is the place, you'll know if you go there. I know them as Incas from Peru. Things are littered in the streets.
Yes
Many are also illegal
None
In the city you can hide.
Yes.
And you can hold back a lot, you can find a lot of little jobs here and there, you know?
None
The, and they have a lot of problems and also, they don't have a lot of time to be chasing you, you know?
Yes.
And you can do little jobs here and there, in the city. But if you are out of the city, then they will come and look for you like that, illegal, you know?
But,  I think that here from Guatemala, from anywhere, and there's a class, and to me there's not much class of,
Of Latinos here. Europeans too, from

From Spain and Argentina

Because it's a small country, look, once, we had one hundred twenty banks
None
From all parts of the world, yes. yes. a small country with three million is going to have one hundred twenty international banks and all that. But that's how it is, because over there there's a lot, a lot of money passes through there.
Yes, true. There will be a lot of industry and all.
Yes.Because of the commerce of the canal. Also the Colombians brought all the, drug related money. In Panama it's said

About two years ago I visited New York.
I think we're far. I've never been to Kansas.
No
Yes. I passed when, when I came from my town, yes.
They're small counties, but it's pretty here.
Yes, do you like it more than Texas?
No, I like Texas more
What is it with Texas that everybody likes so much?
It may be because I have been living there so many years and know the city, people, and everything better. Maybe that
None
I've lived for more than thirty years in the state of Texa
Wow, are you staying long here?
No, hardly two days. I'll stay until the 29, then afterwards the 29 I'll go
El Paso, Texas
None
And then back to Fortward, where I live
I see
What do you think about the subject for today?
Music, I like music
Yes
I love music. Music amazes me.
None
I don't have a specific preference for a kind of music. I listen to any kind of music. I enjoy more soft music; I like classical music because you have to
It has a message. Music that relaxes me
None
Sometimes, I play, I don't know, a Reggae-ton, that are more, more
Noisy
Hyper, more noisy, hyper. But I don't have a, specific preference. I can't tell, I like salsa, or ballads, or
Reggaeton, I like them all, but I prefer music that
None
Has a message, like a good message for your soul
Good description. I actually agree with you because
And
I have no preferences on what happens to me, but I do like much more classical music. Because if I listen to, for instance
It bores me listening to country music or polkas.
None
The music that never bores me is classical music. That's why I think classical music is what I like most
They ask us whatever
Yes
Classical music plays an important role in my life.
It brings me peace and quietness. It relaxes me.
None
When, for instance, when I am crushed or, sorry, when I am sad or so, I play music. And it helps a lot
It pushes me to meditate about life. Maybe in that moment I know for a minute
Let's say, of sadness, but I think of the other people and say there must be people feeling worse than I do. So, yes, music helps
Yes
Much to reconsider. And I'm not so bad, because there are much worse people than me.
Yes, it makes life more pleasant
It does
It makes life much more temporary.
Yes
There are some topics that make you sad
Yes
It can be that touching on these topics that have a, have links to similar situations that you're really living
None
And since it touches you a little bit, but in reality, I like it, I tell you, I like music that carries a message.
This, if it's something lively, that carries a message. If not, it's only a racket, and the noise with
Combined with people who are happy.
None
But this really doesn't have a message
None
A message or something personal. Something the artists, writer, composer, the exhibitor of the song.
None
This, wants to bring it to the public. And this only, if I want an important role in my life, sure, because, I tell you, without, without it
There are situations where live makes, makes you sad, and, what I know, you feel alone.
None
And music makes you happy. I think it has something to do with the real creation of us, because if we sit and we look at the Biblical level,
None
The truth, like in, times before, for example, they say that David danced. Or the praises that they gave to God.
None
If we go much much further back than this it says that Lucifer was the angel who was in charge of music.
Of the praise for God.
Yes
Yes we're created in His image and likeness of God, it means that the Lord likes it, God likes music, no, the, the, the
We have a link to them, then. We're part of his creation, so we have, it brings me to think that, God liked music
He enjoyed music too, he lived music and I think that for this, for us that they say, you hear all kinds of music
It means that music is a universal language
It is
It plays an important role in our lives. I work in the car
None
Almost eight hours a day, ten dollars an hour, every day.
None
First thing I do is put music on, any kind of music
None
That has a message that brings me tranquility.  That brings me peace.  That makes me happy.
None
And now another negative music or that has to do with violence, that has to do with other issues or problems or
Only listen to anything that brings me a type of message.
Some sort of joy, something of
None
That brings me tranquility, brings me peace in my life.
Yes, I liked the idea of what you say that really the music is a companionship. I do feel when you are alone, and
Yes,
You listen to music with messages that make you reconsider and you don't feel alone.
Meditate
None
Then, yes, up to a certain extent well is essential. I have no idea what would happen without music.
Look, I love to dance.
None
I love to dance a lot. So imagine without music, I don't know what we would do.
Dancing and music make you happy.
A joy, understand
Yes
That's why I tell you, is something like you say, indispensable
That's like food for the spirit
We
Something that propels you to keep going, to rest a little and keep on going in your routine or whatever right.
Yes No, That is my opinion of music.
None
I share it with many other people, unless they have a specific preference in music.
None
They like something specific.
Yes
Tell me
You and I are in complete agreement in our way of thinking about music.
Yes
We start focusing more or less on the same type of music, because I too listen to any type of music, but it does takes me
I'm much more interested in, classical music.
Yes
The other types of music start to bore me by the fifth song and I'm not liking it.
In, and the classic no, that one doesn't bore at all.
Yes, and
Yes is
It doesn't bore, and even less when, when you have knowledge of who's playing it, of who
Is
Who was the writer, and how old is it? Because I also start listening to classical music, and
None
I have a friend who's a professional pianist
None
In, classical music. So he
None
They're playing something and he says, Hey, this is Back, this is Beethoven, this is the other.
Ok.
He tells me more or less what, what he's playing, and I more or less understand through, through
Through him, well.
Yes
When, he really hasn't brought it to plain paper
Yes
Who's playing and what they're playing was in the paper, and you understand a lot more, so it makes you
You appreciate it a lot more, therefore.
Yes, it's like when you listen and tell something, like a story that they told you.
None
You put the emphasis according to what you think it really relates to. Music is like this.
Hi, my name is Leticia
How are you?, Hi Leticia, How are you?

It wasn't, it wasn't you then.
It wasn't me, it was someone from Philadelphia too.
There are many Argentinians in Philadelphia.
Yes, you talked with another Argentinian in Philadelphia, how crazy.
I can't speak like the person who was an Argentinian in Philadelphia.

To get a beer and it was when I got a beer.
No, I don't know.
You don't remember, no, at least it wasn't you
Sure, how nice. And, where are you from?
I'm from Panama.
How many Panamanians are there in this study? Because the other day I spoke with a Panamanian too.
Yes, I know who it is, I know her too.
Patricia from
Patricia, from New York.
From Delaware.
From Delaware, exactly.
Wilmington, I talked with her the other day.
She talks a lot, Patricia talks a lot.
Yes, we talked a lot.  She talked the majority of the time.  This is so funny.
Yes, and how?
And how did you find out about the study?
On the Internet I was playing with Craig, Craigslist
On Craigslist
None
Ah, look at that.
Tell me.
Yes, because that intrigued me, because I think the study is from the University of Pennsylvania.
Yes Is the same one that you did.
Sure, yes, yes, yes.
And what do you study?
I'm not studying, I'm doing, I'm working
You work in the University, how nice.
I'm not studying
We already talked a little of everything. Now let's talk about the topic before,
Yes, what's more this topic.  I already got it another time.
Yes that's why you were so bored, right? Me too.
Up to now every time I've talked, I talked with two women, I never talked with men that's why I tell you that for sure I didn't talk with you.
For the two times I talked to women
It's good luck then. The topic is good.
And what are you doing in New York?
What did you say?
What are you doing in New York?
I have a small clothing company.
Look how nice.
And then, practically, I do, the buying, the selling,
Yes
I am the only person who works there and I go and show samples and make deliveries.
Look how nice. Have you been doing that long?
The only one. I've been working like that seven years, already.
Good.
Although this year is the slowest year, but it's been seven years. And you, only work in the university?
Yes and I do studies.
When are you coming to New York for a little trip around here?
Yes the truth is that New York we wanted to go this weekend, but at the end no. We didn't end up going but. this year I was there twice, it's also not been that long that I've been living here, it's been seven months
Yes, only nine months.
Yes, it hasn't been long
Okay
So no, I was in New York twice this year.
Yes, how did you like it? You like it or not?
I like it for a while, I don't like it to live there
Why don't you like it to live?
Because too much craziness, a very hectic city. I think I would go crazy, I don't know.
That's what makes it fun.
Yes that's why I like it for a little bit, but after I want, I like Philadelphia because it has, is more peaceful and also you have things to do, is not that you don't have anything to do.
Anyways we are so near that whenever I want I can go to New York to spend the day.
That's good.
It doesn't come out that expensive.
That's good, No really right. I have gone to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but since I have no ambiance. I don't have people I know or anything. I've gone to walk by the,
By the main avenue, I've walked, I've eaten, shopped, and at night I went to a few restaurants.
Yes
To talk with crazy bartenders only and after that I came, I returned.
Sure, to spend the day is good, same here, in comparison to New York there are not that many things to do, that's true, but,
Yes
To live is good, because is a city that has a more or less acceptable size and you find everything you need.
And how about the night life there?
Here all in the United States at least. I don't know in New York, but here everything closes, very early to my taste.
Yes, And you like it?
And on weekends after dinner, after eleven, it's difficult for them to be open. I used to go to eat with hm,
At this time or at nine or something, so, not so late, not so early.
At this hour the chickens go to bed in Panama.
Yes, not for this.  In Panama they also eat dinner late
No, yes, eating dinner early and after going to bed early because there's nothing to do anymore
They eat dinner early and they go to bed early in Panama.
Yes, at, no, at eleven at night the restaurants are already closed here for.
Look at that.
Di-difficult to find a restaurant open later.
I didn't know this.
Yes
No, it's the opposite in Argentina.  The restaurants open at eight at night and they don't close until two or three in the morning
That's good.
The bars where you can have a drink, they can be open almost all night.
There are bars that are open later, but usually, the restaurants are closed early.
None
Early. Leticia tell me about the technology and the
Yes, I'll tell you what I said to the same person I talked to
Tell me
That things around here that I feel I depend on are the computer
And the telephone.
Of the and the phone up to there only because by the computer I also manage by the phone but, I mean the computer more, than the phone, but the phone also, no.
You sound, You sound relatively young Leticia, how old are you?
What?
How old are you Leticia?
Thirty one.
Thirty one.
Yes
You sound like a fifteen year old girl.
Really
Yes
No, I'm not that young.
Yes, you like a fifteen year old girl.
How old are you?
I'm thirty seven years old
Well
None
Up to thirty is good, the thing is not to pass the thirty.
Yes.
Thirty. I can stand it.
The bad thing is that time doesn't forgive, Leticia.
No, that's true.
That doesn't forgive not for love, nor money
Yes
He will continue to keep getting older, but forget it, that's only a number.
Yes
After the, after the
Yes
You already entered and admitted it, it means that, you feel good, about your age, because there are lots of people that,
No, yes
It doesn't feel good to say thirty one, thirty two, that's it. Especially the women. When they already pass twenty five, they don't want to keep aging.
Yes, obviously, I also don't want to keep on, but one ages.
And
What are you going to do.
What can I do?
How do you feel that you depend on technology?
I depend on technology only the same as you that if I have to send a fax.
Receive an email with pictures
Sure
Or send an inventory on excel.
Sure
Receive an inventory on excel, send a wire. To pay for merchandise also. the phone,
Sure
Is very useful also, because, I take, I've taken pictures by phone, I've sent an email and the person has seen the merchandise without me having to show it to them or having to go there to
The office
None
To send picture
Yes, I understand.
So yes, let's say you have one of these electronic digital cameras. You take pictures. You still have to take a computer
Yes
To download the pictures and send them.
Yes
With the phone you just send it like that and no
Sure.
Yes, I really depend. I makes my life easier. It facilitates things. They make it faster and I like it.
Who doesn't, like to make their life easier, You understand me? so, in that sense, that's all I have to say about the
The computer,
Yes of the communications more than anything.
Yes exactly.
Yes I think that it was the revolution of the last few years, the topic of the communications.
Yes, practically all. I already elaborated, much more last time that I talked with, I don't know with whom. I think I spoke with an Argentinian the other time. In Philadelphia.
Yes
Mauricio.
Mauricio.
Mauricio. Yes
Mariano, no.
Mariano, Mariano, Mariano,
My husband
Mariano is your husband.
Yes
I spoke with Mariano, I don't know if it was Mariano of the same
It could be, it could be that you spoke with him.
Of the same topic, ask him if he talked with from Panama, no with Mariano I spoke, I think that I spoke of something else with Mariano.
It was regarding the abuse of women also something like that
It could be, I really don't know. But, there are many Panamanians in the United States, or no.
No, not really, I have.
No
I've been like fourteen years in New York and don't know.
You don't know any Panamanians?
No, I don't know any Panamanians.
Hi, I'm Arturo
Good Evening, This is Lourdes
To whom am I speaking to? Hi Lourdes, well
Good night, which is the piece of technology you use the most?
Depends, I think that music, All that has to deal with music
Like MP3 players and the
Because, yes, Mp3 players, CD's and all that, any kind of music playback, but I think I listen to music practically all day, then
I can't stop to use the cellphone.  I was sometime without a cellphone and I didn't use it much.  Now it might pass a day I don't make a call or be called by anyone
I see
Also the computer, but you use that a lot
Has technology helped to choose music?
I think that technology has definitely helped, because, when I was younger, the only option was having some tapes to listed
I see.
In the road, and now, if you want to choose a song from a tape, it was hard because you had to forward the recording and it took time
Sure
Now, with technology, from a MP3 you can see all the music you have and you can pick a song
At any moment.
And in fact, with iPods you can have almost all your music library at any moment. That's really cool. It's really easy
Figure out that I would say that the computer
Yes
The computer
None
Because I use in my job, I use it at home,  for things, I mean for anything,  If in the morning we are going to
Yes, I see
Work, the first thing my husband does is look for the weather cast in the computer
Sure
And if we need to save information or keep the house accounts, then we do it on the computer.
So we don't have to care about papers or anything
Yes, right, but you must have a backup, you must have it well protected because in case of malfunction you would loose a lot of information
Well, look, that's our sin, we are very bad with the backup so we keep paper records, for five or six years, but after that we destroy them
None
That, everybody save their documents in a drive
None
And so, they access the drive. They work on their own computer, but they save in the drive
In a drive, OK
IT IS A WAY OF MORE OR LESS PREVENTING IN CASE
Yes, because it
Worries me
Not long ago, my hard drive was deleted, a beverage fell on to my compouter
No.
It did in my laptop, it erased everything that I had, I had super important pictures of trips and lots of music and things like that
I was pretty stupid, I lost everything because I didn't back it up before
That's a pity, I'm sorry.
It was horrible.
I'm sorry, that's another thing, the ones that have pictures, we have them stored in the laptops
None
But we have an external drive with copies of all of them.
Okay, that's great.
And now that we have a new baby
Yes
You take pictures of him every time he smiles. You take a picture if he farts. We take a lot of pictures of him
Yes, of course
So we have hundreds of pictures and maybe four or five are really nice, wonderful pictures, so we do share those with our friends.
Yes, that's right
So, we keep the rest in the special file. Some are in the computer and we have a copy in the external drive.
Oh well
But you are right, when I was writing my thesis, my master
None
I had to file it on a certain date in order to be able to graduate.
None
Believe me that after working on weekends, on all sorts of arrangements
Yes
All the changes i had made in the document got deleted
Oh no
Yes,
Such a trauma
And after crying like an idiot for twelve hours, I said, maybe that means that the next thing I write will be a lot better than the previous
Yeah, i mean, yeah, i hope
And with that mood, I stayed working the rest of the week and I met the deadline
Yes
It's true I mean.
Wow
That's one of the things that technology
Yeah, that is hard for us, right?, we have to
Because then you become a slave of the computer or whatever technology
Yes sure, exactly  if you lose your computer, or you lose your cellphone, for example, or you lose something and you don't even know how to communicate with anyone, you don't
Sure
You don't have a phone agenda and you don't have anything, because everything was
It's true, my phone ran out of battery once
Right
My dad moved, and I lost his phone number because I had it saved on my other cellular phone.
Yes
And I don't know it by heart. So it is a question that helps a lot, but also makes you somehow a slave to technology
Yes right, right now we become more dependent on that, I mean before people managed to live without, but right now.
I think it would be the same with or without cellular phones
Sure
It's just that we learn to depend on them. I don't think that has changed, and not so many things have changed, but
Sure
Yes, that's it.  There is a lot
Another piece of technology that I have realized how important it is, is the microwave oven, because before
Yes
I have never cooked in a microwave.
No
I don't like the taste of microwave food
Yes, no
But now, with the baby
None
To prepare his food
None
In five minutes, I can steam cook for him pumpkin, yame, yutia, banana, or whatever I want to feed him.
Right
I don't even have to think
Didn't it take more time before?
Exactly.
Yes, I have also noted that right now. Because I just started living here alone in the school. I lived at home with my parents before and
Well i worried about the food and now that I've started cooking
Right
It takes a lot of time.  I don't have time because I have to work and do homework or study.  I'd like to have a microwave.
Right
I have to get one as soon as possible, because yes, it saves a lot of time, it's really impressive
Sure, to re-heat, not so much for cooking, the taste is not very good
Yes, not to cook
But for re-heating
Right?, but then there are those instantaneous foods in the airports or stuff like that
Yeah, because then once a week, of course
You can buy and cook a lot faster, it doesn't taste very good but it nourishes you
Sure, but, and, the other thing you can do is cook once a week, you freeze it
Right
Defrost the meal
Yes, that's a good technique to defrost everything there
Here, we do that with minced meat, we season it slightly, marinade, salt, garlic, nothing more
None
Then we save it in individual packages
None
One day we thaw it and it and make tacos. Another day we thaw it and make tomato sauce for the pasta
Look
Another day we thaw it and do some other thing, and since it is already seasoned all you have to do is put it in the microwaves, heat it and mix it with, whatever, right?
Whatever you are going to serve is a great idea and I might use it too.
Oh, do it. You'll see how useful it is
Yes
None
Because otherwise I end up cooking too quickly, usually pasta. because it is the fastest thing I can do and
This way you'll end up putting on sixty pounds
That stuffs me
That you'll put on a lot with the
Yes, right? with the pasta diet.
Eating pasta
No, I must start my new diet. But anyway, I don't have any problem with
I am rather thin because my metabolism processes everything very fast so I hardly gain weight.
Yes, but until you are 25, 26, 30,
Likewise, yeah, exactly, that changes things
So you see, there's no god forgiveness,
They don't discriminate by race or color
No, no, there's no metabolism that can stand it
Everyone, it's true
Although sometimes you don't notice, but the other technology that has also made life easier
Yes, its also impressive.
The first three months after I had my baby, I washed all his clothes by hand because we didn't have a machine.  I didn't want to use a public machine.
Yes
Put his clothes with other people's clothes, because I didn't know what
None
Look boy, what a horrible thing to have to wash every two days, because it piles up a lot
Right
It's not soaking and rinsing, it's soaking
Yes, I can imagine.
Scrubbing the clothes, rinse it, hang it
No.
None
A different story
Exactly, so
Yes, I think that what I was thinking now. The technology, where it's changed us the most is in the simple things. In the daily life, like
Having electricity, having I mean having electricity to have a refrigerator, those things that we now see as basic.
Sure
That has affected us a lot. It has changed us a lot, we don't even realize it. If you start to take away those fundamental things like the the refrigerator...Imagine living without a refrigerator, it would be hard.
No, exactly, buying everything daily.
Everything per day, yes everything fresh.  Imagine.  It would be another story.
In fact one of the reasons why many kids would die when there was no refrigeration was because the milk you would buy in the morning already in the afternoon the milk was, curdled, it was spoiled.
Hello?
Hello?
Who am I talking to?
This Paulo, what's your name?
Paulo?
Yes
Paulina.
None
Where are you from?
People will go to
From Argentina
Yes.
I'm from Chile.
We are neighbors.
Neighbors, yes, how are you?
Fine, how are you?

In Georgia
None
In Athens, Georgia.
And how is everything well?
Good. Are you studying?
No, I'm working in whatever.
Yes
None
How long have you been here?
No a year.

Fourth half I don't know what it is.
To High School
High school
The High School, yeah, fourth
Yes
That's it.
Studying here?
None
Are you studying
I came here to study and then i got married, so my husband is getting a doctorate and we are here in Athens, still studying.
Oh, hey that's very good
Yes
Uh huh. I have my husband here that's also
And that seems like yes.
He's doing a Post-doc
Yes?
Yes,
Very well
Here in Penn University
In which area?
In molecular biology
Okay
What are you studying?
I'm home with the kids and
None
He's studying technology
None
That is the area of the occasion.
None
Yes
Well, a lot of children?
Two
Two kids?
Andres is three years old. Cristina is a year old.
Cute little ones.
Yes.
Beautiful.
Yes, and do you have kids?
No
Not yet?
We are thinking about it.  Not yet.
No, it's all right.
We're used to the life in the United States, after that we'll see
Yes.
We want to, but we canÂ´t do it yet. ItÂ´s not economically
It gets harder.
Sure. First we have to come here and get settled, and then weÂ´ll see. So, all right, has it been a long time since you last went to Chile?
LetÂ´s see, went there the last time, yes, a long time ago, letÂ´s see, IÂ´ve gone back twice
None
And the last lime it was because my family came here so
Very good
When did we last go, 2000, 2001?
None
Four years ago
A long time ago
Because I was pregnant with Andres
Sure
We went to collect blood samples. I was working in a laboratory, a project called molecular genealogy
None
Where they make a database
Yes
They take some blood samples and you were there with mu husband
That's nice
They will take
Nice
The last time he went to Chile
We were in Argentina for a month
Oh really?
Yes
That's nice, all your family there
Yes, absolutely everything
That's nice
That all
You miss some things
Yes, I miss
Other thins are less missed here
Yes, it happened to me, I mean being all those
No, a year is a year
Little time, and some things they had, yes
The moment you enter you are getting out
That's fantastic
Things yes, some things are much easier here.
Yes, and even the requried power that you have here
Yes, no?
Yes, and when we met in Argentina, we weighed everything and it was cheap. But, it is not the same.
Here and we buy and we deprive ourselves, like, in Argentina you know that when you go with one hundred dollars, it didn't seem like one hundred dollars. They're charging us a lot.
For this.
Yes.
A lot of it's like. they're all, they're all
No, yes.
It's the same. So, well.
Some things are strange too, I remember this month when I went with my husband.
None
We had to make presentations. There were some things that's part of culture no more. We had the permission
Transport blood and everyone seemed to us
Yes.
They opened our bags, took out my bags of shampoo and conditioner and said, what's this? Shampoo. So, with the papers and everything, well good.
Some things were more complicated than here.  It is easier to do things here.
Sure.
But, for other things like eating avocado, it is really expensive here.
None
Any food
Yes. in Chile, yes, we eat a lot of meat
Yes. It's very expensive here.
Here it's really expensive and it's not the same, we spent thirty, forty, fifty kilometers when we went to look at the airport and we immediately stopped at a grill
Like the carnivore I am.
No, it's true I miss it, and more that here I buy every thing cut and every thing
Everything cut up differently, and I don't buy it because it's so different for
Yes.
Or anything, no no no.
It's really expensive, yes.
No. so good.
No, and it's from a friend who's in Argentina too
Yes, we're
She always says, no. The meat that I no.
Yes, the meat and wine are horrible, and expensive
The tea too.  Even if you can buy tea
Yes we can find it.
Yeah. Life is good if there's tea, everything's good. Nah.
No, we're missing meat. Now we have to dedicate ourselves with coffee too, everything's good but these things that you've also lived. You go finding
In the taste of the food of the most
Yes.
Afterwards everything is good.  There is always something similar that we will find so it's good.  What is that?
That's great. And they gave your wife the scholarship, how does that come together
Yes, the one with Penn University. We are from Mar De Plata, which is near Buenos Aires.
None
And from Mar de Plata they said okay and they gave me the J1 J2 visa
None
It allows me to work and for the time being we are working, as it goes working at Penn and I work. At times a job ends and I start another.
I've only had this job for awhile but it's my third job so I know it very well.
Yes. It's difficult at first but afterwards
Yes, no
Things get better.
Yes, I spend my time getting to know more people. We don't distinct people that
Yes
They offer work and well you make friends here and there. And since I know a
No, yes
A guy from Chile. I haven't seen him for a long time. He's a music professor.
Yes.
I don't know, he's been here about 10 or 12 years. He left once. Didn't he tell us. You don't remember. You don't remember.
No, I asked you about the music professor. Wasn't it one time, he returned once to Chile, didn't he. Ah, he said he went back five years, but afterwards he missed it here.
He was in Chile and here, also.
No yes.
He has his life.
Yes, no.
Here too, right?
You miss it. I say the next time we go on a visit it is better I tell my husband because he is
He is American but he speaks Spanish
None
I say, I would like to live for a time in Chile or another Hispanic country for children to learn Spanish well.
Yes, fantastic of course.
Here all their friends only speak English and we at home speak Spanish but is like if, they prefer English
They lose it a lot, right? It is a lot easier.
All of them speak it, of course.
For them.
It is possible to go for awhile, I say the ideal would be to be contracted from here.
They would have a great time there.
Yes.
This is what we all want. It is very difficult to find. All of them Argentinians, Latin American all of them say it is the ideal, right?
Yes, because they
Until now I don't know someone that
My sister is also married to another gringo.  She and he are working.  She works for the government in some construction companies.  He is
None
How do you say construction manager there?, Construction engineer?, i don't know
Yes, foreman. Well, he's an engineer
I don't know
Yes, right? To run Argentina with six
Well
None
The thing is that each working company has several parts or projects in several projects and they were re trying to be employed for like two years in a project in Chile
None
It didn't work out
None
Let's try again
None
Later
None
But, I told him, he told me if we go to Chile, instead of spending all our money in, uh, going to the most expensive schools and all that, we take a
All the money and live and afterwords we come back with a small saving too
Sure, yes
Instead of living large, right?
How much is the dollar in Chile?
The truth is that
You don't know what the difference is, no idea?
I don't have any idea.
Yes, we're seeing on the Internet, it's three with forty three cents. One dollar for it's three with forty three pesos.
I don't know what's happening in Argentina.
But even in Chile it's more, it's like five hundred or six hundred.
Yes
But I don't know how much it is
Yes.
How much it is in Chile and Argentina, I don't know.
Sure, I don't know, I don't know. Sure. No, I don't know how it is
Things were expensive when went, some things were the same price as here and people don't earn as much as here.
Sure, yes, I know this.
Some things were as expensive as here and
Yes, yes, we saw it. When we went to the
Yes.
Crazy, what they charge, it's crazy. After a while I got my car insurance,
The gasoline
Since I
Terrible, no.
Borrowed in the tank and started the needle so I said to the boy who was there that no no, that way, that way
So expensive
No yes it's true, it's like three times more than here or more.
Sure, it makes them rich
Yes. And it's expensive here and now
Han, but with a salary more or less of a manager, no. There it hurts every time that you're going to charge, you have to have the tank, no. No, no, no.
This something that's oof. If I go back one day. At least like, how we said, now I have a friend who went back
Argentina.
To Argentina and close to Mendosa.
Yeah.
They are on the other side of Argentina.   Each time I have to call, I call on the telephone.  I was there for four or five years.
He went back
You get used to it here.
They say that it's difficult for me to buy a car.
And to open a bank account. You have to, I don't know, it's complicated.
Yes, it's complicated
Hello!
Hello! How are you? Who am I talking to?
Marcela
There are no Argentinians in North Carolina
Thank you. Where are you calling from?
Where am I calling from? San Antonio, Texas
Yes
And where are you?
In, Saveville, North Carolina
In North Carolina. And where are you from?
I am Argentina. And you?
I am Mexican.
None
How are you?
How's it going for you?
Many, many thanks, today's theme is pretty interesting, yeah?
Yes technical artifacts. What's yes, look, the dishwasher
Yeah the juicer, the planca, the microwave
Sure
The radio
Yes, yes
The computer,
Yes, perhaps they are are talking of more modern, digital things that have come out recently that are computer and the cellular related.
Oh, yes.
Has influenced our life a lot, and yes they are technological advances. Because if we go to places where they still don't have them, for example a blender, they have
To use a mortar and pestle
Yes
The manual grinder and,
Yes, or take wash the clothes in the river by hand.
And, exactly
I shoot myself
I think that yes, these are definitely technological advances, that have influenced our life a lot
Yes
For good because I frankly, I wouldn't be too much in the plan, in which there are people in the, social experiments Right?
Yes
That leave all the technological advances behind and want to live like that, totally natural. that's interesting, for a brief time.
Yes
Very physically exhausting right?
No, look, what surprises me is this that my grandmother my Dad's Mother
Yes
She was maye 30 or 32 years old when she got married in 1918
None
So, she was old at that time.
Yes
Being that old and getting married
Yes
She was, my grandparents were are Catalans
Yes
And then, they make cloth,
Yes
She embroidered, all the things she used at home, the blankets, all was embroidered and all was done by here
That's nice
All the cloth she used, all the cloth her children used, she did everything, except my grandfather's suits, that were made by a tailor, but she could made that if she wanted
The shirts
Oh!
She did
Yes
All tat, and it cooked delicious how they cooked and you read about all days in the Argentina newspaper, a Catalan newspaper and a French newspaper
My God!
Yes, and they did
Wow
She was the manager, the one who handled all the money of a factory of overall uniforms that my Grandfather owned.
She was an exceptional woman, don't you think so?
Why would she do that when she has a washing machine?
The traditional way, you know what I mean?
With her own physical strength
We do a lot of things.  We spend a third of the day in the car.
Absolutely, Our time
When we get home we are exhausted, and then we sit down and watch TV
That's it
Talk on the phone
Less every day
Understand?
Sometimes I miss the telephone a little because you don't talk to your friends
No, that's not true
Sometimes
That's right
For that
So
You are absolutely right
None
I agree absolutely
It is very funny, they had less technology but achieved more things, of course they didn't have the chances we have nowadays as women
None
But they achieved a lot in the matter of production
Of production, of course.
We don't, maybe the women, I am an Artist, so it's like I don't really count, but women who have
Professional jobs working in companies, who are accountants, doctors, lawyers, things like this
You decide less on your own time actually, somehow your grandmother could organize her time in a more personal way, because
When you are an employee working for some other person
None
Often your time belongs to the employer also, often
Yes and so the production goes to
Then
To the employer
It takes most of your time and energy, like when you go back home after driving.
Having worked for eight or ten hours in some other place
Yes
And when you finally get home you go, oh!
Sure, you want your time
What did I have to do?
You want your time, because you've been giving all your time to others
It's true that when you use certain technologies, you avoid learning how to do things they way they were done when those technologies weren't around
If someday a bomb falls or a fantastic situation like that, you'll have to start civilization all over again
Yes
I wonder: how will we do it?
We won't know anything, you know?
If we didn't have everything at hand
I have two sons, one is 23 and the other is 17.
Yeah
They went to a school for, seventh, eight and ninth grade
There are about 28, 29 students, tops
Wow!
They live 4 or 5 in cabins, and they're in the middle of nature
They have to learn that, learn how to survive
And they have no computers
Wow!
No tv, there's a TV that
Yeah
Sometimes on the weekends they rent a movie.
Wow, how interesting
The boys to everything we wake up early in the morning, because I work there in the fall
How great
You wake up early in the morning, everyone helps with the breakfast and there it goes walking, a, a half mile until the
School buildings that are cabins too
None
Sometimes I can do all I want before it's too late.
None
Anything. Any song that you want the boys can play and after the boys play guitar the teachers play guitar and after that the day begins.
And you know
But
The end of the day
How interesting
They've done, we've done, we've achieved many things
None
Of course not, what do I know, the boys grow up constantly doing things, doing work but also
We return a little bit to what you were saying, about not watching television
Participating
Not having a computer
Yes
No way that should take your time, your time is to be used in other things, look how interesting really
None
Technology is not completely good
Yes
It takes a lot of your time
Yes, it absorbs too much energy
The boys now spend the whole afternoon on the Internet
Yes and playing video games
And every afternoon in the week, right?
None
Then you don't have a chance to give your time to other things
Yes, sometimes I wonder what will be of that physical creativity, understand? that creativity that comes from being among
When we were young in the streets we tried not to get bored and we came up with one idea and then another.
Ideas, boys talk about ideas, but while they are playing games on the cell phone
You are absolutely right.
I don't know
It is, it is relative somehow, the use of time, nowadays, how we are using it still having all these entertainment devices, television
Yes
Computers, video games, and all that stuff, they are great consumers of our time, and therefore of our creative activity
Yes, yes, it comes to destroy our energy
Of our energy
No, I don't know and I'm very guilty, I'm now trying to not turn on the television because I have a lot to do. Because I turn on the TV
And even if I'm doing things. Yes, going from room to room fixing, putting this, I go shopping, return, this and that. The same is
It sucks my energy.

God bless you
For small children
What a thing.
I love it, the truth is that I love it, because there
Yes no, it's a vocation.
There is a whole reenergization. You get filled again with positive energy
Yes
Because they really are something else, they are not yet,
Yes there are no limits
They are not so educated on the other options
None
There yes all the use of time has to be always very creative and, and and even though at schools they are promoting a lot the a
Support in the use of computers for education. But it's not generalized yet. And you shouldn't satanize the either,
The technology because, with respect to education, computers are a marvel.
No, that's true.
Usin educational programs and all that
No, and unfortunately we have to maintain the population to the level of the Chinese.
Yes, that have a very high technological development.
They do have a technological development and they are advancing very very, very fast and in that culture education is sacred
Yes
And in this culture it's not.
No,
And then there is where we really can fall behind. we will fall behind but

Technical devices.
Technical devices
What type of technical devices do you use?
For the computer

It's something essential
Essential. It's waht
I use it every day.
Connected to the internet.
Connected to the internet it helps me check mail from work, personal mail and I can see pictures
I am taking classes at the University and sometimes I have homework.
Online.
They put different things. raleted to the class, so I have to check it, that. every day.
Yes,  I worked as a computer technician. I assembled, dissasembled, fixed them
Okay
I have a network here at home, made with 3 machines, a couple screens, my phone, which I'm using to talk now, it's a
How do you call it, a pocket
None
One made by HP that basically I use, connecting by wifi.
Okay
To internet, i check my mail, I download videos, I even have movies, you can have a SD card, I have
None
I have all the information of people, I don't remember anyone's phone number.
None
I almost donÂ´t remember my own phone number because I donÂ´t dial the number, but I use words, or I use the name of the person IÂ´m
Calling
Okay
Yes, now everything is, at least me and other people I know too, used to put directly the name without, remembering the number
None
Yes
I have there my mail, my electronic mail, the e-mail addresses too
None
It goes in the computer, or in a phone connected to the computer.  It can move information from one to the other
None
I listen to music in mp3 through my phone. I put the headset on and listen to that.

Aha, yes.

Now that it has a screen, it has, it recognizes hand writing

I've also learned to write rapidly
None
It connects with everything at work. I also go to class. There are classes where I go in person once a week, a four hour class.
Yes
The rest is online. the subjects are all delivered online, all through email
Okay.
It seems to me that we're really used to it and I think that we could and should get used to it a bit more. For example, to see dates
Friends' birthdays, family,
None
This something really easy to put on the computer, on the machine without thinking, literally
None
Remember
None
All the dates and all the events, I think that not only the ones remembering looking in a while, It's not that often
Do we  depend too much or too little on this technology?
I think that we could also, decide, I mean, there is certain people that can't remember more than the telephone numbers
That can be a bad thing
None
Basically, I've been using that kind of device for several years
Yes..
After, I broke or lost the plastic device, I don't remember anything, I don't know anything.
None
I ask myself for my own telephone number and I don't practically remember
Yes
Now with the connection the device can be put on the home computer.
None
It's always there, I don't lose the information
None
You lost the phone numbers, the names, specific data, things you don't always remember without a note. And when you write those down you usually write in
A piece of paper that is in reach at the moment.
Yes
You don't necessarily find it back when you need it
You can get a lot of information in the computer and retain it, to a point where
Yes
You need it or don't want it
That's why it will only give it to you when
Yes
You remember to ask for it
Yeah
That's the other problem
None
Of course, with the new programs that are there and remember to remind you, my phone reminds me in the morning, i mean, i have
My whole day is on the on my phone
OK
In the schedule that I have in
None
My whole day schedule, what i do since the hour i start working

Until the hour i get out, it's the time when I have to pick up the child from school
None
To
You have the organization
Exactly, and finding her in high school,  for me coming back to faculty to see the classes I'm taking
None
Looking in one look, I see that I have to do in the day, things that before you were always trying to remember, or write down in a
In your arm or in a paper, or as I said
None
Not always in your disposal when you need it
None
I think that there are people that have too much
Yes, it's need to much, not now
None
It looses the human side
Yes
For example, you feel that you are trying to talk, to call some companies for problems you have.
None
Call to the telephone and you have to deal with
With a machine
With a machine.
Operator a machine, like, press the number for that, press number two for that
Exactly
I understand that on the side
It
On the company side, yes, it has a lot, a lot lots of complaints, and they kinda want to organize the way to help the client
Did you change direction, or do you have a question about this?
It makes sense, yes
I helped him organize those questions so that the person that going to help knows what the problem is, or the specifcs about the problem.
Exactly
With it, but, it's very frustrating to call a credit card, and have to talk with the operator
That will possibly have consequences, bad ones. Like you lose your card and have to speak to an operator to put pressure on the
None
That you have been stolen and you want to talk to
Yes
Cancel your card before someone will use it illegally
The way it looks in theory, and i think that most of the time it's like that in companies. The private companies
Those public companies and government, typical throughout the world, i guess
None
They'll find, you'll find that they go around and around more than a snail, i mean, but many others don't, they can't get you the person
None
Because it almost seems like they're trying to avoid talking to you.
Yeah, of course
But
The company, as they did in New York, or what they are doing in many places
The public transportation system is doing everything. WHen you go to the train station and buy a ticket, you buy it from a machine, not a person.
Sure, that might have sense, because it's a really easy transaction, and it might be really fast the machine, while a person
Yes
The person is making money by hour and there might be benefits
Yes
If you pay, $10 per hour in the work
None
And the company has some benefits. Healthcare and things like that

Yes, right?
With clothes, yeah. You know what I mean? Sometimes you live a love-hate situation Optional Comments:

But washing by hand, I can do this with everything, while I think that my liking for the television and the washing machine I think would win.
No, I do it by hand. all the colored clothes I wash here at home. I sometimes wash the white clothes here
I give the rest to the laundromat.
You have a big space because on the other hand none.
For me to be
A house has to be

Yes, is not mandatory to talk about the topics that they put

A little of everything, there are many Argentinians, it hasn't been long that I studied here
Yes
It's been a year
Me it's been six months
Six months, but there are many Argentinians
Yes, a bunch, and what do you think of the topic?
There's a bunch of, I didn't hear the instruction to is I think that is of living in the city or no?
Yes, what do you prefer to in in city or outskirts?
No, I would prefer in the outskirts I mean, in the like that kind of the country, a place like that with a lot of nature, a place where the women can't be tempted and spend too much money
What are the advantages of living in the outskirts for you?
That women are super spenders and, and for me to have peace, be able to dedicate myself to the more essential things in life, be able to dedicate myself to the family, be calm
I don't know, I think that the contact with nature is essential
And, why wouldn't you like to live in the city?
I feel one gets into a rhythm in that we also come from Buenos Aires and Buenos Aires is much more
I prefer smaller city. This is small city in comparison to Buenos Aires, I feel much better.
Despite being a bit far from the family. I think that in a city the size of Bueno Aires, there's a madness of people
I was living in Palermo which was a nice neighborhood, but I felt a pressure in my head that I didn't like. There's something I don't like about that.
I don't know how to define it, but, but, I like it more to have a house, have my feet on the ground, be able to go out and step on the grass
I don't know, simple things
In this country you think that living in the outskirts is compatible with a peaceful life, because I mean, you have to travel every day probably until
Until downtown to work, if you work downtown or in Penn in this case, or
Yes, and i think that yeah, because you can have a car or you can use the, public transportation, for the week, it's not bad
You can go in train or in subway, i don't think it's bad, i think that, it's a good option
But Philadelphia is also a very special city in that way because
That's true.
They say, like not every, not every city in the United States have that public transportation availability
Yes, that's true, besides, Philadelphia is little, you can walk a lot
And how long do you plan to stay here?
Around two or three years, three years i think, i came to do a post-doc so, you never know, I'm with my wife
Sure, yesterday I spoke to a guy from New York that asked me if I knew a girl that worked in Penn
Yes?
That's argentinian, but i don't know who he was talking about, because, i, the guy is from Panama
Right, and what girl was that?
But, he did not know the name.
It's just that there are a few argentinians. I don't know if it's good or bad but there are a lot.
I know, he told me she worked in Penn and lived in Philadelphia
None
He couldn't remember her name
Yes, no, i don't know
I'm happy living in, living in downtown
Yes, do you like it?
Yes, it is not as an aggressive city as Buenos Aires.
I feel very good over here.  The city is very nice.
Where do you live?
I live near South Philly
Me too
Really? Do you know Paula Stein?
Paula, yes.
She lives near my house, not too far away.
Yes, I know her.
Yes but I thought it was a comparison of another area.
Of course.
There are things to do, maybe during the night time would be safer.
Yes
I feel comfortable here, if it wasn't for the two little mice
It is full of mice in Philadelphia
It must be something of philadelphia, Because there are Many in Landlord too
Of course
So for how long do you want to be here?
Maybe three years.
Something like this like three years. Are you single, are you married?
I don't know, yes more I'm with my husband, that in reality we both came and, and well
None
He came to work, but the truth is that he's not working a lot
No?
Yes the truth is in the end I'm working now
Yes yeah and it's a big of justice, every time each
Yes, and everything was planned, but the truth is that
But neither
I'm the one who
Yes?
Earns more, and this, no?
How strange, in general it's always the men, no? those who
Yes but no
Not in your case
No but, we're happy all the same, we like the city
Yes
Yes the truth is we take advantage when there's a study so, so also
That you can study
That also lets us do something more this thing
That can, of course, participate, right? And I saw one of Viagra that was very funny because they gave you double the normal dose and you could
And they made you vision studies for five months or so, it was good money, like the mexiacns say, it was about one thousand eight hundred dollars
Figure
So
There are studies for anything you want, but I wouldn't inject anything. For instance
No?
These things, I don't like, medicating and so
But well, if something happens to you they give the money to your husband so, nothing it was just a joke
None
No, right, injecting stuff.
And
No, I'd rather not
Did you make many calls with this one already?
I think about fifteen, more or less
None
Now I am, I am calling from another phone because, I don't know if you received the email, but if you make five calls from different phones they give you, how you call it? they give you more money, they give you five more dollars
Yes
Now I am calling from the office
Yes, they called me, they sent me an email with that
Yes, you can call from five different numbers and you get fifty dollars more.
Sure
So that, yes good
That's good, everyone I know, who speaks Spanish, I'm telling them
Yes? Do you know many Spanish speakers?
Yes a lot
A lot?
Yes, many are engaging in this
Yes, yes, I don't know if they will continually do Fisher studies and
Yes
I saw that there are other languages
Yes, I don't know, in truth I don't know, but it's interesting.
It's a very interesting idea, true that
Two times the topic of the day repeated and well
To me too but since you speak with different people in general
And at times yeah
It's good because you exchange opinions and see
Yes
See how they think
Yes there are times when it's interesting to hear other opinions
A Venezuelan and this, it's nice, really nice
Yes, the Venezuelans have an accent very
From Los Angeles yes, I love, I love the Venezuelan girls
Yes very, men like them a lot, especially, it seems to me that the Argeninians in particular
Yes, no, but, yes, women like that drive men crazy, you imagine that you are talking with Catalin Fulobo but my God what a beautiful accent they have
Yes.
There are other accents that I don't like too much, but that Venezuelan girl's, or the accent of the Venezuelan girls in general is very pretty, the Cuban one also
Yes and the Panamanian is very similar to the Cuban I think
You think?
Yes, I find it very similar
I mix those up a lot, the Cuban
And, Panamanian also a lot, and I didn't know how they talked.
I can more or less distinguish the Cuban and Venezuelan, and then the Mexican but the rest, no, no, no, no, I find it hard
Sure
Honestly, do you have any plans for today?
And do some Christmas shopping, yes
Ah, really?  My God.
Yes, I feel like buying a few things, let's see
Your poor husband. Did you go with your husband?
Is like that, life's like that, one works to
That's true
To also pamper oneself, no?
Totally, yes, no
I think that it's part of, of, of everything
Exactly
No, and for me the truth that I
Lurdes.
Iliana.
Hello Iliana. Good evening.
How is it going, Lurdes? How are you?
Fine, thank God.  Looks likke I live in the city.  I love the city life.  The happiest day of my life for me was when...
I sold me car because I moved to the city and here the bus is very good. I live in New York.
You live in New York?
Yes.
And where did you live before?
Before I lived in Connecticut. In Hartford. And in the outskirts in a little town called New Britain. And to get anywhere
I had to drive. I needed my car. Not to go to the supermarket. I could walk.
Oh. Sure, I don't like those places for example. Everyone told me that Los Angeles is like that. Whatever is the city you have
What do you call it, go in car everywhere.
Where do you live? City in suburbs or what?
No I live in Boston.
Okay
In reality I lived in the city before. I'm Argentinian and lived in Buenos Aires and
How nice.
I moved over here,and I'm not used to i
Sure.
Boston seems quiet for me
Sure, compared with Buenos Aires
Sure, it's a quiet city, New York, not at all, is not a quiet city
Well, look at me. The convenience of having all that to my reach. No, having the supermarket near, the work near
The care of kids near, the doctor near, all the mail, I can walk, all it's near so
Knowing that I can take the train or the bus and get to any other neighborhood, and i arrive to a totally different neighborhood
Where I live there is a lot of variety of
Yes
Food of the ethnic variety, and a variety of services I really like
Yes, that's it, I also like it, I live on the outsides of the Downtown
None
And it keeps been the city, but I work Downtown, then I have everything there
That's nice
Yes, it's really nice, ,uckily
Do you think this the ideal place or you'll like to?
No
Okay
Not at all. I love everything. I love it because it's safe. I love the city because you can transport yourself without a car
None
And let's say, that's all good, But I don't really like the weather
No, this is cold.
Sure, no, his favorite his whole life. something a more difficult city, that but not, hot. I need heat and the beach, I realize.
Sure. I understand you perfectly. There are times when these snows fall and I say, Aye my God, each time in this country again.
Sure. you forget. The summer comes and it's all so nice you can walk in the city.
Sure.
You forget and after winter comes and look now
Yeah.
You remember that it was, you will suffer
Sure.
Above all the winters are long. Here it's until June.
Sure.
Cold.
Hey, And there in Boston it doesn't snow much, right?
Yes.
None
Yes, a lot and after it freezes. The floor and you slip and everything, it's all a mess.
Yes
You, where are you from?
I'm from Puerto Rico.
Where were you born?
From Puerto Rico, one of the questions was the ideal house of the ideal site to live, right?
Yes
And I think that I would like to live in one of the both extremes, I  have a house in the old San Juan
That even if it's not the great thing, like New York, but it's comfortable because it's all together
To have all in hand
Exactly, or live in the country with a farm and have a coffee plantations or some cattle, but
Everything that stays in the suburbs, the developments, of, all those of cars, none of them I like
Yes, sure
It would have to be one of those extremes, Totally urban or totally country like, right?
Yes for me, instead of the country a day in a beach cabin
None
Yes, I love it, so, I would be able to have a house in the beach and nothing else, only the sea, or a city, a big city sure
Where you have everything, walking and done
Look that
Everything else
The idea of the beach didn't come to my mind, but does no sound bad
No, with a house and a little bar for tourist, cocktails in the night, like being able to live and done
Sure it's done now that you told me that in Puerto Rico
Yes
The snake, oh,there are many people that comes visiting and they found out that, that there is almost none touristic development
So what he developed is really local and finished doing what you just described. They buy a
Sure.
They have a guest house, a little bar for the people who are visiting there and live the rest of their lives there in this dream that you just described.
They're really happy
Yes.
For example, look, I have experience. I was in Costa Rica. And there was an Argentinian family with three little kids who did this. And this is paradise.
But look at what happened. They were, the woman had a nail from the table in the eye.
No. Don't tell me.
Yes, and well, after they had to sell everything in Los Angeles, to operate on the woman and this and the other so
Everything to have a hospital
Aye, yes. No, because Imagine that there they didn't have anything, no
Sure, they didn't have anything. They had to go to
The center
The United States for the emergency that was all
None
Terrible. In the end it was a disgrace because I only knew that as happy and after I met someone who knew this happy family and they told me this tragedy, the truth that
Aye.
I don't know whether to because
It's not the rise of the fall.
Sure. No.
What a shame.
Yes, but well, everything everything is suspect. They know it all, you lose and you win a little.
Sure. Sure. It's not, definitely. Because here, for example, I like it a lot but the pollution is one thing I think my poor son
Will grow up with asthma since there's so much pollution, right?
Sure.
Since this a city.
Yes, yes,
Yes, like you say, everything has its pro and its con.
Sure. yes or the stress you have in a city.
That too.
That makes you age faster and let's say everything, well.
Sure, the cost of living is much more expensive.
They are all a bunch of sure.
You are making, for example, you make good money but everything goes to rent. The food is much more expensive.
Sure.
Not always do you find everything fresh.
What do you do there in New York?
Here I work in that public school Columbia
None
Teaching.
What do you do?
Giving classes to Masters students. And making investigations.
Wow. And what topic do you teach?
Well I work with prevention among youth. I also work with urbanization. That so, I study how the city helps and promotes health and
The way they contribute to our neighborhoods and all these things, and how they influence the health of other people.
Sure, how nice.
Here is the ideal place because I have a huge laboratory here in New York, no?
Yes, no, sure. I'm here
Where are you? In
Doing a post-doctorate in genetics at Tufts University
Aye how nice, how nice.
Yes.
Are you doing a lot of work in the laboratory?
Yes. Sure, exactly.
Okay
What happens is that a half hour is all automatized, I do, yes, it's not not so terrible, Before it was worse when it was bad, but now.
It's more automatizes so it's easier.
Aye how nice. How nice. I remember when I was working on my Bachelors at the University of Puerto Rico where I worked, I was doing
Yes.
Working in the laboratory of molecular genetics and my lab partner and I were the only ones who could insert piece of, ene, in a
That were manipulating
In a
I went, I jumping hopping because of the plate that we had prepared the things
Sure yes.
All the people like kind of cream like that. Us with the blue plate and well the only good experience that I have with genetic. Besides I'm a disaster with that.
You remember
Yes
Yes, no I more than anything I do like I amplify more, genes and ready. Is more automated.
That is, what type of investigation? What you are doing now
I'm like Pharmacogenetics. Is molecular epidemiology. I get populations, cases.
Okay
Controls. I analyze genes and variations in the genes and try to associate the
How interesting.
None
To the drug. You see that one also takes a
Okay, Sure.
And then I try to find different variations in the genes that are
That can explain the
That are the Sure, in what are good or bad respondent of the drug.
Okay. How interesting.
The truth is, luckily where I live has nothing to do with the beach and cocktails
Yes, good.
I tell you that when the experiment doesn't work, this more emphasizes the idea of the beach and cocktails
Aye all the same but look. What you have to do is, you have a little savings jar for vacations and every time an experiment goes well, you
Every time that the experiment turns out bad, you put two and this is like your vacation fund and such.
None
You see, so when your vacation time comes, above what you calculated it to be, when it's a really good snowfall
Yes.
You go to the beach with the
With cocktails.
With the cocktails yes above all.
Sure. yes, luckily right now I'm going next week to Miami, my brothers live there.
Yes, how nice.
Yes, it's a breath of fresh air. Yes. Sure.
Hello how are you?, my name is Paulo
Hello I'm Alicia
How are you, where are you from?
Hello, originally from Chile, but I'm in Atlanta
Yesterday I spoke with another Chilean
It must've been me, probably
None
It could have been me or it could have been another Chilean who lives in Idaho or so
In Georgia
Yes, I live in Georgia.
We talked yesterday and you told me your name is
Alicia
No, Alicia, no, no I spoke to one named, a girl named Paulina
Paulina, and where are you from?
From Argentina
Argentinian, but now you are, obviously
Ues, I'm here in Philidelphia
Yes, the times that, how amusing, is that I've also talked to an Argentinian in Philadelphia
Do you remember his name?
No, is that I'm bad for names but, studying in the university
You are studying ?
Yes
I know a few people studying there at a university.  Are you studying there?
No, I'm not doing anything, I'm doing like, things on my own, I was doing, I was working in the newspaper not long ago selling things
Good
So I'm like independent
With a micro entrepreneurship
Sure, something like that
How good.  I also do a little of everything, now this is ready.  This is my first year in Philadelphia and
Okay
I was in some jobs and now I'm in one cleaning some offices there,
Okay
To get through the winter a little. It's not very nice, but
Yes it's very cold, a lot of snow I imagine
Yes very cold, a lot of snow and I was working in painting, in construction and no, you can't work anymore
No yes right? because everything is outside, then it's too cold
Too cold and too many hours in construction no, the last days I was already coming almost frozen
Yes terrible although now well
None
So luckily here the, the climate is, is better than over there in Philadelphia?
Yes?
Yes I mean, because over there, here, even today it was hot, today it was like twenty, twenty five degrees
I can't believe you, I'm moving over there
Yes, it was sunny and everything here
Where did you tell me you were?, that I don't
In Atlanta, Georgia
In Atlanta, there is much better climate than here, here the climate is terrible.
Yes I can imagine, or
A terrible cold, and yes this week we are happy because there are no temperatures below zero, because this week we have everything one degree, two degrees
I think, Oh my God
So this week it's supposed to be nice well, obviously the firefighters
Listen and it's going to get worse before becoming a problem
Or January we have temperatures of ten degrees below zero, eight degrees below zero
Wow, how awful, no I would die I would die I can't, I couldn't
You couldn't.
Are you from Buenos Aires origin
There near Buenos Aires, Mar de Plata
Mar de Plata, how beautiful, also Uruguay
None
That's is on the way to Uruguay?
No, is not, if you go from Buenos Aires you would have to go to the south, to the side of Patagonia
Okay
It is more or less four-hundred kilometers to the Atlantic Coast.
Okay I mean, not so close either but also
Four or five hours from the capital of Buenos Aires
Okay, I already understood
None
No, what I was saying and, how's the climate there? The same, but I imagine is not as bad.
There's no snow or anything. There are never any temperatures below zero.
It could be the same as in Chile. The only time that I had terrible weather was when I was little and we lived in Punta Arena
I don't know if you can place it but it's the city more to the south of Chile
Yes
Is
Terrible, over there no
Yes, there was snow and all the pipes froze and
None
We had to go out, to look for snow to have water
Ah, how hard
Yes, no super terrible
How long have you been in Atlanta?
I'm here since two thousand
Quite a bit
Yes
Do you miss Chile or not?
Yes, me too. I ho back to Chile every time I can and spent all of 2003 there.
Nice, the whole year? how great
Yes
Yes, there's a lot of, of Chilean people here in the United States
It's not so interesting because they don't get together as much as other groups.
It's hard to have a Chilean party, for example, for the ten, for September eleventh there was a kind of patriotic party here in Atlanta
There's a population of five thousand Chileans in Atlanta, and only two hundred went. So, since
None
Yes, and they told me how if they had a Brazilian event, there would be ten thousand there
Yes
The, Chileans are more modest, I don't know how, you know like it's the same, in South America we have this reputation, and in a certain way it's true
Yes
We don't get together much, everyone does his own thing and that's it
Sure and I don't know how Argentinians are
No, Argentinians, at least here in Philadelphia we get together a lot
Yeah
Yes in fact all of my friends here, they are all Argentinean and some Mexican, Spanish too. We join with Spanish and Chilean often.
It is very different
Only one friend, I had a Chilean friend who was with us
None
But
None
Well, I don't know how it will be between them, honestly I don't know.
Sure, and it depends in this system, I have talked to two persons from Spain who are there for the
Yes
An awful lot of people from Philadelphia that I have talked to about it because that's where the progarm is actually from.
That here is what?
This program, the one why we are talking is from the university of Philadelphia
People connected here and
I have already talked to fifteen people from philadelphia
They connect you
Yes
Yes there are a lot, they gave me the mail too and I enrolled myself immediately, and yes there are many enrolled here in Philadelphia, talking about the program
Have you had many calls?
Yes, many what?
Have you been called many times?
Yes, is that I didn't hear, sorry, that if
Yes, no problem
Yes they have what? you said
If they have, called you many times to talk on this system
Yes okay, I already have twenty two I think
Very good, no this is my second
I like it
Talk, yes is very good yes, the truth is that I like it a lot
Yes
The truth is that it'ss very good to meet people and make some money
Yes sure and, I've always gotten to talk always with people from, to start with many Hispanics, I mean I've gotten to talk with Mexicans
With Spanish, with of everything, and also with people of many ages, I mean, I've gotten to talk with young people and with old people I even got to talk with
Excuse me that I'm trying to give directions ah and what is it called? and today I talked to a mother and her daughter and they lived in
Different states,
Yes
I talked with a lady named Rocio after I had spoken to her daughter. Then Rocio asked if I had talked with her daughter.
Chilean from Atlanta that was named Alicia and then she said yes I talked with her
None
Two days ago or something like that.
Ah, very good
Yes
What is the step?  Staying there in Atlanta to live or you don't know?
Yes I'm already set up here for a while
You are staying there already
Yes
None
In fact
We are seeing, we don't know what, we've been here a very short time and we'll see what happens in the future now
Sure
My husband is working and studying a litte here in the University of Penn.
Scholarship
Yes, he's working there and
Alright
And depending how it goes
None
In life, day to day we'll see if we decide for now everything is fine
How did you arrive to Philadelphia and was it by chance?
No, no, no, no, no, because my wife was looking to do the post-graduate somewhere
Yes, sure.
Of the United States and it presented here for the University of Penn and
And
We got in touch immediately and they sent him the okay
That's nice
We came here right away, yes.
Oh, that's good
Yes, she came with a job and all settled
Do you miss Argentina?
I don't but my wife does
No? yes, that's normal, for example
Yes, is it? yes
I came here with my family, mi mom and my brother, he's been fine and I'm the one that travels to Chile often
None
To visit, and I still have family over there
None
Really
You do miss it
So
Sure, we just got here too, were in Argentina about a month ago
A month ago
Fine but maybe she'd like to go back.
Sure
Miss a lot.
Yes is true, and also you can return to visit
When are we going to return?
Sure, maybe to, you have family there? to go visit
All the family is there
Good
No here it's just as two alone
Yes wow
It gets complicated
No wonder she misses it
I have my little nephews and we miss them. Over there with family is much easier, but we
From my family absolutely nobody is going to come over here so, we will be alone, we will work and next year for the end of the year we'll see if we go or not
Sure
As long as we can go, even oif it's once a year.
What, sorry
I say as long as we can go once a year
Yes that's why it's good, during the winter would be good like that you would be less cold because over there is summer now
Sure, yes,yes, that's what we were thinking
That's the fun thing
We thought about doing it, in January of next year. We'll go there and catch a bit of heat on the beach. We're saving now
In the dead of winter here
Sure, especially because here it's the worst
It's crushing, the winter here
Yes
Terrible, yes.
And do you live in a city or more in the suburbs, lets say?
No, I prefer to live in the city. Always. Yes.
Yes, no me too
Yes I lived for a while in a place that was pretty far from the city and I didn't like it at all, it's for more solitary people
Yes, right? Nothing more than, it's very boring.
I love living in cities, I don't like to go, yes, yes to the shops, the banks, the car.
Sure
Hello.
Good afternoon. I'm Lorena.
Hello. My name is Juan.
Where are you calling from?
From San Antonio.
We are quite close then, I'm calling from Spring Branch, it's about forty kilometers away from San Antonio.
We are quite close! I think we might be neighbors.
Really?
We might have came across each other in the street.
None
Without realizing it.
How's your nei
My neighborhood, it's that, it's a city. It's a mid-size city, it's quiet if you compare it with other cities, that's the truth.
As always, it has some dangerous areas but the quiet ones and the areas where people live and for other, it's quite stratified.
We decided to move to San Antonio which is the biggest urban center around here
Around the center of Texas, we moved fifty kilometers or thirty five miles away to the North because we were looking for something more rural
Less urbanized and that's what we like, exactly. We like green areas, the natural protected areas around the lakes.
All those things we've found them here. We just moved here, it hasn't been that long, since we moved here.
Hey, for what you are saying, it seems to me that you live in a recreational or holiday area, it seems to me that you can spend
Will it be a weekend there or a full vacation?
Well yes. That's it precisely, but only for the people who like this kind of contact with the nature, right? Because you know there are a lot
None
Who don't choose this kind of life because they like the big urban centers and it has nothing to do with the difficulties or not of natural lifestyle, right?
Exactly. It is not my case. I would love to have a place like the one you live in. But, the ideal place would also have a beach.
If it had more
No, well yes, beaches are something wonderful, right?
Exactly
How would be your ideal home? Thath was the question, the subject for today
Well, I think I would rather have a couple of houses. One house would be in the beach, with a view of the sea
With a very nice design. Maybe with a swimming-pool. But I would always like another house for vacations, to relax.
But another house that would be closer to some more movement, for instance in the city.  In an interesting city where I could
Combine both lifestyles. Some things in one place and then the other for a change. One single house might not be the most suitable - not the best thing
There is some need of changes, like when you take your vacations, right?
None
You go there on vacations and you would like to live there. But from other's experiences I know that
When you get to live in that place, after a month you're already fed up with it. Life becomes routine again, so changing from one
Lifestyle and city to another would make it nice again. Only one kind.. maybe would be better
Having a couple of them
Well, you must agree that we are talking about idyllic situations, right? Because you would be moving
Of course
In the daily life, it is not the most desirable thing. I donÂ´t know if you have a family but having a family with children that have relationships of
Friendship and schoolmates
Yes.
And activities and moving well that results to be complicated? However, I tell you
I say that in a case like summer vacations because they don't have school, you are going to stay away for two months.
Suddenly vacations here or there twelve days and you go and the kids are with their lives and when they grow up
I am no, Is like looking for other opportunities maybe on business, you make some in one place, you make another one in other place
Right?
Yes.
I donÂ´t know. You can invent something there.
I think that it depends a lot of the location that you chose for living.
Exactly.
The job opportunities, life opportunities or how close can your life style be in relation with the place you have chosen to live
Exactly. Maybe, I can tell you an example if you had both kinds of houses about thirty of fifty miles from distance
Yes, no.
Maybe is not so different.
It would be fantastic. Now.
None
The reality is that there are countries in which, you can find, for example, i am thinking in the beach, right? If you think in Mexico beaches maybe it is true that almost
Not urban places. There is a little town to join it with activities and the big city, but I think in the beaches in the United States.
Where i say, every port, or every little beach, it's a reason for great development, and all the usual consumerism options are present in the shopping
All the movie theaters, all of those things, right? Even if they're
Yes, indeed. That could be something... something... it's, interesting to keep in mind, right?, and i imagine that these kind of situations, for example
It's not the same to think about San Francisco, that has a beach and it's a city, right?
None
You can have both conveniences at all time, but in the end i bet it's a city, San Francisco, than a beach, i
I'm thinking more of a place, i don't know, maybe like Puerto Vallarta, right?
None
Well, you can be there for a while.  There are peak seasons, there are low seasons.  So you take advantage of the peak or low seasons, depending
Every time distances are getting smaller
Beach in Mexico, it's maybe three hours away by plane, you go and come back. Just in a day, easily. Or the same in Texas, if you're in San Antonio or
You have a business in Corpus, but you combine, like in the winter, the business in Corpus is not too strong, it can close down, what do i know, that's
There are idyllic situations.
Yeah
Yes
We take it, Yes, right now, sorry, they're talking to me here
In an idyllic situation, you wouldn't have to finish the project or it may not even be a real porject.
Stable, an ideal situation. Those would be the conditions, right? Well, for a man like that, right? Yeah, I would like to
Have that kind of alternatives. Combine something in which it's completely a holiday. On vacations, let's say, like a luxury, right?
None
No, quiet it bears much spending and things, related to consume.
None
I did what I want, when I want, in that place and that is all.
None
Is like in another place maybe is combined with the work. I say that because the same Sometimes to be doing only one activity
For a time it is a routine and it makes you tired and you must know what to do with You can or cannot have a work
Of course.
In the ideal place, right? You can go on a vacation while in the other side
Something of work
None
Maybe in that sense for example, an ideal situation would be, not only a location, but for example to have something you could
Routinely moves. For example, if you were a boat owner, to have that location and you go to that.
To that and that is all. You know a region and you pass through it.
Yes. But it sounds to me a lot more like a
Right? I miss the holidays.
To have a retired one life, right?
Yes. Yes. Honestly, yes. Well, it is a
Of course.
Opportunity? Every time they are not talking about vacations but a location and I say The closest to that would be to have a
House in a beach location and to relax
None
How about if you could have some business? In the beach of, or no?
Sure. That's always an option very
That you don't necessarily have to be there the whole time. Perhaps you could
Very feasible.
For examples, thousands, right? And then it goes very well
None
Today you dedicate yourself to see if you sell something
I'm going outside my house to talk about idyllic things.
No?
To the back part of my backyard and now I'm going to give the deers some food. I'm seeing that here is full of deers and so I'm going to give them a little bit of
No way.
Corn to the deers. That's the type of
Is Rudolph there?
Pardon?
Is Rudolph there too?
No.
Go Rudolph

A city, yes.
I like being born in Buenos Aires, I'm a city rat
You from Buenos Aires? It's Argentina, right?
Yes, I'm Argentinian.
None
I lived here since I was 9 years old, so I'm no longer Argentinean,
Yes
But
Well, I have been in New York for several years, I'm originally from Panama
None
All that from New York, but I like New York, the thing is that I'm not that used to New York
That sometimes, okay, we have to talk about, living in a city, living in the town, and yes
None

Yes
I live in New York.

Like being in a foreign country
Yes, Yes, yes, yes.
That street doesn't have
None
It doesn't have a name
None
It's
Yes
Which house? What's the house number? Street
You feel lost. it happened to us when we first moved from Los Angeles, we though everything was dark, the streets had no name, people knew the name of the street
Exactly, that's what I was trying to tell you, yes.
But we, that didn't live here, we had just arrived here, didn't, I mean, we had no idea where we were
You tell me that you come look for me, come visit and you can't find the, the street because it has no name and sometimes when you get home you know that
None
You get out of the car and you have to walk to that person's house because there are no numbers in the houses so there are things that, I don't know
Not only that, but
Oh?
It's like, in Manhattan everything is in the side, you want something, you walk two blocks and there you have it.
Yes, everything is close, exactly.
Everything is closed, easily reached.
Everything, exactly, if you need something you can go look for it and you find it.
Yes.
There are specialties here to, there are so many people
Yes
There are specialties, you can go and buy thing, that, that, that you wouldn't even imagine there is a, a store, a
None
There is a store for things you wouldn't
It's very concentrated, in Buenos Aires too. If you want a special button, you go to the House of Buttons
Yeah
It has 5 stories and they only make buttons
Yeah
And they have thousands of buttons, but if you see they don't have a button you like, you go and talk to the designer, and they will design the button you want
It's ridiculous
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Buenos Aires is a huge city
None
It's like New York but it's absolutely huge, sometimes you feel like you're traveling.
None
Constantly
New York is not so big because of people's concentration in New York because
No, sure
People from New York are going upwards, they're making, one on top of the other.
Yes, really concentrated everything
All buildings, all it's really concentrates, exactly, for being the more populated, from some countries in america, mexico
None
Mexico City
Yes
Which is also Mexico's capital
Yes
Do you understand? The reason is because Mexico, is where Mexico city is, if you lived in Argentina, an Argentinian city
None
There are not many cities in Argentina
Yes
In Mexico there is a major city, Mexico City
The rest are towns
A country with only a city.
None
It has to be big
Yes
Because if you only have one
Yes, that's true
In New York city, when you are in the Unites States there are many cities, cities and the
I like, I like being, I like going to the mountains here in North Carolina. I'd like to have a hut, a place where I can escape to form time to time
Exactly, because I was also thinking of retiring already and I had this surprise. No, I know that, I had an Argentinean friend
None
That would talked to me about. Are we accountants?
None
And when he told me that, that in Argentina some time ago, there was a profession where people watched the inflation, right?
None
Go to the shops in Buenos Aires and change the prices every two weeks
Yes
He says that if you don't buy now, and go back after three weeks, forget it!
No, that's true, that's true
Yes, and he says that is a profession, people who have specialized in that, and I said
Also, there were people in the times when everything was so, when they gave such a big interest on money
Yes, from
They called it doing the bicycle, you bought one hundred dollars when the dollar was low and trhen you sold them when it was high and put it in the bank to get the, the
Tax
You took it out and called it doing the bicycle because the guys went from bank to bank within the city area
None
They called it the bicycle. And what do you do? I do the bicycle
But I remember that in Nicaragua I had the
None
In the banks in Nicaragua we have sixty and, sixty five percent interest in the money
Yes.
Many businesses don't make sixty five percent earnings.
Yes.
The thing is that many people would hear it, hear that, and I would laugh with him, because many Latins would hear that and said that yes
You buy currency from Nicaragua they give you and you sell it in the bank, they give you sixty five percent. But the inflation
Sure.
Is one hundred percent, so you lost
You lost, you always lose
Yes, so you lose, right?
And you are from there in Manhattan. Where do you live, in an apartment?
Yes, that I live in a house and I thought sometimes of moving from New York, because I have a little business that I'm doing here now, and perhaps the business will take off.
None
Because the opportunity, the opportunity in New York is very big also, understand?
Yes.
You can find a lot of things to make money, right
Yes.
If there's this or that and look, the people from New York, what can I tell you? I remember twenty five or thirty years before, when it was only
Puerto Ricans and Dominicans.
None
Now, we call the people from Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, 'chorritos', 'chorritos', right?
Yes. Yes, from all these places.
That are of mixed blood, you see.
None
Oh, half-breeds here and 'chicanos' also, there used to be 'chicanos' in New York, they were from the West End
Yes, yes, yes
West, but now
Yes, I think that when I arrived to the United States, and we lived in New York, there were not Mexicans, they were all Dominicans or Puerto Ricans
Yes, now there are more 'chicanos' than Puerto Ricans in New York. And now
They didn't tell you the blacks are not the minority
Yes
Hispanics are much more  than blacks in the United States
There are little, sometimes  there are less
They are ahead now, they are ahead
Because the Hispanics are ahead now
Yes, they are ahead, because in New York, there are 'chicanos', there are Incas from Peru who play music in the
None
Their music is a little
Oh, yes, the collars they sell
With the
Yes, flutes and things
With the flutes, yes but that music is how do you say? too melodic.
Yes.
Sometimes you got to put rhythm, cause now a day everything has rhythm and everything is faster and all that
None
Now rap is in the Latin songs you hear.
Yes.
Rap like the regueton.
Is in all of them now.
I was talking to a lady from Spain and she told me that all of the clubs and bars in Spain play the regueton.
Mhh.
Yes. How do you know?
Yes.
That is the one it has the influence here in New York, how can I put it, here in New York there is
You can find people from everywhere, from Argentina, to Chile,  there's two people in my house, and chicanos. There's people from all over the world, from everywhere and Spain.
Yes
And so Latin people, well we are talking about borders, right the Mexican borders.
Yes
There, like how the come, how they come over here and.
And more and more are coming
What they have to do to come here, and sometimes they die, there's people that... because they have a desert, right?, a desert
None
They die, what a terrible thing. But if all the Latinos could come to the United States, they should leave. Not all of them, but most of them, come to the United States.
Yes, no, it's true, because we all have TV's and we all see the things that are here, on TV, and we all want to do that
And
How will you buy that if you don't have any money? You have to go to the country where you can work and make a lot of money.
Yes
Many times, the immigrants believe that they're going to come here to work and then they're going to come back
And, they are
With all that money
No
What they don't think about is that, the culture swallows you, you start spending, you start having debts and you don't get out anymore
No, the thing with the culture is you change
Yes
When I get there you'll eat less and use less.  Look, I'm here, there are some chicanos here that have snak- , how do you say it?
What do you call them?
Right
Those are the sneakers you use for sports.
Yes
The ones that cost $100
Yes.
You see a Mexican that has eighty dollars blue jeans
Yes.
In their country they can get dressed for a year with eighty dollars.
Yes, that is true, that is true.
But the thing is that people
We, my family, we knew.
None
We know only one case of an Argentinian family that came here, to Los Angeles and didnÂ´t spent a cent, that people
None
No well is
And they lived, as they lived as poor people.  They ate right, but they kept all the money.
They came back to Argentina, exactly as they planned, after five years.
Hello
Hi, who's speaking?
Hello, Manuel is speaking. I'm in Orlando, Florida. Where are you?
Hi Nicolas' speaking, I'm in the city of Philadelphia
Very good. Hi Nicolas, how are you?
Hi Manuel, how are doing fine?
Fine
Sorry, I didn't hear you too where, where are you calling from?
From Orlando in Florida
Orlando, the heat very pleasant now in December, right?
Well not so much, but yes, I know that it's much more than there in the north
I'm already freezing here
Yes, well look that. Like we heard the topic of the day precisely spoke of that.
None
So then I tell you well, allow me to start, if you don't mind
None
I lived in New York
None
For seven or eight years
None
I liked the city very much, the environment, the cultural life is wonderful but the weather factor doesn't help me
None
There Identified a determinant factor for the place where I should live which is mild weather, or hot
Okay
The climate matters a lot
None
Number one the matter of the landscape two and of course also that that, it doesn't really have to do with, with the housing in itself
None
But it's important the type of city where you can develop according to your profession, or or, whatever you are looking for, in fact well then here let's say that,
I am in that sense, a little better that in the north
None
Without recognizing that there, in New York, specifically, there's a an incredible way of life, especially in the area
Social and cultural
None
Tell me about yourself
Well I'm from Mexico City, and I've been living three, four months in Philadelphia, so then is not something that you say
Yes
That I'm used to this type of climate, so then now I'm just recently, getting also a climate
Yes, very very little
In Mexico, you'll never see snow during the year, except in the mountains.
Of which city, I'm sorry, do you live in?
In Mexico City, it's the capital
Oh, fine, yes
This to me, it was a huge change because of the cold, the cold, overnight, I mean, one day we woke up and we were below zero
It was a drastic change, and I'm still not used to it.
Sure
The cold weather, it's been hard for me, I have a lot of work and since I like warm weather better than the cold, so, to me, weather is a very very very important
It took some time and I know that I will get used to it but right now I do miss the warm weather of Mexico.
Sure
This, yes, that could influence my decision regarding the place
Yes
In Mexico I was used to living in the city, it's huge, right, no? Mexico is huge and you have so much things to do
Yes
So, when I first arrived in Philadelphia, lots of people told me that Philadelphia was the fifth biggest city in the United States, but still, I do feel the change, right? the size of the city
Yes
None
Yes
Since I live in big cities, no, no, I don't actually know a lot of small cities or anything, to me, small cities are fine, and we often visit New York, so there's a difference between Philadelphia and New York
But, I honestly think they are similar, I like them, I like the warm weather.
Sure, both are
A big city for me is indispensable
In the introduction it talked of the dichotomy, let's call it city-country. What do you think, city
None
Or country, where would you live better?
Between a city and what
The country?
I think that in the city because in Mexico, my dad lives in a is not, is not the city but a town a little bit far from the city, and he basically lives like that in the country
Yes
Is very pleasant and all, but sometimes, like that's limited a lot right? the activities, things to do unless you have a lot of ingenuity, right?
And have a lot of creativity to manage, but, essentially for me, for example, it limits me a lot
Yes, yes
The activities I can do in the country; in a place far from the city
Also I don't go to the limit of , you know what. I will never live in the country, because I find it very nice, also living there, it becomes something also indispensable
None
The pollution of Mexico City, is so brutal, that is important getting out of the city every now and then.
Yes, I suppose
The country for me is an option, but not to live in every day of the week.
Look that for me in this case I would try to combine both things as much as possible and that can be achieved
None
There are many sectors on the outskirts of big cities. In some ways they combine those two factors.
But many of the country things can be enjoyed
Sure, like living, like living outside, in the outskirts of the city
Yes, yes. I am from Colombia, in my country its is called the 'leaks' of the city
OK
It's exactly the outskirts, the place where the urban area ends up, and begins the rural area, but not too far being yet
Yes, that is an option, you have the city on one side, with the urban lifestyle, you can live like in the city
It happens often that you may have some emergency, and being far from the city is like a kick in the ass,
In the situation you are putting me now, you are close to the city but also, as I told you have the calm of not living inside the city
Yes, I also think it's a good choice already
Right, this makes it possible to have more green areas.
Damn right
Yes, even, according to your taste or interest, some kind of orchard or vegetable garden, because many people like to cultivate
None
Or gardens, that's what obviously you can't have in an apartment
None
For instance, it's also much easier having several animals, not just one
None
That would be nice, in my case, I would pay for that, I wish some day I'll make it, but, however I am quite adaptable, whether it is the country or the city
Whatever it is, I'll manage to enjoy it.
None
Yes, that's it, that's the good thing about it, if you have a problem there, a health problem, which is exactly what happened to me in New York, well, there are lots of
You are happy in that city
You have to run because that's what got me out of there, it wasn't because I didn't like the city, it was that I couldn't stand the cold and I was getting sick of it
Really
None
Yes, I hope that this time that doesn't happen to me in about six months because I haven't been here during the winter, people say that winter months are January and February
Yes
I don't want to think about how cold it'll be here in January and February
No, it might be,
I might feel better, right?
You might, if it doesn't really hit you that hard, you get used to it, in fact, many people like the cold, they like the
Weather seasons
None
So you know, every organism is different
That's true
About the housing itself, the one of your dreams that they said, how would you like it to be?
The one of
Two stories? wooden floors, what do I know! crystal
The construction?
Yes
Well, I don't know, to me that, I don't know, I find it surprising that most of the buildings here are so shoddy, it isn't even a wall, it is like a
Like a drywall
No, the inside, here the insides are kind of cardboard, I don't know
Yes, I don't know what they are made of, but when the tornado appear they take every single house.
Architecture here is very simple, these kind of things for instance, you will never see them in Mexico, even the, even the poorest house is solid, right?
Made of cement not cardboard. Well, maybe cardboard but not this kind
Yes
So
It is a metal structure, the outside is kind of, yes, I am not exaggerating, it is a fine cardboard
Yes, but the house looks fine. you see the house from the outside and it looks fine but, a little push on the wall and you break it
Yes
You break it. I'm not used to that, I don't like it either.
It's just a not too strong building, right? obviously it must have its
Yes, but tell me
Like this one
I think it almost hung up. Did you choose living there? Or is there a particular city that calls to your attention?
No, I came here because I am studying
Yes
I came to study my degree. I'm studying the first semester, so this is not an option. I chose Philadelphia
But obviously I had a choice, right? And Philadelphia seemed very interesting. I had already came here before, but not to live in for a permanent
I liked the city very much, I liked it not being as big as New York, New York, because that was a
Tremendous chaos, so I liked it not being to big or too small, right? So
Yes
This city is fie to me, I don't live in Phiadelphia, but in the University
In the campus, right? that is
Very well.
That is outside the city, so I find this very pleasant, right now I am very, very, very comfortable, the only problem is the weather, I mean, by now
I hope I will get used soon
Yes, you'll get used to it, and have a good coat ready, because the winter is about to come.
I haven't used a coat in my whole life, it will be my first time
A good coat, thick, good gloves
Earflaps and all the stuff, absolutely
All that will be decisive when the time comes
Yes, I will have to get used to it, the worse is yet to come, but, I'll make it
Yes
No doubt about it.
Definitely, the most critical moment is after midnight as usual and by that time you should be home already.
Yes, but, for instance, here during the week, because I think it started snowing about three weeks ago, but it snowed already so the temperature is already under zero
The snow has frozen already, and it is permanent already. Whenever you open the door, there is snow
That's right, yes, it's inconvenient to move around, because when it's frozen you keep slipping all the time
There is ice, so it is quite unpleasant, right?
Yes
The good thing is that these last three days, the temperature raised a little, so the snow melted.
Oh, good
So, that's good, right? obviously I think that the temperature will go down again soon, but I hope it is not too soon
Yes.  What was your name again?
I am Nicolas
Nicolas
It was a pleasure talking with you
A pleasure having talked to you, have you done a lot of calls already?
I don't know, I don't count them but I have done some
I have done about ten
Well, I
Tamara
Hello my name is Ramon from Los Angeles From what?
Do you live in a city?
Yes, I live in the city
In the center?
Los Angeles, yes like five miles from the center, that area of Hollywood
And you live in Brookland, a city
Where do you live? In Masssachusetts?
It's a small city near Boston
None
Yes it's almost like a suburb, like a neighborhood, Have you ever been here?
Yes, once like thirty years ago, near like I have a friend in Melrose
It's not too far. And have you been living in Los Angeles a long time?
Yes, the majority of my life. I've lived here in Los Angeles like forty years

Ah, I have twenty two calls.
You're almost done
I got an electronic message in the middle of the week that they want me to call by phone, by another phone in addition to the
The numbers I've registered with them.
Yes
I don't know if this call can count for me
You are calling from the same phone.
Yes, is one of the same phone that normally that I use for that same reason that I don't know if that call
Yes
Is okay for me, but I talk with you,
Thank you very much. And do you live in an apartment or a house?
An apartment, and  I want a house like in two three years, I hope
Is it too expensive to buy houses in Los Angeles?
Yes, now the average is five hundred thousand
Five hundred thousand. Wow. And is there some sort of credit to pay?
Yes there are credit methods that a person can yes, since the majority of the people that buy houses are
They need to lend the money to buy.
Sure and already at this moment
Do you have a house or an apartment?
I now live in an apartment but is rented.
None
Are you the owner of the apartment you live in?
No I simply rent the apartment, there's like
And
The quality to live that's the topic
I think that yes in reality how one would like to live, I would like to live a little bit further from the city
None
On the other hand, I'm from Buenos Aires which is a very big city. I'm used to living in a very big city.
Oh yes, very interesting, And what's the population of Buenos Aires?
I think, the truth is I don't know exactly, but I imagine that it's like ten million, something like that, ten million yes, I mean
Two million, ten million is the biggest center of population in Argentina, right.
Yes in Argentina, but much less than what it can be in Mexico or in Sao Paulo. I don't know how many there are in Mexico, but in Sao Paulo there were about eighteen million.
None
But is the capital center, so to speak and the surroundings that
Yes
There are, there are many towns that are called, misery villas, I don't know if you've heard of it, like the favelas in Brazil.
Yes
They are the poor neighborhoods.
Yes
There, a lot of people gather that arrive for work from the interior of the country.
None
Here is not like that too much because no
Yes, well here in Los Angeles, the population I think
Are
Four million
Yes,
There are other areas, the county of Los Angeles and it has like ten million total.
And do you do something related to Hollywood, with the movies.
Yes, sometimes I make commercials.
Yes, you're an actor?
Yes, like for example I have a diabetes commercial.
Yes
Yes, a national commercial, and another commercial that I remember is of Verizon
Yes
Verizon but that commercial is only, I think in the South of like South West of the United States, yes
And you make them for the Latin public or for the American public?
And that one of Verizon is for the Lain public. The other one is general.
Yes, and do you use your own voice or do they dub it?
Yes the same voice
Is
Sometimes I participated in the Los Angeles opera
How nice
And sometimes plays.
Wow! In other words, you're a singer and actor.
Yes, both
Did you ever go to Broadway here in New York?
None
Yes
Do you have any interest in theater or what?
I'm not artistically talented. I'm a veterinarian.
A veterinarian very good
Yes that's why I would like the country a little bit more, because
None
Being near the cows, horses
Interesting, very interesting
Here where I live in Brookland they don't allow pets in the apartment.
None
The farther you are from the city, the more animals you can have.
Did you get your title here in the United States or in Argentina.
No, no, no I lived in Israel for ten years.
None
So I studied there in Israel, and I just moved a year ago to the United States.
None
So I am doing here revalidation
Do you want to live the rest of your life here in the United States or not
I have just come here, the truth is that it is too cold in Boston, I donÂ´t know how Los Angeles is, but
Yes, yes
It is difficult to live here with this cold
Maybe you would like Los Angeles. Half of the people from this place didn't born here in Los Angeles County.
Of course
Yes
But then I donÂ´t know if we are going to stay here. We are going to stay a long time here.
None
But for now we have to go through this winter and we have to stay here for three more years. And after this, we will see where we will go, I would like most to live in Europe.
Do you work in a private practice, or at the hospital?
Right now I am working in a hospital.
None
Yes on a fairly large hospital. with the animal protecting society.
None
Would you like more work in the movies?
The most work I have now is, I'm a mediator
None
Yes, I'd love to.  When people have a dispute I try to help them reach an agreement before they go to trial.
Yes
It's mostly about actors here in Los Angeles and most of them don't work in the movie industry.
Yes
They need another job, and that is normal.
What, do you have a manager?
I have a manager for the movies.
None
And, most of the actors, it's hard for them to have a manager, he's like a salesman.
Sure
Yes, but yesterday I was a host to Placido Dominigo and his wife. They had a
Yes, yes, yes
A dinner celebration with the Los Angeles opera. He's been here for 20 years.
Wow, and, is Los Angeles a nice city?
Yes, when the sky is blue, it's a beautiful blue.

None
She and I have a business, work on the weekends as clowns, and we just came from a part of being Elmo.
Who dressed up as an Elmo?

Well.
Because they demand it, yeah.
Oh, for the copyright and all that
Yes, yes, yes, exactly.

Yes.
Ay, how cool.
Just like I have a Barney but I call it the purple dinosaur. I watch Dora but, I don't like Dora.
I don't have the Dora head, I have a Spongebob I've dressed as Sponge Bob.
And what do you call Sponge Bob?
Yes.
And what do you call it?
Sponge Bob but no, I don't, I don't ,I don't advertise in the in the yellow pages my friend is the one that adverstize
None
She pays for the advertisement so I can give cards.
None
But they come out.  As she gets on the highway, I haven't gotten into the highway.  I nearer.  If they are near her, I do it.
If you're close to your house you go in the subway dressed as Elmo.
No, but I'm crazy, I dress up like that, on the street, I like it
Really.
I like right now I have a Santa Claus hat, and I've been through the whole street that the ball bounces up and down.

None
None
And so, what was I going to tell you? I went with an old one, I have an old one that's a puppet.
And I say that it's my husband. And who feels and doesn't answer me. And doesn't ask me what it's for. I do it to everyone, people laugh, everyone thinks that I'm crazy.
Aye, how cool, so you're really
Yes.
You're really funny and smiley, okay.
Yes. I have a friend, she's a clown, but my friend doesn't dance with them, I like to dance and play, I do it really differently than her.
I like to do activities with the kids
Yes, because the kids are those who want to jump and
Pe-Exactly.
Paint and dance and that's how they're happy
Exactly, but she does a li-ah, like now, the party that we went to I was jumping with them, and she told me that they had to stay quiet because if not
Each time I have a party they will expect the same
None
Yes, because I like to dance.
Hey Gloria, and how did you get into this call?
I applied like one or two years ago on the internet through money and shopping
None
One that I belong to and they sent me this then, I did it last year, it was very different I mean, this year is, speaking in Spanish
Last year how was it?
You had to call from different cells.
Yeah, they did that one too?
Yes.
That, now, yeah, I don't know if you got the email in which you have to make five more calls
None
FROM FIVE DIFFERENT PHONES AND
None
They send you fifty dollars more.
Yes.
None
I didn't see my email
Yes, you have to. For example, it can be your cell, your husband's cell, the cell of a friend - five different ones.
Yes, I had.
Then
I got like a three hundred dollars last time
Really?  And how long did they take after you finished, to send the money?
About eight weeks
Aye, my god, two months? Well.
No, don't count on the money, if it comes. When it comes it's a gift
It's good that you told me, i was thinking my check would come in the end.
No, they take it very, and if you didn't send the tax form
None
They won't send it to you.
Why not?
You have to send a form that they, they demand
Yes, right now I'll print and send it
Yes you have to send it or they won't send you anything.
And.
Â¿And is this the first call you're doing or have you done a few?
No, I think that I've gotten about ten.
None
Ten calls, this, and so it's good, more or less the beginning, the first time it took forever, but after I learned that we could talk about anything
None
It wasn't so difficult.
Oh, really? We can talk about anything?
Yes.
None
No, at most you can speak of, do you know my friend is the director
Yeah
Of the program
Okay.
Then she's the one who talked to me and said hey, Liliana, because she just, she's been here for a little while, and said, why don't you sign up? It's very easy. I don't know how much
Yeah
That's why I signed up, then the first time.
Yeah
It felt like an eternity because we were talking about the United States in the world and God know what
Yeah.
I was talking to a very old gentleman, who was driving the conversation, and I didn't know what to say.
None
Then i talk to my friend, and I tell her, Hey, those  12 minutes felt like an eternity, I didn't know what to say to this man because he sounded very old and
I'm very young and I don't have a lot of information
Yeah
And she says no, she says donÂ´t worry, you can talk about anything you want
Okay
The only thing you have to do, you have to speak in spanish, but you can talk about anything you want, and I was, OK
It's good then.
Yes, and then
Yes, one day I got a man and it was very hard, but he started talking and I didn't understand him
None
He spoke a horrible Spanish and I couldn't understand it, but I went along and I talked about other things, about the subject I was supposed to talk about
I don't know I woul speak about anything
So
It was horrible, those twelve minutes seemed like one hour
I was the first time
I thought, oh my God
I do know about what is going on and so, but I don't know it so in depth
None
That man who didn't stop speaking, and, I felt so stupid
None
I told, I told my friend 'I can't do this' and she told me, just talk about whatever you feel like, don't worry
Your friend, the one who did the commercial, is the one who recorded the conversation
No, there was one before, right?
I talked to that girl, the one who did the, the introduction, because before there was a man, an American who, you didn't understand a word
Yes. Yes, that's what she told me. She told me before there was a person who spoke English so bad that nobody could understand a word, and then she talked
To the directors or whatever, and told them to change him
None
They changed him immediately, but she did not talk
None
She speaks perfect Spanish
Ok, yeah
She was the one who told me you have to change this, it's horrible, you can't understand a thing
And what kind of work do you do, are you a housewife?
Yes, I do nothing.
OK
I have my two and a half years old boy
Right
I take him to the library and other places when I am home with him.
Okay, right
To the museum, my husband works and two or three days a week i work at Gap
Right
On this mall, for hours is like ten hours a week
Okay
That's it. No, I don'No, t do anything else
None
Until he's a little older
None.
Good evening
Good evening. Yes, How are you? Whom am I speaking with?
Fine, How are you? I'm Marco.
With whom?
My name is Marco. And you?
Where are you calling from?
From Philadelphia.
How are you? You're speaking with George, from New York
George's speaking, How are you?
Fine, thanks. How are things with you?
I've been great,  What part of New York are you in?
Yes - I'm in Manhattan.
In Manhattan, yes.
In Harlem
That is coincidentally what the question is about
Yes.
The places where you live.
None
Did you move to Manhattan from a place less urban
No, urban just the same, from Bogota Colombia.
Well
Where are you from?
I grew up in Asuncion, Paraguay
Yes, Bogota is a very congested city, similar to New York.
Yeah.
The only thing, it doesn't have train.
Yeah. No, in
But, equally populated.
Asuncion is not, Asuncion is a city, it's a small city. I, in truth, being there
Yes.
You know many more people from the countryside. I have family that has a
Yes
An uncle of mine is from, he owns a sugar cane plantation.
Oh, wait a second, it's that I can't her.
Yes, yes
Hello. Is the city where you live a small city?
Yes.
Philadelphia. No?
Yes, I'm in Philadelphia now.
That is very similar, right? to Asuncion, with respect to size.
No, Asuncion is very small.
What?
Asuncion is small in comparison
Yes
Asuncion has
Pardon, pardon.
I think, about three hundred thousand people, yes.
Hi, I hardly hear you. Can you speak louder?
Oh, sorry. How about now? Do you hear me better?
Yes, I thought it was the cell phone but no, again, I can't hear you, now yes. So, the city, which is bigger?
Asuncion is very small. Asuncion is only three hundred thousand or four hundred thousand people
Yes
The so called Great Asuncion , is about one million people. But that basically means Asuncion plus five or six cities around it
Yes, I see.  Small towns annexed, and the place you live in, are you satisfied with it?  Would you like to move?
I am alright, downtown Philadelphia, in the
Yes
It can't be more downtown than that, basically
I see
It's like if I was in Manhattan, living in Battery Park. It would be something like that.
Yes, I see. Is it very crowded or noisy?
No, I don't. That's something I always liked of that city because I know, for instance, Buenos Aires
Yes
Some big cities where it is. It is noisy.
Yes
Vandalism? How do you call it? I don't know the word- crime?
None
Crime is something that
Yes, I see, the usual
It's something that here,
In big cities
Right. Usual things of big cities, including, unfortunately
Yes
Asuncion, although it's not a big city compared to
Yes
Compared to, but talking about crime and things like this it qualifies, let's say,
Would you rather move to a rural area?
I just moved here about one and a half years ago, more or less. Here downtown.
Yes
Before that I was not in the suburbs, but in a much quieter district
None.
Even more with the houses that have courtyards, back courtyard and front courtyard and grass
Yes.
Of this style, which is something I have always found very nice
Yes
Being here in the city, in the city downtown, I find it much better
None
I can walk to school, walk to my workplace
Yes
My husband also, he also walks to his workplace
Yes
I mean, the child goes to school that is right here, about four blocks away
None
Before he used to go to a daycare
Yes
That is across the street, in front of our Hauser, and everything is so near. One think we have realized, the big difference between being in the city or being in the suburbs, where
Is my wife's family, for instance. People walk from the door of their houses
Yes
To their car
Yes.
From the car they drive
Yes.
10 miles or 5 miles, where the parking lot is from their walk to the door.
Yes.
After that walk from the door to the car, and from there all the life is around the car.
Yeah.
While we are used to walking, when her family comes we will go in the car, there is no taxi near.
Yes.
There are tn blocks.
Yes.
Ten blocks, ten blocks is very near here, it is around the corner.
Yes,
While a person from the suburbs comes walking three blocks and almost has a stroke.
It is very far,
Yes, it's an issue of being used to it. We have a child, he is five now
Yes.
A year and a half ago, when he came to the city with us,
Sit in his seat, inside the car.
Yes.
Is that, now he walks a couple of blocks too
Of course.
In the beginning, he asking please lift me, no he walks and gets used to it. And now, he walks  ten blocks. That's little for him,
Conclusion, you are fixed, satisfied
I am very satisfied, with myself, I grew up
The ideal place
I grew up, as she did, in a place with a large courtyard. I grew up with a German Shepherd
Yes
I don't like the idea of having a dog
Yes
I don't like small dogs, and I don't like the idea of having a big dog at home, enclosed
That's not a good idea.
No, to me, although many people do. It is, apparently, here in the city, you see people walking
Walking their dogs, their Great Dane
Yes
Where are you keeping that Great Dane? I'd like to know That is something  it's like if there were courtyards around her
In which conditions does the animal live?
That is something that, I would like to
Yes
A couple babies more, we may be able to retire somewhere with a larger courtyard, somewhere I can
Sure
Playing mechanics with the automobile.
Yes.
We sold our car a year ago because we didnt like the idea of having a car
Yes.
It is so difficult, in a comparative way, as I say,in the city everything is so near.
Yes.
That way at least you feel.
Yes.
And, there where you are living,
No, I work far away. I had to take two trains.
None
Then, sometimes I am a computer programmer. Sometimes, I have to give maintenance very late at night, or something, and even when the train service is good, at night it is very
Very, it is not too good. right? Then,
Yeah.
I always, New York, you donÂ´t need a car because the train transport service is very good.
Yeah
In my country I was used to going out on weekends to eat, to go around the city.
Yes.
Then, I bought a car a year ago. I am tired of it, because the parking space is limited, I am always looking where to park, where, to fix schedules
Many tickets give me freedom of going from one place to another.
That is true.
Yes, I'd like to go to a smaller, quieter city
Something that is getting very interesting, now, it's something they're, city careshare, Philly Car Share, and things like that, you basically
A monthly amount around 100 dollars, I think.
None
And you pay, I think 15 cents per mile, or something like that, and basically, they lend you, letÂ´s say, youÂ´re renting
Really, but they give you a hybrid car.
None
They have certain points in the City. For example, here we have three points in a 3 or 4 block radius from our home.
No, I don't know about that.
You walk there
Yes
And they give you,  you an electronic key
None
The computer in the car
Yes
Names, schedules, you go to the car, you get in and use it
None
Your time ends, and you park it again where it should be
None
And you leave it there
It doesn't
Each person has an electronic key that, only in your time is when the car opens
Yes, really?
It comes with a card inside the car, so that you can fill it up with gas when you need to,
Interesting
Already everything included, and, I find that interesting. Because, the idea is to assign a car
None
When people come to visit , for example, they ask us
Yes.
Where is there a place to park? this is Philadelphia, there's no place to park
Yes, it is hard in the big cities.
If you want to find parking, stay out of the city. In the suburbs there are places to park. There are none here.
I remember
Hello, my name is Wendy.
Hello, good morning. MY name is Carolina.
And well the topic is where do you prefer to live?  In a city or outside of a city?
None
Is that right? So, where do you live?
I live in New York. And you?
I live in Arizona but I visited New York and I have friends in New York.
Oh, really? How nice.
Yes, I like New York but I can't live in New York because there are so many people
None
I'd like to have a car, but is very hard to have one in New York, too much traffic.
None
Phoenix the city is really big but there aren't that many people that it's impossible to drive and there's no subway system like in New York
People have to drive to work and
None
OTHER PLACES
Okay.
What do you prefer? To live in the city or outside of a city
For example, I like in New York. I already have more than three years living here
Yes.
So then what happens, see that I got a job in Midtown, Manhattan in the mere center of New York But I in the suburbs
Am working and I like it a lot.  I prefer it having to take the public transportation.
Yes.
Go to my job.
Yes, when I was there I also used the subway
Then, okay.
It was very easy going to the places
Sure.
Yes, in many cities, they don't have a good subway system
Sure.
That's why people have to drive that's why in Los Angeles the traffic is horrible, because everybody has to drive and
There's no subway system
None
OF BUS
None
None
Here with
How do you say it?
The transportation is very, I mean, one get to places better on the subway than the private car.
Yes
To me, the city is good to work in because during the workday, there are many
Shops, there are many things, and you can rest because you have the weekends, the suburbs, no?
Yes, exactly.
Excellent. I really like what they say would be the city or the place of your dreams, or the house of your dreams
Really, since I have my house, it's really comfortable, big, I feel really good here on the weekends, because everything, during the week, what could be done? Nothing.
You get back from, and you're tired, if you have some activity
None
You come
None
In the summer I use it a bit more because the day is a bit longer
So yes
Yes.
I would go to the city, but I have a lot to do at home, tend the garden and fix things around the house.
That really, like, for me, I find working in the city from Monday to Friday and the weekend to spend it in the
It's much more comfortable
Yes. In what part of New York do you live?
In Queens.
Yes, that's where my friend lives too
None
Yes, yes. I visited Queens. Yes.
None
Like me, I live outside the city of Phoenix, in a suburb.  It's called Tempe, that's where the university is.
None
I would rather live outside the city. My job is about ten minutes from home.
I don't have to go to Phoenix where the traffic is so heavy
None
I usually don't have traffic problems because my working hours are usually from seven in the evening to three in the morning.
I work in a bar
None
Yes, So it's fine to me
None
I enjoy living in a big city, but not too big
None
But I also prefer living on the outskirts
None
I won't have the problems of the big cities, that have big populations, right?
I see, overcrowded cities, right?
Yes. And Phoenix is
Study
A big city but not as big as New York or Los Angeles
None
Atlanta
Yea.
There's more people here who are arriving here.  It's also got a future.
Oh, yea?
There's still not really a big city like Atlanta or like that city, but now there's so many people that it's really hard to drive to places
Ok.
To do things you want to do.
Yea.
When I was in New York I took the subway everywhere and it was really easy to use.
Right.
I didn't want to, I didn't want to have a car there to live if I live in New York
Yea.
People drive, or I think the people drive crazy there. It's dangerous to have a car in New York.
Because I have, I'll tell you I feel really comfortable, my house, to go out on the weekends
Yes?
Yes, no. No, I've never had any problems, I hope I don't have any God willing, right?
Yea, it's because I think you're used to driving in New York because in my experience
Yea
To say the, the people stop in the street, for me it's strange, people here don't do that, they can't
You can't. Here, stop in.
None
The middle of the street to let someone out of the car but in New York, it's pretty common, yes, people are used to it
To some things but to me, it's not
Sure
Yes.
Well, not only that, I also believe that, for example, in the suburbs, the value of the homes is cheaper than in the city,
I see.
Are the prices high over there, for houses too?
Oh, well,
How is it? What's the value of homes over there, for example, in Fenix?
It depends on which part of town you want to live in, you can get a nice house for around fifty thousand
None
If you want to live far away from the city
None
You can buy a really big house for little money.
None
But, if you want to live close to the city you have to pay more, but all things are big around here, they are not
Like in New York or Chicago, most of the people here live in houses and not in apartments
I see,
Yes how are you in New York? Do you like living there a lot?
Yes?
Yes. I like it a lot to visit
Okay.
I have a lot of fun there and I like the food a lot
None
Yes, especially in Queens. My friends take me to Colombian and Ecuadorian restaurants.
Where are you from?
I'm in Phoenix Arizona
No, but where are you from?
I've spent most of my life in El Paso, Texas
None
Yes. I'm from the  United States.
Okay
Have you spent all your life in New York?
Pardon? Pardon?
Oh. Have you spent all your life in New York?
No, I'm from Peru.
Really?
I'm from Peru.
My mom visited Peru.
Really?
Like one two months ago
And did she like it?
I want to visit all the places in South America
Okay.
Yes, well Peru. And yes, one day I want
None

Backpacking yes.
Yes
Yes, to South America, yes.
Okay
My
Good afternoon. From New York. I'm John.
Good afternoon. Is Lurdes.
How is it going Lurdes? How are you?
Hello, how are you?
Fine, thanks. Where are you from?
I'm from Puerto Rico.
Oh, yes. How nice? And where do you live?
Here in New York.
We are neighbors
None
What do you think of today's topic?
I think that any type of assistance should be linked with the economic and educational development of the people that are receiving it.
The Assistance.
None
Assistance without help to get out of the situation, no.
None
It converts the assistance into a crutch that doesn't help the person grow.
Right yes.
It seems to me that assistance that's combined to for example studying, or to develop a career or for training
That is, significant for the person who's receiving the help well it could have, I think that it would make more sense.
Yes
And what do you think?
I think that we should be more like the systems in Europe.
None
Or in Canada. No, because I see that here.
None
They pay very little and there are many people who are older who are, are having a lot of difficulties.
Sure.
So
Sure.
It should be balanced in a system where a person is spending good money. They should receive a bit less.
Okay.
No? And if you're earning more, you should receive a bit more, because.
Sure.
It's really hard, it's really hard here.
No, definitely.
In New York, the system is. You're really pressed.
Sure.
No?
None
None
For the things that the system itself put into place, because, for example
Right.
For example, one of my coworkers has a friend that received help, her program was
In training, she had a job through a help program and when she finished her training, she got a
Well, we can't help you anymore so you should look for a job elsewhere.
Yes.
And this was after she had already developed. She had opened up a bank account - she was so happy and proud.
Of her work and all those things
Yes.
The same system that she was in, it, it
None
She was working at the agency she as placed
None
It didn't, I mean it didn't help her get a permanent job, right?
Right
They do give them help, but only to a certain point. But if there's no way to help them develop the
The type of jobs that a person is training on, it doesn't
Yes.
It's doesn't really helps them.
None
No?
Yes. I have, I just returned from traveling from
I don't know it
The wife of a friend I was talking to, had had ten operations.
Good grief.
In the foot. Imagine that, if the companies only pay eighty percent normally
Good grief.
He has had to pay twenty percent of ten operations.
Oh my God.
You can imagine that the poor man already doesn't know where to stand.
Sure,
He can't, then
Medicine is so expensive now
Yes, exactly
The medical care
The poor man doesn't even know what to do because is his wife and he has to do everything possible but also the money he already, already doesn't have any. He doesn't know what to do.
Sure
I think that he has to
And he doesn't qualify for any type of help?
What?
Doesn't qualify for help?
If one earns a little middle class right?
Yes.
Decent money, well then you never apply for anything.
TRUE
Sometimes is preferable to be that they push you to be poor
Exactly. True.
Right?
True.
And that's the problem that
True.
That like that and well. One. One likes to work and one wants to get ahead, but sometimes the systems force one. I stay where I am and I can keep on receiving.
Public Assistance and things that
Exactly.
It shouldn't be. We should do something so that people improve their situation.
That's an incentive instead of a right.
Yes, exactly. I don't know. To me it should really be how it is in Canada that everything is free no matter what
Over there is where I agree a lot with the health insurance universal system.
None
Is something that makes a lot of sense in Canada, the
None
The health is seen as a right.
None
Same as here the education is seen as a right, the public schools and etc.
None
Over there the health is seen as a right, no?
None
I think that the problem with this country is that the history of the development of the medical profession
None
Was very linked with what was the development like they did it as if it was a business, right?
Yes.
Then being seen more like a business than like a human right to receive access to the health, all the problems that area associated with
None
That if, the costs are very very high that if the treatment When when they seem instead of improving. instead of reducing the cost of
Of the services
None
The fact that the education in medicine is so expensive has made it
Yes.
That the medical care is treated more like a business than like a right that all people have.
Yes.
He received  the medical insurance.
Yes. No, I definitely agree, wait a second.
Yes.
Hello?
Yes.
Definitely, like this has become a store so they want to charge people every day the companies are offering
Less and they want to take more benefits from people.
Sure.
And they don't want to give these same people from transit.
None
This is quality, How could they retire at 55 when they want them to work until they are 72.
Yes
That and I think that they should come to a compromise, no?
Sure.
I think that it's been like this for many years well imagine if you get there and you retire and they say that you have to wait seven more years.
Aye, my God.
Wow. That's a lot.
I feel like crying just imagining it.
So we'll see if tomorrow we'll go to work or not.
None
This is another thing.
True that they're
Yes, Yes. It's night
Well yes, in Queens they started with the
Yes, with the adults
With the strike, no?
It already started in Queens.
Tomorrow everyone who has it will be close to the house. I don't have to walk a lot. So at least I will get there.
How nice. I work from home.  Tomorrow, we'll see if we last.  It can't last because imagine if we're in the middle of Christmas
Sure.
We have everyone visiting outside
Sure.
Everyone has tourists. This will be a disaster.
I think that's what's happening. The really bad experience that happened last time with the negotiations
Yes.
Was that the people of MPA didn't have money
None
And after the book appeared
None
Fixed
None
Anyone would be disappointed. You will be able to ask for more.
Yes, And also the people who, like us, are paying, and now they want to increase it, now in two thousand seven they want to increase it again.
They want to increase it again? How much will they increase it now?
Because they want to do a new building, and new offices and everything. That's not right, behind us who are the workers
Right
Let's wait and see. So, about medicine, I have also noticed that they are offering
Packs, right? I've seen them announced on TV
None
They cover you for the thirty or forty percent. You pay about twenty-nine dollars a month
None
And, they cover you for the forty percent. That is nothing because, if you ever end up in a hospital, you won't pay less than fifty.
If it is something serious it may be one hundred or two hundred thousand dollars
Sure
You are broke.
Sure
None
The will all go broke, or will be afraid of going to the hospital, because if they go and are found something serious, it will cost the wife
Yes, the man, the husband dies or something like this
Today yes.
While he was at the hospital, he leaves his wife with a debt of fifty thousand or a hundred thousand dollars, forget it
None.
We'll see what happens there.
None
None
Like to think more in those. Like, a human right,
Yes.
That everyone has the right to receive health care
Yes.
So we'll have a universal system of medical care?
None
When we have a universal system of medical care, prevention will be much more important and then we'll be able to
Yes.
For example, to avoid having to be in so many hospitals many people wait and avoid going to the doctor when they have something that bothers them
None
And when they finally go, then they cannot hold it any longer and they go to the doctor; they end up needing care more expensive than if they had gone in time
Exactly. I also agree with you on that is also
Right?
Part of what they have to do and I for example, I take care of myself. I go to the dentist constantly and I am happy because I go because I've gone and the dentist tells me, I am happy that you came to get this cleaning because
The other thing is, if not, the roots will get worse.
Sure. Exactly.
So you have to do the maintenance.
Sure.
Constantly because if not like like you say, if you go at the last minute, already when
Sure.
Betsy
Good evening my name is Marcos and you?
My name is Betsey. Fine thanks, and you?
Hello Betsey how are you? everything good happy holidays
How nice
Let's see your opinion about social assistance,
None
It said something in comparison to the European cities. And the truth is, I'm not very familiar with how the European cities have done it. From what I understand, several countries
None
None.
Yes sorry I put the the headphone on
None
For example, I know that England has a socialized medical system, a system that is
The system they use is socialist
None
Have you ever been have used economic assistance of the American social system being the welfare that they have here
No, because  I live in Canada
Okay
When i moved to Canada, I mean I'm originally from Salvador.
From where
I'm sorry?
Where are you from originally?
I'm from El Salvador. Yes.
Okay
In order for us to get some help, we had to apply for welfare.
I see
I think it's different in Canada that in the United States. I wouldn't know.
That's another country that I'm not familiar with. I don't know its system. I know the system we have here.
Car accident caused by another person who had been drinking
None
I also had a really bad accident, I was in coma for five days.
None
I was in intensive cares for a month
None
I remember that I had a bit of brain damage but thank God, I'm fine now
What can you do?
And my situation improved. I used the healthcare system, welfare/foreign that is available here in the United States.
None
I used it for about four or five months.
None
What I did when I went to apply to have assistance
None
It wasn't a very nice experience so to speak, the groups of the people that were there I went and I started to work soon again
I felt useless sitting at home not doing anything.
I can imagine
That bothered me, not doing anything
None
I started to work even before stopping the assistance which theoretically is illegal but I did it anyways like they say here under the table I was working
None
To get out of the system of social assistance
Offices of social assistance of the state tried several times to convince me that I didn't have to leave the system of social assistance
None
That I could stay receiving checks indefinitely
Really?
And what they were telling me, I really found it disgusting
None
I'm a person that always worked a lot too much even according to certain people
None
But and I see that and I know my job when I pay my taxes. I don't complain about paying my taxes I really don't complain
None
I grew up in Paraguay, South America
None
I know that here tax evasion always leave the state without the money to do the most basic things
None
While here we have for instance beautiful roads, we have for instance the social security system which is basically paid on the taxes of the citizens
None
I think it is something worthy, but I keep seeing people abuse the system every day
Sure, also here
Yes, they abuse the system, but I think the system is worth it despite those who abuse
None.
It is worth maintaining it because I for instance went back to the working world bounded
I see
But trying to go back - that kept, that maintained me. I didn't lose my apartment thanks to that and, of course, the help from my mom, but I had enough to pay for the food
None
I had enough for the basic things, even a medical insurance
Sure
Paid by the state which was wonderful for me at that moment, it came like fallen from heaven
None
Really, and that's something that is worth maintaining despite all those who abuse the system, right despite them is the right word
Sure, sure, right.
Correct and I believe that it is worth it and I know that in the, in other cities and in other countries they have different systems
The American system has a lots of mistakes, lets say, but it works.
None
And as they say, even when talking about stuff like democracy, it's a good system in theory but the American system is not the best one.
It's not a perfect system but so far, for what I can see, for what I know, it seems to me that it works or that
None
It's not the best one, because it doesn't work all the time, and it doesn't work as well as it should the whole time.
None
But it seems to me that it's the one that works the best and yes
I see,
You are from El Salvador, I grew up in Paraguay in South America and I was there when the dictatorship ended in eighty nine
None
THE DICTATORSHIP HAD BEEN THERE FOR THIRTY SIX YEARS AND THE COUNTRY WAS UNDER THE HANDS OF THIS DICTATOR GENERAL ALFREDO SSTROSSNER
I'd listen to it everyday, but like I said Paraguay system has a lot of
Social security but it's a beautiful idea the way it works here, everyone has health insurance provided by the state, they all have health insurance given by the State, they all have
Is it that way in Paraguay?
That's in paper, but
None
That's the idea
I see
In reality, it doesn't work so much like that. Basically the idea is that there is an
Really?
Issue there's a system that everybody automatically has medical insurance from the state for being a Paraguayan citizen
None
That's true, the problem for example is there's not enough money to pay half of the patients that go to the doctors.
None
My parents both are doctors where I know that system well
How nice
That dad, for example, works in the public hospital. What was the clinic hospital that was from the city
None
He worked there without without charging
The state pays him
The state would pay him what
None
Is the equivalent. I still remember that they would pay him one hundred seven thousand Guarani per month, was his monthly payment and one hundred twenty and seven thousand Guarani.
None
In that time with the change to the dollar
None
I think it was a total of approximately seventeen dollars
Seventeen?
Monthly that was what they paid dad driving in the, dad drove a
Wow
Mercedes
None
Would go to the clinic hospital
None
Several times per week to help neighbors and the state paid him as a doctor a little less than what his gas was
Okay.
That's to get there but all always did and is like I tell you is a system that exists but doesn't work the system here in the United States
Exists kind of works in several cases
None
While at the same time in several cases it doesn't work but like I said I think that up to now is a system that works a lot I had heard a lot of complains regarding the
Social medicine that the English use for example.
None
I know that in the Nordic countries they have taxes much more higher than the taxes here in the United States and those taxes but the people don't complain about that because in reality
They have free medicines and automatic health insurance from the state. There are several universities at least from the state
Silvia
Hello, How are you? Adrian's speaking from Toronto, Canada
Hello from Canada.
Yes, from Toronto.
I'm from Toronto, Indiana.  I was raised in Laredo, Texas, which is where I learned Spanish.  What country are you from?
I was born in Argentina.
Oh, excellent. I forgot what topic, that was that we were talking if they told you.
It was the health system or whatever, no but I have a question, you were born in Texas and were raised in Texas
None
BUT YOUR NATIVE LANGUAGE IS SPANISH.
Yes well we were raised with my grandmother who didn't let us speak a word in English. And, forcefully we learned Spanish.
Mexican right, my grandparents are, Mexicans, my parents were raised in Texas and, I was born in Indiana We are seven and, we all speak Spanish, second language
Grandmother taught us.
But, the school was in English.
Okay, yes.
When you went to the school it wasn't in Spanish
In Laredo we all spoke Spanish and didnt realize there were two languages.
It became difficult because I was five years old when we arrived there. I stayed until tenth grade. It was when grandmother helped us a lot
Already the topic,
And because of him you learned, do you know how to read and write in Spanish also?
Oh, yes - that, too. Right, it's more.
How did you learn?
She was very strict, Didn't allow English neither at home or in religion, she had us write and speak everything in Spanish
And it was out of necessity, not even asking for the bathroom
No, not the, the question that, it's something very common, right?, not only in Spanish
Right
At least all the immigrants I know that live here in Toronto, whatever the background they have - Spanish or
Or what ever, not English
Right
Children might speak their native language more or less well.
None
They can never read or write in their native language
Yes
That's why i asked you, because it's odd
Yes, because
I believe you're the first person I have listened to that, let's say, is from a second generation because
Yes, that's true
If the school you went to most of the time is what they consider your native language
Traditionally, if you went to school in the United States, they will consider
Yes.
English is your native language is, no, never Spanish
Ok. correct
That's why I asked you, because I know it's very hard. I don't have children.
Right
The
Extremely hard because that's how my classmates at school and work were. They couldn't communicate ,either written or read it.
And to us, a big task was the granny - she was a missioner. We would understand well but she made us write letters since she was very religious.
She had us read the bible every day
That's in Spanish
And, well, in Spanish
At least it wasn't in latin, but
The Bible, it was hard for us to be able to understand what it saying. I interepreted them, she asked us questions.
It's been a long time since my granny died at ninety eight years old. She was a stong lady
No, but the way she did it, she had to make you all take a seat
I thank her my
Yeah, dedicating two or three hours a day every day
Exactly, that was, she was like, we called her Hitler
Going to another school, you got out of school to go to another at home
Yeah, that's it. We appreciate it now. When it was happening to us, we didn't think so, we thought it was a horrible task
Torture, yes
Insurance tirture. Now I can communicate, I'm at my job a lot because they are always short. Well, I sell insurance of
Of health, of life, I'm an agent. And my company, are several, because I'm independent.
None
I travel the whole United States with a group of people that show benefits to the big employers; a big company has,
A need to show all the benefits that they get and we sit with them a whole week, for example, right now I'm in Louisiana.
In the Bayou, as it is called, there is a casino that has three thousand employees. We have been here a week and a half and it is like a vacation because there's
Well they give you massages there, I already won two hundred fifty dollars in the casino
You are lucky, that's good.
Yes, they pay our flight and already the hotel.
You have to explain to the employees how the system works.
Correct.
In other words you get the Latins
I get them a lot. They give me all the Latins. They get in line. And the only thing that makes me sad is that the person is very scared
He doesn't have papers and by giving the bad Social Security, they will get in trouble
The life insurance is free, they don't have to be present in the United states to be presented with it, and to obtain it.
Is anyway, a policy that they will pay in case the employee dies. and they already understanding, already want it.
No, I don't know how it works, here in Canada is totally different. But if you don't have a green card, Can you have private health insurance? That's what you are telling me.
Those are benefits of the green card here, since they buy the bad social securities to stay here and so they don't bother them.
And since they think that the jobs, if they realize that social security is bad, well
Okay. No, I was talking, the way that you say is bad.
Yes, they are afraid of being deported. Yes
Yes, that it's illegal, or yes okay. The
Correct, yes
See comments
Yes True. And they pay twenty five dollars an hour more for a person that speaks Spanish, then,
Ah, that's good.
Yes, it is where the rest pay them.
That you do talking through this crap of the university of Pennsylvania and I don't know what.
How do you like, Canada in contrast to the climate there in Argentina,
At this moment it must be minus ten degrees and it's windy, which must be some more, it must be almost twenty degrees of
Wow
Windchill.
NONE
I don't know the truth is it's a change.
I'm from Chicago, there there's thirteen inches of pure snow that has fallen, and here the people want to see the snow.
Well I get tired of it
No, my wife hates the snow.
There are pure Indians because they have reservations. It scared me because here they all look like me, or me like them
Red skin Indians, not Hindus.
Red skin.  Yes and I'm kind of yellow, okay?
What you mean with yellow, are you Chinese?
The person has olive skim. They have their own language.
Gives them their own nation, their own territory. It treats them differently. They respect them, and I heard an 83-year-old old man say yesterday, look, girl
In English, he told me, I was the boss around here, all the Indians used to work for me when I was twenty years old but look at me now, I work in the casino, who do you think is giving me my paycheck?
It all comes from Indian money, he said, who would have thought!
He was the Indian's boss.
He was the boss. Yes, he would order them to work, to pick the rice.
Burnt food.
It's Cajun in Spanish.
No Cajun
The translation is Cajon.
No, my wife would say that the food got burnt.
I see, well it's greasy it has, it weakens them physically, many of them have diabetes and it could be a real health issue because all their foods are greasy, fried.
Lots of rice, lots of bread, I once went to the store to buy some vegetables and I had to leave them because they all want to go eat out every day, they love it.
The alligator in Spanish.
The alligator.
Crocodile, isn't it?
It's not the crocodile, it's the alligator,
Alecaman.
Cayman
None
Caiman is the word. Cocodrille is crocodile. Alligator is caiman.
Aiman
Cayman -c a i m a n - cayman like
Oh Cayman.
Like Cayman Island something that
Oh, well, here there are a lot because in the bayou here, everyone.  And they are 12 feet, they're babies, they're small and
None
To prove that, it's true that it won't be possible. This one defended because, he has put her so that they eat her, those animals.
They throw her to the caymans.
Hi,
Hi who's speaking?
Leticia
Lety, this is Ines
It seemed to me that it was you Guacha
What do you think about today's topic?
I didn't want to say anything, but
I didn't hear either.
No, I knew it was you. This is a truchada
I was all nervous about whom I will end up talking with.
Is this you first call?
Yes, it is the first time, what will it be?
Really good.
Yes, I was dying of shame, who will I end up with! A person I know to break the ice
No mortal
That's good. Did they call you?
They called me, yes. I was about to call but they called me.
I went to the gym, I came back and I said that's strange that they didn't call and I will call myself
Yes, no, didn't they call Pablo?
No, but Pablo put down only weekends, because he now you see that he works in the afternoon
You're right
He talks on the weekends
Because when he arrives it already ended
Able, In reality is until twelve, so I figure that he could
The schedule
I'll tell him later because today I was noticing, since my activation arrived and I was looking at the details, I figure that he'll be able
Yes, how good that Mariano tells me when
None
Why don't you call Maria Ines and tell her to call now.
Like that you can talk,
LIKE WE TALK, I MEAN GET TO BY CHANCE
Besides, it's more exciting
Sure, that's why but I also don't  know. I heard you and said it's Maria Ines but I didn't bring myself to it
I realized it when you said, Who's speaking?
No, mortal
Have you talked to Mariano?
Yes, I mean, no
How funny.
I was calling and I mean nobody understood me they had me waiting a long time, because sometimes is a schedule
That sometimes yes, the other day Pablo was also a while to try to get
Sometimes they take long.  I said, I mean you call. I tell him to see if they pass
Sure
So
You guys have the cellular also
No yes, precisely yesterday we went to the faculty and I said I'll call from there to take advantage that I'm on another phone
There was no problem calling.
Then that's why
To get out of the line, you have to press the nine, no, there's no history, you call and is normal
No, no, no. Nothing happened. I dialed the number. See that they ask you for it
Yes,
I dialed that number fine
None
No.
Really good
No, not fatal. And the other day I talked from the cellular but not I want to talk.
You already have two outside calls,
Sure, I also really need something from the other cellular
None
So
Sure you already have several. Well, but since it's a one eight hundred you can really ask anyone for their cellular
You have, no because the minutes
Count
They count I think, yes, I think so.
No and we are killing ourselves
None
We have one phone for both of us, you see that you can't make more than one call per day Then , either I call, or he calls
It doesn't matter we both call with the same phone
Yes. There's no problem.
Is the same. No, there's no problem. No.
It must be by person
Is by code because you put the
Put your pin
Put your pin. Yes.
None
Yes, so there's no problem because of that No and also I said yes with the code, our code has the same phone no
Yes I was scared when I joined, since it was the same phone, but no.
No, me too. There was no problem because I suppose in reality, they are studying the language
The important thing is that they are two different people. Register how they talk.
Yes, the issue is talking, I figure I don't know
Yes,
Well, they're recording me and they don't pay me afterwards but
No, I don't think so because they give you a subject, but no, you can talk about anything you want
Yes
Yes
Sometimes you talk about the subject, but
But if you don't know you can start,
Not necessarily if you don't have a subject. What's your opinion?
Sure
Yes, it depends on the person you're with. The other day I spoke to a girl from Panama that wouldn't stop talking - she didn't let me talk
Right
I think she spoke the whole time
Thats funny
Yes, and then I talked to another that had already talked to the girl from Panama and he said that girl from Panama talks a lot, and I said I couldn't say a word when I spoke to her.
I sent Pablo so he can show up on time.
Yes
At any time, i don't know if he's going to sign up, but we sent the mail
That's hilarious
Hilarious, well, we all know each other.
Yes, yes, besides, this is the time at which i call so
Yes and
Yes, this is generally about the time when we always speak.
Sure,
Well, I was called today but if I hadn't I was going to call them in a short bit
Yes, until twelve o'clock, isn't it?
No, until ten o'clock
Until ten o'clock
Yes, I think it's until ten o'clock
Pablo is not going to get here because he comes back around ten thirty o'clock
No, he won't be here on time, you are right, not during the week becuase I think during the week it's from five or six PM
None
No.
Well, they can call him during the weekends, what can you do
Yes
The last one, he'll take whatever he can
Yes,
Yes, and some news
What news are you thinking
We recently saw each other right? Did Pablo leave today, did you see her?
Yes, no, he left.
He left today the life, the last time, he leaves tomorrow
No, yes, no, I mean I didn't see her today, no, no, no
None
No, the one I came across was Estuar.
None
I told him that we can have lunch of of these days
Yes,
Because in reality, they still have my cake mold and they never gave it to me and I never also went by to get it
You want it
I also wanted to give them a card and I think that is easier to go to your house or you come to mine
But at the end, nothing happened, where he always has lunch: in the laboratory
No.he I don't know, before he had lunch, it seems he had lunch in the laboratory, he always ate in
Sure, but with Lucero
He said it was too expensive, so it wasn't very clear where he had lunch.
None
NO, I eat in the laboratory almost always or sometimes I come here to the house
Sure, but you always take food
No, what happens is that I sometimes buy it and take it up to the lab.
And where do you buy it?
I buy it there, in Wawa or if not also in the Chinese, that's next to it there.
None
But, generally I take, I try not to take money to spend
I don't know if it's right, but the Chinese guy is selling a tastier food i swear to you thats were we eat
I get sick of the food
It isn't attractive at all
No, it's good, do you know what's going to the wawa?, a
I can fall asleep
It breaks you. The only thing I can buy in wawa are salads that, well, they're not tasty, but they're salads
Yes
Those things are delicious but they'll kill you.
Yes, you can't eat there everyday, it's obvious, right?
I prefer to get bored with a cheap sandwich
Sure
Yeah. a sandwich, an apple, and i go at night like very
It's just, i don't know, I'm telling you, i go to the Abranson, i look at the stuff and it's not attractive to me
Yes
The only thing that's attractive to me sometimes, that's true, are the salads or the soup, the soup does
None
The salads don't have much mystery.
I only went there once and i liked it
Yes. I never eat because it's not attractive. If I said I'm suffering because I see so many good things
Buy it
Maybe one day one meal may tempt me. I won't say never, but it is not only that it doesn't tempt you, but that you realize that they are
Very caloric, and that they are not good to eat. You can't eat that everyday because
Yes, you'll burst like a toad
Yes
The time I went there, there were many of such things, I ended up buying a salad and a soup because I thought everything was like too much, like if I go to work after eating that I'll fall asleep
Yes, that's it, I can't eat that day after day.
No I can't it makes me sleep and get fatter.
Huge food plate
Yes
I prefer to eat something more light
Right, obvious, right. But then he sent me a mail because on Thursdays we can all go together to have lunch somewhere
Go on
We coordinate and go to have lunch with Stuar
Great, yes, let's go with him,
I didn't see him. Wednesday I'll be quite messed up, but I think Thursday will be a quiet day, and there will be nobody
And they start to
They will all leave
Yes
So, I think so
Yeah, I don't have history. Like that, cells are growing
No, we'll send each other mails and arrange.
Growing up and a plate, and see if they grow up, I don't have experiments of being like that
You can take an hour to have lunch, peacefully.
Nothing, yeah, not tomorrow, but the rest of the week is going to be very quiet
Well
I don't have history.
I'll send you mail later and we'll coordinate with Stuart because Lucero or Paula are not there
Sure, but if we go with him
If Rocio is there and wants to come
We can tell Rocio that she eats out. I think she always goes to the Chinese.
None.
She will surely get excited if we tell her
We'll include her too and then maybe she'll be excited.
Yes.
It's an hour more or less
I believe its ok.
Well
Yes, so tomorrow. It gets kinda complicated, but every other day it's all good
Yes.
Even more, Paulo can go too, if we tell him were because he's not working
Very good
Yeah, that
Obviously, so let's go with him
We will tell him.
I don't know where you want to, what do i know, if you want to go Ya Pronto, i don't know
I don't, wherever you want to, i really don't
I'm telling you that i have never had breakfast in Ya Pronto, but you have
It's tasty, the salads are very good
I never ate the sandwich you told me i ate a sandwich, and i never ate it
The sandwiches are phenomenal, the truth it's delicious, and coffee is tasty.
So we can go to Ya Pronto then.
It doesn't look like a Yankee place, it looks like an Italian place, like it's name.
Yeah, good, no, excellent; I'll send a mail later on and we'll arrange and we say goodbye
Did you see the pictures? Estuar's
Yeah, they're really good
They're great, I crapped my pants laughing. I didn't remember those, but I remembered we went to eat, but I didn't remember that there were pictures
I had a couple, but they're not as good as that one.
And i didn't have any
I sent the things to you yesterday. Did you get them?
None
The ones from your birthday
Yes, thank you. I got them, very good too
They are really nice.because in the end i didn't know if you went to the site or not.i'll send them because i saw Stuart's
Yes, I already downloaded them.  No, I couldn't?  Whats that?  WWW letica dot pruscino
Dot com
Yes
No, without WWW
No.
Before it was
Yeah, Leticia and Pruscino with the first letter in Caps?
How are you?
Fine, it's Marcela, with whom am I speaking?
Hello! Where are you talking from?
I'm talking from North Carolina
I'm in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
With the cold.
Yes, pretty much.
Well, we have to talk about the topic of social assistence
Yes, correct, well
I know there needs to be social assistance, but I think it doesn't work very well
In reality, I also think that no, unfortunately, many older people, who depend a lot on this,
I don't have the necessary help and the benefits they receive after they retire.
Yes, yes
Too low, so
None
A low level, that they call, the level of being poor, no
Yes, of poverty
Poverty, and it's like they don't have any, care with them, because what happens is that they can't. Subsist, they simply don't have more help to give them.
This is true, to me the other thing I also see now is with the system that they have, people have to work and if not
You have to try to find this work or else they stop your assistance, the
Yes, I know
There's not enough emphasis on education. Then you have that the majority are women with kids, young
Young women because they have kids and don't go to school
Yes, correct
They don't go to high school, or maybe they don't go to the University. Then depending on how old they are, they don't have any training to have.
A good job and then with those jobs they have to pay someone to take care of the kids because almost always these are single women
I think that is not enough, that there are people that you keep giving money to, then all the single women will get
Pregnant and have kids to live free, but the human being is not like that. They are very few, I think,
Yes, there will always be people that will benefit from that, but
None
It won't necessarily change the idea of life of eighty percent of the population.
Yes,
And what's more, there are many people that benefit that perhaps should not benefit, and people that need a little more benefit that don't get it
Sometimes I think what they should do because those systems cost a lot of money. And there is never enough money. You have all the bureaucracy that has to be kept in place to maintain the system.
I would put all the money on the health insurance system.
So that everyone can go to a doctor a dentist, understand, like there is in other countries That if you for being, I'm Argentina, right, and then
If they couldn't pay a private doctor then they go to the hospital they are supposed to go
And there they have doctors, doctors that work, that have private practices but are in a rotation.  Every certain amount of time, they have to put this
Serve in the hospital for free. Then, everybody can go take care of their health and the elderly wouldn't have the problems that they have now
Yes, I think that
With all the food that is wasted in this country, instead of giving the people money
They could be directly fed and given paid housing. Maybe this is even more complicated, but I think these checks they give
Most of the people can't administrate his money, I, I am in the list, you know what I mean? and no matter, the less money
The more suffer if you don't administer it properl
Yes, yes
So, I don't know, I think that they are giving checks to these people, and what they need is more education, and some training on how to administer their money.
For it to reach something more practical. Instead, all the money goes to bureaucracy
And the check, which is not enough
Yes, I think that maybe the worse thing I've seen is the medical care that is provided.
To the elder, especially now
None
With the change to come to 'medicard'
Yes
That actually means moving from a public service to forcing people to get their private insurance
Yes, they are heading in that direction, sure
It is very complicated because most people are without education.
Procedures for the new medical insurances, and it is very complicated to them, and
And old people are afraid.
So difficult
They don't understand a thing.
No, no
They are abandoned, do you understand
None
They have a thousand things to chose from, and they don't know what's best for them. And on top of that, they want to take more money. Did you see that every month they take a certain amount of money for MediCard?
I don't see how it benefits society.
Elderly people would want to change their doctors that they might have had for twenty years
None
Because they are doing all these changes and the private companies will benefit from it, but the reality is that people won't benefit at all.
Nothing at all. And in the end, yes, if the system is not helping all of society, then it won't even help the
Private companies. It will in the beginning because in the beginning, they will receive money but then everything is going to be more expensive
Thinking about the future, then the society won't value the elderly people.
And you can see that here in the United States, unfortunately, every decade the system gets worse for the elderly people.
There are many of them now, with that. They will be the biggest group in the society.
The ones that were born
Yes,
There were a lot of babies back in the sixties and seventires.
Yes, that's true.
So now
The babies, they call them,
The babies. it will be too expensive and difficult for the federal programs to
To be able to cover all expenses, but they do have lots of millions to waste on Iraq, to focus on
That's what I've always wondered. Why are they fighting there and how much money are they spending to help?
None
If they are barely, they are wasting the money, it's like if they were throwing butter to the ceiling to Iraq
We don't have enough money, we don't know what to do that's why I don't understand it.  There are cities where the schools suck, in this country
You should find the best schools in the world in this country, but you could find better ones in a really poor Hispanic country.
Sure
That's a shame for this culture. So many rich people in the country, and so many ignorant people.
Yes, and it's a shame because at least if we go back to the elderly issues. All the money is wasted in helping other countries.
None
They can't assign certain money for medicard or for doctor's expenses for old people because there's no money. They do it for other countries because people are dying there
Well elderly are dying too. They don't have good healthcare. Many old people die because they dont have the necessary medicines.
Maybe you are right. This is not going to change because young people unfortunately are not inclined to vote.
Well
The old people that do, and then you have a large population that has a common interest.
That's a huge number of voters. So, it's possible that maybe, in the next decade, we can see that influence, right?
None
Ike in most of the other countries in the world, until we don't have something similar here, this is not going to improve because we have to destroy that and start over.
Yes, I think that they are scared, of
Tamara.
Hello, my name is Miriam.
My Name is Tamara
Where are you from?
Where are they from
I live in Toronto, Canada
Where were you originally from?
From Peru. Lima, Peru.
Well, I'm from Argentina. Argentina.
Yes. I see, where do you live?
In Boston.
Well.
Have you been living here in the United States or Canada for long?
How?
Have you been living in Canada for a long time?
Yes, ten years.
None
I see.
And how are health insurance and loans?
They are good, social services? It's good. It's not that bad, yes.
You have a social security number here?
Social security number?
Yes
We have work
And do you also have to pay health insurance?
It depends on how much the people earn.
None
If people earn more, they pay more taxes.
Yes.
And but that's something new. Before they didn't have that everybody had access to the medicine but that I think a year ago it changed.
And that the people that earn more, pay more.
And are there a lot of health plans?
No, it's bad. Because we have a card and we to the doctor when people feel bad.
Yes. And do you have to pay every time you go to the doctor? Because here every time we go to the doctor we have to pay like a
Fifteen dollars for the service.
Look see. No, I didn't know. Is that in all the United States or only in the provinces?
I believe that in the United States
Look.
First you pick a social that one wants.  There's like different companies one can pick.
Each one is more expensive
There are conversations about wanting to privatize this, because now government is the one with control.
Everyone here has the right to medicine.
But at times the waiting list is very long.
For operations?
Yes, for an operation.
But if you have an emergency, you can go directly to a hospital.
Yes. You can go and you don't pay anything. Of course, for medicine you have to pay for it.
Yes
It depends, but the hospital, the Y, I don't know if everything is covered in the night
How are the doctors of medicine? Good?
I wouldn't say it's the best.
The hospitals haven't been kept very clean. There have been infections and
Yes
Bacteria has killed people.
Wow
Yes.
Wow
You didn't hear about SARS?
SARS from last year?
Yeah, it was about two years ago or something like that.
I found out but I didn't think that in Canada. Didn't it happen in China?
In China but in Canada too. In canada, nurses died.
Wow, Nurses?
Yes. Nurses died.
Today, no.
Yes, it was tough
No, I had never heard of that.
Yes. Afterwards it was scary. Not long ago they also discovered they did an audit to the hospitals and
Yes.
They discovered that many hospitals had their equipment. They didn't clean them well. They gave them a fine .
None
Because no.
Of flu?
They are preparing... Well, I don't know. They would. It hasn't happened. Sometimes you know that things happen, and they don't tell.
Sure.
Until someone dies, then they become known.  The bomb goes off and it becomes known.
Yes.
It was, it's not like they paint it.
Yes.
Yes, many things get discovered.
In Toronto is it different than in Montreal? in one they speak English and the other French? sounds like the same because it's the same government
It was a bit different.
None
A bit different
And
But I never went to Montreal.
How is the economy between one place and the other?
It seems to me that Montreal is a very big city. They told me once I went to visit
And Toronto is no?
Toronto is big, but Montreal has a system. For example, the subway is bigger and more advanced.
Yes?
Toronto only has a few lines and it's not a big thing
Do you also speak French or not?
No. I only speak in English.  That one has of
There in Toronto, do you encounter many people that speak French?
Only English.
None
English and the languages of the countries that
So it means that a person from Montreal that goes to Toronto is  a tourist?
They have to learn English.
Wow yes.
They are bilingual, yes.
None
Sure.
I work in a hospital and yesterday a person from Montreal came and spoke French.
They speak French as first language
Yes
Without knowing how to do their documents and in a day they will come to Toronto or to another part. The people need to speak
None
In these countries you need two languages. In other words, french or our language. You need two languages
Are there a lot of people there?
Yes, yes there's a lot
In other words that you it helps you a lot to be seen?
Yes, cool. Yes, because there is. Even though you don't find work in Spanish.
No?
One has to speak English.
None
Yes
None
No, you don't find work
What do you work in?
I'm unemployed now, but was working a while ago
None
Rogers is a communications company.
No
It's a
What is it? Cellular?
It's a company, yes, and it also controls the cable. It's a big monopoly. It's a company that
None
Before it was just the cable.
Yes
It had the TV cable, but now they bought, they bought Canada, it's a big monopoly
None
I was on a contract with them, and they renewed my contract again.
Yes
The job is over. A month ago , I lost it.
Is it hard there now?
What can i tell you, there's a lot of unemployment
None
Yes, there's unemployment. Yes, there are lousy jobs that really aren't enough
Sure.
There are jobs, bit they don;t raise people out of poverty.
Sure.
Because, it's what do I know, they pay very little
Sure.
It doesn't make for
None
Yeah. Tell me.
And has it been a while since? What?
Go ahead. Yes, tell me
Has it been a while since you've gone back to Peru?
I WENT BACK ON TWO THOUSAND AND TWO
None
I have not gone back but my mom came twice to visit.
Yes.
It takes a lot of money.
Yes.
To. One trip requires too much.
Wow
And you? How long have you been there in?
I recently arrived. It's been nine months since I arrived.
You arrived nine months ago?
Yes, to the United States
You are new. You already work in a hospital?
Yes, I'm a veterinarian.
Look how nice.
Yes. I'm working and I have to validate my title. I'm working as a nurse technician. Yes. I was looking for a job for two months.
So you are
Because until I got the permit and all, It was two months.
Yes, I'm glad, because there are many people that professionals don't find. They become taxi drivers, or cleaners.
Yes, that's true. I was very lucky in that sense. I would like to work as a veterinarian no but
Sure.
Suddenly the one to work
Sure. You already found out what you need to perhaps take some courses ?
Yes I took the English exams that I had to take
None
And now I need to take the validation exams. And then once one passes that one, then you register in the other one
But it's expensive, five thousand dollars. I don't know how it is changed there.
And you can't ask for a loan?  They don't give loans there?
I met for five thousand dollars for a North American, very little to ask for a loan. There, there are plans of validation
That one can do a year in a hospital and pay twenty six thousand dollars.
None
And there they do give you a loan. I don't want to do the twenty six thousand dollars one.
No, that after you are in debt.
Yes.
Because they charge high interest.
Yes, besides I don't want to spend a whole year I mean I was already in a. The last year of a faculty is very
Is like a residency of a person of human medicine, right? and is very exhausting
None
I stay without doing it but pass it as nothing. Know the exam and ready.
Yes.
BUT THE DOGS ALSO HAVE MEDICAL INSURANCE.
Yes, how nice.
I think is better for a dog than for a human.
But you have to. Yes, they also say that here. I mean the people are the one that comes and are surprised here, about how they treat the dogs
Yes.
When
Yes. Here they invest a lot of money a day of incarnation of a day could be one thousand dollars.
Wow
And the people pay it.
Yes.
I work in oncology and radiation can cost four thousand dollars and people pay it.
Wow, you see. But are those normal people, ordinary people with a normal wage or are they rich people?
I really don't understand if they are rich or not because sometimes they don't look like wealthy people.  However, these people
You can see by how they dress that they are not poor but they don't look like Americans. They are not well dressed but they pay whatever it costs.
I really don't know how it works. If they are paying for healthcare I've heard that the homeless
The homeless have a dog and they pay more than Social Security.
That's good
Yes, I don't know if I saw this or not but thazt does happen in England for sure. So, you can see homeless people with their dogs
They don't have money to eat or anything else, but they do have money for their dogs.
Look, that's nice. That's interesting. I didn't know these things.
I don't know how that works in the United States, but it works. It's a lot of money for the poor, and there are lots of them that live on the streets by choice.
I see, that's true.
It's not like in South America.  Here it's like many of them are drug addicts.
They chose
They are addicts or alcoholics.
Yes, that's true.
People lost their jobs because they didn't want to work on and I don't know how but in Peru I think it must be like that too
In Argentina, there's lots of misery, no?
Really. The poor dogs are really miserable too.
Yes. The poor dogs.
They're poor things from one extreme to another, because sometimes when the
Hello?
Hello, my name is Gloria from California.
Hello Gloria, I'm Paula, I'm Argentinian and I'm here in Boston.
Yes.
Yes. Have you been in California for a long time, Gloria?
Sorry?
Can you hear me?
Yes, sorry? No, I didn't really hear what you asked me.
Have you been in California for long?
Yes, it's been seven, eight years.
A lot. And what do you think about social security in the United States?
No, the truth is that maybe in part you're right, they don't give a lot of help to make you self-sufficient?
Maybe sometimes there are opportunities  where you don't have to be self-sufficient. Here there are many restrictions.
With economic help, such as medical benefits.
None
We've, suffered a lot in this way,  because of the governor,  Who has limited a lot of the help for people who really need it
Sure.
So, I see this as bad, well because we're all human beings and we also have rights in my opinion.
No, not talking, I think that the system isn't very good, I'm here for three years
None
Understand perfectly all these services and benefits, but i also heard that there are many people that cannot access
Social services nor the medicine, right?  And is
None
I think that in a rich country like the United States
There are many limitations.
Is horrible. Sure, like I think that the people should be first, right? and that of self-sufficiency
NONE
There, not everybody can be self-sufficient in every
Yes.
In every moment
None
NO
The truth is that each day they close the doors more
None
And each day there are a lot of restrictions. We don't receive all the benefits that we deserve
Sure.
The basis for them is that you are an immigrant, you don't have any rights to this, you are an immigrant you don't have a right to medical coverage
Yes.
There are many limitations, and I truly think that's wrong
Sure.
There should be improvements in that, right?
Yes, and the place where you work, they don't give you medical insurance?
I don't know which one No. Is a hassle here, they pay the minimum here
Yes.
And no, I'm not working at the moment because I have a baby.
How cute, how old?
The baby turned ten months.
None
Yes, but she has been very sick with the flu
Yes,
Es I'm a single mother and there to the extreme of asking for monetary aid and they denied it twice already
No.
And yes
How strange. And that's the state of California, right?
The state of California, I got very sick of
Sure.
The heart, I had
None
I was having a hard time breathing, I went to the emergency room
Yes.
They sent me a six hundred and eighty dollar bill.
I don't believe you.
Then, for that part, I have seen myself affected, how am I going to pay that amount at once? I look for a job, I am going to let applications in some places in
No place has called me.
Yes.
I looked to babysit. They want you to charge them ten dollars for eight hours.
No.
I see that there are not benefits
No.
None
No, it is ridiculous, I have a friend that, well, she was not a single mother because she was married but her husband lived in India
None
So, lets say, her husband was virtual
None
And she got pregnant and had the baby ears. The state of Massachusetts paid almost all the pregnancy expenses, including the doctor, juice and milk coupons.
And the truth is that I in that moment, despite that she , was not, was not American she was not a citizen, she was nothing, she was a student
None
And, and in that moment it looked to me that the state of Massachusetts have been fine with someone that
It depends of the State, because here in California, the governor we have
Of course.
It was taken a lot of the benefits
Sure. Yes, Schwarzenegger is a disaster, isn't he?
He has taken a lot and the longer he stays the worse, because he is cutting the medical insurance, he don't want them, and I've heard that the children born here will no longer have the benefits
They won't be born in this country, because they are sons of immigrants. They are closing us the door more every day.
But that is so because it is a federal law
I don't know, to me it is not right, because although they say that we become a charge for the government--because that's what they say, that we become a charge for them
At the moment, we also contribute with taxes.
Right
None
Yes, besides, I think that saying that the health of the people living here is a charge is quite sad and ugly
Yes
Isn't it?
There is a lot of racism
Going to invade Iraq, and spending millions of dollars
None
There but it's not only the immigrants, there are a lot of Americans who can not afford
Black people, I see nobody working here. If you come to have a look where they give the money aid it is full of black people
Men who look alright
Yes
Who are able for working and so, but they are in the same
Sure.
Really then
Sure
I see it as being bad because it's actually getting worse. There's no help
Yes.
None
What country are you from Gloria?
Guatemala
You're from Guatemala, they tell me it is wonderful.
But we are also like in one part, I can't say is one hundred percent bad the state here where I'm at because it was the first place where I came, right?
Sure.
Yes, because at that moment, the people from the hospital all help me financially.
Sure.
It was a collection that they did amongst them, which in my country they never would've done.
Sure.
They do give me the milk for my daughter because otherwise I wouldn't have money to buy it,
Sure.
Yes, they have helped me .
None
What I am referring to is that each day they are closing more the doors, they are taking away benefits that are beneficial to us.
Yes.
They are taking away a lot of benefits that in reality benefit us, I don't know if in all the states is like that, but at least here in the state of California, this is getting bad
Yes, and have you thought of moving to another state?
The truth is I have nowhere to go. No. I would really like to. If I had the support of some relative or something.
Sure.
I'm going to go somewhere else, but already now is not just me alone, I also have a daughter, right?
Sure.
Not anywhere, they are going to say come here and let's see how we give you a hand.
Sure.
I was working with a Salvadoran lady. I took care of her daughter and she would give twenty dollars daily
Yes.
I would go from seven in the morning and would return at eight at night.
No.
I had to clean her house, wash the clothes and everything, and take care of the daughter.
That's abusive.
Yes, since I arrived, I've been like this, it hasn't gone too well you can say
None
And to say that I'm going to return to my country neither because my mom gave me away when I was very little
None
I have a sister in Honduras and she's worse off because she has eleven kids. The poorest country there could be Honduras
Sure.
Just wait to see what happens here because it would be a mistake to take my daughter away from here. I know she will have benefits here.
She will have her studies, something I won't be able to give her in my country
Sure
None
The you've been here eight years or eight months?
Seven years.
Seven years.
None
A lot.
But, yes. Everything has gotten complicated for me, if I haven't gone back is because,  I have nowhere to go, right?
For your daughter.
No because, perhaps I wouldn't be here, and because I also don't want to
None
To shatter my daughter's life, I know that here she will have more opportunities
Yes.
Is easier to study. It depends how things go in the future, because with the new laws they have now, they want
I say things will get complicated
Yes, and do you have family here in the United States or no?
No. When I was little, my mom gave away two of my siblings. They grew up here but we don't know each other. I do not know where they live nor do they know me.
Sure.
But I have to say I have family here, no?
Yes.
A friend of mine took me in but after a few days, I was in the way she didn't want me there anymore.
None
She through me out of there even though I was pregnant
No.
That's how it was, it hasn't gone too well for me, and as time goes by, I think that this will get worse because
You have to be positive, one never knows what could happen
None
Try to think positive.
There are always good people. I'm thirty one years old and
None
In between the changes, right? It hasn't gone too badly. My daughter is a
Yes.
Blessing for me, despite the circumstances, my greatest treasure that I'm here for her I know I have to fight, right?
Sure
And yes, I ask God that everything improves in this country for good.
Let's hope
None
Yes.
To see what happens with the laws.
No,
We have no choice but be partly dependent of those who want to suppodt us, right?
None
None
Yes, and Gloria. Until when is Schwarzenegger in office, there?
None
He's not going to win again
I said that for the beginning of this year, it looks like they are going to do again
I'm not too sure, I don't remember when they are going, going to do the new elections here but let's see what happens
Next year, yes.
This upcoming year, it looks like they are going to do them again and I don't think he'll stay. I hope the one that comes improves...
None
I hope that other stays and brings us benefits.
PROBABLY WILL BE A DEMOCRAT, WHICH ALWAYS HELPS, RIGHT
None
They have more social concerns and this is a way
And in the state where you live, no, no, things are not too complicated or how is it there?
Look, the truth is that I don't really know how it is here.
None
I tell you, that was pregnant
Hello, good evening.
Good evening, how are you?
Yes. What's your name?

It looks very nice.
The light of the tree, you know that it can be the decoration of fifth avenue which is Fifth Avenue

And is there snow there now?
Now there's snow that stayed from two weeks ago. The snow is still frozen there.
None
But no, lately it hasn't snowed
Here in Vancouver there's no snow, it's just raining
Yes but there it snows like crazy, right?
Yes. But
When I
Tonight I'm going to be flying to Toronto and that there's a lot of snow.
Oh really?
I leave for the airport in three and they say there's a lot of snow there in Toronto, and I'm going  there for Christmas
Are you going to spend it in Toronto?
Yes.
Okay, what's the difference?
Well.

My family is there, and I have a daughter who's there. And I'm going to spend it with her there.
How nice
Yes. how nice.
Yes
Hey, there's this dude in New York. What's his name? Howard Stern, right? There was something
None
Where it's more like this week, I heard in the news that he's not, he ended up in the radio or something like that.
A contract that ended, but that is still going. The person he had pays me. They get a lot of money from his audience at the station he works for.
That dude is something crazy
Yes?
Yes, because the guy's a pervert, I consider him a pervent
None
I don't now if you like his shows, have you seen his shows?
Yes, I hear him once in awhile
Yes

None
He only does it so that people laugh. For example, he has a show of
That is televised, but is about what he does on the radio.
None
And then the girls go and he tells them. and they take it off in front of him. And the
And in front of the camera and I don't know what the man has, the girls go crazy.
None.
He tells them, oh take off your bra there. Let me see how they are, that if they are good. And he tells them Come here that I want to touch them and
They let him do it. And he tells them, take of your panty, and they even do it. I don't know what it is that
None
I consider him a person like you know a person is a show. How can a man like that go to work.
And then go home and he has a family, understand?
None
I don't know if you've seen the show, you've never seen the show?
Yes, once that I was in the United States, was here in Canada, what is it called? E right?
None
Yes, here in Canada they don't have that E Channel
None
It didn't happen. I went once when I was on vacation in the United States.
You didn't see any of that. What I'm talking about?
Yes, well I saw the episode that I saw it was an interview with Arnold Schwarzenegger or something like that. And I think that if there had been a girl in a bathing suit and
And everything all of her bathing suit but they censored it. It wouldn't happen like
Yes, they censored it but that is that was working like that. I don't know how they're able to convince these women to take their clothes off because there are women
I used to have a roommate. It was two women, sisters - both German. I was always watching that and I sat down and stayed watching it with them
Two months there were more than four hundred, and the guy was saying I want to watch how that is
Yes, took off her clothes in front of him and said,
Those where they give out prizes or something like that, right? Or like a prize contest
No. For the guy that is super popular with women, there are women who just go crazy over him.
Like it just gives them an inclination to do crazy stuff
None
None
None
Understand? For example, I've heard that there are musicians, here in Manhattan, that when they are putting on a concert, the girls take off their panties and throw them on them.
To the
None
And they're just stupid and crazy little things but they do it you know with people, men when they ask to do something they do it. Anything. They do it.
Happens
Then?
With the purpose of coming out in that program
With the purpose of his program well with the purpose of doing what he wants.
No.
He does what he wants since the see him as an idol.
Yes
But, leave me.
But each time, for example, you have to see these Spanish channels where they do more of these same things. Right?
None
In Spanish.
I talked to a guy who told me there is a song called, The Mega, and a station. There are already two people.
What is it called that they
Must be the same as Howard, but in Spanish.
Yes, they are the ones that direct the show, and they are almost the same as this man, just in Spanish, because they really
And but they can do worse things because they are since they are speaking Spanish
None
They can say vulgar things like that, and nobody
Oh. Oh, yes they do it.
They don't have the problems that Howard had with the FCC because it was in Spanish.
Nobody from this givernment cares wht they say because they are speaking Spanish, right?
Yes, he speaks Spanish loudly here
None
They have regulations. Do you know what I mean? People always know what they're talking about because there's always another accusation that accuses you.
None
But no, let's say for example, that they have a keyboard to say bad words when this man talks about the
The feminine part
None
Instead of saying the word in spanish, they invented a thing that's called foneta
It's not
Yes
None
That means the thing, the woman's thing.
The woman's thing.
But
What i said, in Mexico it's called, doing the cheese, i don't know if they say it like that in the United States
The Mexicans still call it the cheese among them
None
But the chaforeta doesn't really mean anything.
Really
But it's something they have
Yes
They named it like that so they can speak openly in public without getting into trouble with the people who regulate. So, the words
Yes
They call it calembo
The calembo
No country in Latin America call the Spanish language like that, but they
None
At radio level they make people laugh with their jokes and they make good songs.
About the chanfoneta and the calembo, and their jokes are basically theirs
Yes
They take popular songs and change them and put like that, for example, they have the song that says it lasts so long
None
Oh it lasts so long, and they put a woman is singing to the man
None
Because he has a very big calembo
Yes
He makes her suffer, she says oh, it hurts so much but it's just..., it explains everything, using that term. The radio can't control it any longer
Yes
But your imagination, and you know that
Good evening.
Hello, how are you?
Who's speaking?
Juan, hello?
Juan
Juan from  that, is my last name.
It seemed like very religious
No, not at all, I'm a father but of a family.
Well, my name is Rosa. How are you?
Very good, thank you very much, is today's topic.
The welfare system, if I'm understanding, right?
Of the system?
Here in the United States, and in comparison
None
I don't have much knowledge of the European system, nor do I know much about the welfare here.
They asked the question that if it should be reduced, the amount of money that the government gives to those who depend on welfare
So that they become more independent or, on the contrary, continue like that or increase it more
None
Well I don't think that just reducing, or increasing the pay they give people can change the situation in which those people find themselves in.
In order for any change to occur, we must first alter the foundation of society in itself.
To generate a chance in the economical activity in this dependent families.
Yes I believe that this is not about giving them more or less money
We are taking the money away
The money has to do with self-sufficiency
Sure, it exist.
No?
The structures or the means exist for these people to become independent
Self-sufficient
Because you might take the money away from them and they might not have the opportunity to work or get involved in the job system
This wouldn't be solving the problem
Exactly, in that sense, they give people money and people don't do anything, no?
Self-sufficient because they have enough money and they rely on the government to live, that's the issue, no? That this question
Yes, one would have to ask what type of people are requesting this government help
None
The discriminated sectors of society, the poor, the racially rejected, lots of times, old people or women, the ones that are usually, let's say, the ones with
Less benefits in the society we have to ask ourselves if the conditions exist for this sectors to
This discriminating situation needs to be overcome
None
I believe that the changes would have to be very, very different and not just relative
Exactly
The economical size of the aid, the institutions that are giving aid to these groups are just palliatives.
They are not providing them with the necessary tools to become independent
And I believe that it would be best to reduce the amount given to them, to have the same people do the same with less money
They won't be,
Yes, because the structure is not changing, they don't have other opportunities, if you say, well, we are reducing the amount of money but
You can get this job opportunity and only the ones that are working. The funds are going to be lowered and we are going to check that.
You will get money if you work, and education and healthcare and this and that, and then they will
Oh, they will be able to access all the opportunities and general benefits, of this society, well, it's like a, it's like a multi-sectoral measure and not just a unilateral one.
Yes, yes, I think I read somewhere that the poverty systems, the ones that fight poverty in the United States, have failed.
Because they haven't been able to end poverty and they have just made people dependent on the government's help so, I mean,
With this way of social support,  they give money to the ones that need it, so that, lets say, they
They do, yes.
Can move forward in this economical system
But they can't? Unless you have, yes
Yes, just keep the population stable
None
They are not changing the conditions.
None
That's what has happened since, eighty years ago, there were twenty million of poor people and now the number is eight million
It's growing, so, it's the same population, nothing has changed, this doesn't let people integrate, no, no, nothing is going to happen, they are just going to continue getting governement help
Really, as an expense.
I think that the government does assume it as such.
Exactly
Making more structural changes would be much more expensive, not only economically, but in social terms, also for this government
I can't imagine what kind of changes would be the right ones for this case. What could it be? It may have something to do with cultural conditions, right?
Sure, racial
Questions, rather than what kind of structural changes can the government make. I can't imagine it. We live in a world that is the way it is, isn't it?
So, in this world, the way it is, you have to look for your opportunities
It's not the same for everybody
It isn't? You may have it harder or easier
Sure, because, if you belong to a
These circumstances, but then you say no.  But let me tell you, it has to do with education, hasn't it?  If there are schools there, I guess a lot of the population can access those schools.
And however, I guess they may hace some attitudes, or expectations, about their education or something like this, right? I mean it is a very complex phenomenon, I don't dare to think of a
Simple solution, right? I rather try to think about the conditions which you have, several opportunities and paths to follow but you don't
Right?
None
That's it. If you don't do so, it is because there is some interest in your lifestyle, some interest related to governmental aids. It is enough
From this point of view. Why move if I am getting aid that gives me enough to survive? According to my group, to how the population is
Right?
You are giving a simple explanation for a complex problem.
Because this answer you're thinking about, to say that the beneficiary of the social security system, I think that it's too simple. I think that there are also many more complexities.
And many more explanations like cultural, now it's a psychological history, cultural history, I think that it's much more complex
None
In general, I agree.
Yes, it's a simplification of an economic kind, no? To say, it's a decision many, it's like an economic decision, yes> I have more benefit that costs.
They say,I won't move and they'll give me one hundred dollars, I don't move, one hundred dollars won't help me much, but if I move
Who knows what kind of costs, of values, there are for the style, no? a friend of mine told me that in Guam,
None
None
But the minimum salary there for the rest of the population is three hundred dollars a month. So what people do there, they say I work I'll earn three hundred
Yikes.
If I don't work, I get seven hundred
None
So it's, it's simple
None
And so people declare themselves unemployed and so, since they can't
My name is jenny, i'm calling from new york.
My name is Mariano and I am in Philadelphia.
We are close by, yes
How are you? fine Where are you from?
And good And how are you? I was born in the United States, but my parents are Dominicans.
Dominican parents, okay, you I mean speak English and Spanish the same way.
More or less, yes I feel more comfortable in English
More or less
I feel good in Spanish but not as comfortable as in English.
In English you feel much more comfortable, with me is the opposite
Yes, you feel much more comfortable in Spanish than in English
And sure yes since I was born in a Spanish country, where they speak Spanish
Oh, okay.  Where are you from?
Sure, from Argentina.
Okay
From Argentina, what do you think of today's topic?
Well today's topic is one that, as a kid of immigrants here in the United States, always
It has been present. This country was created on the back of the immigrants themselves
Sure.
But nowadays ah people that are kids of immigrants want to make themselves feel better by throwing back the new immigrants. and I think that regrettably
Is a terrible injustice.
Yes, is an injustice, that sometimes I don't understand where it comes from
Hello
Yes, sorry that call waiting one moment
No, no, I really don't know from where
Can you hold on a moment sorry, is that is an important call on the other line, one moment I'm going to put you on hold
Okay
Excuse me
Hello
Yes, I'm sorry. I was talking with immigration.
Yes, hello. They are not going to accept the call.
Yes, they will accept it because it was a small instance.
Yes that is incredible. No, I can't hear with the dog
If you want to cancel the call
No, is that I can't hear with the dog and that's why
Yes, I took him to another room and they came in, so
Now he is there
Yes
Well no that, that is surprising that there are people that are resistant to foreigners because this country is basically made by foreigners
Yes, but unfortunately, everybody thinks that because two or three generations of their family are born here, they stop being from where they are
Of course
Unfortunately, there is much ignorance in the U.S.
Yes, right?
We must not allow ignorance follow progress
And yes
Every time I hear of immigrants, I remember their parents
Completely
They also did an injustice when they stole the land and their way of thinking
We should all be ashamed.
It was tremendous injustice
The immigrants founded this country.
We can not complain because we are also immigrants
Of course I think that's important and we respect foreigners.
Yes
No matter what race they are from, they also work very hard.
They work without asking for almost nothing
Reluctance
Their purpose is to feed their families, and to have a better tomorrow
Yes
For your family and your destination.
Yes, I really admire them. For example, the closest one is Mexican.
Yea
They're people that leave their families behind and they come here to work, to start to provide for their families here and, and they send a lot of money back and it supports their family in Mexico
Really you have to, you've got to respect them a lot, I think that besides that Americans can be characterized as not working as hard as an immigrant does because, because of what I see.
No, here the Americans let someone they know do it. Whoever their family knows, whoever their friend is
They call it
Through friendships, not through work
What they call networking
Complete that makes you worse than networking it's more the old boys club. Your dad studied with someone else's dad who has some important position in some company.
That is going to work in your favor that they have known your dad
Yes.
And not because you have the highest grades in your class, simply because he knows someone from your family and that's how they help each other out.
Yea, it's
My dad in Santo Domingo was a lawyer when they had a war there.
They had a civil war, he left everything he had, it was his family's
Yea
Good, they had a lot of land. He came here with everything, his doctorate and license to practice law. He came here to give us a better life.
A better life
Yea
He worked as a janitor.
Yes, it's terrible
You know that, they couldn't even give him the respect that he deserves being a lawyer. To teach him English, it wasn't easy for him.
No, yes
That's why he made such an effort for us to study
Yes
And, and we won't stop our careers so that so that we wouldn't have to make the same sacrifice that he did, and still today. There are people that they think that we are less
Because my dad wasn't born here.
No it's true for me as well in Argentina it's a little bit like here because that is basically how immigrants are treated, there's a lot for example
I would tell you that Italians they're like sixty percent, seventy of the population
Yes but they immigrated a lot more to the east coast. Who immigrated more over such time?
The one in Argentina you said
Yeah
The Argentinians are mostly from the turn of the last century
Yes that's the problem
Yeah
The new immigrants are Mexicans.
Sure, that is
Russians are just arriving, but cultures are different, because this one Russian woman studies here, came here and left her family behind
Don't ever forget that when a friend comes, or someone they know, they can get them a job
Yes, they're never forget
However, me being from a Dominican family I've noticed that here there are many Dominicans that when they arrive they make the effort, they get a job, a good
A good position in society
They forget about everyone
Yes, they forget.
Sure, yes
They forgot that in their town there are some people that are interested in coming and that they should help them. I've never understood that.
Yes, yes is
No, I don't know how the people so easily forget about the effort
Is terr-
And of all that they had to suffer
Is terrible
And they don't help them nor do they give a hand to a person who comes
Is terrible, is an incredible injustice.
But is an injustice that we ourselves create
Yes.
Like I tell you, the old boys network here an anglo person, American or, or from Europe
A person from their town comes and gives him a hand
Yes
We don't know them, let him do the same that I had to go through.
I had good experiences here in the United States.
None.
Immigrants
None
Or the kids of immigrants that are Americans but that are of Italian origin
None
That I let's say since I have they tell me that I look Italian.
Okay.
My last name, and my family is Italian, but I was born in Argentina
None
They have made me feel like part of them.
None
People identify as Italian even if they don't speak Italian, only English.
Yes
I don't know if they are all like that but at least I had a good experience with them for now
I've worked in the school system
None
I'm now a researcher and I've realized that in both careers, and even in my studies, I've realized that is not like that with everybody, no.
Really
I had a school principal
Yes
Was cuban descendant and got married to a man from Egypt.
From Egypt, look at that
She was not Hispanic and nobody would talk to her in Spanish.
None
She changed her last name to a way that she never wanted anyone to call her
She never wanted to be identified with that again
No, She was doubly harder with the Hispanic workers.
Sure
So, everything was like she wanted to erase that the family came, from Cuba, that her family were boat people when Castro got the people out of Cuba.
Yes that's common in the young people
This was an older lady, this was a lady
No, oh my God.
When I was twenty-five, she was forty-five.
My God
Yes she was a director of a school and I was working as coordinator of a program
My God
She didn't want to accept Hispanic children into the program, she wanted children with parents who had high income for the most part.
Yes
Hi my name is Yolanda
How are you? My name is adrian and i live in toronto, ontario, canada
You're calling from Canada? I live in Texas
Texas, in which city?
Yes, in the area of Dallas Forthword
None
Dallas Forthword
Have you been living in Dallas for long?
In Dallas yes, OK, and you live in Toronto?
None
Toronto?
Toronto, yes
Toronto, OK, and your name is Adrian, OK
Exactly
OK, and  from which country are you from?
I was born in Buenos Aires in Argentina
OK, from Argentina, very good yes, and  I didn't know that country, other countries, and thought that only here in the United States,  have you been in this study for long?
One month, more or less
OK
I think they weren't getting people and they, expanded it to Canada too
Then you know little of tonight's topic?
Yes I don't know, where were you born, were you born in the United States or in another place?
I was born here, I'm from, ah I'm Texan and my mom and my dad also were born here and, we have like five generations that have been here and after that
I think that we are from everywhere,
Okay, but they speak Spanish
My grandmother, she was the last one that spoke more Spanish. Now my relatives almost all of them speak English but
None
When you went to school, the school was in English, it wasn't in Spanish
Yes, it was in English.
And how did you learn to read in Spanish?
I don't know. Just that
You learned on your own.
Yes, I don't know, my grammar is not too good because they haven't taught me how. no, no
They taught us the grammar and all that in Spanish, I always learned it in English, but, it's been a
If a Spanish books attracts you, can you read it or not?
Yes, I can read it, there are some words perhaps that I can't understand too good but  because you see, from other countries
Some use certain words for something in other countries
Mixed
I make myself understood. We can talk yes?
I'm not in the,  I ask you the question  and obviously here there are immigrants
None
Something very usual no matter what background the immigrants are from, but they share the worry about
None
The second generation of sons born, were in a country wirth a different native language
Yes
From their parents, is that they never learn to speak the native language correctly, or
Yes, because my little brother who is right behind me speaks Spanish just like me.
The youngest two, they understand well but don't speak to they know some words
What was the difference between the brothers who speak well and those who don't?
Yes, well, me and the brother right behind me, we raised together with my grandma, and she did speak a lot in spanish, but the
Youngest two, well my grandma had already died, so they didn't have much contact with her
It's alright, but to have just your grandma speaking to you all day long in Spanish, was that enough for you to learn it?
It was.
Or did you study?
No, I've never studied spanish, just being around my grandma, all the people who talked to her talked in Spanish
And so I ealrned it little by little, and
Because your grandma didn't speak english? was it so?
She knew English but she preferred to talk to the Hispanic people in Spanish
None
Yes, and it was good for me because this way, me and my cousins who are the same age, we all speak spanish, and my cousins better
Less. They had no contact with her. They don't speak a lot of Spanish. Yes, it's very different.
It is different, you try at home and I know a few Hispanic families
None
That came here. The children weren't born here but they came here when they were very young
Yes
They don't speak Spanish, they might understand it but
None
Only if it's a simple conversation, their dad speaks to them in a language and they answer in English.
Yes, yes, yes, what happens is that
They speak in English.
Yes
Well
My nephews, many times, they don't speak Spanish, they speak English and even my own children do, oh because I was married to a
A gringo and he didn't speak Spanish so, how did you end up in Canada from Argentina?
Oh, how did I end up here?
None
It's a long story but basically
Tell me a short version
Short version
None.
Basically for a bunch of topics
None
How is Argentina or Buenos Aires I always had the idea that I was going to end up in another place
None
I don't know where she got that idea, but it kept growing.
Yes,
I remember that when I left I was twenty eight years old
None
I remember that I told my father that I'm going to go live to Canada and he told me
Go, well, I already knew and how did you know?
None
And because, ten years ago you told me I don't remember according to him when I was eighteen I told him, but
Wow.
The truth is that I don't remember when I told him
None
Why I told him or in what second I told him but for him it was like he knew
Yes.
He
You already had friends or family there in Canada or, or just that place
Yes, a few friends
Okay
In reality, I was going to go live to Australia.
None
When I was finding out and the topic the
None
Some friends that were living at that moment here in Toronto
Yes
Told me no, don't go to Australia you're going to talk like the crocodile hunter and I don't know what, and and it's very far
Yes
Ere is cold but it's nicer, and I don't know what and
I've gone to Toronto, I went once a few years back and I loved it, it's very beautiful
That state yes
This moment is snowing
None
A lot, so,
The cold season perhaps is not as nice here it was raining the whole day and it was in the forties
Middle forties, but tomorrow is going to be sunny, and it's going to
None
It's almost sixty and that's how I like the weather.
Yes I figure that we won't see the sun until March
Until March
That's when my wife said that it gets cloudy
Yes
What's cloudy November
None
Sometimes
Yes.
No, I don't know. If you want to discuss the topic of the immigrants, my opinion will be a little subjective, but
Yes
Because you were born in the United States, you lived there, how fine that you are an immigrant
Yes, the topics they gave us of immigration and religion.
If the people have a desire to get ahead there's so much in this country.
Also in Canada, to come and make a good life I think.
And of, why doesn't anybody want the immigrants in Texas?
Well
What are those that patrol the border called?
None
The other time I heard in the radio the minuteman or something like that
The minutement is that there are a lot of things is, they have many reasons and, I understand both sides but also is that
Is that is very hard for the government to maintain, the hospitals and here there's a lot of crime caused by situations like that
Many things happen
Criminals are just criminals
Not all of them but sometimes the news talk about that
There are criminal that are immigrants
All mexican, yes
How can I tell you that the border with all the drugs is not very good or safe?
That is not good for the country
Something negative, like a burden.
Yes it is very hard for the people who lives close to the border. to maintain hospitals and jails
Like I told you there are two ways.This is a seriuos situation
We need to have an open mind to solve this.
I understand the crime and all that but
None
The statistics say something different
None
90% believes that if the immigrants disappeared
None
Texas will have no crime, there would be no crimes
None
Hello!
Hello!
My name is Luisa
My name is Aurelio from washington DC
I'm from Miami, Florida
Miami, Florida, how nice
Yes, yes
Listen, the topic they put today is a very hard topic. To talk for twelve minutes is hard, right?
Sure. Yes.
Yes,
Very complicated, But Are you an immigrant, do you live here? or, you were born here
I live here, I'm an immigrant, originally from Venezuela I've been here in this country going on twelve years that I've been in this country
None
None
A long time, long time, I'm Colombian, it's barely been two years that I've been here
Imagine that.
None
How is it going? how did you come here to this country?
I came legally, I came with my visa, but I had to emigrate precisely for that of the guerrilla. Because in Colombia, the guerrilla bothers a lot the people that
They are well off. They killed my dad. They killed my little sister's dad.
Oh my goodness, the guerrilla
The guerrilla was threatening my mom, that's why I had to immigaret here, so I came due to political asylum.
None
And now I am  in political asylum process, waiting for immigration to respond
Listen, it's hot. Wow. I came here to study. I finished my studies and stayed here.
I met my wife here, she is American, and we married while in the university. Yes, but never under these circumstances. That is great
None.
Yes
Here we are, safe
Yes, absolutely. Here, at least, you are safe and there is no guerrilla.
Yes, at least there is no guerrilla
Wow, go figure! But I think you can't stop immigration. It's impossible.
Specially in a country like this one, that was actually founded by immigrants, you know what I mean?
None
And second one, listen, that would be impossible, most of the people here have a family abroad,you know what I mean?
None
It would be impossible to stop the immigration. No more immigrants or rather only immigrants who are somehow qualified, university graduates, that can't be done
Impossible
Such an injustice would be unthinkable. There are a lot of people who would love to do that.
Who would love to completely stop the immigration
Sure so
I don't know if
I heard this past days that they had approved or were going to approve a law to make a dividing wall between Mexico and,
The border of Mexico and the United States, I heard
Yes, exactly.
I think that even if they do that the immigration will continue because look many are the Cubans that risk their lives to come here, and many people that are leaving their countries just to get here
Sure, exactly
Is very hard of what they can do starting with that we
Yes,
The immigrants are like the engine of the United States. How many immigrants do the jobs that Americans don't want to do?
Exactly
Latinos do the hard work in hotels and restaurants.
Sure Is the same here in Washington, is the same thing I mean the majority of the ones that do those jobs are Latins Are Hispanics, especially Central Americans.
Here in Washington there are a lot of people from Salvador.
Here in Miami there are a lot of Cubans
Over there of course a lot of Cubans and Venezuelans, here the majority are from Central America, Salvadorans especially Salvadorans.
And then Hondurans And look the great majority, I have many friends from Salvador And almost all of them have told me that they've arrived, of course they are already legal in the country
But when they arrived, they arrived as illegal immigrants
Sure
Yes sir, they arrived. One told me a story one day, something incredible. he came in a truck from El Salvador, they crossed all of Mexico, in a
They crossed the border here in a truck. Yes, it's horrible, but stopping the immigration would be impossible.
And unfair. And besides, like you say, the engine of, a big part of the engine of this economy are the immigrants
You remember
Sure
You've been here for two years? So you were in Columbia during September eleventh, right?
I was still in Colombia
Ok,  you know that I lived very near of the Pentagon when that happened
Yes
I spent most of my time there, in front of the Pentagon, and saw the destruction, something horrible.
Most of them were from El Salvador.
Yes
Yes, and there were voices for an amnesty to give citizenship to the people who refurbished the Pentagon.
It wasn't approved.
I don't know how all that ended, I think they were given something, some amnesty for patriotic reasons and so, but
I haven't heard back from them. Really, they talked so much about it but, now, I have heard nothing.
Here they keep talking about that wall you mentioned, that they want to build one wall, but
That is impossible, just figure, spending so much money in that
Yes. They can enter by any other side.
Of course.
Imagine that they allow no more people entering, what would be of people like me?
That are leaving the country because they are in danger, to where they go the most it's where is the closest, okay one says well to Canada, but in Canada is almost the same, the same.
Exactly.
Do you understand me?
True, true
I have came here twenty years ago.
None.
Imagine
And she came here twenty years ago, imagine she had to do everything but thank God at this moment she's already an American citizen
She already has all her things in order, but it was lot of suffering what my poor aunt had to go through, when she came here
I imagine when she came twenty years ago, many things were not so tight as they are now.
Yes, twenty years ago
Especially with this republican government, because this government Is totally anti immigration despite what they say that the republican governments have always been more of
This is a disaster.  What do you do in Miami?
What do you work in?
I study, I don't work.
You are a student of what?
None
You are young, how old are you?
Nineteen
If you don't mind nineteen years imagine
Nineteen and
I'm thirty five years old, I'm a musician, I'm an opera singer
I study vocal techniques
Yes. How nice. Where?
With an independent teacher And did you ever see a program called voices of America
Of course, sure
Yacke Aredondo is my teacher there.
Listen that's good, excellent, I congratulate you
I'm going to start studying music
None
I'm going to start college for music, because that's what I want to do, that's my passion and is what I want to do
Sure, And you want to be a singer? or are you going to play an instrument?
I want to be a singer
I went through that already and that's a career that makes makes very good money when one works right
You never finish studying that. It's going on seven years since I graduated from the University
I graduated from the conservatory in Venezuela also.
None
Before coming here and look, that's something you never stop studying. I still weekly go to my singing lessons and all
I have to do
And that's something constant
The word is perseverance, because one has to be very constant.
What one wants to do, and when one likes it, one studies
What university are you going to go to?
I'm going to go to the community college first.
Yes, sure
Really the same subjects as the university, only that a little more expensive.
Sure, listen look how nice I congratulate you I tell you something, that's another area in where the immigrants here are let's say at the head
At the head
Yes. If you see the great majority of the singers in the opera companies, the ones that do the main roles are immigrants, people that have names
Russian, or Polish, Italian, or Latins Especially in this area you know that here, the opera company, is directed by the maestro Placido Domingo
None
Yes, and he gives a lot of preference to the Spanish singers because he is Hispanic also. He was born in Mexico and raised in Spain.
Sure
Yes, but that's another example of the immigration, you can't stop the immigration
None
Guy, it would be impossible Because there are people that come here, just to sing There are some that come and stay, there are some that come
They return to their countries. What's more I have a Colombian friend. Cuban the guy he moved, he went to Venezuela, he fled to Venezuela.
One time when the Havana symphony went to play to Caracas and he stayed there in Caracas and from there
He came over here to this country from Cuba as a political refugee and
Sure
They gave him his residence papers almost immediately, and they gave him his papers in less than two months
An incredible thing and what are you? A soprano I imagine from the way of speaking, Mezzo soprano, how nice
None
What are you?
Yes,
Studying in music now?
What songs do I do? Well, sorry? I didn't understand you
None
Yes.
Hello, yes, whom am I speaking with?
I'm Lorena. Whom am I speaking with?
Lorena, Jorge's speaking from Los Angeles. Where are you, Lorena?
Hi. I'm in Dan Antonio, Texas.
How are you?
Fine.
What an interesting topic today.
Absolutely
Absolutely
Hot
Super interesting and you  are there in Texas, that
That's it. Well, And in Los Angeles too, so much immigration.
Of course.
And so impor-
How far is San Antonio from El Paso?
By car, it is
Yeah
Is approximately three hours.
Is not much. The border is there in El Paso.
It's not a lot, it's pretty close,
Yeah. Around here more or less, from Los Angeles to El Paso and that would to the border that would be two hours from Tijuana, it's not much.
A lot closer.
Yes, what a candid topic.The only thing I can tell you, as a Latin, is that, honestly, it hurts me deeply that it
No it's not my opinion
None
The president, it's what this government is doing
Yes
Basically the treatment that the government is doing with immigration is generally okay.
Yeah
When I talk about immigration, I'm not talking only about the Hispanics. In general, it's very frustrating to see how
It's that this government is driving the immigration theme based on the Constitution and the origin was based on the idea of receiving
And sharing and offering opportunities. To put simply, Lorena, in a few words.
So that's how it is. From the beginning, but also currently. Even though they want to deny it, immigration continues being the motor of the economy.
Exactly
In addition to all of the other forces that already have for well for the structure of the country. But definitely I think that migration is a source of renovating energy
For good things. Definitely always the rich intercultural of the people. We cannot say that if we have immigrants of other countries that won't we here
Receiving them as a positive energy and learning new things is enriching us.
Without a doubt it hurts me.
It hurts to see undocumented immigrants in this country.
None
It hurts to see that when you are trying to put eleven million in that bag
There must be some terrorists in that group but most of the eleven million that are here are human beings that have just come here to
To work and to have a better life for themselves and their families, if they had that where they came from, they wouldn't be here.
Yes, one is where the money is, and
Exactly
Because if you have everything and you are doing okay and you feeling fine, why would you leave?
Exactly, I believe you are right about that. And regarding the mistreatment of immigrants, it's different
I feel it has changed, right now I think that Hindu migration is accepted, in comparison to some ten or fifteen years ago
The Mexican immigrants, specially the ones from Central America
That is painful, that's unbelievable.
Like, no, they are hard working people, good people, and if they, if we think about it, I say, I don't think the Hispanics are going to think about it
About doing any terroist acts, it's not part of their culture, of their lifestyle
No,
It's the same story, of all our lives, witch hunt.
Exactly
They are hiding it by saying that there might be some terrorist among them, and trying to get rid of all 11 million
That are left
Exactly. It's unfair that because of a few, there can be. The majority being, as you said, is the ten million and nine hundred and ninety nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety nine.
Exactly, I missed some zeros.
Have to pay for that. It's terribly painful, right?, and you know that, when was it?, i believe last friday, or the, yeah
When the house of representatives basically sketched out this new law project tha tbasically has the white house approval
That really has an incredible anti-immigrant spirit. Have you heard about it?
No, no, no
Well,  i think it was until last Friday, in Washington, they finished working on it until late hours in the morning
Right
They came on friday. The house of representatives, in English it would be the HR, the House of Representatives
None
The presented a sketch of a law for approval. It hasn't been approved, it will probably need to be taken to the senate, but it's supported at the moment.
By the white house, which is outrageous. those eleven million people are considered to be committing a civil offense by being illegal.
They are studying the possibility of converting eleven million people, but that could be a civil offense.
In Spanish we call that a major offense.
Yes
A criminal offense
Oh my
Being illegal, that is
None.
That's a witch hunt. They want to rule out that even the settled
Yes, that's it
Of illegal people
Born here who have no right to
That, as you say Lorena, what fault is that of the innocent people born in this country
Oh yes
Not to have the right.
That shows this discriminatory attitude of the government and the society, I wouldn't like to generalize because there are a lot of people in this country
No
Who don't exactly agree to that stance
Right
Always those attacks against the minorities and the weak, as if they thought this is the only way of exerting their power
Minorities, right?. Oh, it's outrageous, really
Another thing, basically this plan that the Parliament is preparing, to their level
They achieved some treat
I've heard is giving a two year term to the companies, for them to have the time to check all the documents
And the social security of all their employees
None
To see what is the real situation of all the employees. and I almost forget the worse,
This new one doesn't have any organized plan for those eleven million to pass neatly to a system
That allow them to legalize, normally.
Wow
It is interesting that this measure is to be taken by the Parliament.
None
The House of Representatives, it's never going to be passed by the Senate. They planned to take this to the Senate in February or March, but
They expected the people that understand that, and study, that ninety percent
What
That this bill is never going to be approved
Yes it's barbaric. But simply, it's been that.
Hi.
Mauricio.
Hi.
How are you Mauricio?
How are you Maurico, how is it going? Paulo speaking.
Oh, Paulo.
How are you? It's my pleasure. Where are you from?
No, I'm from Panama, I thought that you were Mauricio from, from Argentina. How are you? I am, Jaime, from New York.
Your name is?
Jaime.
Jaime. Mariano, you were saying, from Argentina, maybe
Mariano
Mariano, my friend, speaks all day long.
Yes.
By phone.
How are you?
How are things going?
Thanks God
How is it over there? Cold no ?
It's very cold. Same as there, no?
Yes, the same here
We almost have, almost
The whole week below zero and
Well
Here we are inside, having a few beers, warm
Christmas is in the air
What are we gonna do about it? Do we talk a very hard subject, immigration?
Yes, that's a very delicate subject.
Yes, i don't know if immigrants are necessary to the United States, i say let it get filled with immigrants here, the United States, it's complicated to work, right?
Very delicate, yes, it's complicated, and the problem is that i don't really think there is
How can I say it? A shock on the economy.
Right
What they have done is helped, because there really are jobs that the locals don't want to do
Sure
Immigrants are needed to shake this a little bit, how can I say it?
Yeah, cheap manpower, that's what we call it, i don't know how you call it
They don't want to work in a meat store, they don't want to do delivery, they prefer to be in the welfare system to
Before doing a cheap manpower job
Yes
Something unqualified
None
Meanwhile, the only personswho do that are the students themselves, or the immigrants, for
It's the immigrants, yes
For need. So, I really don't think it is any economical problem it turns out to be some kind of competence. That
How you call it? when you are unemployed
None
Unemployment, and they send you to look for a job, and you do
None
Of course, you won't talk about that you went to, well, looking for a job to, to a shop to do delivery and so
Sure
But, this jobs, if it was nor for the immigrants, no one would take them
Nobody takes them
Exactly. Nobody does them.
No, I think this gives energy to this country, all the immigrants. Just look, all the food places where the people from Mexico are working
They get paid
None
Little money. It is all right for them.
Yes
I don't know.  At least they have the chance to work, in Mexico, and maybe also in our country is difficult enough
I agree that it is people we need here and it is good for the country because it is cheap labor, I was working in construction for some time also
Yes.
Working here was Spanish speakers, Latinos and a lot of Africans.
Thing that the national doesn't want to do. You see? Because he is too strong, or rather too, this
Sure. Yes.
I, What I have,  I consider, for example, okay,  the issue of immigration, how it relates to, they treat the amnesty issue of immigrants as it relates to
The illegal flow that comes to the country.
None
Yes, they can control that about the borders.
Yes, yes.
The thing is that there is authority, that clouds the vision, for for, because the traffic, also, eh, is beneficial to them. Right? The traffic of illegals,
Sure it is.
And the rest of them.
Yes, it is beneficial for them.
I would have to say that the Government of the United states should have this
To not say that's going to be, this, How I say it you? the right to stay here, that they register, taxes
None
They let the authorities know about the taxes that they could generate for the country.
Yes.
And the help that this could represent for the economy.
I think that's the plan. They've told me that you've already planned to not swindle the people, or to give the citizens papers.
But yes they can pay the tax. But, anyway I don't see it like that either, there are people that are working for many years like that. I have known a lot of people here
That for twelve years, they've been working and they haven't been given their papers, five or six years working to get papers. They are people that are very hard workers and been behaving well day after day.
They've got to make it easier to get papers. Right?
I think just like you. Right? As an immigrant, I think that these people
And well, in two, three years, you realize who is good or bad people, if they're a worker or not, and there you go. And then they have to facilitate getting papers. The other day I was reading in the newspaper
Yes. yes.
If you become a Marine, in four or five months they give you papers.
Really?
Yes, if you do enlist in the Army
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
In four or five months, they give you your papers. If you're a worker or a laborer, you're working. What do I know? Five years
Well. Exactly.
It's like that
For example, the system that you are talking about, they are going to monitor
None
To those persona, and about the taxes, to what kind of problem that gets you into,
With this number, people can also report cases of abuse
None
They have the right to deport them but take the liberty not to.
Oing to have problems with the authorities. But, at least, the authority, they can monitor these people, without them really have
The rights of a citizen, the rights of a, resident person
Yes
But, that is already on survey, I mean that has something to do, for instance like me, I was working with a person here in the.
About abuse, women's abuse
None
Physical and mental
None
In same week and same survey
Oh, the system, really?
Yes, but then she led  me to believe that she was a Mexican, and she led me to believe that she really
I was living that situation
None
There are many people who don't report because they are afraid.
None
We are afraid of the system because we are illegals
None
I told her, where are you from? and she told me, no, I am from California. Alright, I have been in California, I know the amount
Illegals there
Oh, yes. Right?
The working mass, yes. There are far too many.
Yes, I was being told too much just yesterday.
Them he told me, he told me, yes, there are people who don't report because we have immigration problems, and we are afraid, you know what I mean? Then
Yes. Yes.
So I say, with this number, with this social security or with this tax ID? this situation of the person being her and paying his taxes
He must have some privileges, some rights
None
At least the government and is scanning and knows where.
Yes,it's alright
Because just dropping us like this, because there are no documents...
To be abused. A friend of mine worked once in a pizzeria and the man
Yes, yes
Worked for a week, that week was left in fund, then he worked another week, he got paid, then he worked another week more, he didn't like it much and he only got paid half salary
That happens often, right?
Yes when he quilted.
None
The man didn't want to pay him for the time he had worked. So he worked almost two weeks fro free
Look
Do you know what I mean?
Yes
So, these people have no support at all, there is nobody who actually watches over them.
Who will they complain to?
Who're they gonna complain to?
None
And, I have found a bunch of cases like that.
That's horrible
Yeah, once, a boy  in a discount store
None
A beauty discount
Correct.
He worked there supplying and putting things on the shelves for inventory.
Right
Suddenly, he realizes that people comes and steal
Yes
He caught two guys that were stealing
Yes
He took their articles and he told them, look, they're stealing from you, and the owner came and he thanked him. The guys were waiting for him outside at closing hour and they beat him up babdly, they sent him to the hospital.
Oh, look at that
The owner was the beneficiary, why didn't he do anything?
He didn't do anything
He didn't do anything, so the guys took, the day they gave him the beating, they took his money
None
And they had to send him to the hospital because the man was bleeding there, someone found him
None
The hospital sent a very expensive bill.
Huge, right?, it was expensive, of course
After that, yes. Every pay day they waited for him outside.
Yes
And they stole his money
He had a really bad tome
Bad, because of that situation
Look at that
I'm telling you, because he was afraid of not knowing where to report that, to the police,
He couldn't do anything
He couldn't do anything
He's alone
Exactly, do you understand? If there's one entity that can give them the tax register, that
That can help them with certain
Hello, this is Vanesa speaking, from San Diego
Yes Rafael's speaking from Vancouver, Canada, nice to meet you
How are you? Is it cold over there today?
No it's nice here we've had some very sunny days and the truth that we can't complain this December, it was the nicest December in a long time
How nice
Of San Diego I don't ask anything because everything is said, everything is said so Vanessa I eh is like saying I'm going to the table and I know there will be good food in San Diego
In other words, you've come here already.
Yes no I was there a long time ago, I remember, and very nice. I was traveling around all of California from the north to the south. I went 'til almost the border
How nice, what an interesting trip. The truth is that the coast of California is incredible
Have you been more to the north?
Yes, I drove a little after San Francisco, but I would like to go. That's one of my dreams before moving from here
Well here I'm here by the accent, what part are you from?
I'm originally from Puerto Rico.
Puerto Rico, I bet you don't know where I'm from?
Argentina
How fast are the Argentinians identified
But what a beautiful accent
I'm married to a Mexican, you know.
Pardon
I am married to a Mexican.
None
And you tell me that your are in love with the Argentinian accent
Yes, that is true. To me, from all Latin American accents, it is the most beautiful. It truly is.
Is it the most beautiful from all the Latin American accents to you?
Yes
Thank you very much from my part because we are around thirty seven or thirty eight millions of Argentinians
Have a little piece of it
Yes it is very beautiful
And, how long have you been in San Diego?
Since 2001
Nd are you going to stay there a little bit more time or are you
Yes my husband is in the navy he is a sailor
He is working in the navy but lets say you are traveling
Yes he travels a lot but this is the base where we are now and if God wants we are going to be here until two thousand and seven
After that he could be transferred to another place
Yes before being here we were in Louisiana and I met him there
From Louisiana base
Yes, in New Orleans.
What and where do you like most? I think that you like most of California right?
None
And because New Orleans is not a city, I don't know how it is now but
It doesn't compare
No, no, it doesn't tell me much as far as the quality of life
None
Eighteen hundreds
Yes
You don't find that here in California it has many flavors
Yes
Very nice city with  things from when the French and Spanish were there
Sure yes it has a lot of history that's true and speaking of history because I heard at the beginning of the conversation that one of the topics, the topic of the day
The topic of immigration
Yes,
I say I'm also an immigrant
Sure
I've been in Canada for fifteen years
None
I'm already Canadian and I travel to Argentina to see my mother my siblings, nieces and nephews but I've already adapted here, I feel very comfortable,
Like an immigrant
Yes
And I think that Vancouver, where I live, is a very cosmopolitan city. There are many immigrants from many parts of the world. We all share in some way
Its own characteristics, that's what has made him bigger and I believe that immigration in general, we are talking about a certain type of a more qualified immigration cause
Sure
There's people that I mean, are criminals all over the world, no?
Yes
And that's something but we are talking about people that have a certain type of idea, of progress or of doing something, to plan something
We all speak Spanish and of course, English of the United States is our second language
And that implies that this is important because our cultures are mixing and people want to get to know the Hispanics and so on
And it happens the same thing here, I think, San Diego, how can I say it? I think they all must speak Spanish, right? It's normal.
Yes, many Mexicans and I, before I moved to this house where I'm living now, I was living in a city that is near the border and I would walk a mile in the beach and
I would be in Mexico and I was embarrassed because we as Americans or the United States, we can go into Mexico when we want and so, it's not
The Mexicans they, obviously can't come in here as they please and I don't like that.
I'm no expert in this subject but at least, I see that the situation that we now see in our borders
Is that there are many many problems, and obviously, that's not positive and it doesn't show a good image of us. I think that the United States wants to change that image
To be flexible about not having to live under this psychosis regarding the immigrants because the immigrants, in the end, they were immigrants too, the ones that first got here.
To the United States, they were all immigrants.
Yes
I don't understand why they now discriminate people if I believe that immigrants contribute or in general, immigration
It doesn't matter where they are from because each of them has its own culture and its own traditions and languages, but in general,
None
I believe they bring growth and a supply of fresh blood to wherever they settle, the immigrants.
Yeah I agree but and I'm an immigrant too right I understand wanting to have a better life but so even to what point are they going to open the doors to the United States
In reality, people die every day trying to come here because everyone wants the better life that supposedly we have here in the United States
Even to the point that they could open the doors and it's not really going to affect things too much. Not just our quality of life here but for people that
In Europe, now that they're the European Union, what's happening is they're opening their doors to other countries and
This is causing lots of problems
I think everything's extreme. It's not the the most opportune thing, but I'd have to do things with a certain set of criteria. I say criteria because, in Canada they have the policy
On organized immigration means that there are lots of them even every year there's even a minister of immigration. They could perfectly well do the same thing here. Does the United States have a minister of immigration?
I know they have different quotas I mean different amounts of people that they allow from each country I really don't know how they choose the different people
That's the green card, you're talking about the green card.
But exactly.
That's a lottery you're talking about
I don't know exactly what the details are about how things work here but I know that some countries just
They only allow a certain amount of people to come into the country every year but I don't know the details now with NAFTA
Mexicans can show that they have a job in the United States. They come here to work and sometimes to live. But they can't come in.
But from other countries I don't know.
But, for example, if they get a job and you come into the country, it's for the number of years it's been renewed
Hello?
Yes
It's been renewed they're people who work here not because of the opportunity
I agree
I think that to put this in a state of xenophobia against foreign is not in general good
Besides in America that in general is a country of immigrants, so nobody can say I have not drink from this water
In this aspect, we would have to be a little bit more tolerant, the concept is that the United States should have a policy.
More flexible there are a lot of people I don't know how many who are illegal.
Yes
I dont know how many create a serious problem inside to find a way those people already have or working and have years
They must have rights, they have demonstrated that they came to work.
Ou choose the place they cannot forbid because at last the man puts the border
The world in theory belongs to all we can have, we could have access, and when we have good intentions, we are people without criminal eagerness, terrorists or other things.
And well I think that there is where they should put the law and that is obviously they are going to give a renew
To approve so it is possible in any country.
Yes
Can have a better quality with a university degree.
None
Yes I hear you.
If not, is a very difficult situation because I feel that because somehow I would like everyone to be welcome
Hello. Good evening.
Hello, how is it going? good evening.
Good evening. My name, Shaun, I'm talking from Toronto, Canada. What's your name?
How are you Saun? my name is Paula and I'm in Boston.
In Boston, no, I don't know. I've never gone. They say that it's a city with a lot of history and of
Of a lot of culture. Is it true?
Supposedly here is where all the independence movement of the United States started and it's where the pilgrims arrived
So it is definitely a city with a lot of history, and is a very beautiful city also.  How is Toronto?
I'm here visiting. I'm from Toronto but right now I live in Vancouver there in British Columbia
They told me that Vancouver is wonderful.
Yes, is wonderful but I returned here to Toronto for Christmas, to visit my family
None
Vancouver is different from Toronto. There's a lot of snow and it's very cold but not in Vancouver.
No?
No,
No?
A little bit of rain and some days of snow. But usually, it hardly snows there in the city of Vancouver.
None
But there are a lot of mountains that are not far from Vancouver.
Yes I knew a guy who was from Vancouver and he would tell me you could go skiing in shorts
Yes? I don't understand, I still haven't gone yet. But, I think that, for example, in these months, I can't
Yes you can go, for example, if you take a helicopter to a hill where there's snow all year round.
No, I don't understand what that was with the liquid but here it's more when the winter
Up high
Yes.
Always snow on the highest peaks. But I wouldn't want to go wearing shorts
Yeah
One fall.
I think that he's talking about how warm it is that you could
Yes
Ski or
IT's warm in Vancouver it's four, five degrees out
But
Yes
One hour outside of the city you go up a hill and there is snow and ten degrees below zero
Yes
Yes, it's kind of strange how the climates vary, go just a little but, over well, by the mountains  and the sea, ocean also
None
There's a  variety of climates
And how come you speak Spanish if you're from Toronto?
I'm part Canadian, part Mexican.
You grew up in Toronto.
Nd so yes, from here from Toronto. And where are you from?
I'm Argentinian. Address me by you.
From Argentina.
Yes, from Buenos Aires.
None
None
There's a desert I believe, I don't know if it's in Argentina or Chile. There are parts of Argentina that are very close to the border of Chile, right?
Chile and Argentina share a border, the Andes.
By the south of Chile there's a desert there called Atacama, or something like that.
It it north?
No is not the north
It's not embarrassing I'm not sure
None
Yes
I worked, for some that went there to Chile to film by
Yes
The border of Argentina, Chile, they were filming the sport of kayak
Yes
The river is very well known
Yes.
Yes, it's
Of Argentina
They were in Chile.
None
But I think that the river goes by both sides. by Argentina, and by Chile.
None
It looked good
Yes
Great, that is the river of the kayak and the white waters
Yes  the south of Argentina and of Chile is also beautiful.
This is not developed.
Yes is true.
None
Is very, very beautiful.
Yes
So man, what do you do? what do you work in?
I'm an artist.
Really?
Yes, actor and writer
Yes
I do several plays, commercials, things like that so not yet a star,
Sure
That's my career.
What have you acted in lately?
Soon I come out in a play that's called Tony and Tina's wedding. I don't know if there's in Boston of of those plays, it's call-
Tony and Tina's wedding?
The weekends
Yes, how nice
Yes, there's a lot of, of those well, the same play but they do it in different places. Maybe there in Boston, I don't know.
Sure
I did a commercial a few months ago and things like that so. To keep on is a struggle so, like any other
Is also a sacrifice
Are you a student there in Boston?
No, I was a student up to last year and now, I do cancer research.
Are you working for John Hopkins?
No, John Hopkins is in Maryland
Maryland
Sure
Is Marylan far away? It is more or less nearby, no?
No, Maryland no, it's not too close. I think that by plane it must be like an hour, an hour and a half.
None
From
Are you in Harvard?
Well, yes I'm in Dayna Harvard which is like it's affiliated with Harvard.
In Harvard.
I've been working there since April, and happy
That's good what research are you doing there?
About cancer.
About the cancer, yes.
Yes
I had an aunt that died lung cancer
None
Three years ago
I'm sorry
The best research that you can do against lung cancer is not to smoke, no?
Did she smoke a lot?
Yes she smoked a lot. So that
None
One day, there are hopes for some types of cancer that
Yes, that's why we're working.
None
Shaun, I think we have to talk about the rent.
Yes We have to see, but I don't know well, is like they've told me, the organizers of that
That research that they are doing is something suggested.  But if you walk to talk about that.
You don't have to? I thought we had to talk of the topic.
No is not completely necessary, for example, they suggest the topic, right? so that if one doesn't have anything to talk about.
Then you don't have to talk of, no
Yes, if there's nothing else to talk about you can talk about the topic. But
Sure
They say that is only a suggestion.
Better. And how did you find out about this program?
Yes, I saw it on the internet, Craigslist I think.
They told me.
You have Craig's list there in Boston?
Yes there is.
Yes in well in every city there's a Craig's list right?
Yes
They were looking for speak
Yes
Only me, I hope it pays. That's the point, you will do your twenty-five calls and then you will be left without
I'm talking on my cell phone
Nothing
So, I hope they pay
Yes, me too. And they said they would pay some extra fifty dollars if you do five calls from five different phones. Did you hear that?
Yes I heard that. I have already talked from two different ones. How many did you talk from?
It will the fourth, but I'll make the five, for instance I've talked from here in Toronto and my house in Vancouver already. I think I can make the five different places
Sure, yes, how many calls have you done?
This one I'm doing with you will be number nine already
You are my second call.
The second one, right?
None
None
I just started. I knew through a friend of a friend who had done it
I see
But no, I don't know if he had finished and if he had been paid, or how much it takes to get paid, right?
I hope they pay for Christmas, extra money for Christmas
I hadn't thought about that. that would be nice
Yes, me too. I've heard it takes from eight to twelve weeks once the study is finished
Yes
The check arrives.
Yes, sure, let's hope it arrives. Totally
Even if it arrives
That it arrives just when I have to pay my cell phone bill
How do you say landline in Spanish?
A fixed phone
Where I can talk, but, sometimes I've received a call from, cell phone, but it was at night and during weekends, when it's free.
Sure
Yes
That's the best part but I don't have a
Yes
Landline. So this is the only way I have
Yes, me too, where I'm staying, in a girlfriend's house, she lent me her phone, I am
Sure
I make local calls and how do you stay toll free?
We don't have those
None
None
No
Toll free.
Well toll free
I suppose. yes, a call, free.
None
Free.
Yes and right now is there cold in Boston or is there snow?
There are many - Do you talk about Celsius, or Fahrenheit?
Celsius.
Celsius. I think we have it is felt like minus seven and there was minus five
There is snow too.
It snowed when was the last time it snowed? Friday last week.
None
No, last week it did not, the one before that one. But it was so cold that there is still snow. Then what we have is
A little of snow, but there is too much ice.
None
Then all the houses are covered by ice.
Let's see if, hopefully, it will be a white Christmas.
Hopefully. It looks to me that it will not, besides I saw that
This is Vanesa from San Diego.
Hello Vanessa, it's Elena. I'n visiting Miami now and live in Boston.
That's a big change of weather!
That's so true, I just got here and I'm so happy here because the cold in Boston is terrible
Yes, I've heard that lately, it's been pretty cold in the East.
We had around eleven degrees
My grandmother lives in Miami. I do like Miami but in my opinion it's to hot.
Sure, it is during the summer, the summer is pretty hot here.
Yes, I used to live in the South, in Louisiana and the weather there was also hot and humid.
Sure and in San Diego you have the perfect climate, isn't it?
It's perfect. It's amazing how pretty it is. Right now we have around seventy degrees and during the nights it goes down to sixty.
I live close to the beach and we have the same weather throughout the year.
Oh, that's nice. I sometimes think that, although I have a job, quality life here in Boston is not good because of the weather, right?
And speaking about today's subject, is housing expensive and hard to find in Boston?
It's quite expensive. You end-up living in an old, small place with rats. My sister used to line in a small apartment in Boston, and
None
With rats and nothing, lets say that no, she couldn't have a washtub and spend two thousand dollars
None.
She lives in a private neighborhood with two bathrooms, one in each story, it's unbelievable.
Yes, it's amazing, here in San Diego it's also like that but for two thousand dollars you can get a decent place. I do think that Boston is more expensive.
Look, yes, no, but the truth that Boston is really expensive. I know the truth, with the topic of today I don't know what to say because
I've been here a year and I'm renting. I don't know if I will stay living here, I don't think about buying.
Yes, when we came to San Diego, let's say that a house that's two thousand square feet, for a family of five, pretty comfortable.
Was about three hundred thousand dollars, and now you can't get, in five years it's gone up so you can't get anything of these size under seven hundred thousand
Like the prices have more than doubled in five years.
Yes, I got into. It's amazing how they went up, but, so, what are you going to do? Spend your whole life renting?
No, and this money putting it all
Yes.
In a credit to buy a house
I prefer to rent because it is cheaper than buying.
Buying isn't only the price, it's the taxes you have to pay and so you have to repair it if something breaks. I think that it comes out much more expensive.
To buy
It's really difficult here, it's expensive
Yes, but you have to pay this. I know, because the climate is so nice and it's such a pretty city, people are disposed to paying this amount of money.
How long have you been living there?
Since 2001
Where are you from?
Originally I was born in Spain and I grew up in Puerto Rico and I'm in Louisiana, in the United States, since the eighties.
From Puerto Rico, yes everything is right.
Yes.
I talk most to Puerto Ricans.
Are there many in Boston?
I am from, how?
Are there many of us there in Boston?
Yes, there are a bunch of them
None
With this telephone, calls were always made to Puerto Ricans
Yes.
But, no, I talked to an Uruguayan. I am Argentinian too. I don't know if you notice it by the accent
Yes, I notice it. I have talked with someone from Argentina, from Venezuela, from Mexico, I think the one from Colombia. With many. Yes, I have been doing this
For a time. And you?
You get informed about another things, and we earn some money.
I have really liked it. And Why are you in Boston
I recieved a doctorate in genetics and I came here to Boston to get a post-doctorate.
WOW
In an university.
Which one?
In Tufts.
Can you say it?
Tufts University
Yes. How nice. How interesting. Wow.
Yes, the truth that
And you don't plan on returning?
And what happens is that I've been here a year already and practically no, the climate is not for me. I don't want to live in a place with a climate like that, so
Yes.
Boston is not going to be that
Yes
I love Buenos Aires my city, my people.
Easy to buy the reagents and over there is very expensive, and is complicated to do research and work in what I want.
Yes.
But
Well.
I hear you.
No, I don't know them well and then you are thinking of Miami, of your family, perhaps.
We are here my sister with her husband also my nephew, my brother
Yes what happens is,the summer in Boston is beautiful and the quality of people too and the
No, everything is very cultured and you always talk with someone who studies this, that works.
Yes.
Is very nice, everything super interesting
Yes.
In summer you love it, but later it starts the minus eleven degrees, the snow, and it freezes, it rains and there you remember
How ugly it is, right?  everybody stays home and is a little unsociable, then, the city and the people are sad in winter
It's not worth it.
You're right.
And the houses are small and everything is very expensive. And for everything to be so small, dirty, and with rats, how can it be no?
I didn't imagine things were so bad there.
No.
In that regard.
Yes, is that yes, I just rented with a friend a very nice apartment without laundry. I have to climb three floors by stairs because there's no elevator, everything is very old.
Yes.
In a very nice neighborhood but, it cost us one thousand six hundred dollars
For each one.
No, no, both, an apartment with two bedrooms.
None
In the best Neighbourhood only
For everything, $15,500?
One thousand six hundred.
One thousand six hundred. yes, is a little expensive.
Sure. Without laundry, without elevator, without anything. So is that one used to it, because it's what you see here. You can't imagine that
There can be something better, right, for the money? So then one starts getting used to it sometimes.
Yes then hold on there until you decide what you can do, because you already finished the doctorate and you are doing now in
The post doctorate.
None
Sure, perhaps later
How
I came here, but i would also like to go to California.
Yes, here it's beautiful and there are many opportunities in that in the branch of
Yes.
Of biotech and things related to that
And what do you do there?
I work in an employment agency
Look at that.
I was a civil engineer but did not like to engineering.
Sure, the , sometimes is good and sometimes no because perhaps someone comes and cries, I don't have a job, no, and it's kind of sad
It is very sad that the immigrants from Mexico come and don't speak English and want to work but don't have the necessary papers
Is very good when I can find people a job and that
Yes, sometimes
And is
Yes,
And is very interesting, and the day flies by, and I like it. You have to think but you don't have to think that much that I don't get home with a headache.
Sure.
I'll see if I stay with this, before that, for five years I was teaching.
And what did you teach?
I taught kids all subjects, kids that are home schooled, I would give them Spanish or math classes
None
And I was doing that.
Are there a lot of kids that are home schooled and don't go to school?
Yes, I home schooled mine for four years
Why did you decide that?
Because the schools here are really, not so good there's no, they don't provide good education to the kids and there's a lot of kids who
I find that the kids are very spoiled, disrespectful, and they don't really go to school to learn. I didn't want my kids to be in that.
But now that they are in a school that we found which is very good and they can be there
Okay and then you would teach them you sat with them an hour a day, that's how you taught them, what did you buy the,
Yes.
The same book
I would give classes in my house on various subjects to make money
Could be with other students, not just be them only in the house all the time
None
And I liked it a lot.
How fun, yes, that's good.
Yes, I really learned a lot by teaching the kids. I learned more than what I learned in the University, that's the truth.
I say that the best way of learning is by teaching.
Yes.
Because you have to understand and think about the questions they might ask, so you end up learning a lot.
Yes, I really like it, all the subjects that I had studied in the University. I learned them and now I can write pretty well, I didn't use to write before
Hello
Hello
Hello, how are you?
Hey, oh, hello
Hey, we have already spoken right?
Oh yes, I do recognize your voice.
It's good we have a chance to talk again.
You are Juan from San Antonio
Exactly, that's right
My name is Lorena
Aha Branch
How have you been?
We are now to discuss housing subjects. What do you think? It's a very basic subject. It's like they were asking us about food.
None
What do you think about it? What are the benefits of owning a house instead of leasing?
I was once told that Jews never buy houses becausr if you have a lot of money you can lease a big house
For a lot less of money of what would cost you to buy one, build one
Buy one
Buy one
None
No
None
It is simply a question of money. If you have little money, the impact of the rent on your expenses is very high. If you have a lot of money the impact of the rent is lesser, so that
Like always things are relative it depends on the circumstances of each person
Of course they are relative to the global income you have, no
None
Monthly
None
Because it is another illusion to say, Well I am going to buy a house and I will take out a mortgage I am going to be paying.
Well the same that I would pay for a rent to buy my house, and I have always think that like an illusion, because I paid and paid.
None
In thirty years you would finish to pay the mortgage
In effect
The, the psychological question is always more positive when you say I am paying for something that is going to be mine. because if you pay a rent there is always the
Sensation that you are wasting your money, no
It is like  That could happens but as you say there are thirty years of being paying and if for any reason you fall behind two or three months you lose everything
Yes, they can take it out. Yes, that is such a terrible thing.
Then that could be serious, right?
None
The issue turns hard to have a plan
Yes, it's a very. very serious commitment, if enter one and it's also that, no, the largest companies that sell new houses and that have furthermore
Their own mortgage company and still no man they sell you on the house like its a facility,you wont have to put a deposit or closing costs  or pay this,enter it
Yeah
And even though it's a house that's really pretty big and that at best the payments are going to be high and a pretty big effort for your level
All of the marketing gimmicks that they have you know to sell the house
In effect that happens, yes. You always go with the optimistic outlook that things are going to go great in life, and that here you won't have any sort of setbacks for the next thirty years
Sure you'll have a job, you'll have income, you won't get sick eh, none of this uncertainty for any reason, well yes actually
None
Yes
It's double edged sword, right
Well it's that anybody could get caught up by this business, I tell you, I always
Yes, now on the other hand, in the state of Texas, the price of housing are pretty affordable compared to the other state of the United States
Well this
Yeah
Right now the housing market is at a truly impressive peak. They are building houses as if they are baking bread.
I sometime say where are the people coming form that buy so many houses,
Yes, it's incredible and that's happening in a lot of places. I think there is a large amount of internal immigration and international towards here.
There's a way that there's a very interesting market for the builders of housing and in general for all real estate.
None
That's observable, a lot of people come from California and they establish themselves here easily
Yes, me too
Yes
I have heard that it is at least at half the price of what the houses were costing in California. Here in Texas state
Yes, I think that I've heard it too and it is much more economic. A house here costs a hundred and twenty, a hundred and fifty thousand. There it may cost
Five hundred, up to a third part, more or less
None
So
Yes
I guess there is a relation more or less interesting with salaries, with the income you can get in California, because they live much better here, right?
Of what they could
None
Living there, and the same on other states or cities
Precisely in these conversations, the other day I talked to a woman from Guatemala who lives in Los Angeles,
She told me that her husband was only earning nine dollars an hour, which means that there is not a big difference, or we also have to consider
There are certain economic areas of the society that are always marginalized, and have more difficulties to reach, those goods
Yes, that may be true, but I think that there is a sector who is in that situation. I guess from what I've heard from other professional areas
They earn much more in California than in Texas
None
That might be a working class person
Yes
Unqualified people, I don't know. There's a low level of employment and in this case if you get a pretty low salary
Yeah
There's no reason for it to be very high, but the professionals get a really high salary in California, as I understand.
Well about that question
And the percentage
The question that are making us do they said that there's a little housing bubble here in the region
Well the stats they show that if there is a bubble, there is a notable increase in prices, fifteen per cent per year in price of real estate
Yeah
It isn't a very elevated bubble, that's not such a great growth as a high that shot up, like what happened in California, New York, or other cities.
Well they doubled or tripled in price every year after in the case , they were growing about fifteen percent, to mean thats an increase
Very good for investors, but it's relatively small when compared to other locations, well I guess that some investors they should of been in California instead of trying to sell something here in Texas
No but it's something important because also the other day
Yeah
Was reading some news that was indicating that there had been almost one thousand five hundred houses available last year that hadn't been sold.
None
You know that were here like they had already came
Returning back here
It would be so important as a business but it's not the same situation here
According to all the forecasters it's going to keep on growing at least for the next four years. Anyway, that would seem to be good. Yes if there had been an inflation bubble with the housing prices on a national scale
A lot of people discovered here that this area is growing and is going to keep on especially because of our region's economy. More people are going to keep arriving even though it's so spread out
It go slow, right.
None
It is growing that will spend another four years with the actual tendency.
None
If they do not stop it in four years this is growing. That is the point while on average across the country the prices have stopped.
On average, like in another regions, no, that could be growing
None
Average How does it looks to you?
It is very interesting that for example, compared to other countries, like Mexico, the cost of a family house here
Is inferior to the cost over there in a country with less economical development, no, then this
Exactly
Always is contradictory and interesting
When in some places it looks like they have lower prices, they have higher
None
Those are surprises. things of the market
None
But as it is said, there are some capitals that define and move the things in a way that they are always trying to earn the big ones, no
N this case I think that the way the big companies are building here, it means that the signals are good for the region.
Always be aware to see what the big ones are doing to the small ones
Yes
Ones can do something
On the other hand.
James, from New York
Hello, yes, who am i talking to?
James from New York
How re you?, you're talking to George, also from New York
Hi, how are you?
What do you think about the subject?
I don't understand what's that bubble that's
I imagine we're the same, I really don't know. I imagine that's like sudden elevated prices or something like that. I really don't know
None
They surprised me with that term
It depends on the area, what house you're thinking about, because if you go to
Yes
North Carolina, you can find a house for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars, that's a mansion
None
Right? If your here in New York, it's rare to find an apartment there on the Bronx.
None
For that price, do you know what i mean?
Yes.
To me it's important to have, like I said a piece of a house.
A property
Or a property, yes, because really with the housing prices going up, and the most important for
Yes
I told you,  after you, sure. how do you say?
Independence
Are you independent from your parents or did you have to look for a way to find a property, and you know when this
What do you think changes this and has value?
But it's like an investment, or
Yes, like an investment and to live also because with the prices in New York
The rents
The rent is really expensive
Yes, what they ask
You have something like a strong
But what do you think of the costs of maintaining an apartment or a house here in New York
Because you start to think you can pay for an apartment, and we'll put a price of $200,000
Two hundred thousand dollars to say the cheapest a good apartment more or not in a very good area but two hundred thousand dollars maintenance.
Five or six hundred dollars down,We;ll get you a mortgage for fifteen hundred dollars a month.
None
Between maintenance, the rent right now for this same apartment you will pay around one thousand eight hundred, one thousand nine hundred to two thousand dollars
Yes
Understand?
None
When you stop paying, the place is no longer yours, you must leave, and find some other place where they will charge you the twenty percent of what you were paying before
Yes, I show apartments for a company called Manhattan Apartments
Yes
Here in New York, honestly, there are no properties for rent in a good area, a good place for less than
Two thousand three hundred, two thousand five hundred, for something decent
Yes, in what area?
What you find for less have mouse holes, it is profitable, but it is not worth it
Yes
It is not worth it, you know what I mean?
Yes, I have seen apartments around here for one thousand six hundred but in houses, almost basements
Yes, it's very correct
The average for one room is about one thousand four hundred.
None
I am talking about Queens, I don't know, in Manhattan it is much more expensive
There are some on that price, you can find some more, in Manhattan at least, there are no
No in Manhattan it is impossible
There aren't, it doesn't exist
I have an apartment with a stable rent, but that is really hard to find
Where do you live, in what part?
No, I live in Manhattan.
In Manhattan, yes. But that is like
Two bedrooms
That as you say is a privilege
Yes because next door, the same apartment cost almost two thousand dollars
You see
In the building next door that they fixed up not too long ago
Okay
Not the rest, if you go downtown, sectors like this are very expensive.
Yes, so then let's say that you, well, that you don't have the luck of having this apartment
Yes
I managed to get an apartment by the grace of God
None
The apartment right now is valued for three times the price that I paid.
Where do you have the apartment?
I have an apartment in Iverdale, I don't know if you are familiar with that area, the street is called Lakeview the apartment is lakeview that would be  two hundred sixty four by there
Yes, the advantage of having a property is the appreciation
But yes, the apartment when I bought it two years ago
Yes
I paid fifty thousand dollars for the
Any apartment right now cost almost four hundred thousand dollars
Right now the apartment, yes, is valued in 180
How big is it?
Is big remember that
Yes I think it's worth more
Yes, remember that the more uptown you go
None
The bigger the apartments are
Yes
None
With two hundred thousand, you don't find an apartment here in New York, nor in the Bronx nor anywhere.
You hardly can
Very hard
You can find it, but hardly, no?
Last four years I think it has increased
None
Tremendously
Then
Tremendously
You feel calmer that the property is yours
None
If you have any problem, you can put it on the market to sell it.
I'm very scared to buy, especially in a condnominium of a building
You see and get money out of it
I don't know how people respond with the maintenance fees and all those types of things
Yes
One of those things. if the people are not responsible
Yes, but when, for example, you have a house at least
None
That's more more dangerous still
No, of course, and the inspectors, and that it is in bad conditions and that
Yes, when you have a house for example.
None
The oil is very expensive, like you say
The water
You already when you have a house are every week inside home depot buying and that
Yes,
You know you spend money you understand me, when you have an apartment for example the maintenance is fine  the repairs are done through the
The board
None
The apartment does have good funds. What you have to worry about is that they don't decrease too fast.
Yes i think that
And
The key here is that in my country, it's very different. If you have a good management
You don't have good management in that building
None
You're dead
Yes you're right.
The insurances
You're right
Maintenance obey the construction laws
For example a friend of mine bought an apartment also in Brooklyn like two years ago.
None
And he bought it in $50,000
Yes
That the day he bought it, the day of the closing.
Business
The business yes, then came a person from a real estate agent
Yes
And come and say that if he wanted to sell the apartment, because he had sold one down
Yes
He had showed it to some people, then the other one who didn't buy it
Yeah
Was looking for one in the same building
Yes
And offered, two hundred sixty thousand dollars
How come?
Can you believe it, two hundred sixty thousand dollars
Yes
None
Right now the same thing is happening, I was reading that it is also happening in New Jersey where the people are selling, and the next day, the one who bought it is wining two hundred thousand dollars
Not in all places too because I have a friend.
No, no it depends of the area
Yes I have a friend in Arizona
It is not that it is very cheap right now
Yes but eh
Everybody is going there
He bought a house in two hundred fifty thousand dollars
None
Only bought the plans of houses that
None.
They tell you how it's gonna be
Yes. Yes. Uh huh.
In three, four, or five months the house will be ready
Yes
In six months, the hose was supposed to be ready
Right?
And they stalled a little, because re-financing, it seems that people wasn't buying homes a lot
Yes
When the house was ready
What's it going to do?
Yeah, he sold it
There are a lot of people taking them. It's very quiet, I don't know what that is.
Yes he went to Las Vegas.
Yes
WITH THAT MONEY THREE HUNDRED, I WITH FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU GET A MANSION THERE YOU CAN'T ALMOST BUY HERE, BUT YOU CAN
Yeah. No. It's very hard here, and you really need to know where to buy
Right
Yes, i was looking at that for two months, but no
For this I tell you, that always, for me it's important that you will make a home, even if at the beginning you are going to be a little bit
Because, I'm going to tell you, if I already have a man with a large family
Of course
I grab it and sell the property that
Yes
Take this money and put it into a Downpayment or on a large property
Yes
Then the payments are going to be more confortable
Yes
Then anything is going to be more comfortable, I'm not going to put all the money into the property only that I take it and leave it in, leave a
You see, a part is in the bank in case of an emergency
Of course. To quit, give it
If you have a property, that's what I'm saying.  If you have the luck to have an established apartment.
Its very economic
It's economic, but I've seen people that are paying a hundred and fifty, there is one uncle of mine that his neighbors pay three thousand dollars in rent
It is going to be, not everything is impossible now.
If then
Many people are taking to the Bronx because people are leaving because they can't pay
And it's for this reason that the, in Manhattan, the number of people that I have showing apartments
Yes
Hello

Good evening, Aurelio from Washington -DC
From Washington DC. My name is Sean, I'm calling from Toronto, Canada.
Toronto, Canada. A pleasure. What's your name again?
Yes, Sean.
How are you?
There's a lot of snow
None
I came for Christmas. To Toronto, to visit family here.
How nice. Where are you from originally?
I'm from Canada. I'm half Canadian and half Mexican.
None
I was born in Toronto, but I lived in Mexico and in Canada. Right now I live in Vancouver, and I came here to visit the race.
Exactly. Spend the vacations there.
Yes, and where are you from?
I'm originally from Caracas, Venezuela.
From Venezuela.
Aha, yes.
They say that, Venezuela is the capital of beauty pageants.
Sure, Yes. They say it's one of the most beautiful in the world.
Yes, I say that there are many of them win ? the Miss Universe
Yes.
They are from Venezuela, it is true that many have surgeries to
No, that rarely happens unless she's an actress or something.
None
It might be pretty common nowadays
Plastic surgery
Not so much
None
Where would you like to go on vacations?
Well,  I'd love to go to Europe because I've never been there, I've traveled through Canada and the United States,
None
And Mexico, but not Europe. I still have to travel to Europe. It's the old world
The old continent, yes.
None
None
Last night I was speaking to one of my friends.
None
He was showing me his pictures of London, and
You like them.
Yes, England and Ireland have always grabbed my attention.
How nice
Yes, more, than, I mean, also, France and Spain, but more,  for a single trip, it would be too much, to know all of Europe.
Yes, I can imagine
Yes.
I have been to Europe many time.
And you?
Not too long ago, precisely, two weeks, we arrived from Italy my wife and I. We spent a week over there. In March we were also in Italy, again. I was in France.
I've been in England.  London I think that it is the capital of the world.
None
London is the city.
London.
That's the city of the world.
None
There are things you don't see anywhere else with a city whose culture is awake twenty four hours.
Restaurants of all types, people of all types is an incredible thing. It can't really be described with words. One, the people have to be there
To know
Exactly, to see it.
And realize, what it is,
Exactly, yes.
Yes, I remember reading the problems they have nowadays in Paris with the
None
The Muslims
Sure
They say that it has nothing to do with being a Muslim.
Whose fathers don't take care of them, who don't have two parents at home, and are only into the culture of
Violence and rap music, and all that
Sure
And, so.
Yes, well, it's horrible what happened there. it is a real shame for the French
None
Pretend to be an open, peaceful and civilized culture
Yes
Yes
I don't know Paris either. But I've heard that it is just like it looks like in the postcards. Many African people who went there
Who went there as refugees. apparently they are all hidden in the outskirts of the city
When I was in France you can see a lot of blacks, certainly. But not more than in London, let me tell you.
None
I was several days in France, in Paris specifically
None
And I have also been in London for one week. But I think it was a junction of things
Of many negative things
None
I'm in Paris but in London there are many black immigrants from Africa.
England was the colonizer. And the same with France
Yes.
I think that they are, also a part of the problem, those immigrants haven't had any chances
None
You know what I mean? I think that the English have been the only country that has colonized and has let that the country's culture,
For instance  as you can see the Indian culture, the Hindu culture has always maintained
MM, it was never destroyed, you know what I mean?
Yes
The English didn't do like it was done in this country, where they really destroyed the so called indians, because here in this country
None
It is a part of the problem that France had
Spain had also, when the Spaniards were the colonizers.
Then?
They went, right, they went to destroy Mexico, figure
Yes
Even nowadays I don't think Spain makes many concessions to the Latin American immigrants.
There are immigrants that go from Latin America to live in Spain. Are there many?
See, there are many Venezuelans.
None
In the years after the second World War, there were many Spanish that went to Venezuela as immigrants.
Then, that people was set there in Venezuela, had children in Venezuela, business and all that stuff. And then, in some way they are related to Venezuela.
None
And, of course, the children of Spanish born in Caracas, or in Venezuela, or in any part of the country, have relatives in Spain. Then, they have to,
Round trip. Now, the last I knew was that Spain, now is requiring a visa to all Venezuelans to travel to, to Spain.
To Spain?
Yes, and it was not like that before.Venezuelan citizens could travel to Spain without needing a visa.
None
Now they are requiring the visa.
It could be because many of them went there and stayed, or nothing else, are there?
I could not tell you. But, the Spanish have not given plenty of opportunity to immigrants
So, to Latin American immigrants. Do you understand me?
Yes.
Spanish culture is a very closed one.
Since they, establish as a Catholic State
None
Since the 1400's until Franco, they expelled all the Muslims and Jews
Oh, your God
All those things
Yes
After Franco and Franco failure was gone, it was when they opened them a little bit.
None
But, the culture is still closed. It's not like English people. Do you understand me? English people are a little more open.
On the contrary, what's its name? The phenomenon, the multiculturalism. This has worked against the system in England, because
Right
The immigrants remain closed.
None
They don't assimilate
They don't assimilate.
Exactly, yes
And there it grows, for example, there is an example that the terrorists, there, of Al-Qaeda, have grown there in England that
None
They have the mosques there where, where they go and say, well, that is too much, hm, the and, they take the poverty as an excuse to look for
Their soldiers in that war of terror exists.
You know what other thing I saw in England? We diverted from the topic a lot, supposedly they were vacations. When I was in England,
I discovered that there exists mix of races.here in the United States they say we are,
American people say that this country is a melting pot.
The small matter but is also doesn't matter
This is not a melting pot, if you compare it with England, for example. Here we do have lots of groups.
Yes.
The blacks are with the blacks, the Chinese are with the Chinese, the Japanese are with the Japanese, the Hispanics with other Hispanics.
Yes, it's the same as in Canada.
It's hard to see them mix, do you understand? You watch a commercial, for example
Hello!
Hi!
Hi!
My name is Solanne
I'm Solanne [Alicia]
Oh, Alicia
How are you?
Fine, thank you, and yourself?
I'm fine too, here in Atlanta, Georgia.

It's not as cold there as it is here right now.
No, obviously in the winter it's quite cold
Yes
Yeah, but for starters, it almost never snows, so that's already good
Ok, i thought i was mistaken, i thought it was the opposite, i thought it was colder, here than
None
That here
We are more to the south.
In Atlanta is not as cold is like
Sure but also is not as nice as in Florida that is never winter there, then
Then the topic we have today is
The trips.
The trips, well
Precisely
Precisely
And now you, Wouldn't you like to go to where is not cold? That's where I would go.
Where is it not cold, because I'm from a tropical country. I'm Dominican.
Yes so
And I like my heat
Yes.in the Caribbean, how did people live? there's never winter ?

I would really like to travel everywhere, i have been in China, i have been in Egypt and I've been in South America, in Europe, so
I really love traveling
Yes, that's good.
The part I would go to now, I would love to go to Bolivia.
To Bolivia, yes
Yes, because a lot of interesting things are happening now regarding politics
Like what? Ok
I find that very interesting
I would like to go to a place that's not too far away. Because first of all, i don't like planes
Really?
I don't like planes too much, but I would like to know another place
None
That's near and easy, because I'm lazy
Sure
I like to travel, I like to know, but I don't like
The effort, lets say
NO, PLANES, I DON'T LIKE THEM BECAUSE MANY HOURS

Just the United States
Yeah, and you don't care much about planes.
I would like to meet, i have a curiosity with Jerusalem
Oh, yes
None
Anyway
It's pretty far, and I would like to know Europe too, but I would have to throw out the
Sure
There is fear towards planes a little bit.
It's true, yes. It's terrible
Yes, my brother has invited me to Europe a lot. He travels regularly
Brothers?
In his vacations, he goes to Europe
None
And he's invited me several times but
Not that.
I still haven't decided. I can't.
Like if someone invited me to Europe, I'd be happy
Yes, he tells me you're going to love if you go
And yeah, where does he usually go?
England
None
He visits several places there, you know, because he does love to travel.
GOOD TO ME, THE TRUTH, PLANES DO, FOR EXAMPLE, I DO BACK TO CHILE APPROXIMATELY EVERY TWO YEARS BECAUSE IA AM ORIGINALLY CHILEAN AND I HAVE FAMILY
You're Chilean
Yes. I have my family there. Every two years, I go there. The plane trip os awful
Since they go through the Caribbean and the famous Bermuda Triangle

Okay
And there it was horribly cold, it even snowed for three straight months, it's something horrible
Wow
Sure,
Wow
There's like everything.
Yes.
INTERESTING THING OF CHILE,
Is like Colombia.
Colombia
I think that Colombia has, those same characteristics, that it has parts that are cold, parts that are mild, other parts there
Yes,
In the mornings it's a little cool, then cold at night.

Oh, of course
I always go to them. I have been there four times already this year. I wanted to go again in December
Until Easter, of course

Is true
I would've gone again to Santo Domingo.
None
My daughter is going now to spend New Years's eve
Shes going over there
She will be over there,
If you had the money, perhaps you would even live in Santo Domingo

Okay
They were offering for one or two thousand dollars one could be two, three weeks in a ship like that, traveling all over, or Asia, or Europe, or anywhere.
Listen how good, how good

Wow nice
We have been lucky in that yes,but it would be nice to know other cultures
Yes, you have to go to Israel, that culture is different, from the Middle East, kind of rough
None
The historic places are beautiful.
None
And there's a lot of contrast between each city.
None
In other words one goes to Jerusalem and is a historical culture
None
The architecture the city old something that you can't believe
None
Hello, this is Mariano from Philadelphia.
Hello, how are you? This is Luisa from Miami, Florida. From Philadelphia. How are you? Very good, yes.
How are you? Where are you from?
I'm from Colombia.
Colombia, you have the cutest accent in Latin America.
And where are you from?
From Argentina
I can tell
I can recognize the Columbian and the Venezuelan accents; those are the cutest ones in all Latin America.
Yes
Yes have you been in the United States for a long time?
I arrived here two years ago
Two years, Ive been here for eight months
That's so recent
Yes I don't know that much
A bit of time and
A bit
Are you bored, do you want to go back?
Not now, I'm studying a Doctorate and a post-doctorate here in the University of Pennsylvania,  I'm busy right now and I do miss things from my country but some other things are better here.
So in general, i'I happy
Of course
I made it
You traveled with your family?
No with my family, with my wife.
Your wife okay, good
Yes we are getting to know a lot, which is precisely today's topic
Yes
That we are traveling a lot, there are many places to get to know and that for me is one of the things I most like to travel
I don't know if
Travel and what places have you traveled to
Look
Besides Philadelphia
I was in New York, Washington, Boston, Virginia, New Hampshire
Quite good. I've been in a few places for the holiday break that there is between Christmas and new year
We are going to California
To California
That I have some friends so I'm going to start knowing a little that side over there
Sure and what has been the place that you've liked the best
I like Philadelphia a lot
Yes
But the cutest to me was Boston, it's very nice, New York is an impressive city, but
And crazy
Boston seemed to me.  Yes, do you know New York?
I know it now. Yes.
Yes, I like it but i think it's crushing
Yeah, very accelerated, everything's so fast
You're in Miami
I love it, I live in Miami, yes.
No  i am not living in miami
I live in Miami more or less since i got here
Well, i love Miami because of the weather and  the people. Miami is very good
It's quiet, even though it's a little bit more expensive than other places
Yes, right?
Because it's touristic, yes
Sure, but one of the possibilities i was considering, because i love the weather, i mean, the problem with these northern cities is the weather
For example, it's awful in Boston, even here in Philadelphia it's a very tough, very long winter, and i don't know, the truth is that in Miami you're fine the whole year
It's cold right now, but it's tolerable if you put on a sweater
Whats the temperature, for example?
I don't really know what's the temperature
Put a sweater and it's done
Yes, with a sweater that's it
In other words that eighteen, twenty degrees something like that well
If it doesn't manage to go down it doesn't manage to
Here, last week there was a day of eighteen degrees below zero, and that you die of cold yes later.
I would like to apply for some position in some university to be a professor or something like that perhaps I would leave more to the side of Florida
How nice.
That is
But that and then as far as today's topic to what place would you like to travel and with whom, tell me
Well one with whom my wife obviously
Obviously,
Yes I really don't have many options really
Oh, with your wife.
I would really like to go to what do you call it to Europe.
To Europe
Yes, but Europe is very expensive, but there is a lot to see and there is also something I really liked and would like to continue getting to know
All the parts of Central America, that even Colombia, that while is not in Central America, it faces the Caribbean, but I was in Guatemala, the south of Mexico and I liked it a lot and
And I want to know Costa Rica, Puerto Rico the the Colombian Caribbean which is in Cartagena of India
Santa Marta
Sure. All those places that are beautiful
Yes
So you are from Bogota
No, I'm from Pereira
Where's that.
It's between Bogota, Cali and Medellin
None
Is all in the center
Is it dangerous there?
No, it's a small city that's barely growing. There's no guerrilla there or anything like that. No.
There's no guerrilla
No is a peacful city
Where is the guerrilla? In the jungle
More in the jungle yes
More by the side of Brazil
Yes, more towards there, more like to the south, towards the Amazon.
Sure, and is a big problem right? There is Colombia
Yes that's a big problem, every day there you see kidnappings and in the news that they killed such person that they killed the other
How incredible
But thank God with the new president that we have he's putting a hard hand in the country and things are improving.
Really
I don't know if you've heard that they approved the law so that he could run again as candidate to the presidency and they are again to well like to re-elect him like that you understand me
None
Yes madam no my aunt talked to me I am embarrassed
Where would you like to go
I would like to go to Germany
Germany. Why?
I am so interested in Germany because of the things we hear the Nazis and all that stuff, movies
Yes it happens the same to me
I would love to go there.
There is so much history. I would like to go to Italy because my family is Italian. I would like to go around Italy by car
Yes, I would like to go to Italy, or if not, I think Germany or France.
Yes, Argentina.
That's a crazy thing but I would like to go to China
Well I can tell you Argentina it can be very cheap now
No, but it is
Argentina , was devalued, Argentina is very beautiful.
Yes, I have never gone there.
And devalued a lot against the dollar so going to Argentina now is very cheap and very convenient. What do you do here in the United States?
I am a student.
Student
I have just graduated from high school
You're young.
I just turned nineteen
I'm twenty nine
Look you're ten years older
I'm doing the post-doctorate here because my doctorate was in Buenos Aires. What are you studying?
I'm going to study music
Nice music
I start at the little school in February
Nice and you
Since I'm three years behind, I just graduated high school
Sure and you, what instrument do you like
I sing.
You sing
Yes I sing, this is why I want to study music
Very good
To study music you are obliged to learn an instrument, obviously.
No sure, at least one,
At least some, yes, pianos, organs
Yes and you have to think about applying to a place to study music like Berklee, some of these
No well for now I will start at Brawer Community College which is public
None
To do the same credits that I would do in the university but cheaper right? I do plan on transferring to the
Sure
That have a good
Sure there would be good for you
Sure
Sure, you feel like
Sure and with that career I can travel all around the world
You probably feel like returning to Colombia some day or do you plan on staying here
I have the hopes of returning to Colombia but I don't at the same time.
You're with your family here right?
Yes, I'm with my mom and little sister.
Good
What happens is that I can't leave the country because of that of the guerrilla, I'm here on political asylum.
Look at that
So I can't leave the United States for ten years
Something happened to your family.
YES
How terrible.
Exactly they killed my father and my sister
Wow, how horrific
Very horrific
And your dad was in politics
My dad
None
My little sister's dad was ex-military
None
Then that's why they killed them but well thank God we're already here and we're already safe
Well I'm very glad that you are fine my God what a terrible story, the stories of
But I swear to you that I would love to return to Colombia
Yes, I imagine the people there are warm.
Yes
I don't know in Florida, but here there are a lot of Columbians.
In Florida there's a lot of Cubans
Cuba is full of Cubans but there aren't so many Colombians
There are Columbians, but not many.
Not that many
No
Is the nicest place that you would recommend to go to Cartagena, Columbia?
The nicest place is Sand Andres.
San, that's just before Cartegena, right?
San yes is an island in front of
Well the San Andres island because, you know what happened to me several times with Colombians, I said Cartagena and they said no no, San Andres
Yes it's the same
That it's prettier
I don't know how to explain it but it's nicer
It's sweeter, San Andres of Cartagena
It's the same.
It's the same but no
It's the same, because they're both tourists so they have the same rates
One day I'll go there
Yes,
My goal in life is to travel everywhere. It's what I like the most and I have fun.
I would also love to travel to Brazil
I've been to Brazil like five times
Yes, and how was it? Really nice
Wow, great, it's really great, it's something that won't surprise you much because you come from a Caribbean country, a warm sea so
It will be different because of the music
You will find really different landscapes. Sure
What countries has San Andres
No and the south of Argentina that's called Patagonia
Yes
Is very cold is mountainous like you see
Hello?
Hello?
Yes, hello?
Hello.
Hello, Manuel from Orlando speaking, with whom am I speaking?
With Blanca from Arizona
How are you Blanca?
Fine thanks.
Very good, I'm listening, tell me about your travels
None
After I'll tell you.
Ah well I love to travel.
Yes.
This year I was able to go to places, well, yes, two place in Colombia and Guatemala.
Correct.
I went to Guatemala for a month and two months in Colombia. I'm Colombian.
Very good. Me too.
Sorry?
Me too.
Yes?
Yes.
From where?
From Merchi
I too,
What a coincidence.
I'm also from there and I love to travel. I love to travel, if I could I would travel all the time.
We agree on this, what we need is time and money.
And money.
So relaxing, so revitalizing.
None
And well, I've been able to visit some countries some cities, as many as I would like. But here we have the right that I can mention that has really called my attention.
Yeah, yeah, the support, hmm It's one time that I was in our neighboring countries, I was in Ecuador, Bolivia. And above all, the part of the Sierra. Eh, Peru, Bolivia, all that.
Macchu Pichu, Titicaca.
None
This was an unforgettable trip. And I did it for forty five days. And then, well there's the beach and all that. In the Caribbean that's called Granada, some islands.
And eh, there people are spectacular, really really really nice, really honest and the beaches are really beautiful.
Yes.
Before telling you where I would like to go, tell me more. How is it in Guatemala?
Well, the truth is that I say really bad luck now that I went to Guatemala. My husband is from Guatemala.
Yes.
But then.
That is true.
Planned to go to the Duenas and visit all the historical Mayan cultural sites.
Yes truthfully
But we arrived in a season when there was a terrible winter. There were many landslides every
Of course.
A bridge had fallen.
That was because of the hurricanes season.
Exactly, yes.
Yes
And I do visit Guatemala. It looked to me as an incredible place and the
It looks like
The volcano in front of the city. that is spectacular
I have seen it at the television on documentaries, that is a beauty.
That is a beauty. It is beautiful. There is a hotel, a very old one that was left as it was after the earthquake and the flood. Because what happened there with the volcano was a a
None
There was a volcano
LIKE IN COLOMBIA IT CAUSED AFTER FLOOD.
Like in Colombia. That caused a flood. Because there is not snow at the top but it was
None
Flooded it was full of water and was like a point
Yeah.
Flooding the city. In such a way that many people and things were lost.
Yes. And, and the costs too, did you stay there or not?
But it's pretty.
There in the
No
None
Uh um Since we're close to here, like an hour and a half, we didn't need to.
And it's true since your husband is from there you didn't have to pay something.
Yes, my mother in-law and father in-law are living there now. They're also North American, but they went over there.
None
They were tired of being here,
These places are beautiful and really nice
Yes
Yes
I really know very little Canada and it seems pretty
Yes.
Before moving here i lived in boston.
You were very close, no.
Yes, we had the chance to come and go. And I also have family living in Canada so we were able to go and come often.
Sure, that's the reason why. Which on is the dream of your life? Have you been able to make it true yet?
Oh, I wish to go, I dream of going to the pyramids.
The Great Wall of China?
Yes, the Great Wall of China.
None.
The pyramids in Egypt.
Yes.
But before that, I think I wouldn't want to go to the Middle East,  they have so much problems there and it seems to me that it's all part of their history.
It's really interesting actually
Yes, I think that that's why everywhere
Greece too.
That's right, I agree with you. I'm interested in the way in going to the pyramids and the Great Wall
None
Traveling to Greece and to the Italian civilization.
Italy.
I've only been to Spain in Europe and there are lots of things to see there but you never have enough time. I'm very interested in Italy, imagine
Time and money.
And Europe it's particularly expensive nowadays because of the exchange rate, right?
None
When i went there i still got the other coin and you changed your dollars the way you wanted somewhere and you got them multiplied, not anymore. Now you take your dollars and they give you less
Yes
Because the Euro is worth more than the dollar
The euro
It's also harder because the costs have risen, but we have hope, and of the neighbor countries, which one interests you?
Yes, i would like very much to go to Mexico, to the Pyramids of Mexico, i would like very much to go to Peru
Yes, they, there's a lot to see there
None
The South, as well as Chile and Argentina
And I would also like very much to see the falls of
Yes
Of the Iguasu
That and Brazil too, that's another destiny that
Because i have seen documentaries and there's a point where it unites, I'm not sure, correct me if you know it better than me, Argentina, Brazil and Chile
Paraguay, right?
And Paraguay
Yes, in a specific point i think those three countries
The falls are looks so beautiful
That's a marvel, because there you have
That immensity, that, i don't know
Each of those is two hundred and sixty six
None
Little and big, there it's two hundred sixty six separated
Yes
In one place
It's that, i do know the ones from Canada, I'm open and i know it from both sides and i think it's incredible and nice
Yes, it's a beauty, it's a beauty, and speaking about jumping and waterfalls, i would like to go to the
Yes
Salto del Angel in Venezuela
In Venezuela
Sure, it's the highest in the world, there's so much to know
What?
So much to know
Oh, so many things left to see, the only thing we lack is the will
So much to know, that, no, but look, we're lucky that we get the desire to travel, there's people that don't
I do
Even having the means, they don't want to
I'm telling you, if i had the way, that would be the only thing I'd do, dedicate myself to know, to know, to know
Me too. Definitely me too, and stay here for a while in every place, no eight days or,
Yes
Wait here until I don't want to do it anymore.
Yes, sure, in the place that grabs your attention the most obviously.
I want to stay there a month,
Yes, it's true.
But without worries
Yes. Now speaking of tourism, we're prone to wanted to always know the outside that we almost never know our country.
WITH ALL THE MARVELS THAT ARE HERE.
Yes.
Believe me that when I lived over there in Colombia I traveled in the west and on the Atlantic coast.
Yes.
I traveled on land to many places.
Yes. Yes.
But I still missed a lot because I don't know the east.
Aye and there are many beautiful things to see
I don't know anything about the Llanos for example, I don't know anything about these departments in the east near Alcalde and all this. Maybe I'll go there.
Yes.
There's a lot to see there, but it doesn't scare me.
Well sure, there are failures like the failure of security.
This has gotten better and it's scary
Yes.
A beauty, really pretty, and,
We also have a bunch of nice things.
And above all playing, it's good to play.
None
There's a  little town, everything.
I went too to play for a bit in the park in the east in Tio Queno.
None
Amazing, we went for a walk several days. This was great.
This is a marvel, you really like knowing what you say. That one here goes to play, if there's nothing to do, they're all commercial centers.
No, and here all thecities are the same.
Exactly and they all turn around the commercial centers.
They're like photocopies.
Yes.
That's a town of artists. It's on the seaside and is really picturesque.
It must be really pretty.
It's pictureque, the most beautiful thing, and there's another little town.
Yes.
Here in California the name escapes me but I went this year too. It's in a European style,
True, it must be really pretty. But a question, and why, why the change?
Scotland
Why from Massachusetts to Arizona?
Because of the cold
I also lived in New York, yes. That was the cold I endured, yes.
Because of the cold, and besides here my husband had family, so we took advantage of that also.
And have you guys already adapted?
Well yes, I am, I'm here.
They say the weather there is very good.
No no
Well,
During this time by mid-year is very hard.
But if one gets in the shade the same because you tell me there's not much humidity.
There's no humidity whatsoever, it's a dry heat.
That
You go out and you see the dry vapor.
Yes.
But it is tolerable. If you have a bottle of water with a hat you're fine.
None
THAT'S TRUE. THE HUMIDITY THER IN FLORIDA IS VERY BAD.
The summer is terrible. Aroung this time is good but the summer is terrible
I have family in Florida and I've been there many times
Yes.
Hello!
Good evening.
Yes, good evening, this is Jorge from Los Angeles, California.
Hello! I'm Rafael, from Vancouver, Canada.
How's everything going over there?
It's fine doing what we have to do. Every day. casually, casually because we have the same, the same hourly usage
So there, it's six in the afternoon.
SURE EXACTLY BECAUSE BOTH
Sure the same
We're both on the coast, on the Pacific Coast
Yes, exactly
Let me say something more
Yes, of course
You're Argentinian, no?
Well, the truth is that  it's the third call that I've done in the system, and I'm a little surprised because there's
I'm new, I'm a amateur, but evidently they discover, they find me, I can't pass to the other, to another place.
Yes, I'm right, No? you're Argentinian?
Yes
None
Ah, also
But of course
But one moment
Yes, the Argentinian accent
Yes
It's something that a person starts to speak and
Yes
One picks it up terribly, I was doing this yesterday, talking to a lady from Boston.
Argentinian also
None
Nice to meet you, What's your name?
Is Rafael
Rafael, Jorge, I'm from Buenos Aires.
Well, I
And you, where are you from?
Also from Buenos Aires
I was born and raised in the neighborhood of La Nuz
From what, well I was born
You know it?
Yes, how am I not going to know La Nuz, La Nuz East. La Nuz West, Margarita
La Nuz, La Nuz, West.
West
Precisely, Valentin Arcina
Yes.
And you, what neighborhood are you from?
I'm from Centennial Park
How beautiful, yes.  Well, how nice.
Yes How much
How nice
How long have you been here in Los Angeles?
It's been eighteen years that I am
Good,
In
Jorge, I'm going to tell you something,
Tell me!
I was listening to you and of course I found some things, but the accent at least
Yes
I mean it's a bit mixed.
Los Angeles possibly,  let's say the tone, in the color of, of you voice there's a
A small difference from the traditional
Sure.
I've been in Canada for four years.
How long have you been in Canada?
FIFTEEN YEARS
Aye!
And let's say this, this with
Fifteen
A little
Fifteen years in Canada, in British Colombia?
Yes, like I was here a time, at the beginning of everything, in the east, I was in Toronto.
Exactly
And after, I didn't like it because
To
Well
It didn't take and I decided to come to this coast I have ten
Exactly, I  liked it a lot
I spent eighteen years in Los Angeles.
Do you know Vancouver?
No, well the topic today is special: Travel
So, to travel
I love for travelling
To canada, i went there to Los Angeles so i know it.
You went to Los Angeles?
Yes, i was in Los Angels
You came here?
I was there five or four years ago. Five years ago in San Francisco I went all around in a car from Vancouver up to San Diego.
Where I really live is in  Hollywood.
Yes
I live basically six blocks from you. Do you remember the Chinese Theater?
Let me see a little that
The Chinese Theater,
Hollywood Boulevard. Yes I'm placing it
The Chinese Theater is famous
Yes exactly, okay
I live six or eight block from there.
Speaking of Hollywood
Tell me
Vancouver is now called.
What do they call Vancouver.
Hollywood, north.
Basically the producers from the United States go film.
Yes
They are right.
But,
They are going to film in Vancouver
It has been transformed here, Hollywood remains as numer one, number two is New York and third is Vancouver in this thing
In this moment; it's amazing, I am a tourism guide.
Great! how wonderful, interesting
What do you do Jorge?
I basically work in Customer Service, as the English would call it.
Customer Service
Yes,
I
How amazing is the tourism guide.
Going around the city, because I have to work with tours I permanently see in a day three four places that are in the
Buses with all the equipment to film
Of course, because it is cheaper.
So yes
It is cheaper for United States producers.
But
Work and film. Everything is cheaper if it is done in Canada.
But there's a catch
Say it?
There are other things, that maybe aren't related. We're not only talking from the dollar point of view, or other costs, but
This place, and they go meet the surroundings, it has multiple landscapes in a very near radius, which means that here we have a city
We have mountains, we have forests.
That's wonderful.
We have rivers, we have lakes, we have beaches,  i don't know, something more, i don't know if there's something else out there
It's really beautiful that
So, that, that
That's very nice
That makes a producer call you
Hi
Hello?
Hello. Good evening, how are you?
Good evening, how are you? This is Vicente, I'm calling from New York.
From New York,  hi, we're close by, my name is Edo, and I'm in Philadelphia.
You're in Philadelphia?
Right here.
Where are you from originally?
I was born in Guatemala, but my family came here and I was very young. I was seven when we arrived in Maryland
Were you born in Coronara of Guatemala?
Yes
So you have lived all your life here?
The majority of my life I've spent in Maryland,it's been three years since I moved to Philadelphia.
Philadeophia
To
Very good. I'm here in New York and the strike just ended. We had a strike.
They were really, like if they had to walk a lot no.
Yes, the strike is in New York, which is serious, because New York remember, is not like many other cities, other people
So close so separated, for many that use cars.
Sure
Here we use a lot of public transportation. Because to park a car in New York can cost you a lot of money
Yes, if you have a contract you will get paid  monthly, two hundred, three hundred
Pesos a month
I know
That is what most of the people pay for rent, understand?
The most
SO, IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE, AND THE FINES ARE REALLY EXPENSIVE IN NEW YORK, AND THEY TAKE YOUR
None
If you park in a forbidden place, when you come back, after going into a shop, be sure that when you go out your car is already gone
Oh my God
It will cost you like two hundred pesos to get your car back
Oh, and where are you from?
But that's life. So we should be talking about, what? Travelling
No, actually I haven't traveled a lot in my life. I think
Me either, I only traveled when I was in the army. You know, and I was a soldier
In what arm where you?
Yes, and it costed nothing, because of course, I was traveling with the army to some countries in Europe. But no, when
When I was in the army, i didn't have much time
Go out to visit most of the other things
None
Wait a minute, ok, just a minute, OK
Yes, OK
Yes
None
I don't work, I haven't traveled a lot, I would like to travel to other countries in the world such as Europe, Africa, and  Japan; those places, you know
Yes. I would like, maybe before going abroad, to know a little more the rich and famous places in the United States
You would like to know more about the United States?
Yes, I would like to know a little more, how you call it? for instance, over and above having been to Maryland, and Philadelphia now, well
I know New York, and Los Angeles but not so much, and, how you call it? I would like to know,
Las Vegas, San Francisco
But rather than the Yellowstone Park, that is in
Yes. Yes. Yes. The nature, I know what you mean. And I would like to do a little more of that. Sometimes I go to Miami
But in Miami it's very urban, understand, much of a city. My brother lives there
Yes
They own Miami.
Most of the things depend on the Cubans, because the Cubans are like the Jewish of the Latins.
And he liked money. That's why,Castro started the revolution,  because
Cuba, before, had a lot of capitalism, understand?
Yes
Very few had a lot, and most of the people had nothing and then started the communist revolution, understand?
Yes
Since it belongs to everybody
But the rest of the country, the other ninety percent don't own their ass
Yes, would you like to visit Miami?
Yes. Miami, and, San Franciso
I had things like in Latin America. I had trees and things that are kind of tropical, you understand?
Yes
In Miami, you see palm trees and all that. And sometimes, when you see the palm trees, you think
Yes
Central America and Latin America. But there is a lot of that, in Miami, orange trees. It's like
Yes
It's something very, very beautiful. But I would also like to go out to, to visit Europe also, you know what I mean?
Yes, that's what I thought. Now, the part of Europe that probably attracts more of my attention is Italy.
When I was studying, I took a course on Renaissance art.
Oh yes, arts in Italian
And, yes. What do you call it? I liked quite a lot of the things I saw. I would like to visit some of those cities that are so old
Yes
Maybe see for myself what I saw on the pictures we were shown
None
And get to know
And most of the arts stuff is old, like in Italy or Rome, right?
That's the capitol
Yes?
They can't see the big cars over there because everything's very old and
And the streets are still small
Oh, yes? I didn't know
Because Rome is, in the bible, the eternal city.
Oh yes
Uh, do you understand that?,  that Rome is a city that, you read and Rome is in the bible
And it still exists, you know, the same city exists
Right
None
Yes, it's very ancient. So much history coming from
Yes, it's very old. And sometimes the very streets are
Like they're breaking up sometimes, because they are always fixing something in Rome.
None
They're always fixing something. We were talking about the Michelangelo painting, right?
Yes, about Michelangelo's paintings. The structures that he helped build. The sculptures that
Donatello and i would
Oh what's he's called?, in the Church, Chris thing, Christine, what's it called?, like
The Sixteen Chapel
Nowadays they are still passing it day after day. You see, it's years
Trying to conserve it,because it's so old. the paint is coming off, and sometimes the chapel itself has to be repaired. I've heard
United States and many countries around the world, make donations for its maintenance, understand?
Yes
Because it's so expensive to maintain those paintings, it's jus different, the chapel is interesting.  They were in channel thirteen.  Here in New York? I don't know what channel it is there.
Where you are, it's called the public channel
None
They were talking about these things, paintings and music. In Spain, there are a lot of paintings. A lot of very nice paintings.
Yes, I guess Spain is another nice place to visit.
Yes. Yes. I was in Spain for two days. I was in Madrid, but I didn't have the time to visit everything, museums and all that
I was there for only two days
Wow
Yes
None
I was in Madrid for two days, also, just like you. But I didn't visit much of Spain. But there are, in the
Culture, Spanish culture, has a lot of Arabic influence
Oh, really Arabic?
Yes, Spain was conquered by the Arabs for seven hundred years, a lot of people don't know that.  For seven hundred years the Arabs controlled
Until the Cid arrived, remember the Cid? Have you, have you read the Cid?
NONE
The Cid, the Spaniard that pushed the Arabs out of Spain. But yes, they kept the architecture and the
Painting, the Spanish have many influence from the Arabs
Yes
Understand?
I didn't know that
Yes, I saw it, I read a lot about that. It's like, I don't say the word  ojala
Have you heard any other word that say ojala, I hope this happens, I hope this is
Yes.
That's Arab.
None
That's it oajalÃ¡. The Arabs said, the Arabs to AlÃ¡, he Arab God, right
Yes
Everyone says, if AlÃ¡ gives me permission of that happening, if AlÃ¡ wants this to happen.
None
But, now there is a word in Spanish
Sure .
But it's witten different in Spanish O-A-J-A-L, something like that, do you understand?
Yes
But it's interesting
Yes, in reality i didn't know that
That's really interesting, there are many things that came from the Arab, that are in the Spanish, and the Spanish architecture
The architecture is more Arab than Spanish itself
None
The Arab had the numeric system we use
Sure
Many people don't know that the numerical system that the United States and Europe and the whole world is Arab
7,8,9 THAT'S WRITING ARAB
None
I would like to visit Latin American.
That's the bad thing. Latin America is one of the most beautiful places, but unfortunately, the situation, as it is now, is the crime.
With all the kidnapping and gangs,you don't travel really secure, and visiting all places like before
Can you talk a little bit higher?
Sorry
Yes
Well, unfortunately the experience is not as nice when you travel to Latin America.
Of being able to
Yes
Or other countries, I would have done it more easily. Why take vacations if you are worried that something can be done during that time?
Yes, and the thing is just starting, in Panama and other country also
Many people from Latin America now
My name is Celiana.
My name is Adrian and i live in Toronto Ontario, Canada
HOW ARE YOU ADRIAN? AND WHERE ARE YOU FROM ?
From Buenos Aires, and you from where?
From Buenos Aires.
Where were you born?
I was born in the federal capital. Of grain let's say.
There,
You?
I was born in Villa de Boto.
There, the first time that I talk with an Argentinian.
Where do you live now?
I'm vacationing here in Miami because my brothers live here but I live in Boston, near of let's say I die of cold like you.
A little less that in Boston but yes.
Yes
There's less snow.
I suppose that a little less but the only thing that makes me feel a little better is thinking of the people that live in Canada.
None
There, less you..
It's going to be colder
It is true. It is not true. Yes. What are you doing? Have you been living there for a long time?
I am going to have four years.
A lot.
Of course
ARE THERE MANY ARGENTINIANS?
Not to much. Neither there
Yes. it is okay
Yeah.
You being with the do you have a beach, right?
Yes, trying to speak neutral to be understood
Of course. Do you know which by region I said, but with you I can talk this way.
Yes I can understand you perfectly
That is good. I can talk to you in an imperative way and don't feel that I am attacking you lets say.
Yes.
Yes, and what do you do in Toronto?
It is simply a work.
Very good
Yes, Do you live in Boston recently?
Me yes almost a year
There, yes.
In January I went to live, yes I work too.
Are you happy or do you miss it?
Something.
The milk candy, mate and the breadcrumbed meat?
AND I DO ALL THAT IN BOSTON, AND DRINK MORE
The mate and the milk candy, yes
Tell me
None
Tell me, what did you said?
I ate bread crumbed steak and more milk candy.
No, no. My roomate eats milk candy, let's say I don't like it very much. I drink mate everyday, and yes, that is not weird but I miss those moments.
The weather kills me.
Don't worry like my wife, she is never going to get used to that.
And yes, the truth is that I don't think so because of that Buenos Aires. Are you going to come back or not?
That is what stops me to think about staying here or not.
Yes, why did you go to Boston?
Well, why did I go to Boston?
Why not to Miami?
I had a good job. Possibilities of
There. yes.
Growing and all that lets say but I donÂ´t know if that is better than Buenos Aires with the family and its weather. But now it will be seen, it will be seen.
For now, I am living this that I like, I like where I am now, what I am doing and everything.
Are you happy?
I am Happy. yes, very happy. And you, how are you doing?
What I miss most is the food.
Yes.
I miss it almost daily.
Do you miss a steak?
The American plastic food and everything is tasteless or it is to spicy.
Or.
None
The pizza left my mouth swelling because it is very hot.
The world eat practically too much spicy but I think the spices are meant to sleep the mouth so they cannot feel
The food flavor.
Because they get used to it and after a pair of generalization it is a form of
Of course.
Yes, I don't know how is in Boston, but here in Toronto is like kind of a zoo.
Yes, the same than in Boston.
They complain, I donÂ´t know about the Argentinians, but many nationalities complain about the spicy food and that kind of stuff
At least they are Hindi or Pakistani, for them is good. Another issue with the food, but
Sure, Irish restaurant and ask for not spicy. They said No? and I said No, not a bit spicy.
Oh my God, that really gets me head. It's missed a lot. And the tourists that go to Beunos Aires love the food. So it's there when it's good.
No?
Why don't they do it here?
Sure.I know.
Is meat very expensive in Boston?
And
Good cow meat?
There's only one restaurant for example Argentinian that the that if you buy the beef it's twenty three dollars.
Oh shit. Twenty three but it's a motherfucking restaurant in Boston. in the Neighborhood.
That is like a little restaurant tango it's called Argentinian
That's good.
Yes.The truth is that it's expensive. But
They make the grill, and it's good.
Yes
But on Saturdays one for two must cost sixty, seventy, eight Canadian.
Ten dollars?
Yes. No no.
It's a bit expensive
The worst is that in the evening .
None
Sing? That's unbearable.
Yes, well, there are things you have to stand.  I guess you too, working from home.
No, it's just that I have not worked bad in Buenos Aires.  Now, all that shit, and it was alright.
Yes
I WAS FUCKING SICK OF IT. THE OVERALL SITUATION AND
Sure
The day in particular. But
Sure
I remember when I went to see my old man and I told him I'm leaving, he said I already knew
I asked, how did you know? Because you told me ten years ago,
Oh, really?
I don't remember when it was, but he told that when I was eighteen he started with that 'this shitty country' 'I'll send it to hell' and so
I don't remember but he told me, I guess he did, if he remembers I guess it did happen
He was chewing that for ten years
It's quite peculiar, but well. Another detail
Sure
He
My sister lived in Boston, my brother there. So I came to visit them, and found this job, and now we are the three of us living in the United States
At the end, I came to visit them in Miami
The cold like this is the truth.
The truth is that it's great.  My sister says how cold, and i'm no, it's a little hot.
I don't know how it is now.
Twenty degrees as such.  it's crazy, but it's winter,so that's why it's cold.
Do you get to go to the beach?
Yes, just got back from the beach. We were at the beach all day.
Yes.
The truth is that good, to live like this too. To me I realize now that winter is returning to Boston
Climate is really important, people are in a totally different mood. Perhaps in Boston people aren't really sociable, I don't know but
None
We Latinos aren't made for the cold
No, this is the other topic, but I just saw the truth. They go skiing, and not in
Sure
It was a culture, between this.
Sure.
Be in the car for half an hour to go skiing, or snowboarding, and pass the winter like this
Last year I skied.
No, I've only skied once in my life. I wasn't very good at sports.
Really?
Not with sports.
It's the only way I can spend the winter doing somethings. So yes, I'm going to start snowboarding
You bet
I HAVE A FRIEND WHO HAS BEEN LIVING HERE FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS, HE USED TO SKI IN ARGENTINA, SINCE HE ARRIVED
Yes
Snowboarding, and he became psychotic, he goes every weekend. No, I know he does go, because he is not that simple
GOOD EVENING NANCY
Yes good evening, Patricia's speaking, whom am I speaking with?
How are you Patricia?. I live in New York, in New York.
Hello Nancy what country are you from and where do you live ,yes what's your culture, what Spanish roots do you have
I'm Colombian, yes.
I live in Wilmington, Delaware and I'm from Panama so we are neighbors
Yes
Geographical neighbors
Yes,very true
What do you think about music, Nancy?
Many sense unite people because when there's disaster, it enters competitions. Music can also relax you a lot.
Exactly
Messages like that
I totally agree, at the beginning of this recording they gave us a quote from a British poet
None
Long Just that it says that eh music is the universal language I totally agree with that
Because one suddenly doesn't understand let's say the lyric or something
None
But it reaches one
If you don't speak the same language, sometimes it is not necessary, because if you have music in common, you can
Have full assurance that there's communication
Yes that is true one communicates there is no need of being with
Totally.  What type of music, do you like?
I listen to a lot of romantic music
Yes mother
Yes, I love Alberto Plaza, a Chilean singer.  He's a Chilean singer, who's all his songs are...
I've never heard of him I'm a bad Latin
Yes, how much he feels for his wife and loves her.
My God but you are so romantic
Yes and now since I have a baby then I'm devoted to listening to baby music I play him Mozart and all
I like to listen to music
That he relaxes
I listen to whatever is on the radio.
Yes
I like to listen to Raggaeton to classical music when I'm traveling.
Yes, because he doesn't let us sleep.
By the highway, you forget the stress and everything, it's so relaxing.
Yes
I don't know many of our Latin singer songwriters
None
I know more of what's contemporary in Reggaeton
Yes
I know in my mother's time I said Los Panchos
Right
These kind of things?
Yes,  I know that if I finally get the music I listen to it, but you kinda get melancholic every now and then
Girl
If you listen to it long enough
I like it
Its a ways for you to relieve the stress.
No, definitely
The best way you can rest at home.
And, and it's also good for, and it's also good for sending social and political messages
Yes.
Right?  There's secretly, in the background, they're telling you more than four things.
That's very true, I'm here right now.
Have you heard our singer Ruben Blades?
Right, yes, i love him
In his first career he is a lawyer, the baby is no fool.
Right, he knows the, he know what he says
He writes songs when there are political situations in out country? It depends on his point of personal view and that's personal
Yes about
Look at the things that my daughter comes up with from these musical intrigues
That's exactly  how Ruben Blades sings
Does the same thing happen in your country? Do national songwriters sing?
Yes they are also singing them that's why I've heard Juanez also
Yes Juanez is very famous he's gone to Panama a million times
He's been in Florida
And he's very good looking also
How he wants, yes?
Is the one that comes in girl give me your money
Yes
What type of music do you like to dance
I like salsa and I was learning to dance reggaeton
YES
Because reggaeton, it's really hot here
And you think that we could music be used to unite people
Yes
Me too, I read
Yes yes
I saw the television .
In grade school especially when they start young
None
If they learn to play a musical instrument or are involved with the music in anyway, for example, chorus
Yes
That those kids their mind learn more, they are more intelligent
Yes, it develops normally.
So you already know you that already have a baby
Yes
Start thinking musically
Yes I put it and I hum and she gets there and moves her little mouth and I love it
Imagine the power of music Nancy that makes a, how many months old is your baby?
Five months
Imagine that the music has the power of making a five month old baby react
Yes because they immediately come look and
I believe that God gave us the music
Yes. That's an incredible communication medium.
It has to be incredible, is incredible and is look that I've been eh saw a documentary about an eh American eh from a relatively famous band
In this country, I would say in the seventies he and his band went to Africa
None
To learn about those of the wrong, many of the African drums
Well, yes.
No? What we call swing
There they're removing it
He was put together with a really famous band and I don't know where in Africa they made an album, you saw this combination.  Nancy, it's look...
Spectacular
From hell, there's another dark girl too who's called Sade
None
She's African, her dad is English and her mom is African and she's so cute
A cute dark girl
She is cute and has a song that is very international
AND IT'S FROM
Now from Latin music you think, for example, because I knkow that in different countries the native music, the music from the countryside, for example, no? Not whaat you hear in the city, but in the countryside, we call it
Yes
What we call this in Panama, ah, what it's called in Colombia, you, cumbia
Cumbia.
What they hear in the countryside in the little towns
I don't remember.
They hear everything
Yes, yes they make a mix of all the music, of everything
Oh typical music
None
Typical music which is completely different from the one you can hear and dance in the city
Yes absolutely, and to them it is something completely new
Despite that, see how it is opening. That amazes me because I think much of it is in the culture. It is very important if you don't have
Culture, you are almost like a beast
Yes. There is much of the person in that
And music has a lot to do with that, it's involved and even, for instance, the singers from the inside like we call them
That have come up, and are now listened to all over the world, just figure Panamanian from the inside now being listened to in Europe
I had never heard them
Can you imagine that?
Yes because I had never heard, where did that come from?
None
Yes
And it's something that, to me is a wonder and it affects me in a very positive manner. Sometimes it makes me melancholic.
Yes because it's like, look it's nice, it's not too late for them
I don't want to hear those things
Yes, because here came Carlose Vives last year, and when we went to buy a ticket it was too late
Believe.
You go, God we noticed too late!
He goes to Panama every once in a while.
Carlos Vive yes, he comes here, is the first time I hear he's coming, not in New York
In Miami it's the first time, in New York ah the first ah so that tells you
Yes
That they are seiing his musical geographic field.
Yes
He started right? in Colombia hopped over to Panama, Mexico, now he's getting in the market and look, let me tell you, music is a huge business.
The video production and all that, it's big business there's money
Yes because at least they would tell D'yankee
Like crazy
That a boy was asking him that how did he do it to get the money
Exactly and P'Diddy
And yes. Yes. He would say singing counting with
Multimilionaires, my love
None
They are, I act  I do the part in back what people don't see when they are watching movies
None
It is very hard, the other day I had the opportunity, I wasn't forced because when they did the feature film, it seemed that the audio was poor
None
There was enough money for one or the other but not both, so then I had to go
None
Had to go do the audio
To do everything well
I will tell you, girl, this is hard. I started thinking about people who are doing this musically.
When you see them in the video recording in a studio
Yes because they play
You know what this takes
And they play record and record many times and there are stops and
And it has to be, exactly Nancy.
IF THEY MAKE A MISTAKE THEY GIVE
You know I thought
And finish
I gave myself an end, I said look girl, I think it's going to be a half hour of this
NONE
And I did this for two hours
It took you double what you
It took them
It's easy to get in a recording studio
Hello. Good afternoon.
Good afternoon, Marcela, whom am I speaking with?
Hello, Marcela. My name is Niky. Nice to meet you.
Where are you calling from?
I'm calling from Florida, and you?
I'm in North Carolina
Well not too far
Not too far
No, are you Argentinian?
YES, I'M IN ARGENTINIAN, AND YOU?
I'm Dominican
Look, the first Latin person I met who was not Argentinian, that I met in the United States when my parents emigrated was a Dominican lady
Oh really? How nice.
Yes, but I haven't met many.
I've met many Argentinians, that's why when I heard your beautiful accent, I already knew
Thanks
Yes well, what do you think of music?
And I love music
Me too
It seems to me that while people listen to music and dance, they don't fight. Isn't it true?
It's true, yes
We export enough music and still fight each other
I love music .
Yes
There are a lot of movements in many countries about music and bringing peace I've seen
For, example in England and Africa
Yes
But, I haven't really seen a deep change, sadly
No, and I also think that this, this exporting music thing, it depends, I mean, music doesn't export itself
Yes
And then, when you have big companies like the ones in this country
Yes
Then, there's a lot of music exploration, the music that's made here
Yes
And not all the music, just the super popular music
Yes
Music is super popular because these companies are selling it and pushing it,
Yes
Music from this country, or from another country, that doesn't have the money to promote it.
And export it, it's not listened to or exported, we have, we have to
Yes,
To be like an archeologist, looking for something new
Yes, unfortunately. I've heard that many artists, when I listen to them in a concert or buy a CD, they are part of small independent companies because they want to.
Have some freedom, I mean, to make their own music and not be part of a corporation, it's hard for them, really hard
Yes, because these people they don't have contracts with big, big money.
They work for every penny they get.
Yes
At type of music do you like?
I love all kinds of music, I mean, specially, I don't know, I'm not old enough to say music from a
None
I mean, like,if I tell you, for example, I collect music by Carlos Gardel, I mean
You do?
That's before my time but I love it, I really love it. and also music from the thirties, forties, ballads from the fifties, all kinds of music. I studied music, so as I said, when I was little I thought I would become
None
I also collect classical music, merengue of course
Yes
But all types of popular music; in Spanish, in English, all types. I really like it. I do find it hard to listen to hard rock
But sometimes, there are some rock bands from Spain or South America that I do really like, so it varies
Yes
I also like jazz.
Rap, yes.
And I think that music is very violent. But sometimes there are young people that are artists that are playing but they have postive messages for the youth
Yes
Because of that it changes, and you?
The challenge is to try to understand. I don't understand them but I think that is because of my age. I am fifty one years
Yes
None.
My younger son who is seventeen years old, he loves to hear music
None.
He loves the old rock music from the sixties and seventies.
That is unique for that age
And, but from very young, he was a little one and he liked to hear rock from the fifties, and he knew the lyrics
Yes?
I say that in another life.
How good
He plays classic, Jazz, Blues, everything. I don't know. Sometimes, to hear music from my era, you say Yes. I remember that.
It bores me. I have heard that it is over
Yes
Do you understand me? or it has to be much more - something more, older than me, or something that is happening now
Yes
My husband is also a musician
How nice
Plays piano and writes, and them=n
How nice
That I bring something home, sometimes
What are you listening to? I listen to what they listen to, especially my youngest son. I like all the weird things.
Sure.
He brings them as long as they're not old things
Yes
It would be a good thing for the music to bring peace
Yes
No the truth is I haven't seen that, I mean, we can look at, at, at Bono from U2
Yes. That's why I think of him. Yes. He tries, but I don't see
Necessarily I mean the music, and it gave him fame, and it's the fame.
Yes. It's true
Played a song and the people were transformed
Yes, sure
You understand me?
I also think there's someone from your country that is, I'm forty two years old and discovered this singer already
Perhaps you can tell me if Mercedez Sosa inspired people in the seventies.
Yes she really inspired people who were against
The military.
Sure
She was an inspiration so they could continue with the work that they work were doing.
Sure
Against the military, yes, this woman is a barbarian. I was born in 1955, and I've lived here in the United States since I was nine.
Wow
I've only returned to Argentina in seventy one when I was sixteen
And now, we went with my husband in the summer of two thousand four
How nice, you've really seen the different stages of your country
Yes, you can see the difference
Interesting, I don't know Argentina, but I've traveled a lot and I also grew up in the United States, in New York
It's
And I came really young, so I completely understand
Yes, it's a rare place that we're in, because we're not from here.
Yes, I call it between two worlds
You know? and yes, that's it
More between my world.
People sometimes ask me, what do I know? It seems to me I like being in this situation, because it seems that we can look at the world with a very objective eye.
Yes I agree
As Americans look at our american culture
Yes
And really see how we function and at the same time we can look to our countries where we came from
Yes
Since we have that idiosyncrasy, because we were raised by people from that country
None
Also understand that in them, we also are
Yes
How that works and how it is - why that doesn't work
Yes
I get in trouble with people
I like how you say it, I agree, because  we have the power of choosing
Yes
That one really, I understand it is part of oneself, but things are also perhaps not for me. I think many times I've visited the Dominican Republic, but many times I think.
Where I go there is a much smaller country than yours, and I feel it's really hard for the professional woman, and I'm an attorney.
None
My family comes from Santiago and it's a city of million people
YOU REALLY CAN'T, LIKE THE REST OF LATIN AMERICAN WHERE YOU REALLY KNOW THE LAST NAMES IS A SOCIETY, WHAT FAMILY THEY COME FROM
None
There one feels, like the duty of the family more than in the United States, it's a much bigger country, one can choose his
His profession is not hindered by the duty of his family and the woman. I can choose, I love merengue, I like Spanish because it's a part of my soul. I am a professional and I'll stay in the United States.
I choose music
A small country has the power of money.
Has a limit
Yes
Virtually, do you understand? so, if you come from a rich family, you can have more money, but if you come from a middle class family, since the country is so small
Yes
You have no chance. Once you have sold to the hundred people living there, you can't sell any more.
Yes
You sold already, so, in a country with a bigger population, there are more opportunities because unfortunately, money talks
None
Then it doesn't matter what class or what family, right? not even what class,or what family, or what's your name, because
What matters is if you can produce and make money for me
Yes.
Understand? Since there is many people among who I can choose then everybody has the chance to stand out.
Yes.
That's why my dad says Argentina is such a rich country.
Yes
The difference between the United States and Argentina is one zero, we have a little more than thirty million inhabitants and the United States have almost
Three hundred million
Yes
That makes a lot of difference and we will feel it.  The power and the monetary powers will move.
Hello
Hello good evening. How are you?
Hello, How are you? I'm Alicia
Yes, I'm calling from Philadelphia,  where are you?
Philadelphia, I'm in Atlanta, Georgia.
Okay, we are still in the East coast, no?
Yes, precisely. Here is quite hotter than in Philadelphia
How nice, yes, you are more to the south. You have good weather, we are here putting up with the cold, though today is not that bad, today is like forty degrees
It's good in Pennsylvania is colder, how funny.
I think we are awaiting some snow this weekend.
How exciting! Just in time for Christmas!
It would be nice a white Christmas like
That's never happened to me.
Yes
I've never on snow christmas
You haven't seen snow?
Yes, I have, when I've lived
White Christmas
It never snowed for the twenty fifth of December, so back luck.
The topic seems to be the music.
Yes, the music. Exactly.
Music helps unite different societies or different types of peopl.
I think so,only because there have been revolutionary or cultural movements in which music has played an important role for that movement, for example
In Cuba, the troba, Rodriguez, Pablo Milanes and all those people,  the messages, the political motivation through music.
Music was a fundamental part of hippies in the United States.
Their movement, their messages, the problem is that nowadays, people listen to stupid music that has no meaning, the songs are
Very boring love songs, this music has no message, obviously it doesn't unite people.
It creates a space between them instead of uniting them, do you understand?
Yes nowadays the music is based in romance, relationships and not in
Sure
There are no political or controversial
Sure
Between the Hispanics, I know? Maybe Ricardo Arjona.
Arjona is some ways yes, but he's too posh for these things.
Yes
He does have political messages and all of that, but he's more general. He's not a revolutionary like Silvio Rodriguez. It seems that
Maybe, he's older or was a bit older, how can you say it? Well he is less idealistic and he has more existentialist subjects, I love Silvio Rodriguez and one time
I went to Mexico City to watch him play, it was fantastic, I was eighteen years old, just for three days to watch them play.
Was it good?
It was excellent, he had some really good new songs, the guitar, the music, he played the violin and the guitar,
I'm interested in technique, I noticed that his style had changed. The guitar was less folk-styled than in the seventies.
More guitar
Wow
Yes, and you?
I'n not that talented in the artistic sphere and i have no talents
What?
I do appreciate music a lot, and I like espcially the ones that have a message.
Sure. Good messages, I mean
None
Instead of
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT WHEN YOU SAY IN OUR HISTORY, IN CRUCIAL TIMES, MUSIC HAS BEEN IMPORTANT
Right, and music is always the voice of a generation as well
Yes, you're right
What kind of music do you like to listen to?
Generally I like Hispanic Music, Latin music most of all
Sure
It has more kinds
None
More emotion, more passion, but, how do you call it? but, I also like
But, what kind of Hispanic music?  Latin Rock, Cumbia, Ranchera, or more like ballads?
I really liked the Salsa
Salsa, yes it's true.
I really love it.
Arjona is really good I remember
Now there is a rhythm really fast, but
None
Is reggaeton, but sometimes, the messages from that music are not necessarily the best
What kind of music is reggae town?
Yes, the reggaeton, have you heard Daddy Yankee, Daddy Yankee?
No
Daddy Yankee
What happened?
Hello, I don't know there was some kind of interference there
Yes, that's weird, I haven't listened. Yankee dale is his name?
It's called Daddy Yankee, also Don Omar, Tego Calederon, Ivy Queen. They are the most known inside that genre. It's like Raggae but it incorporates something from the merengue, some house
Oh, it's really moved
Yes
So, it's nice to Dance. I'm into listening Juanes at this moment
Yes Juanes, he has a little nice music, and well, he has some messages in his songs, right?
Yes, but generally only humor and I can listen to some romantic and then I get bored because there must be something more in life.
I like
I'm dying for you, do you understand. it's a bit
Corny,
It's corny, that's right, I had forgotten about that word. Hey, where are you from?
I'm from Guatamala.
Guatemala, that's interesting, I'm from Chile
You are from Chile
There are some good Chilean rock bands that I really like. I don't know if you ever heard of Luz y Vela (Light and Candle).
I haven't heard of them. There are lots of bands, South American groups, Rick, that are very good
Have you heard of the Petineli?
No, I haven't.There is a group called Mosca(the fly) its an Argentinian band.
You haven't heard them? They must be kind of new.
I don't know if they are new but they have nice music.
The Mosca, is that Rock music?
It's similar to Rock
I'm going to have to listen to them, there was an Argentinian group that I really liked, the Suite del Garabat,
It's entertaining and it's now in Chile too, the three, I loved that group, I don't know if they still play but they were very good in the nineteens.
Do you like American rock?
I do like it, in general terms but old American rock, for example, music from the sixties, Bob Dilan, British bands too, Pink Floyd, I loved the Doors, that type of old music, I love it.
And now
The group Queen?
Queens they're good
And the group Creedens?
I never liked Queens becuase I don't know the foreign.
No
For some reason.
Guns and Roses is a little more modern but they were good.
Guns and Roses were fun.
Yes, but also they sometimes had romantic ones, and they were very good.
Sure, like that one, yes I remember the video even the November rain or also that song called patient

I LISTEN TO NATIONAL ROCK, WHICH IS ARGENTINIAN ROCK
Yes, tango
I also have many tango, and other music called Samba, which is more like country music.

Yes, from our countries
Yes , it seems that it happens to all of use, did you when they are
None
Once I got here, I started to listen more music from each country. Many people, Chilean, Mexican, they told me that
That this had happened and able to listen to international music, when they were in their country and when they came here, they listened to native music. I don't know if this will be true or not, it happened to me
None
None
What do you think about music? Is it a bringer of world peace?
No,
What's one of the questions, certain?
No, I think
I don't think so
I don't think so. Look at the things that happen and there's music.
None
How many thousands of years and the things keep happening, the same, they're things, I love music, it relaxes your soul
Sure, but there's
It's nothing more than this.
Yes
So, I repeat, I love music, but, no, the world wouldn't be nice without music. But I don't think it fixes anything either
No,
Just ask John Lennon.

Yes, some nut who said he was a fan of the Beatles' or John Lennnon's, I don't know.
He said, no. He got a message and had to kill him but didn't kill him out of hate or anything like that
Yes. A nut.
He went crazy in a minute, the guy, and killed him just reading a news article. About the man
Yeah
He got a signal that he had to kill a lot of people.  But he didn't really attack him for the music or anything like that
No, I think music helps in every way, a concert helps to increase brotherhood between countries.
Maybe it's not enough, but I think it helps something, right? at least is therapy for many people
Another way like you say it calms a lot
None
It's weird, I think that, not like soccer that for example creates passion, music doesn't cause that, at least, no?
None
It doesn't cause fights or turn people against each other, like the passions caused by an event such as soccer
Sure
You, more than any one, knows it since you are Argentinian, Right?
Yes.
There the bars are fierce, for example
Amazed
How about the music? The music in fact contributes, no
It contributes something to peace.
Yes I think so, anyways, right?

They were fascinated with Boston. Philadelphia is not so beautiful, but I want to get to know it.
No. They have another. I went to Boston once for a weekend; I have a friend there too. And I loved it. Its seems like Boston is like a toy, it's all cute and clean,
Philadelphia is a city like Argentinian cities. Do you understand? They have cute things but other things are a disaster.
He said the same. The noise they make. I am going to
Yes
The supermarket to buy meat for Christmas because
None
My siblings live here in Miami. I spend holidays & feel a little hot weather

What a luck to have them near you.
Yes, of course. I really found this work because my sister lived in Boston, I came to visit her.
None
They came to live in Miami later.
An well, they went to look for a little bit of hot. Boston, cold right? terrible.
Yes, terrible. The truth is that it was terrible cold and it was nice too. Here I am, I was at the beach today
Great
It is incredible the same country and there is snow, everything, is like, I donÂ´t know.
You feel like you were not in the United States when you are in Miami.
All of them. I went to Buenos Aires Baker and I ate some invoices and I was listening the conversation of the other table
Sure, not here. Philadelphia I believe, it's even worse than Boston.
That's amazing.
There are no Argentinian restaurants, but we do have Hispanics.
Sure, we only have one and it's a bit far away, I've only been there once
Aha, and how was it? Was the food tasty or not?
Yes. No. You eat well. That's right you do eat well and you can have a Quilmes beer.
None
That's good and I was going to ask you something but I forgot. Are your boys there? Oh no, the boys left for California.
THEY WENT TO CALIFORNIA,AND THEY LEFT, WHEN DID I LAST SEE THEM? ON THURSDAY, I BELIEVE THEY WERE LEAVING YESTERDAY.
I'm going to call them tomorrow. What about you, do you have friends in Boston?
I have one friend that doesn't know anything about biology. She's a friend from school who went to Havard and married an American man.
That's fine, she has nothing to do with it.
Oh no, nothing to do with biology, no, I hope I get to meet some. I also have one friend, her name is Ana Avalos, do you know her?
Sure.
I don't really know where she works, I think it's Tufts or in Harvard. Ana Avalos.
Ana? No.
She's the only girl, she's younger than myself but yes, she's in Boston. Some other guys are from Mar del Plata but I barely knew them because they left a lot of years ago.
Their names are Liliana and Eduardo.
No, I haven't met anyone from Mar del Plata in Boston.
No, they are the only ones. After that I don't know anybody else.
So we will surely meet.
Yes
The next time you come to Boston,call me
Just like that, how funny
Yeah, there's no problem
That's very good. It
It is, yes, and have you spoken to any
I got a Mexican girl that I didn't know, one for you, Leticia, and Mariano, I was laughing.
You got to talk about them
Yes,it's not like we agreed on it or something.
Look, i haven't. Well, i got this and no, yesterday i was talking to an Argentinian that lived in Toronto and after that no, Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, to tell the truth it's really a bit crazy
None
It's interesting, meeting other people,
You're left wanting to ask about everyday stuff
Yes, just like that and afterwords, you make some bucks too
And yes, while you're at it
That, obviously, and is it very cold in there or not?
Not here, it was really nice today. The truth is that it doesn't seem like Philadelphia, every time i go out,there is heating in here because it's an old building, it has air-conditioning heating
Yes
You preserve the heat. This is why when I go out I put on eighty layers of clothes. And today I was too hot, I had to take off the hat, the gloves, everything because it was
There was a bit of sun. It was good.
Yes, I was talking with my roommate from Argentina and she told me it was fifty degrees.
None
Fahrenheit, obviously. No? What is it? Ten.
Yes. It is nine or ten degrees.
She has a method - good. It's five, forty and five, ten, fifty, fifteen...
I always do minus thirty two divide two
No, like that is good. She made the calculation, it's great.
How is it? Forty you add five, forty five, ten and fifty, fifteen.
Just like that.
The rest you don't add.
Sure, exactly. Sixty would be twenty.
Yes, there.
There it is, how nice.
The math
No? We study so much
Yes and with inches, and with pounds, don't they make you crazy? I, no.
I still don't know.
Now recently I've started to lose a bit, they say everything to me in miles, in inches, in pounds. I keep looking at it like they're saying, for it to add up.
Yes, I still don't know how tall I am, let's say, in feet.
No, in feet, no. Because even the difference are very small because a person who is five feet is really short, but someone who's six is like
None
It's five that you should measure, but no
Yeah, that's it. How many calls do you have?
And this is the fourth . I started a little while ago.
If you make five calls, you earn fifty more dollars?
Yes
How is this? It's within the twenty five calls or after?
I don't know if it's in total. Sure, it wasn't very clear to me either. In reality I was missing a lot and I didn't give, but
It's five plus the twenty, I think
Ah, okay.
Im not sure,but when your profile appears, the maximum number of calls appearing are twenty.
Yes.
So, I don't know, I had a doubt because it the maximum is twenty then it would be within the twenty.
I will send a mail and I will ask them. I'm already at seven!
I want to find out. Besides here I have my sister's telephone, my brothers, all to do this.
Sure.Keep doing it till the last one is left.
Sure, it's I don't know, five in a row. It won't be five in a row, it doesn't have anything to do with it.
No. It shouldn't have anything to do with it. I don't think so. Inc-
Sure, you see. Is Laura your name?
None
Yes, quite different. I don't know why, that's so funny.  I'm sure, maybe I'll be there next month. I'll take a China bus on the weekend and
And you'll come here. It's on.
And I might go visit my friend.
Oh yes, you are going to like it. Philadelphia is a beautiful city which has ups and downs and interesting things to see.
I really want to visit now that we're hear, we should visit places.
Yes, I'd have to travel a bit far away, to all the cities that are nearby. I'm still missing New York, it's the first one in the whole world that I saw
Some better idea like it
Go there in the summer, it's completely different
In the summer? Yes
It's really nice, I loved it in the summer, two days you sleep there, but are you coming back?
In a hostel, I go back during the day because I live close, it's one hour away.
You have never been there?
I know everyone hates me for that.  The ones from Argentina tell me they can't believe it.  They say I'm and idiot, and ask how is it you've never been there?  I don't know why.
How long are you staying?
My contract is valid until October of next year and then I don't know if I'm going to renew it or not. I don't know yet.
That would be two years. Sure, it's all right.
Yes, so far you, I mean five years top right ? for a post-doctorate? But I think my bosses subvention has it.
Sure.
For the pay I receive, she has it for more than a year. So I think that until July two thousand and seven, something like that, and
Of course, what a shit
Nothing. Now I am looking for a scholarship, but, I am not too excited because I donÂ´t want to stay here for three more years, so let see if
I am going through the same thing.  I have two more years of work here, but
Of course.
I want one more year to learn.
Yes.
I prefer to learn other things. I have to make this place.
Are you here? Yes, and would you go for the postdoc to another place?
Of course that is, but I donÂ´t know, lets see. I am happy living this situation but it is not the right place for me, for my life.
No, you don't like it. Do you want come back to Argentina? right.
I'm in love with Argentina, but I don't know. We scientists are jerks. How could you be a scientist in Argentinian?
Of course, No, we are big jerks, but well.
Well, see it.
No, I don't think I am going to come back.
Of course.
Hello
My name is Miriam.
Hello Miriam, Marcela.
Nice to meet you Marcela Where are you calling from?
I'm here in Salem, North Carolina.
Okay I'm here in Toronto Canada
You're far
You're already far
Where are you from?
I'm from Lima, Peru.
I'm from Argentina.
Yes, I noticed the accent
You can always see our true colors.
Do you travel a lot?
No,when my parents immigrated to the United States.
None
Then in the summer, I'm fifty-one so this is old history
None
In the summer of seventy I was fifteen years old and went to Europe. For the summer, yes that was fun, and then the next summer of seventy one we went to Argentina.
In the whole time that we had arrived since sixty four, that we hadn't returned.
Wow
I didn't go out any more until '85, after I went back to Argentina. I was thirty by then, and I went back with my 3 year old son.
None
Three years.
None
My husband entered into army and we moved to north carolina from los angeles
None
After I didn't travel again except to go to New York because my older son was at NYU, and now lives in Connecticut
None
And so, these trips, and to Miami to see my mom and my father when they traveled from Argentina because it's cheaper if they
Come to Miami. I go to get them.
How nice, and you travel by plane, or by bus
When I go to New York or to Miami we go in the car.
Oh how nice.
In the car, yes. But after the summer of two thousand four, I traveled with my husband and older son, who'c seventeen. We have two sons, that's all.
None
And we went to Buenos Aires.
None
It was my husbands first visit to Argentina, he couldn't go in 1985
Your husband is Argentinian too!
No, he's American
Thats nice,and you did not lose the accent
No, because I never spoke English at home
Your husband speaks, Spanish
At home, we all speak english. my kids are billigual because I spoke spanish when they were young.
Yeah, sure
My son was nine and the eldest was three. i don't know what happened. We started speaking more in English. And now we communicate more in English
Yeah
It's rare that we speak spanish, but when my parents are here, everyone speaks spanish. Except Rene, my husband, who only knows a word here and there, he's never made any effort
Oh, look at that.
He has said he's going to learn because he doesn't want to go back to Argentina without understanding or speaking, but he hasn't done anything yet.
Nice, but then you have the accent because of your daddy, right?
Sure
If it's not in the country, it's very hard to keep
Yes, I think it is.But I don't know. I don't know because I haven't met any other people from Argentina who've been here for a long time.
My sons have both an Argentinian accent
How interesting
Especially the youngest, the eldest has it a little more mixed up
Yeah
Because when she was a student he worked for a long time in a restaurant, and in restaurants he spoke Spanish with people from Mexico.
Yes
He has a touch of Mexican that makes him very nice.
Yes, because sometimes one can spread it.
Yes
Without wanting it, one goes around catching it, leaving it here, leaving it there.
Yes
And the accents don't mix
And this, but the little one especially has an Argentinian accent, mixed with the American accent, but it's an Argentinian accent.
How interesting.
This, it's funny, that they still don't have the accent.
Your Spanish is really pure. Yes, because there are people who are like you.
None
The English are people who
Yes
Whose Spanish isn't that great.
Yes, I speak English without an accent.
None
I don't have any accent when I speak English
And you will speak like an American because you learned English since you were really young.
From when I was really small,
Your Spanish is really good too
Thanks
Yeah, how nice.
Yes, your
Look, I'm a coward, I pretty much don't like to teavel. before nine eleven happened I was already afraid of planes.
I'm a lot more scared.
But you're
I don't like planes much.
You're losing opportunities,
It won't be. I came to Toronto and traveled by car to Montreal, Quebec, and Ottawa.
None
And these are my travels, nothing more.
You have to get up because, the truth is that it's much more dangerous in a car that in a plane.
That's what they say.
Because the statistics. It's marked, the exit ticket, if it's your turn, it's your turn, and this is the day and there's nothing you can do.
And in any moment I think, this can happen also in the safety of my house. This really happens.
You can go to unplug the iron and there you are.
It's true.
So this is why you have to get inspired.
Yes, I have to get inspired, and travel there.
I would like to go to Barcelona, because my grandparents are Catalan.
Oh, look, how nice..
And I have family in Barcelona, but I've never met them, and they haven't met me
None
They know I exist but nothing else.
None
I would like to go to Barcelona, because when I was in Europe, I went to London, Paris, Switzerland, Florence, Rome and Naples, but I didn't go to Barcelona.
To Barcelona. We didn't go to Spain at all.
How nice, you've traveled.
And then I would like to travel to Spain, but specifically Barcelona.
Right, how nice.
And I'm also curious to go to India.
Oh, India, wow, that is so big.
Always here hoping for the opportunity to come, I'm not going to see it, what a shame because the issue is going to China,
None
BECAUSE IT'S CHANGING SO FAST
None
So fast everything, that in five years the China that you will see, is not the China of your fantasy
Of the western people, we have certain fantasies of certain countries, of how they are,
None
It's going forward so much and it

Yeah, the truth is that the money, and the children. so next year, when he's at college, i will have more freedom
But my husband has a more steady job
Yeah, right.
And so, you can't just say, well, let's travel
Right, right
If I had the money, I would be traveling. I love to travel.
That's good
I love to travel, if someone has to travel, i say to him do you need a ride to the airport?, I'll take you; because i love airports.
The train stations, the airport, it gives me that feeling of anticipation, like I'm about to get on something that's going to take me to some place
Look at that, how nice, you have an adventuro?us spirit, you were born with a spirity like that , right?
I love it, look, when i was sixteen years old, i had done
Right
The whole plan is to travel by train from Los Angeles to Buenos Aires
Right
I was going on the train to Los Angeles , San Diego , Tijuana.
You can do this?
Yes you can and my parents
How interest.
They did not want me to.They closed their mouth and didn't say anything.
None
But after the mess happened in Nicaragua.
Yeah, the
So in the seventies it wasn't the same, it was dangerous a young
Dangerous
A woman alone
Alone
I must have been crazy, but when you're sixteen, seventeen, you think you're invincible.
Yeah it's true
And after my husband was in the army he came here. My older son was five and we were
So happy because we didn't have to come with a van that we had,
None
WE HAD TO WAIT A WEEK THEY STOLE THE VAN
Aye, what a shame,
They had taken everything when they found it was totally destroyed  just days before leaving
None
The insurance paid us a little money compared to the van cost, and we came by airplane, that adventure was stolen.
What a shame,
They didn't steal my car, they stole the adventure.
The adventure. it's never too late, now your son will to to university, you'll have more free time,
Yes, I think that I'll have more opportunities. Now, what I have to do is get some money together.
Don't get scared of the bad guys, the bad people along the way. I've changed my thinking a lot about
You know what crossed my mind,
None
It crossed my mind, sure when I go to New York or something like that. I make sure, since I'm taking my wallet.
I'm in the middle with a lot of people around me. I'm conscious, even when I went to Buenos Aires in two thousand four, I didn't go around with my wallet.
Aha.
Sure, they saw me with my husband speaking English
And they think that we have money
They think they came from the United States. They have money.
None
And we didn't have any money. We were dying of hunger.
Yeah
But this, everyone said don't take your wallet. Don't take your wallet, don't take jewelry, don't take anything.
No,
Since the times are hard, there's much more crime in Buenos Aires.
There, they take your wallet, the
Yes
It's like Lima, Lima is terrible until
Hi, this is Vanessa from San Diego.
Hi, this is Carlos, from Houston, Texas
From Houston?
Houston, yes
And, how's it over there, cold?
It's beautiful here. It's in the seventies, and there?
That's interesting, I thought it would be chilly
We wore shorts and t-shirts
It's the same here, always around the sixties, at night it may go down to fifties
That's good
Yes
Where are you from?
I'm from Puerto Rico, and you?
Likewise, that's
None
The voice told me
How long have you been in the United States?
Five years and a half
Oh yes?, do you like it?
I'm here for college and didn't choose to stay in Puerto Rico.
What are you studying?
Virology, i work with viruses
That's interesting
Yes
Are you doing a doctorate?
Yes
I'm very interested in alternate forms of medicine.
Help with diseases and viruses and i was reading about the coconut oil, have you studied the, or the, what the coconut oil does for killing certain viruses and all that?
No, I never heard of that before.
Yes, a while ago I was reading that it helps for HIV, AIDS, osteoporosis, hepatitis and many more things.
Something they say it's almost miraculous
That's good
What do you plan on doing after you finish your doctorate?
I still haven't decided. Research, teaching, I don't know, we'll see.
What's your specialty then?
Pardon me?
Do you have any specialization?
No, not in particular.
Nothing in particular. That's very interesting, Hail Mary. So I imagine you're not going back to Puerto Rico
I go there every year, mostly for Christmas, but there isnâ€™t much work in Puerto Rico.
I'm talking about the topic.  I haven't returned to Puerto Rico since ninety eight.  Things were so bad when I went over there that I have no interest in returning.
And I hardly have any family anyway, so I don't have much reason to go.
Okay listen, I always go every year at least for one or two weeks.
In San Juan, I don't think that I've never had any problems, never.
The family has never had problems with anything thank God.
Aha are you in San Juan?
Yes.
How good.
No, right now I'm in Houston. I was there two months ago.
None
Usually, the time I have to travel that's what I do.
I don't like
Go to Puerto Rico.
Traveling too much because I'm terrified of planes
None
And I try not to ride one unless I have to.
Okay.
So
If that wasn't the case then where would you like to go?
In May God willing I'm going to Spain, Italy, to Europe.
What a good life.
Yes
I was there in May.  I was in Holland
Oh, how nice
I loved it.  I'm crazy to go back
And you went there to study?
Yes, to work.  I spent one week working and one week on vacations.
It was interesting.
Travelling, relaxing, not having to worry for the work. It was basically like I go somewhere, sit down, give me a beer...
Some other place.  No worries, that is divine
How good. And are there many Puerto Rican in Houston?
People keep coming here.
None
There are a lot of universities so many people come here to study
In San Diego I haven't met any Puerto Rican
None
And I've been here about four five years, and not a single Puerto Rican
Sure.
Yes, things don't look good, there are a lot of Mexican
Really,only Mexican here
When I moved here, there were two Puerto Ricans and the next year four more came, and the other year, and every year came about three or four
It is always so
And do you think it is because of the working situation in Puerto Rico that it got better?
It's rather because  here in Hous, in the medical center, there are so many hospitals and universities that many people come here for that
I have a lot of friends, a lot of them in Florida. It looks like everybody enjoys going to Florida.
Basically in Puerto Rico
Yes, and specially, I think by Orlando, in that area, there is
Es, my brother moved there last year, my brother
Who? Does he like it?
Yes
And is he also in school?
No, mechanical. I am the only one in my family
Yes, over there in Southern New York and it has also been long since I went to New York and New Jersey
I also have family there, that's life. No, I don't travel often. I camp a lot and I do try to travel along the California coast.
In California there are different visiting places and so many things to see there. But so called big trips I haven't done any for many years.
And where else would you like to go besides Europe?
No.  That's the first I would like to do.  I would like to travel the whole coast of California, Oregon, Washington
And afterwards Canada, and get to Alaska if I can. But I would like to do that by train or car to see everything
I am crazy to go to Australia
Yes
Because it has caught my attention
Yes, my husband. But I have never had any interest in going to Australia. But, what would you like to see in Australia? Because it is in another continent and the difference
I have seen documentaries about such things in the TV and it looked very nice
Surfing nature, I mean, you can go camping, backpacking. And besides I find the Australian accent fascinating
Do you camp a lot? Do you go backpacking?
I'd like to do that, travelling. I like going on the Appalachian way
Yes
I think all of it goes from Georgia to the very North. I love everything related to nature. I love camping.
One of my favourite places, I lived some time in Tennessee, in Nashville. I used to go there to camp, go on river rafting
Things like this. Here in Texas there are not many places to go camping. I like one place, in Huntsville, about one hour far from Houston.
There I can go camping, etiher is a lake to go kayak. And I can also go paddling. I love all these things
We have a lot of that here, If you have heard about the Appalachian trails, then you must have heard of the Pacific, haven't you?
Yes
We are into a group called the Venture Group, for men and women
Go on excursion to the Pacific
OK
We go for two or three days and try to do little stages, but it is very interesting and hard as well carrying backpack
Big backpacks, weighing sixty pounds or so. Very nice. Here the climate is always comfortable, so camping is easy.
Don't need no air-conditioned or heater
No
It's always nice. The weather is really nice there.
Yes, the weather is really nice and beautiful. There are beaches, lakes, mountains, deserts
If you drive an hour in one direction, you arrive to the mountains, the snow.  If you drive one hour in the other direction, you are in the desert.
Other site with lakes, there are really everything to
Like I was saying
You can
Like i was saying, in puerto rico, you can be
Yes
A little low on beach, a little low in caves, or dry forest
Yes, n a larger scale here, but Puerto Rico, it's the only site I've visit that has that much
Topography
Where you would not like to travel?
No, I'm not interested in going to Japan, my Husband has travel to Japan in work, he really like it, but he says is
All that different and that many people
It doesn't interest me, maybe a little bitI mean, nor Japan, nor Chine, Asia in general,
Good day. Good evening

None
All of it, and its surroundings,
Yes, the Middle East in general
Yes, but the main thing, the most important
Yes
Would be the money
Details, details

One thing I had seen, we are already in the twenty first century. One of the things, for example, communication, which includes what type of phone are you using? A cellular?
It's a cordless.

None
The telephone connection is through the Internet

The commute is easy, and I go to visit my dad once a year.
None
I go in twelve house, I go from here to there, I go Philadelphia - Miami, or Philadelphia to New York, from New York to
San Paolo, Brazil, to Asuncion in Paraguay
None
This is the place I want to go to
I'm compromising ,me and my finance , we would like to go to Europe, being in Philadelphia it's really easy
None
The flight there costs less than two hundred dollars
None
Direct flight from here to Paris
None
In one jump, and a few hours, it seems to be that our ability to travel, communicate, to send,
None
Send things by mail, by Fed Ex, whatever
None
Changes the way of seeing the world. Everything seems a lot closer from here, for example I in case of an emergency.
I could practically go to any part of the world in less than a day
None
Can go whenever I want
It's like a power
I like it a lot
To visit other places and more when you have the opportunity
I've always realized that the  details for example, the money.
Yes,
Traveling is much cheaper now than before
Yes, but
Yeah,
For me it's not,
It's not cheaper.
To not
No, it's less expensive than before.
Yes. True.
Yes but traveling still cost
Yes,
Even if you drive
I would also live very much to know Spain. I more than anything have researched a lot but on the internet. Each place that I think of on the internet and
Yes
I imagine like I'm in those places. No, that's the only way that I can do it, otherwise no, my economic situation is not
Not enough for now
It doesn't allow me, yes
Yes, I wanted to go to Paraguay for example, I remember when I had just gotten the the United States, ten years ago.
Calling on the phone to Paraguay, it cost approximately a dollar per minute. And being young, I would call home and say hi to my mom
I would talk with my dad
None
A while: hello, how are you! Twenty dollars,
Yes. Now it's much easier, right?
It was cheaper. Back then I would pay more than one thousand dollars for a trip from Kansas to Paraguay.
None
Now I'm in Philadelphia, the last time I went, it's been already like two years
None
It's been almost three years that I don't go
None
However, the last time that I was there, I remember that I had to pay around five hundred and sixty dollars
None
Instead of the usual thousand, it's so much easier now than it used to be
None
It's still five hundred and sixty dollars
None
And earning per the hour, that's a good deal
Yes, if you make some numbers. How many hours do you work?
Yes, exactly
To be able to give yourself a little treat, to be able to be with your family
I remember the last time that I was in Paraguay, some friends were there and they asked me about it. I remember that at that time I was earning about two thousand dollars per month.
I was working so hard, and I was like a computer technician software too
None
When I said that I was earning two thousand dollars per month, that's
None
Twenty-four thousand per year. That's something but it's not fantastic.
Not here.
Not here
NONE
I remember when I was there I was wanting to say to the person I am making good money but I'm not a millionaire
I know a couple from Paraguay. I like them a lot and I talk to them a lot.
Yeah,
It calls a lot of attention, it looks good I like it well, the tone of voice that they have there, you're able to understand it very well
Thank you. One that I remember is that I told them I only make two thousand dollars!
They would have said a million dollars practically, it's
None
A ton of money for them. They are in an economic recession, it's difficult to
Yes, there are a lot of places that people would like to see, right? But there's a lot of obstacles that don't allow anyway
Sure,
It's worth it to dream
Have a brother in San Francisco he also works in IT
One thing I know is that the Network Administrator can do it each time. The new Sony PSP comes.
Like a little toy practically
None
What's it cost, three hundred, four hundred dollars.
None
Yes, he bought onehe was complaining that he doesn't have any money, that he can't travel, he can't come, I couldn't sorry, my mother is here in Philadelphia also
My Mom doesn't, he couldn't come to visit because he didn't have the money
None
But he had just bought a new digital camera, an expensive one, he also bought a new laptop too
None
Expensive,
None
Because it was the latest one to come out
I imagine
The thing is that he, for example, with the last one, the new one came out, he had the last one, that had just come out of the factory
None
It's still hot, and he has it
None
He's happy with this but, this left him with no money, he almost can't do anything more than this
Yes,
This is a decision that, for example, he made the decision. He preferred to have a new device
He's always so avant-garde
Exactly. A-vant-guarde is anything having to do with technology
None
This cost him the power
No
He wants to travel and have the power to do things he wants to do.
None
Other things.
None
If you have to choose, either this, or you do this
Or it's one or the other
One, or the other, it can't be both
None
This is something that, I think it's stupid when, seeing that he complains that he doesn't have money, but after he talks about his new PSP
None
You choose one
People like this don't grab my attention because you always excel.  No?
Yes,
Iin my land we're snapping our fingers there, because he does it, or now I need
For example, there I buy things. Things recently are pretty expensive but I take care
None
I gather every bit with care.
None
And I have it for a long time
None
My telephone for example, it's an iPod that's expensive, but I've had this for a few years
When I bought it it was cutting edge, the latest one, but now, it's already showing its age.
None
But it's still useful to me, I need to have the very last
None
I need something that is useful to me.
If we analyse it, the times are not to be in the vanguard but to somehow survive. that's how things are
I am studying now to be able to find a job and get paid enough.
None
Enough to keep in the vanguard without worries
None
Without
Yes, it's New York,
Well my name is Claudia
Yes is New York. What Claudia?
Yes, my name is Claudia.
Where are you from?
I'm from Mexico City, and where are you from?
I'm from Panama, but where are you calling from?
I'm calling from Idaho.
You're from the potato
And where are you at? Yes, and where are you from?
In New York
Look from the other side
The stat- yes tell me.
Yes, what do you think about music? Does it play an important role in your life?
Yes? It's that music fills the lonely moments of my life. Always when I'm alone that I need something to give.
I always choose music,it feels me spiritually.
Wow, look also for me. Music is something very important because, for example, I like to be cleaning my house and all that
I turned on radio to cheet me up and finish sooner. I do like music, my favorite is
None
The music that's not so loud
Like instrumental.
And something like that, instrumental, but also for example, sometimes I put on music for example cumbia, salsa, music because I also like that music to dance to.
None
When I need to hurry to clean house, I put on that type of music.
None
And woo I hurry faster, than if I put an instrumental one yes, I like it a lot, and what type of music do you like?
Yes, in reality I don't have a preference
None
I like any type of music
None
I like to listen to Jazz and instrumental.
None
And, I myself fill up the part, the spiritual part with my thought, the part of the music that doesn't have words like my thought. I listen to reggeaton, I listen to any type of music.
None
The salsa, the cumbia, I listen to anything I like it. As long as it has a message. And the song that has a message I like much more, understand.
None
Listening to something it's just noise for the ears, something that has no message.
Yes
Constructive, for example, there's music that always talks of a man than of a woman or a woman than of a man that the feelings failed, broken feeling, broken heart
None
I'm going to cry. I'm not going to cry. That type of music doesn't attract me too much for the sense of reason that
That instead of cheering you up, it depresses you.
Yes true, I don't like that type of music either is bad normally the music, for example, there's country music which is from my country
I get to listen to it but is not really my favorite, I like happy music a lot.
That wakes up a good spirit; that music has a good rhythm to dance to, if it's the time to dance
None
The music that keeps me in a good mood and, and for example in the house now I listen, to children's music now because my son is now almost two years old then he also likes the music and I also put children's music
Children. How nice.
And I also like to sing the songs that I remember that my mom used to sing to me when I was little to my son, and then
There's always music in my house.  Maybe we can live without television, but without the radio, I don't think I could live
I likewise get
Yes I use the radio a lot
I'm always listening to the radio, in the car, in the house
None
I like to feel it because it cheers me up, makes me faster, and accelerates me.
Yes
I also learn from it because there are music songs that have a message and it's an important message
Yes. Is true. Honestly, I think that the music plays a very important role. For example, there
None
That sometimes, for example, you don't understand it too much,you see that the people are dancing and they are playing this folklore music and that
You feel a peace so great and it starts to get your attention because people is dancing
And so, i think that it, the music can help you, most of the times, to unite other cultures and other countries.
And you're watching how people are enjoying it, you even want to participate, you want to be there and dance if you can. Music is very good
Sure, like everything, there is music that's, i feel that it's destructive, like there are a lot of people that have a lot of satanic music, so, the music  i personally avoid right?
Right, yes
But i think that music, just as it can help you, it can destroy you, because that kind of music leads you to a lot of drugs, vices
And other kinds of music, it kinda helps you get away or forget about that sort of thing and vices, what do you think about that?
There is music that helps. It touches you and helps to clear your mind.
Right
It transmits negative ideas and thoughts
Yes
That without you knowing, it's there. There comes a time when you can't, (How do you say it?), toss it out in the air
Yes
It's the feeling of destruction.
Yes
When people were children, family told them, you don't understand.
Yes
And that remains in your subconscious, that they really think they're worthless
Yes, it's true
Heir, subconscious, not their conscious, but themselves, unconsciously think they can't give much, they can't give much
Yes, yes it's true.
The music plays the same role. A song can play the same role, as certain information can be received and stored.
Yes.
Without you realizing it, there comes a time that you don't explore, make it digente, you do it, you throw it out.
That yes
And unfortunately it results in a catastrophe; it takes a destructive level, for you or other people to understand
Yes, it is true because depending on the type of music you listen to, you start to dress, you start to behave.
You start to style your hair and your appearance starts to reflect it
None
I have realized that, for example in Mexico, if you listen, for example, Mexican rock. Yes, rock in Spanish and such, usually are jeans that fit really tight to your body with fonders and
Spanish rock.
Other type of clothes like types of music
And you are like really mysterious, always and if it's, for example, you like salsa, you dress with, I don't know, with colorful shirts if you're a man or woman and
None
Many times people can tell the type of music you listen to by the way you dress or how you behave.
I think that the music plays important role in your life. and it can help to improve your life.
Have more coexistence with the people or distance yourself from people, to be a loner
I think music plays a very important role in the young people.
Yes.
Is not very suitable and there comes a time when they start to listen to another type of dark music and in a month theyÂ´ve already changed, all their life.
So, in a very short time
Yes
I think that music is very important, what do you think?
Yes, because, like you say, music is a universal language
None
So, the same song gives you a message, whether it's positive or negative, but
Yes
If it's going to be handed to another person, it's like me telling you that you're not worthy or you are worthy, or get up
Yes
You're going to be alright , everything's over. You know, there are some things
Yes it's true.
None
Yes, because i also realized that people of all ages isten to their music
There comes a time when if the artist stands in every concert, they also stand at all times. For example, they
Right
Sometimes the kind of music you listen to

About music, yes
Yes, I wonder how is music nowadays, but I heard recently that Reggae-ton comes from Panama. I don't know if it's correct.
I don't know. I heard it comes from Dominican Republic.

Reggaeton was born in the Dominican Republic, that's what I heard. I'm not sure
I heard Panama, I heard it in the Latim music TV and I know it was Reggae-ton. But I don't know
This is what we know? I thought  it was Dominican
None
Raggae is from Jamaica.

Reggaeton is like a combination of rap, samba, latin rap and things like that
Yes
But I heard that  they showed it, I was watching something there. But the thing is that nowadays music
I don't really like Rap but the influence of Rap, especially among young people,

Yes, for Dominicans, Merengue and baseball are their passion. But Merengue is a little too fast for me.
I find it a little bit too fast. I like old rock and roll, to dance.
None
Like disco, something like this.
Have you listened to Vallenato?
I listen to music in Spanish too but to dance when I go to the disco, something like this. You see it, nothing else.
That the disco music. How is it, this was very disco, dancing. Any time. Seventies, eighties, the disco.
Merengue is music to dance to, it has rhythm.  Latin music also has a lot of rhythm, but I like Merengue music more.
Sure.
A bit too fast. I like to listen to the
No.
Latino songs, too. No, but hey. What I can tell you, music has changed a lot.
Yes
The future of music, I can tell you, I don't know what comes. No, I don't know if it will be music, or if it will be the Banda all the time.
You KNOW like Rap Rap. They speak more than sing, you know? It's speaking more than singing. I don't know if this is his future or not.
What do you like about Latin music?

Dominate the United States.
No.
No.
No, I know is not like that, because I used to live in North Carolina before
Aha, Oh!
Then, yes. I know that the Latins don't dominate the world.

They don't dominate the United States, but you do find many Latins here.
In New York, the Cubans and all those, I have a brother, that lives in Orlando.
Yes, I was also living in New York, like three months.
None
And when I was little, I would go and come a lot to New York.
You
I know it.
You lived in New York, you said?
Three months, I was in New York. And before when I was younger, my mom would always bring me to New York. That we would stay three months, we would return to Colombia.
We would come here to visit
To which part of New York, would you come?
I would go to Queens or sometimes I would go to Manhattan
Ah Manhattan, yes, because I live in Manhattan. I live in Manhattan, but where are you from? When was the last time that you came to
New York?
To New York it's been like three years.
It's been three years.
Yes.
There is a lot of Latin accent
Latin in all parts of the world.
Yes
Because here, there's a lot of the things they put that are written In Spanish and in English
Make sure to learn English.
Sure.
No, don't talk nonsense that you don't speak. Talk and learn English because when you return to your country
The rich and influencial people in my country speak English.
Yes.
Only rich ones
Learning another language is very important
Yes.
If you live in an English speaking country, you must learn to speak in English, no matter how many Latins you find around you.
And not only, one important thing I can say in life, when I left Panama I learned a lot more about my country.
More about my country outside than when I was inside.
None
I learned more about my country when I was outside than when I was inside. When you are inside,
None
You know how it is. They feed you with politics, and falls. Your country loves you, but when you go out mabe you learn to observe.
To observe and to think more, About your country, the things that, What happens
And you can compare it to other countries when you are outside. Because in the Latin countries, the poorest people are fed with politics to eat
Sure
They tell them that the United States are to blame for everything in the world. That makes me laugh.
Because I tell them, to me, seventy percent of your problem is internal. Thirty percent external
You know what I mean? Because they think that all the problems
Yes
The problems of their country are due to the United States. This is the policy of the rich and the middle class, tell the people
Most of the people there. And they put the blame on the United States, for everything. For instance, if you go out and observe your country
You will see that seventy percent of the problems are internal problems. The other thirty percent have an external cause.
You know what I mean?
Yes
But you can just tell them because they won't believe you, specially the poorest. The poorest are fed politics
Yes. That's why Panama lives out of the most rich and powerful. They are all citizen, American citizen
Yes
Yes, remember that in many Latin countries you can have two citizenships. You can be a citizen of Colombia if you are from Colombia you will always be a Colombian, right?
Yes
You can go back to Colombia and vote, tomorrow if you feel like.
Sure
You will be a Colombian, even if you come here, and you become an American citizen?
You will keep your citizenship
Yes
What you call it?
Colombian citizenship
For all your life, understand?
Yes sir
It's the same in Panama. Understand? I see that all of the richest people and more powerful
In Latin America, and not only LatinAmerica but Europe and the rest of the world as well. I have travelled, I have travelled the world. All the rich and powerful people speak English
In addition to their natural language
Yes
If I go to Germany, they speak German.  But the most powerful, richest speak English as well.  The international language is English
Most of the people don't speak it. When you see contracts and all that written, between one country and one other
It's always written in English. If Argentina is about to do a contract with Japan
Hello Jose.
How is it going, Manuel, I'm in Orlando Florida.
How are you, I'm in New York.
Fine, sorry, where?
In New York.
Hi Jose, nice to meet you.
Likewise
You talk first.
I think that on one hand, it's good, sure that there's a system of handling, I don't know of controlling, what the
The kids can watch, or the type of movie or material that, they are making for a type of ,particular audience, but
Yes
If we are talking about kids also part of the responsibility is also of the parent
Correct. Well, look that in that we fully agree. I think that those classifications are indeed necessary.
None
But the most important and definite part falls on the parents.
None
Because they are the ones who should be aware of what their kids are doing
None
According to their.
None
No, kids decide what they can see.
None
I agree with
And you
They asked something like this, what was the question, they said the moral question or I don't know.
I don't remember, the PG, the classifications well.
Yes, if they agree with that there should be a chip
Yes. Thanks, I rememeber the
The chip in the television
This
So the parents can control
This is really effective. In fact all the cable companies now
None
Are offering this helps and I think it's really important.
I think it's like a po
But we come back to the same thing, if the parents don't use this, we win nothing.
None
We don't win anything, so, aside from the class-
Yes
From the same classification, that's a help to a parent. They also need to be aware of what to do or better, whoever's watching the kid, and decide himself if it's appropriate or not.
On Univision, channel fourty one, they had a report on the games
None
How they made kid's games like Nintendo
But we're referring to games, the video games, yes.
That, video games have categories too, and that
It's this.
Some time the parents let them, because the kids want the game that's the most
They don't know the contents.
None
But in reality the topic of today should include this part that I think it's the most problematic for today. The video games, more than television itself
None
All those that are coming now with video games are incredible
None
Most adults don't even know what it's about
Exactly.
The contents that are sometimes so violent and
None
Racist, too.
None
The internet too, they're also using the internet a lot, since they're little, and sometimes the parents don't supervise them.
Yes This, I remember that they came out with a protection when the Internet came out at the beginning, so the parents would buy.
A system should  be able to control the access that the young kids have to certain Internet pages
Yes
I don't know if it's more like a business or if it's really a system to be able to prevent.
That type of content
Well I know that -AOL, which is where I have the subscription, has a very effective filters program,
None
And, at the time of registering, of opening an account for, for a kid, they ask the age, and if is
None
Under twelve, has
None
Certain filters until fifteen others, and then the adults.
You have kids then.
No.
You don't have, okay.
I've been aware of that, and nieces and nephews, and I've been close to them.
None
I know what it's about, I've opened accounts there once again we go to the same thing, the parents,
None
The parents are definitely the ones that play the determinant role there.
Yes
That was the initial question about cinema. I find the qualifications very clear
None
It's up to the theater who they let in.
Yes
But there is a problem. Many kids and youngsters have access to the DVDs
None
YES, THEY DON'T NEED TO GO CINEMA TO WATCH CERTAIN MOVIES
None
The advanced world is confused and the supervision is definitely the parents' duty.
Yes
They are not doing it
Yes, the system could also help when they do, how is it in spanish ?
Some programs like the programs with Janet Jackson in that show,
Yes
She sung and showed a breast on the TV that was pre-recorded
Yes
And shows also. Maybe that would help a little to set, a classification of what kind of
Show or movie
None
Influence
Yes, that is also right
None
It's easier to do it when they are pre-recorded than if they are live
Yes, right.
Definitely, what you just said education, education, and more education
None
About the contents themselves, despite classification, what do you think? About what we are seeing, or what is being shown.
On TV
On TV they are showing much more than they showed before
It does take a lot
I don't know, children are learning more explicit things that when I was a kid
Yes, that is another subject
None
Another part of this subject that can be touched, and there
None
The government does have to act, the contents,
None
Have definitely changed too much
None
I've sometimes sat down to watch the cartoons kids watch nowadays and was stupefied. I didn't watch that
Yes
The cartoons I watched were very innocent
Innocent. It's not
Now, in cartoons
None
TV or internet you see violence incredible things
Yes, more aggressiveness
A lot of aggressiveness, even racism and insults. It's supposedly geared towards kids from six or seven.
None
They're going to grow up seeing that as normal
Yes. That's transferred to the attitude later, to behaviors in school. They've made studies about that. And there's a connection between what they see and what they do sometimes.
Yes
Sometimes, in
The point is that I read and don't remember about that singer who is not so famous and don't know the underground music.
None
In a show, he gouged his eye out, and after that, one of the fans went home and did the same thing
None
They follow
None
Or they have their idols and they really see them as Gods.
None
It's incredible.
That also has a little complicated problem because there's also no supervision, the parents
Knowledge of what they are listening to, I don't know I don't want to just blame the singer in that case, right.
A teenager who has low self esteem, that's partly ingluential what is
Yes
What's happening also in the house, or or in the type of advice that kid is getting. Or not getting
Is true. yes, is that, it all leads to the same, the parents are decisive, and many times they leave their child's education in the hands of could be, the television, I don't know.
And the control; how much television they can watch or not
And especially the quality is very rich, there's a lot to see.
Yes
There are plenty of channels, some very good and very entertaining. I'm happy watching channels like Natural Geographic or the History Channel.
None
In all these travel channels
Yes
Kids and parents watching documentaries together is good. Parents can explain and the kid will be entertained and fascinated watching adventures with real animals.
None
They put them to watch the same cartoons
Sure
That
No, it's getting list, also, that contact, that relationship here, I believe more in the United States than anywhere else.
Yes, believe it or not, that's gonna have a world wide influence,
With all this stress,
All those shows about, aimed for children, the massive ones, they are in the whole world.
Yes, there is little attention, i think, at home. But it's, it's trending, uh, it's, it's getting harder to keep that relationship
With the children at home
Exactly, and the movies, it's the same. In fact, i was reading that there is a crisis now in Hollywood, the box offices aren't responding, well, they don't know what's happening
Well, i think the answer is simple
None
They are showing something else because we are tired of watching the same thing.
Yes
Adventure movies, and fantasies that don't ultimately transmit anything, they don't teach anything
Yeah, of course
We have to search for more educational contents.
Right
That's it, from there.
They lack a lot of education, even though they say they're educating the father with that kind of
Of codes, like PG-13 or et cetera, they
Hi
Hi, how are you?, nice to meet you. Luisa, from Miami, Florida
Ho, what's up? Paulo speaking here from Philadelphia
How are you?
How are you doing?, fine?
Very well
Where are you from?
Colombian
Colombian. Yesterday I spoke to a Colombian boy. What a coincidence. Did you understand something about the subject for today, about the movies?
I tried.
I didn't understand a thing a lot. The truth is i have no idea, the only thing i think is good is that they're blocking
The violent programs for the kids, nothing else. That's the only thing I understood.  After that, the rest of the acronyms, I have no idea what they're about, do you?
As far as i understood, it was the specification of the movies, when they say, PG fourteen it means they can't be seen if they're not older than fourteen, and if they are violent or what do i know. But that's true,
None
I don't understand a thing
The truth is i have no idea about that, so
Of course.
Also
But we should talk about something similar, what kind of movies do you like to watch?
What kind of movies? I like the Argentinian movies very much. I like adventure movies.
The war ones I don't like at all. I like a lot of the ones that have to do with travel.
The characters that are traveling around the world. Like that I can see some scenery. I like those movies a lot.
For me horror movies.
No horror movies.
Yes, and the comedies also, the funny ones. I like them a lot
Look at that.
The ones I like the least are the action ones, one gets too bored and watching unrealistic things and things like that. No I don't like them.
Yes, I only like adventure travel.  I like a lot.  Well, the Latin American ones, I like a bunch.
More than anything because I like to watch the problems and the
The Latin American ones
But there is more than anything for that.
None
Rent, when I rent something, there's something of traveling.
He Latin American ones from what country have you seen? Only the ones from Argentina or from another area?
I saw some Brazilians, I saw one Colombia that, now I don't remember the name.
Maria, full of grace.
That one I saw is good.
None
Look, did you like it?
I loved it.
Is it similar to reality?
A lot, yes, that's the reality
Yes?
It's just that girl, I mean that bitch, this young lady reflects poor people, they are the people from Colombia that live in poor areas
That have a very hard time to survive? The people from the streets
Yes.
That's it, like people from the streets.
Is it hard to live in Colombia? Is that how they showed the movie?
I am telling you it is not so
Sure, that's the kind
What they reflect there is a poor, lower class.
The lower class, the marginal
Exactly
None
But
I saw that one, and then I saw another, although I can't remember what it is called.
This model, what's her name?, she's colombian, right?, the movie we say
None
Do you know Diego Torres? There was another boy with him.
Angie Cepeda, right?
The one singing? Angie Cepeda, there he is. A film we watched with her.
Pantaleon and the
Pantaleon and don't know what. It was good. I enjoyed it.
I didn't watch it, but I watched the trailer on a Peruvian channel.
It is a good one. Pantaleon and I can't remember anything else. A very good story and I liked the film. They are the only two I have watched
Yes.

Oh really?
Yes, have you never seen it?
No, I'll take note right now. In the time of the butterflies.
From the butterflies, with Salma Hayek. It's a really great film. It talks about something that happened in the Dominican Republic.
None
A rebellion that happened there against the president and shows a lot of things.
In the time of butterflies. Well, I will rent it. Really good for the date. Aha, so good. And what's the temperature there now?
Right now they said that it was going to drop to forty nine, at night. More like at nine, it starts to drop to, they said, like fifty or forty nine.
None
It's not as cold as the north
Here it's been pretty good.
What temperature is it now?

Yes.
Watch TV and eat and watch the TV. You always put on some kilos here in winter, because there's nothing to do. It's not nice to go out, like
We don't go out any ore than necessary.

Yes. No, here it's nice too. It has its good parts and its nice parts.
Yes. Is it small or big, what's it like?
Philidelphia is huge, and what happens is, the climate is so terrible it becomes incrediably hot in the summertime. So hot that you can't go outside.
In the winter it has extreme termperatures, and during the winter there's a cold, with continuous below zero temperatures and it's not good at all.  The only good thing is that it has a beautiful spring.
And a pronounced autumn.  winter and summer are very pronounced and ugly.  Summer is terrible.
The summer here is terrible, you can't even manage, if you don't have air conditioning, a good equipment in your home

You're in for a bad time. It's very important to have good air conditioning

How nice. I like it a lot. I like to visit. I don't know if to live.
Suddenly visiting, is nice. One already.
What?
Like for a visit, one lives here because of necessity.
Sure, okay. yes, It's true.
That's today's topic is housing.
Yes. I honestly don't understand when they say that is a
None
What does it mean?
None
I also never understand when they talk to me. The truth is
Yes.
I don't know if you are aware.
Yes I'm a little bit aware of that but at the moment because I'm renting an apartment
Yes.
But all of a sudden one does have to think in that, instead of paying rent you will buy to get something for yourself. Because you will paying something that's yours.
Sure.
Yes.  But, let's say the finances becomes hard because when one rents an apartment you don't pay the water, and at least here you don't pay the heat
Yes
If I get a house I have to pay the water, the light, the heat. Absolutely everything.
Sure.
My insurance and all of it then.
Sure.
It would be for the best, but from whom do you rent from?
Would you live here? Are you going to stay to live here in the United States or is just for a short time?
I am staying
Sure, then you would have to see whatÂ´s the best for you.
Yes the possibility of looking and saying what are the benefits
Sure.
BECAUSE YOU SEE A LOT OF HOUSING OF DUPLEX FOR TWO FAMILIES
Yes, your family

Of course.
And the situation get complicated.
With so many Hollywood movies about neighbors, you donÂ´t feel like.
Yes, no, you donÂ´t know that
You get scared.
Then you donÂ´t think about buying there.
How?
Are you going to stay here for a while?
Of course I am renting a place. I have a three years contract. My idea is not to stay there.
None
What I am going to do.
Yes.
You want to stay here to live in any other place in the world
Yes.
Pay like you were renting.
You have something for your children.
Of course like a credit and paying a loan and all that stuff yes, it is okay because tomorrow you will have your own house.
Yes that is true.
And
Is it that girl's location?
The problem is that one has to be very sure of everything.
You can buy it and rent it and you rent something else with the same money.
Yes that's true. It seems the rents here are very expensive.
Yes, in Boston also. They are very expensive.
Yes?
I live in a good neighborhood in Boston in a two bedroom with a roommate and we pay one thousand five hundred and sixty.
None

Like this. Suddenly they exist one morning to have the, where I go and in my old age and his youth,
You have to get travel a lot to work.
Yes. No, we say that here there's a close part that's called New Jersey. It's pretty.
Yes.
Yes it's expensive where I looked.
Sure.
But I wanted something small.
Sure.
That it's safe and expensive
Right, that's in here. My sister lives in El Doral. That's thirty minutes from the beach
None
In a Miami neighborhood with a fountain and all that in a duplex home. It's really big with a yard
It must be expensive.
No, it is ninety thousand.
No, it's not expensive.
Right, it's much more accessible here. New York, Boston are the most expensive cities in the United States.
The most expensive ones
But the salaries are higher too.
Yeah a bit. Here it's not much, just the minimum wage. They raised it a little while ago. Eighty-five
Right, yeah.
Yes
And how long have you lived in the United States?
Five years.
None
I've been here for five years.

That's good, only one is missing.
Yes, Sometimes one needs it,
And your sister is thinking of staying to live, yes?
No, she doesn't know.
Neither? I'm still doubtful.
Yes, for the issue of raising the kids.
Yes
If I'm having new children, I don't know if I would like to raise them here
Well, I'm starting to raise this one here. Let's see how that ends
Sure, how old is he?
It's a 5 month old
None
It's a little baby
You can take care of him any time.
I'm working two days per week
Sure
To help with something because it does not survive with two days.  It runs out, it gets mad.
Sure
Problems when they run out, and then i was paying, because it would make me move, because i work in new jersey and i found a home in new jersey.
None
To be able to get away, with a babysitter and all that, it is so very complicated.
Yes, right?
Yes, because you don't know to whom you are leaving him?
That's complicated and daycare is really expensive
About $300 per week
Yes, with kids in Boston, it's $1500 per month.
None
Yes, it ls something like that. It's really expensive.
It's easier for me to find a house in New Jersey and live there.
Sure.
As if, yes but in reality all this is expensive
Sure. Yes, the truth is that it's very expensive and one sometimes thinks where do you live better if not in Colombia or in Argentina or here, right?
Here there are some guarantees that you don't have over there, not in Columbia.
Sure.
But everything is that one also has to look
Yes.
You have to think of him. That's why I'm looking at a small house, not a big house.
Sure.
Yes.
Yes, well. But something is something.
Yes because I have to think of leaving something to him.
Sure, one also thinks that
None
That leaving a property is something secure
At least one is not going to be thinking about where you will leave your stuff or from here to tomorrow one never knows.
Sure.
Yes, in reality I didn't understand what they said about the bubble.
Me neither no I tell you, what Spanish was that. To whom are they speaking to,
Bubble?
I don't understand, Mexican, to Puerto Rican, to whom?
The soap makes the bubble. Or one
Sure.
A car
We also use it for the same thing but sometimes we say you live in a bubble.
There isn't something very beautiful or special
You don't know any other thing but your world, your school, your country club
None
And your relatives, right?
None
That's living in a bubble to us.
For. Yes.
No? I didn't know this happened in my city. Do you live in a bubble?
None
No, we use it this way but I don't understand
I didn't understand either. If I return the call that is aboutthe bubble. They already didn't stay as such
Yes, I think that the topics are what to talk about, there's no need to talk the whole time
Yeah, because it's not.
Sometimes, so I start talking and I don't talk about it, right? Because the other day, I spoke to a girl that lives in Philadelphia, Argentinian incidentally
And she knows mutual  friends, and we stayed talking about that. And how we work in the same, so we didn't even remember what subject we had to talk about
You started talking, he's Spanish and keep talking on your own. But it's nice because I've met other people
Sure
Yes, different cultures
Yes
Yeah
Yeah, super interesting. It's fun to me, and, well you can also make a little money at the same time
None
None
Yeah, it was necessary
Of course, it always come in handy
No, even better
None
So, right?
Yes
And how long will you be in Miami?
I'm now here with my sister. I have a two year old nephew
So sweet
He's called Oliver, and now my sister is expecting her second child and that's where it gets complicated, so my mom is coming.
Next week and she'll stay here.
Hello. How is it going?
How is it going, this is Paula speaking? What?
None
How are you?
That is Manuel speaking. I am in Orlando, Florida. Where are you?
Boston.
In Boston, Massachusetts.
Massachusetts
I believe that
None
I believe that we've talked once.  Tell me your impressions on today's topic.
Yes, today's topic renter or buyer, and I think that if you have enough money it is much better to buy than rent.
Yes
It seems to me that too much money is wasted on renting. That's money you don't get back.
Correct.
It's more advantageous to buy, the thing
Yes.
No,
None
I don't know what,
Well, no, yes, yes, and finish. I'll be right there.
That's my opinion. If I could buy it, I don't know how long I will be staying here, I don't know if it will suit me.
What do I know? If I'm to stay here for a long time, sure, but I rather lease it
Sure.
And you,
I completely agree with you, the truth is that it'd be better to own one and see how can you do it, to capitalize something.
Housing costs in my area are unaffordable, which makes me sad
They are charging huge prices for the properties.
None
I lived in New York, as you said, those are big cities where housing is really expensive, so I was never able to
Yes
I thought that it'd be different here. I've been here for over a year and this is happening again.
Yes
It's a bubble, as they put it in the entrance, well
That's right.
I don't know when it's going to burst but for the moment, this bubble is growing everyday.
It's not okay to buy right now?
No.
None
Exactly, prices are so expensive, I don't think that the houses are valued that much.
Yes
Any day the bubble can burst and go down all the prices hit rock bottom and then look that the  one that bought so expensive all of a sudden will find himself with
With the fact that he's losing money
Yo lose money more than you renting
Renting hurts a lot every month
I don't know why
What can happen when the bubble busts but How do you do it to give a down payment now?
When you are going to buy a house and they tell you that the cheapest one, it's two hundred, two hundred fifty thousand dollars.
None
Then you need to have handy at least some twenty thousand dollars, thirty thousand.
Sure
You don't stay, because that's another thing, that finance you part of the initial payment or down payment but, you'll see later those mortgages because I know people with mortgages
Or amortizations of three thousand dollars people that are working, twenty four hours, practically to be able to pay that.
Sure.
People are not really enjoying it living in their basement and the house is rented to be able to pay it. Which doesn't make sense.
Sure
Because it's sacrificing yourself too much, the quality of life deteriorates a lot.
No. I had a roommate. She was the owner of the apartment. She was young and her parents helped her.
Yes
And she had a three bedroom apartment.
True.
So we rented two places, and she was in the third. And with my rent and that of the other girl, we payed the mortgage.
The advantage that she had, it's that alone.
Sure, you don't have
It's not idea, and there are more dramatic cases.  They're real because
So, stuck in. People who are there definitively
Sure.
Go crazy because they can't pay these high mortgages.
Yes
I have to comply with
Yes
Keep paying the lease and they we'll see
Sure and I don't have an option either so I don't worry too much. No, living in Boston is so expensive.
Yes
I have to live with a roommate.
Definitely, and the big cities, New York is the same, I also had a roommate, it was indispensable because,
Sure.
And well any small one-room apartment, something like that, one thousand dollars.  really expensive, really expensive, so
One bedroom can be two thousand dollars there.
Exactly. In these big cities it's very difficult. Now that I'm speculating a bit, if you had the option to buy, where here in the United States would you like to buy?
Here.
Let's have a fantasy.
None
There in Boston, or in another city.
Is Boston is too expensive?  With the same money I could buy something smaller
With the same money that I buy one bedroom here, in another place I have a five room house.
That is correct.
That is the doubt. But otherwise, I'm a biochemist and right now I am doing investigations in Kansas.
Really.
Then there are not many places where I can go to do biotechnology. Then it must be here or in California.
Of course.
And the question is that California is the same or even more expensive than here.
Yes
And I have not a car either, then I would have to buy a house in the outside of Boston,
In the,
And buy a car.
Yes in, those states is necessary. necessarily you must have a car.
Yes I would need it.
When you see it, you say something that is true Sometimes you cannot buy where you want but when things are easier.
Of course.
Yes, that's true. That would have to br there or in California. Something has to deal with today's topic is that the government does so little
To inform in a side to new buyers, at least the ones buying for the first time
Yes
I think the market is to open.
Yes, in the Massachusetts State, for example
And in the last, the
They help to buy, the ones that want to buy a house and they make less that $70000 a year
Yes, lets say that information flows and people lend a hand, because where I libe in Florida, it's
Yes
I don't have an idea, and I have even look on the internet and I can find the general things of the central government, but here exactly in Florida, I can't find anything
Yes
We are lacking some promulgation,  for first time buyers
They must install that, it does not appear, because it must be a help, at least in the first house you buy
Obviously, I totally agree with you, Manuel, you told me, not
Yes, Manuel
I agree. Are you Mexican, Manuel?
No, it is Columbian
Colombian, well, I don't know how Colombia is, but in Argentina, the apartments in dollars, they are expensive, the same or less than here
Well, yes, in Colombia there was a real state boom and well, it ended in a recession
Sure
It can never compare with the prices here.
None
Never, because
Buying an apartment there would be difficult right now. At least, there are no credits there, here at least you get thirty year mortgages
I don't know your intentions, but if you're going to stay here for a long time
It is like somehow the dream of owning your house is reachable. I think that would be almost impossible in Buenos Aires
This is another consideration, because we, almost all of us have one foot here and the other in our origin countries
Yes
Sometimes you think in the two places, buying there and buying here, to come and go
That would be ideal
Many people make it, actually
I see
Many people do that.  They invest there.  I wish I could, I would like it
Yes
Eventually buying in
Yes
In any of the southern states, that are warmer, because I ran away from New York because of the weather.
Oh, wait a minute Manuel, hold on a second
Yes
Excuse me.
Yes
The food's ready
That
Yes, Well
No,
How long have you been doing this Manuel, the phone calls?
Almost a month, I have done fifteen calls
Oh, that's a lot, I am doing only one a week
Yes, I have had some luck, because sometimes they call you just four minutes before six, and they leave you there on the phone, and wait, we'll get you a 
None
To a partner I forget to dial back and I stay without calling
Today I dial again and I get lucky and get in touch with someone immediately
At first i called until seven, but since i only have my cellphone and it eats a lot of minutes, it ends up being fifteen.
Right
And at least I don't see it as a vacation. For me is the beach and
I'm like at fifteen
Did you know that if you do five different phones, they
James, New York.
Hello. Marcela, from North Carolina
Marcela And you?
Yes.
Marcela likes it, but Paty doesn't. Do you like it more than the other?
There are a few
Really?
Yes, there are a few.
In what part of North Carolina?
I'm in Fayetteville.
It must be over there because I was there and I was in a few towns there. I hardly saw any Hispanics.
None
Yes. There are many more Hispanics now. How long ago was it that you visited, that you were here?
Last year.
None
Yes.
Well, yes, because comparing it to New York, because you said you were in New York
Yes. I'm in New York.
Well, compared to New York, yes.  No, there's hardly any Latins but when we got here in eighty seven, there was no one.  You could speak in Spanish and the only ones that understood you were the soldiers that had gone to Panama.
But not now, there are some.
I'm from Panama.
Ah, look at that.
Look, what a small world, right?
Yes.
Do you own or rent?
No we own. This
Sure, from eighty seven. I imagine.
Yes, we never thought that we would be able to own a place because we came here to Los Angeles and we are both artists.
Even though now he's not in the army any more.
None
Despite our belief that we couldn't afford a house, we purchased our rental after the owner put it on the market
For sale.
What would be need to buy the house? And we started to look into it and it ended up that we could buy the house, so we bought it.
Really? How nice, thank God.
Yes. But now it's almost there in this bubble that they're talking about
None
Here in North Carolina yes and no, it hasn't finished yet, but many people have moved here.
None
This, many people from the north, especially who are coming to North Carolina.
None
It's sad because it was all green and now, we have each time less green
None
Because, they build and build and they don't stop
Wow
Yes
I don't have the experience of construction because
It's different to be in a place to replace something
Yes
Are they building that new project?
Yes
But the bubble, I don't see it clearly.
People is exited, because there is many immigration
Property values increase in some places.  It goes up and up.  It's a bubble at any moment.
Puff, the bubble blows and then the prices go down. And then people lose money. Let's say you bought a house in Northern California, near San Francisco...
Three million dollars.
Yes
And once the bubble blows, that hose that you bought at three million dollars, maybe, if you are lucky, you can sell it for a million
None
Do you understand?
The interest you paid for the house.
The places become popular and the prices go up, they go up because the people, they don't care, the issue is to live there, then the people pay whatever
And that creates artificial values that sooner or later
Here
Everything goes down, everything normalizes.
Yes, here in New York you are not going to have that kind of problem, because it always increases though there's no, the time I've been here I haven't experienced any type of bubble.
You understand?
Yes, Always everything goes up, except after nine eleven that the properties went down a little.
Here it went down always. (?)
Yes. I know we are
And right now must be more expensive than ever
We would love to live in New York, but
Yes.
How do we live? What do we do? You understand? Is very hard
I see how you started North Caroline yes is to New York.
My husband works in one emergency
None
Maybe he, could do some sort of transfer, right? I don't know
Yes
He would have to find a job there
None
The cost of living is so expensive here.
Yes,  when was the last time you were over here?
The last time I was there was two thousand.
None
Two thousand and three. Because our older son graduated from Tisch, the one in NYU, the Art School
Right
That was the last time
None
We went there twice a year, more or less, the three years he was in college, because he finished it quickly.
My Art School, right? House of artists then
Any veterinarian, dentist, profession that could help us a little
If you wanted or need the family then, you still have time.
I don't think so.
It's not hard to convince a boy of what you want.
He's a dancer, and he dances with a company called Pilobolus. It's started that famous art, modern dance
Right, here in New York
The company is in Connecticut, but they dance for up to six weeks each summer in New York in the Joyce theater.
Right
Joyce Theater earns well and travels all around the world.
Right
It was really well, and the oldest is twenty-three years old and the youngest is seventeen years old, and he is a guitarist
He plays classic and jazz, it's what he loves.
Yes, exactly.
He is going to college
At least you are not worried.  They already built their life and now you are resting in North Carolina, even if there is not much to do there
Yes, that's the only thing I would like. Being in New York and going to the theater, I'm an actor and I produce, I work here but
None
It's far, far from everything
And you see, because you have a house there
Yes, and we can't complain, but it's boring sometimes.
I lived To much and well
None
Yes, to see
Yes. Where do you work?
I'm
Hello?
I had some accounts there in cloth
None
I stayed a day next to them and then I stayed other day to return quiet
So, you entered and then left
Then
Hello? What?
No.
Are you talking to me on a cellular?
Yes.
Yes, because every now and then, I lose you
Yes, is a cellular I'm talking from.
Yes.
Although I'm not home that's what happens. You were talking to me and so
Every now and then, I lose you.
ARE YOU TALKING FROM A CELLULAR?
No, I'm talking on my house phone.
Is it necessary that you have your house? It feels like realizing
Yes, the truth.
None
Yes, if something happens, we have something.
Yes, and then one feels better, for example there's already
A place
Not just the fact that I imagine that the difference between renting, to being an owner is really, is big.
And yes because the only thing is when you rent and something breaks, you can call someone and they fix it.
Yes
In exchange, as an owner if something breaks, you have to fix it or you have to pay
You have to exactly.
And you fix it, so there you start
Yes, but since you have insurance this is your
None
It's not, the day when you want to really go to New York, you're going to sell this, and take the money and bring it there and buy a little apartment or a house.
Yes. I will buy a place.
You don't have to study, yes, a place exactly,
A place, because there things are worth a lot of money, I can't imagine myself
Yes, every now and then there's a good opportunity.
This is true
Yes. For example, I had the opportunity to get an apartment and it's now worth three times what I payed for it
You were really lucky. Fantastic.
Yes, this was only in two years.
What a short time.
Yes, the person, in a year and something, it went up twice, and now it's three times more expensive.
None
He bubble didn't break. That I don't think, because here the value never goes down.
Yes. It only goes up.
Here things have always been raising, I have never seen them going down
Where in New York do you live in?
I am where Manhattan ends
Oh, yes
But the district is named
None
And it's an area populated by Jews, and is quiet and clean
Properties rise
The people who used to live there, were older people, they wanted closed apartments.
None
And I got to know it, and they told me, well we want this much but if you pat that much it's yours
Because they have a house and had no need for an apartment
It had to be
But the feeling of owning is different.
You were lucky
Owning and renting, you understand?
Yes
None
When you rent, you are always at the expense of what the owner may want.  If tomorrow he decides he wants the apartment, that's it.
Yes, right
At most they give you three months to move, you have to go.
None
Hello?
Hello?
Is this Jorge? Who am I talking to?
My name is Blanca, I'm from Phoenix Arizona.
How are you? Happy holidays
The same for you
None
The weather is great.
Very good, I was born in Argentina
None
Your accent sounds like you're from Colombia. Am i right?
Yes, I'm from Colombia
What part of Colombia?
None
Yes, I know that place, It is Medellin they play more tango than Argentina.yes, I know that place, It is Medellin they play more tango than Argentina.
Argentina, OK?
Medellin is beautifu/.
Okay, Gardel died there.
I was there a few years ago.
Yes, Garden died there right?
Yes. It's a really beautiful city.
None
The topic of today is housing. They want us to talk about housing. And I've never been to Phoenix, Arizona.
No.
No.  I've almost been to a place nearby to visit, that's called Scottsdale.
Scottsdale, it's a city close to here.
But after I couldn't go. How far is it from Scottsdale to Phoenix, if you
Maybe a half hour.
That's it?
It's right here, next to the city
Close.
Next to Phoenix
They say that Scottsdale is really pretty
Yes.
Is it expensive to rent in Phoenix, Arizona?
Okay. A year ago I came here to move to this state. I lived in Boston, Massachusetts.
Today in the east, on the east coast.
I moved and everything is so expensive, that we decided to move this year.
Look at that.
A house that a year ago was worth one hundred thousand dollars is not worth two hundred and fifty thousand.
One hundred thousand dollars more.
You and your family are trying to
Yes, we bought.
Or are you trying to buy?
We already bought, already bought but Look, there's a huge difference between the states here, right?
It's incredible.
Because we had a house in Boston that what's worth five hundred sixty thousand dollars.
Do you have?
We sold it for that amount
That's good, very good
No, but is they are houses, they are old houses, old houses from many years ago and houses that have not been fixed
Housing over there is very expensive. Houses here, even though they are expensive, have a greater acquisition.
More easy. The acquiring power here for the families to buy a house is bigger. There are more possibilities in this state, at least,
That is in Massachusetts.
Sure, but then you bought a house for approximately one hundred forty thousand, you said.
No. We looked into it and it would costs us one hundred forty six thousand a year ago. In August it was a year. And we came here in May
And it already cost two hundred twenty three thousand dollars.
Two hundred what?
Two hundred twenty three thousand.
From May to August.
From August to May
Oh, I see.
Then
And they bought it?
Yes.  Do we keep paying the rent to another one?
It has no sense.
No, it has no sense.
But they kept their profit good
And, what I pay to someone else I can pay it better for me
Exactly
My rent, my own convenience
When you can do something like that, it is really nice. In Phoenix, how much can the rent be?
In a really safe zone in Phoenix, Arizona, like an apartment, one bedroom
800 to 600 pesos, but it depends on the place
Depends, okay, exactly
Now, I'm renting at this moment because I will get my house in May.
None
My house is not even built.
Oh, your house is on construction
None
Is it under construction now or are they going to build it?
No, they are already building it.
How nice, but you are moving into your own house in a couple of months.
At this moment, I pay for a house.  It's a new house in a very good area that has three bedrooms and a living room.
Dining room, its kitchen and a little yard and a double garage. I pay two hundred dollars for the house.
That's very good if you go rent
None
That here in Los Angeles mother, please
Yes.
It would cost four times more in Los Angeles.
None
California is very expensive.
California is like Massachusetts. My cousin lives in California. She bought an apartment, or a townhouse, with two small rooms for three hundred and twenty thousand dollars.
In what area of California?
Already used. She lives in Arcadia.
Yes, i spent the weekend and the night of the twenty fourth with friends, family from Ecuador in Arcadia
Very big apparently, but the area I was in is very beautiful. Very pretty. Have you ever been in Arcadia, Blanca? Arcadia is pretty, is a residential area.
It's very peaceful, but California is very expensive.
I'm mistaken, is the climate perhaps, is one of those things. Eh, I don't know if that has anything to do with it but the
You would have to see the climate in California to decide whether you would like it or not.
You know that we have a very beautiful climate here in California ?
None
The climate are not extremes like you know in Massachusetts
How I know it here in Phoenix.
I could be mistaken.
No, because Florida is very humid, the climate there is very unpleasant. But the houses there are better, the cost is also cheaper.
You can find a good apartment with a pool that's six hundred dollars.  In some nice places
Sure.
So sometimes I don't understand.
I also don't understand too well. What makes me think is the climate here, the closeness to the ocean we don't have those extremes in climate as big as you guys have in Arizona,
California has a beautiful climate all year compared to other states, which makes me think.
True.
There's a taste for everybody, you know?
This type of climate. There are people that like the four seasons, isn't it true? There are people that like the cold, like we say
In Arizona the four seasons exist more than in California.
Yes.
For example you in Massachusetts the four season exist right?
Yes
They are very differentiated ?
None
But in Arizona the seasons of the year aren't very different?
None
Isn't it true?
Yes, this is true.
In Arizona you have a lot of heat and a lot of cold?
No, no,now it's never cold
When is the hottest part of the year in Phoenix?
July, August, September.
From July, until when is the hot period, good
September.
Three months basically
Basically.
It's really hard in Arizona.
Really hard. It's only three months.
It's basically hot, and it's dry heat?
It's dry. Yes, there's no humidity.
Dry, there's no humidity.
At all.
It's a heat that, well, at least it's dry.
Yes.
And you go, inside your house, start the Conditioned Air, you can live with that, right?. Is not that heat that
Moist that makes you cold in Arizona, right?
None
Hi, this is Leo
Hello, my name is Blance, where are you from?
I'm from Washington, DC, how are you?
Nice, I'm in Arizona, in Phoenix.
Phoenix, Arizona, that's nice.
Oh, yes
How is the real estate market in Phoenix?
It's better than those northern places.
There is a pretty big well, they called a bubble in English,
Yes
We bought this house that my wife and I live in.
Yes
We bought it two years ago on December 28th, 2003 and we bought it in
Yes
$130000
Sure
And we just refinance it, in this May and the price is $260000, figure that out
Here it is similar.  I will tell you my story.
I lived in Massachusetts
Really?
Here, houses are in the skies
Sure, and well, I was working in Massachusetts for a long time.
We had a house and it was valued at $560000
Figure that out
And we moved here because it was cheaper to buy a state, right
Sure
Last year we came in August and checked some houses that seemed pretty.  They were going to be finished in time, the new year, and the beginning of this year we moved there and went to check the houses.
From $146000 they were now $223000
Figure that out
None
None
Yes
Wow
I think that real state is fine
Boom of the bubble
Exactly, the bubble is like a cycle, it happens some other time in this country.
Yes
In the 90s the house prices were low, but they are now climbing, I think that in some years it would drop again, it's like a cycle
None
Yes
Yes, Listen Blanca and where are you from originally? You sound like from Colombia. From, Colombia, yes I knew.
I'm from Colombia.
From from what part? from Bogota?
I'm from Colombia, Medellin.
MedellÃ­n that's good
Where are you from?
I'm originally from Venezuela.
Are you from Venezuela?
Yes, from Caracas.
None
Yes
IT SEEMS TO ME, ANYWAY, HERE WITIN THE MEASNS OF POSSIBLILITIES AND ACCORDING TO THE CAPACITY OF EACH ONE I
I think that it's preferable to buy your house, even if it's an apartment.
Listen of course, yes. Better than renting, you mean. Sure, because imagine, you renting is throwing the money in the trash.
Look, for example, at what has happened to us.  If we were the ones that rented, we wouldn't have gotten any sort of gain from the property.
But since we've thought of buying property and we have the capacity, at least the capacity of indebtedness, even though sometimes you don't have it but you get into debt
Sure.
Buy your house and you have one way or another a gain.
Sure, a very good investment.
None
Yes, this is a wonder. When we bought this house, we bought it without a deposit, without putting down a deposit. We didn't put absolutely anything
Zero down payment
Zero, zero deposit. What saved us is that my wife and I have this very good credit
Yes
We got a mortgage to a reasonable rate. It wasn't the best one, but it was much better than many other mortgages.
Thatâ€™s another story.
Yes
Sometimes, sometimes banks do abuse
Sure
According to the status of the person, his capacity of indebtedness and all that stuff, I've had to do it. As a matter of fact I am working right now
None
In a mortgage company. I am a loan officer
Yes, figure
So I, I know that sometimes banks do abuse. Sometimes they abuse on the conditions and requirements. And when people can't fulfill all the requirements they still get the cerdit, but the rate is so high
Sure, very expensive. It's ridiculous
That's why there is so much crisis here now, in Arizona there are many people buying houses, but there are also many people in
There are many houses in forceclosure. People are in debt up to their necks.
Because they can't pay, right?
Because they can'y pay, because the rate is so high, because they can't fulfill some requirements due to their legal status.
Enormous rates
Imagine all that.
There are many things.
We bought this house that we have right now in a foreclosure. The lady that lived here was already very old. She and her husband moved here.
Yes.
I tell you, he built it in the year forty six. he built it himself.
Oh, my God.
Yes, then, well, he built it, they lived here, here they raised their kids and they all, moved. The man died many years ago, like ten years ago
And the lady was already like eighty years old, imagine, she couldn't maintain the house anymore, and then
Yes.
Unfortunately, the bank took it from her. What I don't understand is
None
Why was she still paying that house. If, if her own husband built it in the year forty, imagine.
So long ago, how strange
The house would be completely paid off don't you think?
Yes, thirty years. In the seven- from the forty to the seventy it should've been paid off.
Suppose that they refinanced it and suppose that the house had been completely paid off. Can you imagine that it still wasn't paid off?  I think they cheated her.
What a shame.
We never got to meet the lady. But that was the story the bank told us.
None
Yes, We bought the house
Yes.
Even if we fixed it, I wouldn't have this kitchen cabinet at all.
Yes
We had to install the appliance by ourselves.
None
Yes
We had to organize it.  It's better to have your money invested in something.
We also had a lot of credit card debt
Yes.
All the debt was totally eliminated. And not only this, the student loan debts as well.
Yes.
This debt.
Yeah.
Was also eliminated
We did this with my husband. he, paid off his house completely, the one in Boston.
None
He totally paid it off and eliminated all the debt. Here we are, buying another and moving ahead. No?
You have them in investments.
None
That's great
As an investment this is our first home. We sold the one in Boston and we are buying another here.
Now I understand, that's fine.
Yes
We have a two bedroom house and an attic.
Yes
It doesn't have basement, that's the only thing. It's a house without a basement but it has a good acre of terrain
Yes
How much does a house like that cost there, in that area of Phoenix?
How much?, a house of two bedrooms and an acre, maybe about a hundred and eighty, two thousand pesos
Yes, it will always be a little cheaper there than here in this area
We bought our home with three bedrooms, it's two floors. it's three bedrooms, two living rooms, a kitchen
An additional dining room and a yard. The house is almost an acre, it's not much, it's not a full acre
None
It costed us two hundred and forty six thousand dollars, and they still haven't finished building it for us
Can you imagine a new home?
Yes.
Compared to the prices over here, that's not so bad
Compared with the prices of Massachusetts, a rent for a home I'm living on right now,not so bad.
It costs two thousand five hundred and i pay eight hundred for a new three bedroom house
With a yard, a living room, dining room, kitchen, all new
Those eight hundred pesos you're telling me about is that for tent or mortgage?
It's just that I'm renting at this moment
Oh, because you're renting, because you're still in.
That they haven't give me my house yet
Hey eight hundred dollars
They're building it for me
Eight hundred dollars
Without power, without water, it would be around one thousand and two hundred
Sure, all expenses you have to do
Yes.
Well look at that. We lived in little apartment that was horrifying because it was a little apartment. The living-room and the dining room together, a little kitchen there
Four by five meters for example, a really small thing
I know the houses of
Right
Of the part
Do you know how much we payed for that apartment?
None
Six hundred dollars for a month of rent, can you imagine, while we are paying one thousand and two hundred dollars a month for mortgage out here.
But you're in a comfortable part
Yes of course> I mean there's no comparison between
None
Between being in a rented house or being in a
Lurdes from New York
Miriam again,
Miriam how are you
Fine and you?
Fine  thank God, the weather has warmed up a little, so everybody is very happy.
I think you passed the cold on to us then.
Really? I'm sorry.
Yes, everything is cool.
Well Miriam, tell me. What do you think, about that of breaking up with your partner
I think it depends on how long you've been with that person,
None
And, how much you love him. Because I recently have, I have a boyfriend, that we had been together years
How many?
Three.
Three
Three years. And some three months ago, I told him, that no, no, we didn't go out anymore, I already felt I tell him, I already feel old, I tell him, we have no kids, you don't take me out,
I never see you. You come home from work too later and I was getting angry with the relationship. Yes, I told him that I wanted to break up, and
And we left, because we lived together. So then I left to my parent's house.
None
Later  he started calling me. The truth is I missed him
None
Like the ex- but I tried to bear it.
None
And yes, it was pretty difficult, I don't think that I could do it again without being one hundred percent sure that
Sure
I didn't want to be with him but now I' sorry. I think now that I should have had more patience with him.
None
To give him an opportunity to take me out a bit more, and to be a bit more
To get to fall in love with you again, no.
Yes, and he works in construction, so
Yes
It is difficult for him to come every day to work
Sure
I tried to understand it, but a moment came when he came back at nine, ten at night, and I'm really tired, there's something to eat, and
We already had a routine
Really routine, yes, yes, yes
He's giving a little bit on his part and the same for me
None
It depends.
I will tell you that for me breaking up with a partner was always difficult
None
I think that when you are young, I mean you are in high-school or
You prefer freedom to the compromise of a couple.
Specially if you have been living with that person, the compromise, the responsibilities
Somehow it becomes more difficult.  Everything in the house reminds you of that person: the daily routine
Yes
If you used to spend time with them, then the one will remind you of the other.
Very much, yes, and restaurants specially
So, sure, you can't go anywhere without having a thought for that person, with you all the time, right? And then, while anniversaries keep passing, the first year
Yes
Everything, every anniversary, every little thing reminds you of that person, the anniversary of whatever, when we nought a
Every little thing reminds you of that person, right?
Yes
I think the break up is much more difficult the more history you share with someone, right?
Of my own experience I can tell you that, that when I broke off with my husband, on my first marriage
It was very difficult
None
We kept to working together So i could not avoid seeing him
That is true
None
Yes, that's even harder.
Sure
Because you have to keep seeing that person.
One tries to be cordial. Not that you understand me.
What is happening to you with work, because then that's also unprofessional. It my case it was that I imagined because everyone around me
Everyone knew it was happening because in some places it was true. So everyone paid attention to see how they act.
When they are together, one is near the other. Right, because then we were kind of a well-know couple at work.
The whole break up was more or more like public
None
The fact that there were third parties paying attention that were part of the problem that made it so
The break up was a little more uncomfortable because it wasn't what happened to one or the other, but also
How the people around one interacted.
Yes, yes yes I understand. Yes I can imagine that it must be very hard.
Those things happen sometimes. I think that the most important thing is to see those
Those moments as an opportunity to grow as a person right is easier said than done
Yes; but no.  For example, my dad.
None
With my first boyfriend, he was, very jealous. And, with the second this guy, he had really won him over. He loved him.
Really?
Then when I broke up with him, I was going to leave to the university and we were going to be in different states, we were not going to be able to see each other.
None
I told him, that it was better that
None
That we should break up. He took it, he didn't want it but he respected the decision, he understood that it wasn't going to work.
Sure
These long distance relationships.
Sure
This summer was pretty uncomfortable.
None
What do I know? Sure, he invited him, until I had to say, Dad, this is pretty uncomfortable for me.
Sure
I am trying to foget him.  I love him, but it wasn't going to work.
Sure
One of the two would finally say, you know what, I want to be with you, or I don't want to be with you, or could be tempted by another person
Sure
You know when you're at the university, or surrounded by people your age, you are always meeting different people
Sure
At the age of eighteen you don't want anything more with your first boyfriend,
Exactly.
You want to know what's out there
Sure, life is like a buffet, if you fill your plate in the first
None
The first thing they teach you. Other things come later.
No, not what there's more of.
Exactly.
Yes, everything is good with my boyfriend right now.  He's already talking of marriage.
Wow
But I'm a little scared.
Well
No, I wouldn't want to right now
You have to talk about what it is you expect from him and what it is he expects from you.
One gets divorced and one gets married with the idea that your getting married for the rest of your life.
Of what?
None
When we get married,things will be different.
None
Things are the same
His parents already want a grandchild.
Really?
Yes
What he doesn't have any grandchildren?
They have enough grandchildren, but there is no grandson that carries the family name
None
His parents came, they came to visit from New York
None
They are here in Florida
The weather and all
None
Then, he tells me to let him know when we are going to get married so he can start saving. But I tell him we are fine like this. We go out whenever we want.
The ring and signing a paper is not going to change anything, how we are right now.
None
He says no, i already want a grandchild
None
He tells me since his brother didn't point well with the
That what he has are girls.
My boyfriend's brother
None
Just had his first child.
None
And they didn't want to know, what it was going to be, so then they made it a surprise and at the end it came out a girl.
A girl.
It is just them who can carry the name.
Sure.
They are not going to have any more kids for a while.
Sure
I tell my boyfriend to not even think about it.  I don't want any kids.  I ask, what do you want to do now? Do you want to go to this disco or the other one?
Sure
You don't have to think who's going to take care of the kid.  We ran out of milk, we have to go buy diapers. I tell him all this.
That sound like the conversation that my huaband and I have because we have an eight month old baby
None
Sine the baby was born, we have gone out alone I think that we've gone out three times.
The movies, or to eat, and we ran home because the only thing we could think about was the kid.
I tell him I have the patience but in reality I have don't have any.
None
None
With what you have to do, you will have a frustration, and and you will always have the desire and you will always blame the kid.
That look, because of you I wasn't able to these things I dreamed of doing. Or travel, or whatever it was, or study, I mean
Hi
Happy holidays, and good evening!
Same to you
Yes, thank you
To whom am I speaking?
My name is Marco, I'm in Philadelphia, and you?
I'm Maria Ines.  I'm in Philadelphia
None
What's up? Where are you from?
Everything is well. Excuse me?
Where are you from?
I grew up in Paraguay
Paraguay. We're neighbors, I'm from Argentina.
None
Couples breaking up, we got an ugly subject
Yes. Out of all the options. I have to say I only have one experience of
Yes, and what was it like?
A little classic story, my first girlfriend and I, were stupid and we just did it
I imagine some couples have it easier breaking up than others. I'm in a relationship now
It would be, we live together. She has a son who's five now. But we are together since he was 1 year old
None
None
None
None
None
None
None
None
None

None
None
None
None
None
None
None
None
None
I think that it happens to everybody
None
He figures out how she should be, and then tries to accommodate the person who is his partner to that image, and nobody is
It seems that when a person shows  a personal feature,  it is not something unique of that person, but something that
I like her, I love her very much, but I don't know, I can't think of a little stupid thing that the person thinks she has to bear.
Yes, she cut her nails in the movies.
Happy faces, in the movie, they kiss and the end, after that comes the part
People don't cut their nails. They don't cut their hair.
Right?
How you call it? Ah, they never put on, of course.
No way
That would mean they are not the size sixty ? sixty right. That's it
Ninety, sixty, ninety
I knew many people
Yes
I had lot of boy and girlfriends
Yes
Who had a partner?
None
After some time they break off
Yes.
And the big drama is, I knew it in some cases, the friend first, the other friend, when they started going out
Yes.
Or vice versa. Knowing the friend, and after, you're friends with both.
Sure.
They then break up.
None
If I knew him first, he had a girlfriend and they break up.
Yes.
I have the moral obligation to hate her and only talk to him. not like this. I keep talking to her,
Well ok
As much as I talk to him, but I don't tell him that I talk to her.
Because it's complicated. I know cases that aren't like this.
And, I think, yes this is true, there are cases that aren't quite like this,
What's complicated is to take, I don't know, your birthday, you have a party, which of the two do you invite?
For example
There it's complicated
The worst is that now he has another girlfriend
None
This yea, and now I invite the other.  But, it's really, really
How do you come alone?
Yes, exactly, exactly. Is,
It's true, that's happened to me.  But I invite everybody and tell them who's going to go.  Then they can come or not.  I try to do that. Because, if not
Very complicated.
Yes, it can become
One day we'll go have some coffee
In that case, a typical male
Yes.
He likes to look for the best looking woman to take to the party with him.
With talking of how happy you are and of the
And perhaps you just met her two days ago.
Yes, they meet like that, in so much time.
The Paraguayans seem similar to the Argentinians in that sense
Yes, yes no, yes no, it's worse.
Look.
None
Very sexist.
On thing I know, they are very,very sexist in Paraguay
Look.
The woman, in addition to what I had said, has to clean, cook, and raise the kids.
None
Beside that, yes, she speaks and has ideas also. That is very,
Those conflict.
That is in Paraguay, yes.
No.  In Argentina, we are a little bit more moderate.
The worst, I can imagine that
Thereâ€™s a hint of sexism.
In Paraguay, for example, my parents, both, are Paraguayans, they are doctors.
Yes.
Specialized here in the United Stated,
Yes.
The President of the Paraguayan Association of Urology and the President of the Paraguayan Association of Doctors are home.
Is she a doctor, too?
She's a doctor also. Dad has to cars, a truck and others. Mom only has the minibus and he doesn't lend her the car.
And it never occurred to her to buy a car?
No, because she didn't have.
She doesn't work.
No. She didn't have the private practice or anything like that. Then, she just stayed with that
None
I came to the United States to study,
Yes.
As a doctor representing Paraguay inthe United Nations, She would come to New Yourk every year and one year, she came to visit me.
Yes.
And the night before I was going to take her to the airport to go back to Paraguay, she tells me I THINK I'm going to stay
None
The day before the flight.
And she stayed?
And she stayed
She just stayed?
She returned to practice in Philadelphia
Look.
She was working for the Association of Puerto Ricans for a while. Now, she is working in another hospital. She's returned to working here and she also goes over there.
They as a couple, did they separate?
They separated, but dad didn't find out until much later. I don't even remember well if they notified him that she wasn't going to be in the airport.
The situation that your mom had faced because of the issue of sexism?
Yes, mom was in the health ministry.
Yes.
That was her in the Ministry for Women
None
One of the things I remembers, she did a lot of work with the international organizations of development.
Yes.
Machismo is perpetuated by women
That can be true.
For example, the mother is the one that educates the children and the way that she behaves with their father or the father with her,
Children take notice.
Yes.
Women decide  if we want to avoid machismo.
Yes, it's so hard. But that's true.
But it is hard.
I don't know if it's genetic or not but they play with dolls.
None
And boys play with little cars,  I don't know if it is that way because we are conditioning them to play that way
Yes, that's genetic. For example, I'm in computer science.
Yes.
Computers, computers, and this and that, I remember that we had a lot of articles talking about the lack of women in that field.
The computing areas.
Yes.
I think basically the percentage of women working in the computer area is really low.
I see.
I've also heard of people complaining that the games are for boys, that there are no toys for girls
Looking it in other way?
Hello, Jorge, from New York
Hi, Jorge. This is Nicky
Hi, Nicky, How are you doing?
Hi, what do you think about the question?
It's a hot topic you could say, right?
Yes
I think that definitively it's something really common this time.
Yes
What do you think about it?
T's really hard to brake, I don't know, I think that depends on the person
You see your couple, I think that it's an investment in time.
Someone, and I always see the positive. I think that person is good, and I want to be his friend, and always a common topic
Many men don't wan to be just friends
Sure
For me, it has been long, and sometimes, breaking up. I do it. And there is always a time where you don't communicate, but
I always communicate as a friend.  I think that I invested time and I know his family well and I love that family.
In my case, it has been a long time ago since my last brake up; I practically don't know what it means to break up.
Yes
15 years with my wife, right?
Wow, that's nice
Yes. So,  we've been here for fifteen years, between us, we've broken up, we've gotten back together, we've had fights, we've made up the next day. But,
Yes.
This type of break up like in fact one mentioned in the question, right? As you just said there are many people out there  definitely in that sense, I mean why can't they find their real match
Why aren't they ready? I don't know.
Yes.
They don't feel the need
Yes, yes, I believe so. There's always people, men and women, that don't want to have a long relationship. But, this changes with age, I believe, and, by person.
More than by the age, by the person, I believe  what happens here is that there are so many different types of persons, cultures, different
People from different countries
Yes.
In that sense they have traditions that influences them to the person that you feel is right for you
Yes.
Your traditions, what do I know? your religion or stuff
YES
So, you end up being too different. Where are you from?
I'm Dominican, and you?
From Ecuador.
You know what? I realize, with this research, that they are bringing people together, they are linking people from South America or the ones from the Caribbean. I've never spoken with someone from the Caribbean.
I guess that people from South America haven't gotten a chance to speak to someone from South America.  I don't know.
Well, no, and, I've spoken with someone from Argentina.
Yes?
The other time, I don't remember, but I think it was someone from Peru, that I talked with
None
It all depends, but in that sense, for example in this subject, I agree more with getting paired up with a woman, definitively. Because it's more
Yes
It's easier talking about that, but there was one that
Yes, that's true. I also think that it depends on the culture, it depends on, on how you were raised up.
My parents raised me in the Dominican and 19th century's style
I see.
I mean, they told me, never, I mean never, let me go out to meet, to find love, let's say, when I was a young girl. They told me, no, you get married first, and then you
Fall in love.
And do you agree with that?
No, but I have brothers that, yes, got married and then knew knew each other. That's why I was so
But are they still married, have they had a long marriage?
Yes, I have a sister who's been married for 25 years, and a brother, 30 years already, and both, it was their first experience with love. They were very young, they had like 19 years
Wow
And, just like that, they later got to know their husband or wife, and they're still together. I think that's fine. But I didn't
Didn't understand that tradition. That's why it varies, no? At the same time, it's difficult. I think people
Sure
Every adult has had relationships where they think the relationship lasted too long.
And because they don't want to hurt such person. They have hopes from that person like me. Let's see.
No, I don't believe that too much.
Really?
I think that you have to break the myth.  Before getting married or living with someone, you can't be with your partner
Have any sort of relation. I think the important thing is you experiment all that before getting married.
Yes.
Because from the first day of being married, you realize a lot of things that your ignored.
Yes.
I don't know, how your partner sleeps, how he wakes up.
Yes
Sure, how she cooks, what havigs she has, if she's neat, if she's disorganized.
Yes, yes
There are so many things. All of a sudden, you saw that person so pretty when you went out as boyfriend and girlfriend. When you would go to the movies holding hands.
Yes.
And when you get married, the next day you see a woman without any makeup, that you get scared.
None
Or, in the same way, the wife. Right? she sees, the man, fixed up, all nice, but who knows, maybe, the guy is used to taking a bath every three, four days right? Is like that.
Many stop taking care of themselves
Sure. But for years before, as a young guy it was
Breaking up isn't simple because you get used to having a relationship.
Yes.
One person at a time.
Yes
It's hard to break up with someone just like that? I see people who break up with you, go to the next person the next day, then break up with that one
Yes
And the next day, the next guy on the list, no?
Yes, that surprised me in this country. When I was in college, I saw people who broke up and were still friends.
None
I am normal like for think that me
It depends, but for me, for Dominicans, and for other Hispanic people and culture. when you're with someone, you know her little by little..
Sure
Seeing the whole family makes the difference,but that I see as investing time
Sure
It is also key, in getting to know your girlfriend or boyfriend, so that person will get along with your family
Well, he's a boyfriend, believe it or not.  Despite what many people say and I agree with that
I'm married to my wife, not the family.  The family has a huge influence.
Yes
What do I know? If you don't get along with your wife's family, she's going to feel bad. Or if she doesn't get along with her husband's family, he'll feel bad because they can't go to visit.
Yes
If you take your partner, not the burden of his or her family, but the responsibility, of keeping the party in peace?
When I was in love, I always noticed the way my boyfriend treated his mother or sister.
I have friends who say the same thing
Study how your girlfriends treat their sisters and their dads, because that was our first experience.  Our mentors are men or women.
Of course.
Of that, it changes. A trick for me, I am married, and my husband and me, we always say that we are in love. No, we donÂ´t say we are married, and so, still we are not going to , I donÂ´t know, to think
No, we are not going to neglect too much, lets go to the cinema or a date,
None
And so.
That is good, however, sometimes you are not careful about it?
Yes.
So, it becomes a routine, you are neglected, but, yes it is good. In that sense, to go out of monotony.
Yes.
Maybe, you are fine, and continue fine, how was the topic, breaks. Right? Definitively.
Yes.
It is so simple to do easy things and then all goes well.
Yes it's true, but I know it is different with each couple. Because life goes on right?, and if they have children, it is more difficult to do it
Because life gets more complex, more busy.  It is more difficult.  Yes, like if you were only boyfriends.
Yes, I know. I think when you have children, the situation is more complicated. But at the same time, it is
Besides being more complicated, it is more responsibility, right? And suddenly you are more tied to that person, right?
Yes.
In my case we have a girl and we will have a baby the first week of January.
That's nice. Congratulations.
It is like the illusion that we will have another child at home.
That attaches me and my wife, correct?
Of course.
I definitely get more attach, right?
That is great.
Many friends believe they have found the ideal partner, but they haven't.
Yes.
How are you?
Hello! Yes, this is Jorge. I am talking from Los Angeles, California
Hi, how are you?, Jorge my name is Adrian and I live in Toronto, Ontario, Canada
Adrian, what does Spanish represent in your life?
Background
Your background, your origin, I didn't want to use English
I was born in Buenos
Oh my goodness
That's why I have the 'porteÃ±o' accent
What district in Buenos Aires?
I was born in Villa de Boto.
I am very good, I am from Buenos Aires as well
From what part?
I am from Buenos Aires.  I was born and raised in La Nuz west, in a city called Valentina Alcina.
Have you heard that?
Yes
See, what a coincidence, I don't usually talk to people from Argentina, you are like the third one, anyway, how is it in Ontario?
Cold yes
What is the temperature there?  Very cold, right?
No, today it was about two Celsius, positive, so
My God
It was hot. It should be cold but the snow is melting. It rained today, the whole day, so there's still a bit of snow. I'm looking over there.
It's amazing. You've been in Canada for four years?
I've came here four years ago.
Very good, I've been in the United States for eighteen years. Today's subject is why do people
I don't know whom to break up with.
They want us to be philosophers
I don't know who is conjugating the verbs, but this people is breaking
No, you're wrong. Yes, that's what happens.
Get a dictionary
Why do couples break up?  I donâ€™t know.
I believe that all breakups are
Break ups
Or, yes, break ups are wrong because they are never good and easy, otherwise people wouldn't break up, right
Exactly
If everything was going well, they wouldn't break up
Exactly. What happens is that there are lots of reasons why a person...you know.
Decides to break up with someone, the only thing that I can say is that those types of relationships are quite hard
Did you leave Argentina five years ago?
Yes
The social situation in Argentina has changed a lot, when you left it, it has change a lot
When, I left Argentina, in march of 1986, we didn't even had a divorce law
Divorce didn't existed and I think it started just like 14, 15 years ago, more or less
I think that was for
Yes
I think that was for the time of Alfonsino
When you left, people were divorcing a lot
Something like that, because people got married in Paraguay and there was a parallel system, further than the formal, right?
Really Argentinian, a parallel system, there was a song that way: let's get marry in Mexico or Paraguay.
Yes, I know about that, but
It was the tradition, in those times, before the existence of divorce
Yes, but there are people that
They got married in Paraguay, Uruguay, or Mexico
Yes, do you remember that, Am I right about I'm saying?
Yes, but I think that there also was
For Argentinian laws, that marriage didn't exist.
That's not my area
Not my field
No
Yes, but do you understand me?, I mean, many people was interested in getting married that way, but for many other people, they weren't interested in that.
They were married, but for the law, they were concubines.  Do you understand what I'm saying?
None
Apparently the laws of divorce, they were approved in Argentina and people is much more free now, to to get a divorce
I have one cousin who came to visit from Buenos Aires and you must've seen it, it hasn't been long since you arrived in Canada, but they say that the situation in
The economic situation in Argentina is so hard that people don't even get married now.  Do you understand what I'm saying?
They have a partner and so on.  They have a certain percentage of people marrying, but it's not a
Because of the money
Of what that costs, no? it's too expensive to get married so people, they just decide and I'm telling you
I might be a dreamer but I'm a bit liberal. I will never get married in a civil registry. To me, that doesn't mean anything. Do you understand what I'm saying?
Sure, it's not a guarantee, right?
It's not a guarantee, do you understand? To me, going to the civil registry or marrying in a church, is not a guarantee, there's no guarantee, it's not a guarantee to
No, that doesn't mean anything. The important thing is that the couple has respect for each other, right? If the couple get along
The respect, no? If there's respect, that's everything,a signed paper is not going to guarantee or change anything, that's what I think, no?
It's different for some women. It makes them feel
Safer,
Safer, isn't it? I don't know, I don't think that way. Do you think?
If he has lots of symbolism its more about tradition and its natural social issues.
Exactly
What do I know?
Yes, that's it, basically, it's a tradition.
Yes, it was the one that you wouldn't between the cassette inserted in the head of an Argentinian.
The average Argentinian wants to get married, the church and the wedding party, and has all that stuff in her head, and the Canadian one is somehow more concerned on the engagement ring
And the size of the stone, oh yes.
The Canadian?
They, they pay more attention on that, no, no, seriously let me say
That is not true, because it's the same in the United States.
But the cultural difference is big, they do care more about that than the party, the event itself
It is lighter because it's something quick
Yes
And they marry at noon, have lunch at four o'clock and at eight o'clock everybody goes home and that's it.
Right
But the stone, since she will wear it all her life, on the finger.
That is what you have observed in the Canadian society,
It is similar to what happens here, in the United states
No, not long ago I talked to an Argentinian friend of mine here and he said, Thanks god! We didn't born here and had to marry in this country.
We saved a lot in the ring
What did your friend say?
My friend said god we didn't marru in this country, we saved a lot in diamonds
In Canada, yes, you know everything is relative, isn't it? it depends on the person, Argentinians do care about that as well, don't they?
The right, not so much.
Yes but no, there isn't a tradition of it, the size of the rock and
The rock.
A few months ago, a Canadian boy works here with me got married and every time I had the chance I asked him
About the rock and its size
None
Using the subject in my favor, look, it's just that I'm here and I'm a new-comer.
Exactly
And, explain to me about the rock and the number
Hello?
Hello?
Hello.
How are you?
I'm Alicia
Alicia.
Yes.
Hello, where are you?
None
Oh well, I'm in New York.
New York. How nice. How did the strike go?
Sorry?
How was the  transportation strike?
Yes, last week was a little bit difficult.
I imagine.
But I didn't have that many problems because, I don't work very far from where I live, and my friend took me in her
None
Car to work.
That's good.
Once I walked to Manhattan.
None
From the place I work in Manhattan,  it was about a forty five minute walk.
Wow, of course.
Not miles and miles
Yes.
BUT YES. WE ARE HAPPY. I THANK THAT WE ARE, WE ARE ALL HAPPY THAT THE STRIKE ENDED.
That is logical.
Where are you from?
I am from Chile.
From Chile. What part of Chile are you from?
I lived in Santiago, Concepcion and in a town called Los Andes.
Look, I lived in Chile for two years.
Right?
Yes: in Chile, in Santiago. I
Wow. Of course.
I was living in NuÃ±oa and after that in Providencia.
None
I was teaching English there.
I know that place. I have relatives in Providencia. Where are you fun?
I was born here in New York.  My family is from Cuba.
Cuba.
My Dad's Cuban.
None
Well, my Spanish is the Cuban kind
Sure.
Studying Spanish here and being in Chile and all that.
Sure, from all around.
I'm a mix.
But a New Yorker in the end.
Yes, I am.
I lived in Chile until I was eleven years old. I came back during high school.
I returned two years back. I was in Chile the whole year, so that's
And do you have family there?
I try to go and come back. My father is over there, my mother's here.
Yes.
It's today's theme.
No. I don't understand the theme. Yes, it is difficult to break up with your partner. Dumb question?
Is it going to be easy, yes, yes
It's just a a stupid question.  I believe that it's hard to end a relationship.
Sure.
Even if the relation doesn't go too well, it is difficult anyway
And it's true, as a matter of fact I
Unless, unless you really don't care. I mean, if you are with the other just due to boredom, then it may not be so difficult
I was talking to a friend of mine and she had a boyfriend
The had been together for four years, and they lived together. It was the kind of relation that you knew that. I only knew from it last yet.
None
And I could feel, on both of them, that it looked bad, yes, you could feel some
None
It was obvious, let's say, they were somehow different. He was kind of immature.
None
And she, you could notice a strange attitude. They broke off last December, one month ago. And she is suffering, it is incredible because
She recognizes that he was not meant for her and doesn't know how they lasted so long, but she is still upset by the split.
Yes, I think that sometimes difficult relations are more difficult to finish because ther are many. In easy relation.
Yes?
Things are not going on fine and when you finish you don't feel so bad because the feeling was not so big. I was once with someone
And we did get along but there was not much passion and when we broke off it was not so hard
Yes, that's true
It's hard after all, it was also difficult afterwards
Sure
You missed him, but it was not that much suffering like other times
None
I do believe that was the reason why we had such a good relationship but it was never so
Passionate.
But I do believe that sometimes, that type of relationship is hard, when you are always talking about those things, it's hard to end it because you
Its the same feeling.  You get addicted to the emotion.
You are too involved with that feelings.
That's right. It's true, it's like they say, that love and hate are two sides of the same coin, yes.
Yes. I believe, that when one
It was too emotional.
When you are in love, it's like, you don't care, you can be so mad, you can get so mad with the person you love, even more than with any other person.
It's hard to break up with someone, or if they break up with you. I've been through that twice.
In a way, I'd rather let them break up with me because it was a bit longer than a two year relationship.
None
But in the sixth month, I was tired of him but he would act like no, I love you, I adore you.  That's why.
I felt it became a pain in the ass.
None
Pity, me
None
I felt sorry for him.
Yes.
I went on with the guy for another year and a half
Yes
I felt sorry after that
Sure
I saw him once a week because I was going to college full-time and working part-time
None
I was still busy. So I kind didn't pay much attention to him, but the last six months I was like.
I want to get rid of this person, but it was so terrible, because he kind of
Sure
Every time he had the feeling I was going away, he sort of felt despaired. So it was very stressful to me to know that I could cause such pain to someone else.
None
I told myself, it's better to get kicked myself than the other
That's hard, it also happened to me once
Yes
When I was very young, I was fourteen when we started and fiften when we broke up
Yeah
He was too close to me, always with me
Sure
I mean a boy
Sure
And I wasn't too interested in him but
Yes.
I had never had a boyfriend nor anything and I felt
Sure, the opportunity, let's say.
I felt like guilty, like leaving him and breaking his heart like I was
Yes
Guilty. I knew after a month of being together.
What have I gotten myself into?
I realized you have to end things.
Yes.
Soon because I stayed with him like a year.
Sure, from pure pity
At that age a year is like too much time.
Yes, it is true.
I think both ways are hard.
But I
That they leave you, one feels so bad, I mean one is like And I have friends, I have a friend that she just recently ended with a.
With a boyfriend that they had already been together years and years. And he left her and she had no idea no idea, she didn't know.
She didn't know.
I mean no
What happens, did he stopped loving her, let's say?
He started to think things for the future, and decided that even if he really loved her, for the
None
It wasn't going to work
As a couple
They had been together a few years and he felt that he didn't want to spend his future with her and decided to end it.
None
He didn't want to marry her, I mean.
Sure, after four years you start to think, where is this relationship going? I mean
Sure, and I think that that as, and he also was really worried, I mean, sometimes.
And
That happens more to guys that to women, that
None
And things start getting more serious, and
Sure
People gets nerveous
Sure, it's hard, and that book that was presented a few time ago. He is no that into you, I was checking, and one of the things this book says, what this book does is like
He is not that into you was really popular in a season, last year, I think
I don't know it.
No, It's a book that a man wrote because women are always complaining about how bad her boyfriend is.
That the boyfriend, the other but in reality, according to him, the boyfriend is bad and this and the other because he simply.
He's not that into you, I mean, he's not in love with you. Because probably this guy, if it's that he, if a crazy is really in love with a woman is
None
None
He gives you flowers, tells you he wants to marry you, he calls you on the phone every day blah blah blah, because that's how men are when they are really in love like that
SURE. WELL, I THINK THAT MEN AND WOMEN LIKE WHEN THEY REALLY ARE
Then
They behave like they are in love. Many times one person in the relationship is like that and the other is a little more distant.
Yes,
Is like hard that both people are so romantic
Sure.
Either the man or the woman
Yes.
That is so.
One hundred percent.
Sure and the other is like more distant. Maybe interested just the same but a little more like
None
It's hard to share intensity between two people.
Yes, I've heard of that.  It' true that when people are together for so long there are changes.  For a year
He is more than her and the next year she is more than him
Sure
It's a little dance that exisat
I think that there is some kind of imbalance. There has to be a little difference because there are many people.
You have to be hunting a little
Married
I am like for hunter
The prey let's say.
Like some kind of game.  It's not on purpose
Hello!
Hello!
Yes, my name is George. I am from New York. Who am I speaking with?
Hello, I'm Alfredo from New York
HOW ARE YOU?
Pardon, I didn't understand your name what's your name?
George.
George
George
Very good
Yes, how is it going?
You live in Manhattan?
Yes, of course
Okay
In Handen yes, Where do you live?
Yes
Good
Let's go to the
What do you think of today's topic?
I've seen better topics. I've seen better topics but
On the topic
Do you have a partner?
I've had three casual partners.
Yes
I've had quite a bit of experience on the topic
Yes.
Yes
And how long were you with her?
I spent eleven years with my third partner.
Quite a bit, yes, I think that as time passes, the longer the relationship the higher is the level, I say
I say,No?
More than
Or do you think it's the same? Do you think that a relationship that lasts many years
Yes
Lasts more. When did it end?
None
You see that it's proportional to the length of the relationship or No?
For the length of the relationship.
Yes
Well
None
I think that any relationship, whenever it ends
I think that it's always the same.  Isn't it?  What I think is that the routine is really rough, a lot of times you don't
You sacrifice yourself for your kids and there are some relationships that are really tormented, no?
YES, SURE, DO YOU HAVE KIDS?
So yes, I have kids. I had kids in all three relationships and well, really well, I never stopped to look at, at how good
Yes, there can be confrontations. I'm also a son of separated parents, no.
None
My parent's separation never really affected me.
Yeah
My kids don't suffer much but i prefer they don't come out affected.
Yeah
I see many couples, I see that years and years and they're, a torment
It's a situation for the kids.  A couple that doesn't love each other, a couple that can't live together and put up with each other, no? No more than
Yes, that is what they've shown.
None
This is, they've proved that it's more damaging.
I think it's more damaging, sometimes separation is better.
It's more
This is my case and my philosephy
Yeah
At least
You have three relationships. Yes, eleven and this and, how long did the other two last?
I think it was last about six years, I don't give it any more.
Yeah yeah
Yes after six years,
Yeah
There's no flavor in it
What other things did they ask us? Another question was if with age, one changes.
The pain, what do you think?
I think that it's not so much age, but suddenly the stability--suddenly the economic situation and the human situation. Right?
Yes,
Because for example many couples who have never separated and last twenty years and in many cases, and where the woman has never worked
This is a traumatic situation.
Sure
Yes, a person who's never left the house who's always been submitted, let's say to the labors of the house
Sure it is.
It's
Invested everything in being house mothers. like
In relationships, I've always permitted them to have their jobs.
Always. Yes, that they have their independence, that they depend absolutely on themselves.
Yes
That is my criterion, because I think, I am not good for having a woman in the house
Yes
That's it, You get home, just figure, you get home tired of working and so, the woman all day long doing so, busy and suddenly she wants
She wants you to attend right?
None
I heard someone call a radio station the other day to apologize to her wife.
She had gone mad, because he had arrived tired and she wanted to go out
That's not, repeat that
So of course what?
I didn't understand that last part
Well, someone who called to apologize to his wife because the day before he had arrived late from work, he had arrived tired, the women don't work
The woman had asked him to go out, and he told her: No I'm very tired, I can't, I don't want to go out I'm very tired
It's a difficult situation, right? It's two completely different situations right?
Yes, of course
One gets home ready to rest while the other stays home and is bored.
Wants to go out and do something, of course.
So I prefer the partner to work, she has to be occupied with something.
Have your partners been American?
Never
Yeah, yeah
I think he will have an American partner.
None
Your experience or point of view.
My point of view is that I think that it makes a difference I think I could be wrong but I think that with time relationships become cemented.
A year long relationship is like falling one meter.
Yes
A TEN YEAR RELATIONSHIPS IS A MUCH STRONGER FALL.
None
I think that with time, being in love the difficult thing is this part
Yes
I think that if you get a pet, I don't know if you've had pets that dies, but
None
You live with a dog ten years
None
It goes, like this I'm making like a, it's not like when a person dies but, love dies, and this is like a, a loss.
No, I understand, always
I find that the more you get used to someone, the stronger it is.
I think that a moment comes one of the two gets to this point
None
Suddenly that one, when things are coming. Suddenly people have to prepare, and it's because of lack of preparation from the people right?
But yes, obviously
That's a good point
Obviously, with age, the habits, there are many things, it's obviously not easy
There are many factors that we agree
What
Yes
Sometimes, I fint it true
Yes
That it's so sudden and
Yes,
It's the same in death, when
Death
It dies, when it was already know that it was cancer and it was known that
Exactly, I was expecting that
That was suffering, sure. It's very different to a son dying in an accident.
Yeah, exactly, or like a pet, right?, or the worst cases that
Yes
There are people that get affected enormouslybecause they love them so much, right? Yeah, i don't know, i think that
I don't know, really.
You say things are bad when they end.
Yes, I think that many things that when they don't work anymore. You should not stand that. It's like there is not
There is not anything.
I think they might be.
There is not
That they agree, because I know there are times they both realize is not working
None
But I think that there are also cases where someone really stays
Yes
More affected that the other one
Yes, I think that most of the time right? It's really weird to coincide both of them.
Yes
I think that almost every time one of them is more affected than the other one
I think that might be a huge factor, right?
Yes
It must be really easy to be on the side that it's rejecting,
It's not easy
Loneliness, and finding a moment because it didn't had friends, all because it was completely dedicated to the relationship, right?
None
As they say: to start over again, it's not easy. It's really not
Yes, and in the holiday season, that must have been a little
No
Hard? No? Why?
Yes
Because
You have
I donâ€™t know how old the kids are
The
How do you do the things you do when Santa Clause has those kind of problems?  I don't know
Yes, that's hard running from one place to another
Yes, that excuse is good
He disagrees with it
Yes
I know, I always, I feel that, someone feels offended, or someone is going to be angry always, to tell the truth
You can't be in three places at the same time
Yes, that's true
You don't distribute it, you divide it. But, the thing with your family, let's say current
Yes
What they are, I also meant. They are splitting up, right?
None
How do they treat  an issue like Christmas? Like, do the kids realize that this is happening?
Are they hiding it. Did they tell them. How are they dealing with this?
I'm really in this trance where, that I still don't
Yeah
No, there's a very big difference
Yes
It's talked about
Yeah
Yes, but it's very difficult.
This is the difficult part,
But, it's really difficult. It happened to me many years ago between the first and the second relationship. It was really difficult
Yes
It was really difficult, above all, there are different attitudes of the people. No? Involved in this issue.
Yes
Yes , it's not easy but I think that, in truth, like I say, I say, I told her.
Hello
James, New York
My name is john
Miriam from Toronto, how are you?
Fine. And what's your name?
I'm James from New York.
Hi James. How are you?
Fine
The break up of couples.  What is your experience when breaking up with a person.  Do you feel very bad?
How did it happen?
Well, thank God that I got a woman today. Because the topic with a man it's more, I wanted
Well, I would've like to have gotten a woman to see this from a woman's point of view exactly what it is.
She has in her mind what she really thinks.
Tell me.
For me, I find it easy to break up with a person, as long as I've been with her a short time, and, I see that the relationship is not going to get anywhere, instead of
Prolonging it,I like to evaluate it,here, we are not going to ge anywhere
Let's keep a friendship better
That, could be a reason, or could be a motive to prolong the relationship a little bit more. I think that if
At first, you see the person you realize you want, and you realize what really
Expect from her, the other doesn't have it, you don't find it in that person Or the same chemistry with that person well, I think that you realize that
You can decide if it drags on the matter.
None
I think we will be better as friends
Okay
You must respect yourself and decide which person you should be the one for you.
You know there is always an explanation about things
In your experience have you had many broke ups and you evaluate people?
I like to evaluate the person because they can always be different.
Okay
Often they broke up with me, some other times I broke up the relationship
Okay
Sometimes you break uo with the person but
You better not be together when it does not matter.
You usually always and up missing the person.
Is it always?
We always miss the person.
Whenever the person is miss, you get together with someone, then there are memories, moments together, and stuff.
You provided that the person is not always there when you really miss him/her.ThatÂ´s when you realize what you want in your life.
My last relationship
Was a little long with a girl.
None
The problem with this girl is that she was too, flirtatious.
None
And  the problem also that yes flirtatious. So she was always flirting with all the guys. And she was also very pretty.
None
We always had a lot And she always would go out by here by there, And, she was very dishonest.
Did you notice that before getting into the relationship?
Not before getting into it. During the relationship I realized it, I broke it off,
None
I broke it off for missing her.  She called me and tells me, No I'm not going to change.  You know that I don't...
She changed for a moment, then back to the same. Would she ever change? I always gave her an opportunity to
Yes, the flirtatious person, doesn't mean that they cheat on you, but that they are like that, they have a happy nature. Or is
No
Apart from being a flirt, she was cheating on you
No. A flirt, yes. She went out with guys and would tell me no.
Oh well, that's already wrong.
SHE WOULD TELL ME THAT NO, THAT IT WASN'T LIKE THAT, AND THEN I WOULD REALIZE IT BECAUSE I WOULD SEE HERE, I WOULD SEE HER I FOUND HERE SEVERAL TIMES.
No, that's wrong.
She would still tell me it's a lie, that we only went to the movies
No
After I found out that if they really had left for a few days, they had
Thinking love, then
It's a shame there are women like that
No, i like the way that is, because she was going to take my daughter away and
Dishonest
Love like those, so
Yeah
Broke up with her, that's why I told you, I told to myself, she said no, I will change again and I said, no
It's a vicious circle
None
You will never change.
Yes
You will never change and it's not good for me, so I closed the door. I missed this place, certainly, the
I missed her voice. But you realized, it's not for what you want for your life.
You have to look at who a woman calls, who she does not call, who is or is not by the house. That is not for me.
That's really sad, you have to feel safe with your couple
Yes, then you close the door you realize that you can miss her
None
Bur missing and being in love with that person does not meean, that you had evaluated inside you what was what you really expected from a couple relation, of a relationship
Rom a marriage, what is you want to have in your life
None
You don't want to go after a man that's unfaithful to you or that looks for relationships in other places.
He is always available, teaching the other girls.
Right, right.
You know
Yeah
And that's what she told, that she was available
Oh, that's a shame, and you got involved emotionally. You didn't like her because of her looks, but you got emotionally involved. You took her
To have a very special love and
Yes, but you
Right
First of all, you can't love a person without loving yourself. If your relationship is destroying you
None
None
None
You have to step aside from it.  Because, you have to call love to be able to love
It's OK.
To love yourself to be able to love
It's ok, you're strong, because there's people that fall into a circle that they can't get out of
None
Like you say, if they don't love themselves, if they don't have respect, self esteem, and
Yeah
Tthey let themselves be manipulated in this way. They let themselves be emotionally exploited. Yeah, and it's really sad. But now nice, how nice that you
Yes
Know what you want and and for you, therefore, it's not hard to decide if someone
You respect yourself and you say look this is good for me
None
We'll suppose that I'm a woman. And suddenly I find myself with a man that no man wants possession of me, and wants to have
To control my time, to know who calls me, of my privacy, and I have this emotional abuse, who abuses me emotionally,
You have to respect yourself, and say, oh this isn't good for me
NONE
You know, I'm going to get away from this relationship. Even though this person gives you some physical benefit, emotional, financially, you know, you have to respect yourself, and I don't need this,
Let me get out of this relationship.
Wow, well I'm happy, you're great, yeah.
And so
Great.
I think that we've dri-, gone off topic a bit,
The question is, is it easy to break up, and does age influence or not.
Related to the age, I'm thirty  and yesterday I turned thirthy eight.
Happy birthday.
Thank you
We'll get the little hump down the next day.
Yeah
Oh, how cool.
Yeah, but I don't feel like an old man and I don't feel younger now
You're still young, son
None
Yes, you told me you've had many relationships.
I don't know, look. I'm 40 years old, and in my whole life I've had four relationships. But I've never broken up with anyone. They've broken up with me. Because I get like very
Yes
I get very attached to the person
Where are you from?
Sometimes, I'm from Peru
Yes?
And then, sometimes I tell myself, it's not good for me, I don't like him, but
Where did you say you lived?
Toronto
Toronto, Canada
None
Then you
That's why I tell you, I don't know, but yes, when there's a break up is very sad, even though the relationship wasn't working, I stay sad.
Are
For years.
Are you with someone now?
Yes, the father of my kids.
Yes, it's going.
I tell you it's just been recently we've reconciled, after being separated two years
Is it going well with him now?
More or less, but there's nothing perfect I say also there's no perfection, you have to put up with the person, don't you think, but we ourselves are not perfect.
Depends. Were you married to him?
No, I've never been married to him.
Okay
But I always wait for many years
Waited to see how it worked out?
Yes, since my son is five and six years ago, I have never been with anybody, only with him, but is seems he has had
None
I don't break up with the person, the people break up with me.  I've very cowardly to break up a relationship.  I'm glad that you have that
Matter of self respect and loving yourself, like that well, I love myself
Sure, sure.
And I think that to be crying, or sad, or thinking, I had better
I don't know, perhaps for the man is easier to find someone. Because I've been alone understand. The relationship that I have with my kids' dad is more apart, than together.
And I've been able to find another person
I hear you
Well
Hello
Yes
Silvia here, how are you?
Very good.
How nice.  What a crazy topic, right?  I already imagine that the couples
Yes, true
They are, it doesn't matter how old they are to you, it has by experience the same as mine well, hard to break up but I say for other couples it would be easy
Depending of the circumstances right?
Yes, for some people is definitely easier, for others more difficult.
I'm talking about couples who have been together for a long time and have never gotten married.
Some have been married for fifty years and separate after such a long time, and I don't understand why they continue to be friends,
Then they keep on seeing the kids and they keep on seeing each other. The only thing that happens is that
Yes, daily
They don't live in the same house right but, they still see each other daily
Yes,
Yes
It's a topic that I don't know much about because my marriage failed after twenty years, but I got married too young.
Eighteen years ago
None
After twenty years my eyes opened up a little, i didn't know anything
Right
I didn't, i didn't know a, i didn't, everything was secret at home, what was important to know wasn't known, i mean, that
Right
There was people that drank, there were alcoholics, there were drugs and i didn't know any of that, and when it came out with, my husband had all of that
None
AND IT WAS GOING TO CHANGE HIM AND MY FAMILY DIDN'T WANT TO, AND THAT ARGUMENT WAS, I GOT MAD ANS SAID, I WILL STAY THERE TO PROVE THAT YES, THIS MAN CAN CHANGE
He was going to change, correct?
Right, and he never changed
No,  i realized that much later, but more than anything i wanted to protect the kids,  i had two girls and i said no
I will protect my family against this
Right
So that no other man will bother me and no other man will come to take my children because i have heard that a lot
In my parent's conversations, the children were abused one way or the other
I mean the reason
I said, i won't stay like this, so since then i haven't had any partner, I'm alone, just me, my girls grew up a lot, they're twenty six, twenty five years old
Hello now i do want to search for a partner, right? at least,  do some of the things that you do when you're old
Take vacations, go out for dinner and to, leave that subject of the children, but it's hard to find someone that have children that aren't
Adult or that aren't problematic?
Yes,some of them are Emilio's
I'm forty four years old and i'm not worried
But married again, i can't imagine
Yes
When you're getting old, you have your ways. You can't change your habits and if they don't fit.
None
But, mom and dad were married until my father died and it was fifty one years so, and I think they were very happy, I saw them very happy, but
According to mom, she didnâ€™t know him.
Yeah, they spent a while, fifty years
Yeah, and where are you from? No, it's that
I'm well. I'm Mexican
Me too
Yeah, you don't sound like a Mexican.  You sound more like, I don't know
Yes, I hear a lot of Columbian and Puerto Rican people live here in Chicago, Indiana.
Right
A lot of HIspanic people from all kinds of places come here.  When I talk to them, I get their
You get their tone
All of accent everything right
Here
None
I mean, i live in Texas, well, i think most of them are
A Mexican of course
They're mexican, yes, so
I was raised in Laredo, Texas, until I was seventeen years old
In Laredo
Our granny, forced us to learn the language, but she was tough, my god, i was very little, my granny made an effort for us to watch it daily so we would
Learn
Right
To be able to read, write and speak it perfectly according to her. It was going to do a of good for us. It turns out I get 25 dollars more in my job.
Per hour, because I speak the language.
Because you're bilingual, yes?
Yes
What's up, it helps a lot with my oldest kids. My littler girl is six years old
None
She doesn't want to speak spanish.
Yes
It's very hard
I'M TRYING RIGHT NOW.
Its hard.
The same things happens with my grand children, they don't think it's important so they don't want to. I did the same though when I was little.
It was a, bother because, who was I going to talk to? Aside from my grandmother, because my mom talked with us in English and my friends also
But she, thank God that she forced us
Yes, it's what happens. Here, it's more that I force my daughter to
None
She doesn't want to, but one time when she went to visit her grandparents over in Mexico
None
She was skating
None
They didn't understand her and I told here there grandparents don't speak Spanish and I said they don't speak English.
None
You have to speak
Unfortunately, with this topic about the couples, I don't know anything.
Well
No
I know very little of, I also have been married, like for ten years almost
Yes, you have to know something, no?
And this  is how it all goes
None
Anyway, for what I've seen, like, yes there are good things and bad things
None
For some people it is very easy.
None
Once you break up with the first, the second, the third, the fourth already is
Is much more easy
None
It's already like changing shoes
That's true
Practically
That I agree with,because of many friends that I have seen them keep on after, they already have the experience of leaving their
See a criteria they want and when that criteria is not satisfied, whatever it was, out, they  say
They can't anymore.
Yes and I think that once they realize that the person it's independent
None
It is made easier when
That's true, because
None
I've seen my friends that suffer, with the same and, since I didn't let go of my husband for nothing, and every time that he would tell me
Let's try again, and I never said no
None
It was always yes but, I think it has to do a lot with religion, because if one is devoted and since God always teaches that one should
SPECIALLY IT YOU'RE CATHOLIC, ANY RELIGION SAYS YOU MUST DO AN EFFORT, WELL, SO THE FAMILY THAT DOES AN EFFORT SHOULD STAY TOGETHER, BUT
It can also harm the kids because now they want to name the disease kids have
They want to call it a deseased, that they are children from a divorced family
Right
On the screen, the TV
Yeah
I only saw pieces. There was a lady saying that she was affected pretty badly, because every time she thinks about marrying she can't
She can't do it, because she has
That's true
She's very afraid that the same will happen to her, and she wants to have children but doesn't want to have them outside the marriage.
She has done a number of problems herself, but she has suffered because her dad left her mom twice.
In very bad shape financially
Yes
She wanted to hear her dad communicate to her, but that
Well, if the person is strong, she can overcome it, and maybe with help from a psychiatrist or maybe a group or, maybe the very person itself can do
AND OVERCOME THAT PROBLEM, RIGHT?, BEACUSE, INCEDENTALLY, A LOT FO THINGS HAPPEN TO A LOT FO CHILDREN AND THEY CAN
Yes
Move on.
Yes, many times they blame
The parents.  Yes.
To the parents, yes, I mean
ALL THE PARENTS, ARE TO BLAME FOR EVERYTHING
I mean be it good
None
That's what always happens, they blame the parents and since the parents got divorces
That's true.
Is that's why is that you already
A crutch
That's why we are
None
How we are, because the parents have divorced
It's true, a lot of combinations for having tend years. I stayed married twenty years. We were not together, it was a constant separation because
I couldn't put up with it I would say look, if you are going to drink here leave already
None
If you are going to take, like that, of friends
None
If your going to behave like that, leave already.
Yes
Then, he was out of the marriage more than what he was in.
More than
I'm only married on paper
None
And, well
No well, at least I, I that's why I've always said I mean, no
None
When I got married he was what, twenty seven years old? So I said
None
I already knew I'd done all that I wanted
More.
I'd already seen and done a lot
Yea
Before it went bad.
My ex-husband always deals with me, he always says he wants to be friends, he always wants to get along well with me and says you're the only family I have.
But I don't understand anything about being friends, no, but if he wants us to be able to talk in a civil way, well I can understand that
None
When he needs help I'm the one he asks, and I told him, and the friends you've had all your life? Where are they?
Friends in good times
No, it doesn't stop but that's how life turns out, so
Yea
You learn but I wouldn't recommend to anyone that they get married young because you're still getting to know yourself and you realize
Hello?
Hello?
Who's speaking?
How are you? My name is Adrian.
How are you? My name is Mara Ines.  I'm in Philadelphia.
In Toronto, Canada. What part of Buenos Aires?
From Mar del Plata
Almost
You from the city of Buenos Aires, no? yes?
Yes.
Do we talk about today's topic? The boyfriends and girlfriends. The courtships
I don't know. I'm a little off the market
Yes
Is that
Except for the memories, I can't give an opinion of how it is nowadays. Tell me about Canada. How is it?
In reality, it is too hot. It must be zero Celsius at this moment and all the snow we had melted.
None
The little snow there was and, and for this time, in Toronto is like I don't know, but five or six degrees above normal.
Look.
It should be colder than
Also here last year at this time the weather was getting very cold as as in Canada.
The cold is tremendous
Yes the cold is tremendous about seven degrees Celsius below zero
Still not cold, it is fine.
It's cold, snow ice.
Ten degrees is too cold
It was too cold.
Yes. The nose.
It was too cold
For four years, this will be my fifth winter
Compared to Buenos Aires you better prepared me for the cold.
Yes there is no point of comparison
At least we have wind, when I came here I wanted to kill myself it was so cold.
I had to buy new clothes
The street suerter of John B
Neither of the knit caps worked. It was so cold.
Is there a street called Juan B. Justo in Mar de Plata?
Juan B. Justo
Where are the factories of sweaters?
It is not good because they are terrible and ugly.
But.
It's like a tradition for tourists to go there.
My grandfather actually lived many years in silver sea.( Mar de plata)
Look.
No, the image of my old woman and my other grandmother taking me
Good price
Put me on the street
It was better 10 years ago, before everything was made in china.
Here are some who do not.  There are some that are very good, but not many.  They are also in the center, no need for Juan B.  Where are you?
Yes, is it work?
Why? I wanted to leave Buenos Aires. I wanted to go to Australia
None
Living a sort of holiday visiting friends here in Toronto
Look
Everything went bad
I would never come back. Did you stay?
No, I did not stay but the trip was take a desition
OK
To stay or not to stay.
Yes.
Not bad in Buenos Aires.
Buenos Aires
The first two years in Buenos Aires were better
Of course, yes, I have several acquaintances in Canada I do not even remember the cities, My brother is an engineer agronomist.
Some of my classmates went to Canada
In Montreal, where else are there many Argentines.
I think it's Montreal.
In Montreal
One of my friends married a girl from there and took her to Argentina.
They could not stand the cold.
In Montreal is much colder than here.
Okay
There are places much worse.
I almost go to Ottawa in a moment.
Ottawa is a very beautiful city.
Yes
Yes, there are many cities like that in Canada.
Yes i can see it for ottawa
Okay
Te pictures of the city were very beautiful.
Ottawa is a small town with about 300,000 people.
Oh, look that
Even if it is the capital
Weird, right?, in Canada
From Canada, but the way the government works here is very different from the Argentinian Government, with Independence of the regions, it's big
None
And ottawa is half in ontarioo which is the state where toronto is half in montreal which is the region where quebec is
None
Which is half way both cities
On purpose, maybe.
It is not a casualty, it's a city where I worked sometimes. It's a rural city.
None
I would be like Mar del Plata must be bigger than Ottawa.
Yes, it has 600000 people
That's why, I said
Sure
The concept of a capital for Argentinians should be huge
Sure, and well, you look for photos on the internet, and I went there at the moment they offered me the job and I already accept it and well
I came here, kind of sad because I found nicer Canada than the United Sates, but I had already said yes her and I needed to change, but
I really liked, but It seemed huge when I look the photos
The downtown in Ottawa is five blocks
Sure it's small
The parliament is beautiful and the Rideu Canal is frozen.
The slogan of the largest ice skating rink in the world
Figure, natural yes
You can skate to your office.
If you want to.  Some people do it
No, yes, it's like this, that's it. If you ever think of going to Montreal you must speak both English and French
None
It is the bilingual city par excellence
Look. It would have been a disaster. My English is fine, but french, hardly three words. yes
I am not sure whether it's French or something similar.
Is very divided, right? The relationship between French speakers and English speakers is very bad, right?
There is a traditional resentment, I don't know. No,actually I don't know what the hell do the people from Quebec complain about.
They are always with the independence claim.
Oh, yes, i heard about that. i heard something about that they will do elections to see if they can become independent.
THERE WAS, A REFERENDUM, THERE WERE TWO REFERENDUM
Yes, they want to become independent.
Not long ago was it's tenth anniversary.
Sure
Outsider that I am, I'm very interested in the topic because the Quebec are Latins.
Yes.
They are more similar to us. They scream and drink wine and they fight and good luck
The ones from Montreal are more tranquil like the Americans, able to look
No, some are from Montreal and some are from Quebec.
No, I'm dizzy.
The ones from here supposedly have a British background.
Sure.
Of austerity, and loyalty and the development but
Look at that
I don't know what. In, in Ottawa what you have is the, the Ottawa employer is the federal government, eighty percent of the jobs
Are for the federal government and the requirement is the
Sure.
Bilingual. But like that as well.
Both yes, look at that. How incredible.
This side of Ontario is English
Yes
If you speak both languages, you can find work just for that, if you want.
Look.
English is predominant and the opposite of you go to Montreal.
In those places, if you speak one of them you are alright, I mean, you can get a job, everything
In a way, yes, you will survive
Sure, and do you speak French as well?
I understand some words. I can't have a conversation in French
In French. But then understanding isn't that difficult.
None
I don't know what accent they have. In France, I listened to the people and understood what they were talking about, don't ask me to repeat the conversation, but I knew what they were talking about.
I don't know. It is quite affected
They don't have any accent.
I don't know if it's because of the accent, but it's complicated, like Spanish, with the A and E
Sure, no. Speaking it is very difficult
Verb conjugations, and the accents.
Speaking is very difficult. I tried to study one time but I quit.
I'm Alfredo, and I'm talking to you from New York
Hello I'm Marcela in North Carolina
Hi, Marcela
How's it going?
Here in
How can you hear in the city
Yea I can hear the sirens
In New York
It's pretty normal for here so like dating
Dating couples. I've been married for a long time.
Ha, but that must not be very fun
No, I don't have a good record of dating
No yea like it's an exclusive relationship
Yea, yes yes yes, yea
Yea, he
We've been together for thirty years.
You've been together for thirty for years?
Yea, thirty years
So internet dating didn't exist for you two.
No it wasn't around,  not even the DC were around
The what?
None
Sure, no
And the personal computers didn't exist
Yes listen, and where are you from originally?
I'm Argentinian and you?
I'm Chilean
We're neighbors
Look
You've been here long
I've never lived in Chile.  I left during the coup
None
Lived in Europe and Honduras in Mexico
None
...and, I haven't been here in New York, like in ten years
So you were, born in Chile but
No, I was born in the United States but went to live to Chile
Your parents are Chileans
My parents are Chileans
None
They were studying there, and so I went to live in Chile, my dad worked with agrarian reform, with Allende's government
Yeah and after what happened
Obviously we had to, yes, but, here, now I'm in New York I'm looking for work, I just moved here because I finished school there in Wisconsin and I returned about three months ago
None
So
You're not married
Yes, in reality I'm married
None
No, I separated from my wife about three years ago
None
And and we're still married because I'm waiting for them to give her the papers
Sure
To be American, I'm giving her residence and this is why we have to separate.
Yes, this takes time
Yes.
Yes.  No, I met my husband at school, university.
Wow, in what university
It's a theater academy but during the uears he was a graduate, in Los Angeles
None
Ten years after we got married we celebrated our ten year anniversary.
Sure
So in total they're thirty years
Okay I understand.
Legally they're twenty
They're twenty. But, I was with my wife and I was six years
None
From there, I got married, but it lasted only two years/ It's been three years since that happened.
Look at that
The important thing is the relationship--not the paper.
That's true ,that of meeting people on the internet
Yes
It could be that it has to do with different generations but to me that seems very strange.
Why so strange?
I don;t know it seems strange perhaps because I'am very visual person
Yes
You understand me, I mean I can't imagine  how it would be to meet a person and form a friendship with someone even develop some sort of affection, but it's an affection based on what? based on, on letters only
No, and you are not limited to that because that's one way, but there are places where one puts pictures, and looks for specific people, you put there
A sort of what I like, what are
Yes, that's a kind of dating.
That is a big part of dating, they are doing it online now. They ask you many things about personality to search for compatibility. That's what they say when they add
Yes, look you know what I would like to do but just to have fun only of course just like to act crazy, but what I would like try
None
Just to see what speed dating was like.
Yes
Where people go to like a restaurant or something and then sit with someone for i don't know two, three minutes, I don't know a very short time.
Five minutes, yes
They ring a bell or something, I don't know, and then you move to the other table and talk with the other person
Yes, I think that's interesting because you know looking in their eyes, being there, talking a little, and seeing if there's a connection or not
Yes
I understand what you are saying through the computer like no
I think that would be fascinating to do that only as a form of experiment, to see how
Safe
What?
What happens is that you have to be careful, be careful that there are some that when one decides it's supposed to be a complete date there are some that are like that, there are some
To
I mean that  it is not like at the hour you are going to tell him. I'm going home already or whatever like you have five or ten minutes to say yes or no
But that you decide like you are not committed to do things
Yes
Necessarily specific, but to eat, you have dinner.
Sure
So
Yes
Yes, it could be interesting.
But is that they are intereresting things, but is strange, because we have so many people and so many communication mediums. However, it's obvious that the majority of people feel alone.
Yes.  It is true.  You are lucky that you haven't had that problem.  For example, after being with my wife for 8 years
None
After that I had to start with dates again, and that was strange. One that hasn't played the game in eight years let's say is
Yes
It's been interesting, I I always, at least I've seen on the internet many of those sites, I'm not participating in any but I've seen them
Ah
Inclusive there are casual encounters, that one can see, that are very fun to read on craigs list
No.
I don't know if you've seen them very entertaining the one yesterday was about a couple, she's five months pregnant they were looking for one or two participants, to
Make love in front of those other people
That's an old story
Someone has to answer
What a
Perhaps, you have to see the New York, if you are going to do it, it's very entertaining you go to craigslist dot com New York and casual encounters read them that they are very good
Let's see, I'm going to go because is that I like to read funny things like that
It's called casual encounter in English.
But, yes, I don't know, we have two children, one is 23 yo and the other one 17 yo
They use the internet.
No, like the old times, them meet people in school or
Yes
Maybe where they live.  I think the majority of people.
They try to meet someone through friends, work, school, or church first.
I see, and when they can't
When they are desperate, they sign up
It's a good theory, but I don't agree, I think that the younger people now realizes that internet is considered distinct, I think, the tool
You can look for compatible partners without going to bars.
Yes
If it's in work, or with a friend, but it might be a really close circle, many people here, does not make that many social activity in the week, at least there is not much time, people is short in time
People must meet in a gym or a bar.
Yes, that's true
It's like finding a needle in a haystack
Yes
I'm someone who likes the cinema, so you make a quick online search
15 candidates
Sure
They send a little mail saying, and suddenly the same on their side, their instinct works and I think it might be that someone is desperate, or nor
The truth is
It doesn't have much to do with what can be your partner or not. Because it doesn't
Yeah, right?, you save time from all those dudes and girls that you're wasting time on
I have seen a lot of pictures in those websites
Right.
None
None
There's people that's very pretty, gorgeous, in those websites, so it doesn't add up, i can't believe they have no other way of doing it, i think that, it can also be fun like that
Maybe it's the new wave
I think it's the new wave, interesting. A little bit of adrenaline
Yes
A little exhibitionism sometimes it depends on the pictures they put
The thing is that when you meet with this person and that the picture and the person match
It's very different, the photo is from fifteen years ago.
Because you imagine, it turns out you're meeting one of these girls, completely hot and you open the door and it's a parrot, that would be horrible
It's must be right
But, what are you gonna do about it, right?
It's something...
And another thing, how do you know that these people live, it could also be lying to you, no, but you think how do you know that what they're putting there is what they like, what they do?, it's true
You find out, I think that if you get there and the person is very different than the picture, you have a problem of trust on that person from the start, besides you may not like it
Yes
But after this, I think that if you lie, as you get to know the person, one realizes it and
None
I think that.
Thank God I don't have to worry about that.
I'm thirty three years old
Young
Some day I will be one of those desperate ones that puts the thing on the internet
No, I'm fifty years old. So I'm on the other side of the wall already.
None
And that would be very easy, imagine that I don't know what at this age one separates or becomes widowed or one finds himself alone and
Hello
Hello, how are you?
What's your name?
George
George? I'm Diana from New York
From New York
This is Diana from Philadelphia.  I am calling from San Francisco.
None
I came here for the holidays because my brother lives here
In San Francisco?
Yes in California
But where do you live?
In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Philadelphia. What's your name?
Diana
Diana, how are you? Where are you from?
Paraguay
Pleased to meet you, Colombian
My pleasure.
What do you think about the subject?
The topic was the courtship
The courtships
Yes
And how have you been?
Are you married?
Yes I've been married
Yes
Yes of course and you?
What? No, I have a boyfriend since a year ago.
You know sick of the topic.
A LITTLE, I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE COURTSHIP THROUGH THE INTERNET
It's fresh, no, you haven't had, nor have you met anyone that has boyfriend by the internet
Not many I do remember when I was, now I'm twenty six years old, but when I was like fifteen years old, I was
Yes
There was a guy that lived in Spain.
Yes
That we talked a lot by chat every day, but it wasn't a courtship, it was someone with whom I talked to a lot
Yes, a friendship
Exactly.
But not a courtship
What?, what other question did they ask about relationships?
I don't know, I don't remember what the initial question was about relationships, the last one was about the interest, but I don't know about the beginning
Beginning
Anywhere here
I don't know either, I think I'm happy with this relationship, but I came here to California to visit my brother who's ten years older
Yes
He's thirty six
Yes
He doesn't have a girlfriend
Yes
He broke up with his girlfriend six months ago
Yes
He lives as a bachelor.
A bachelor
I don't know, I don't like that he is like a bachelor.
Why not?
He goes to the bar, he meets a girl one night, and then it's over.
It's over
And there's nothing there, it's over, he met someone like that, last night he met someone and he mentioned something, i didn't go with him
Yes
He mentioned to me that he knew someone and laughed. He didn't tell me many details.
Yes
But basically in the environment of the bar is like you can really get into the life of the game, more or less
Not take the relationship between a man and a woman seriously
Yes, and what do you think is the best way, because a dance is a good start
Yes?
I think what happens that night you decide who you want to dance with and the next day it's forgotten
Yes
But, at least in my case, I meet someone dancing and I'm interested, I try to keep it going, turn into something more, no?
But it's a good
How did you meet your woman?
What did you say?
How did you meet your wife?
I've had three up until now
Three wives, yes, that's good
And I'm booking because I'm in the process of another separation now. The first was from school.
A young love
So, yes
In secondary, high school
Yes, and second
How nice.  I have a boyfriend.
Yes
Who was my first love
None
And I don't know, he was really young, I was really young
Yes
Things didn't work, but until now I think that it would be nice for things to work one day
Of course yes
By chance or to come back to this first love
Yes, I know cases of people who after they've been married, they've separated and met their first love again
Yes
Yes, and there have been these kinds of cases when one takes its course and finally comes back in a few years
None
I do not remember.
Went out with

I don't know if it's because of the age or something like that, but
Yes, and what's the longest it's lasted?

Hello?
Hello, good evening, my name is Carolina.
Good evening, my name is Marcela. I live in North Carolina
You don't say. I live in New York.
Where are you from?
From Peru.
I'm Argentinian.
Look, how nice. From Buenos Aires?
Yes.
How
I've been living in the United States since I was nine.
And very from Buenos Aires.
I'm more American than Argentinian, but the accent has never gone away.
Yes. My daughter worked with Argentinians and she has all of their accents.
Yes, both my sons are bilingual. And my oldest son, he was in New York because he went to -N-Y-U
And he works at La Palapa
None
There, everybody that worked in the kitchen was from Mexico. He spoke Spanish with the little accent.
Mexican, it was very amusing
But always the accent, it seems unreal.
Yes, this also happened to me, if I go with someone from this site or the other site and, I talk with them for a little bit, after a while it sticks.
Are there many Latinos there?
When we came in eighty seven no, but now yes, now there are many, it's surprising
And where, and from what place?
And the majority are from Mexico
Yeah.
Yes. The same story everywhere,
How nice.
Yes.
The topic
We have to talk about dates and courtships, I don't know if I can have an opinion because I've been married for thirty years
What
So no
So you don't know, but you always hear?
Yes
I'm not partial to internet dating, because I have the idea of how the people I talk to
They say
Yes.
The internet, justifiably, through Fisher, I've meet people from various different places.
None
And they themselves have told me that when they go into their transformation, you can go into what you want, but it's really something else.a boy from Arizona told me that
I know better, but he told me that the problem is that blondes are liars.
You go and see it's a small blonde that work, but he says that all he has gotten so far
Isn't worth it and after that i met another Dominican that also told me there was, through the internet, he told me you can get a lot of women
Because they want to date you and all that. But he tells me that they all tell lies
I thought about that, and i just asked,  my oldest son, that is here for the party, i asked him, you
Would you go in one of those companies to find someone over the internet?, he told me no, never ever, and, because I
Curious as I am, the only thing that intrigues me, but I would like to do it only for curiosity, right?, not to go out
With anybody behind my husband's back, but just out of curiosity, that thing they do where people goes and
Sit in a table with someone else for a very short time, and then, they ring a bell and you move to another table
And you talk to someone else for a very short period and then based on those short conversations
Yeah
You write in a paper if you're interested, who are you interested in, and if the other person is also interested, then the company or
The group that handles that connects you.
None
It's curious to me that in such a short time
You can
PEOPLE CAN, AND MAYBE YES, RIGHT? MAY BE YES BECAUSE IT'S ON A MORE INSTINCTIVE LEVEL, AND NOT SO INTELLECTUALIZED, YOU SEE?, THAT
I look sometimes, right, because i say, i have a niece that told me, no, aunt, i meet them on the internet, i dated a guy
I told her, how can you do that?, it could be a sick person, a maniac or a
You don't know who you'll find, because people can tell you anything.
Yes, and sometimes i see it, yeah, a bit difficult, but after relationships... later on i think that long relationships also aren't, without the internet, the ones that are long also
Just yesterday I was talking to a lady that told me she was in a relationship for ten years and she broke up with her boyfriend because he came to the United states
She was coming to the united states she was with another forcthen years snd herr she met one and married after ten months.
She's been happily married for five years
Look at that
She was in a relationship for ten years with each one of them.
None
Unbelievable, right? I mean, life is like that, you never know
You never know, yeah or no, you always hear about people that lived together for a long time and later on they get married and they
They don't last, it doesn't last.
Yes
Me and my husband are the exception I have heard a lot of people like that, we had been living together for ten years and we celebrate our tenth anniversary
Look that's very nice
It's been twenty years from that, so we're at thirty years total
None
We don't count since it was legal, we count from the beginning
Yeah
But, we're the exception
Of course yes
For what i have seen, right?, about people that have lived together for a long time and then they get married and bam, everything falls apart.
I was with someone, and other conservative friends, so I got married
None
Marriage didn't work out and i didn't last five years married, but i had two children, but no, i have never married again
But incidentally, i got back to Peru and i found the boyfriend i had when i was young
Look at that
He told me he had gotten married, and that he wasn't happy. He was separated and about to get divorced. He told me, i realize now it's because i always loved you.
None
None
So romantic
It was like I was in a fairy tale. He was established in the military, I had my life here.
I couldn't leave my children, that they practically were born here, and so, going there is
Itâ€™s very complicated.
Sure right?
It's different when you have children, because children come first
Also, he proposed to me, right?  To marry and rebuild our lives and everything.  I told him no, I couldn't, that my children were first
That I would never leave my children, so he told me look, I take my hat off to you because not many women put their children ahead
I dedicated myself to my two children completely and i live for them, well, i lived for them both, but my son just passed away,  six months ago, and I'm completely torn apart.
I dedicated my self to my mother and father
None
He wasn't a good husband but he was a good father
None
And like that,
I understand because I also have two kids and my husband works. But the one who pushes, who knits, who drives, who
The one who does everything is me and thank God that they are both doing The oldest, he graduated from -N-Y-U he did it in three years.
He is a modern dancer
Tremendous
Dances for a very famous group in that profession, that is called Pilobus
None
And, he travels all over the world. And, that is
None
That's too much for an artist, because I'm also an actress and director and my husband is a musician, so as a family of artists, we know that
None
Is hard making money and to live from what you do.
None
You always need to have another job.  And, now the youngest is a guitar player who plays ...
Okay.
Plays classical guitar and jazz. He's going to university. They can be artists if they want, but they have to go to university.
That's the only thing but
Tell me.
Yes, it should be like that. Yes, I hope and pray that they find good girls when the moment comes.
Yes.
But
Yes, both of them are boys
Yes, they are both boys,
I had a boy and a girl.
Good, you always have the girl, because the boys always leave
None
Belong to the girl right? the boys belong to the mother more than the father. The girls belong to the father, but then when they grow up and get married, the boys go
With, to their wife's house
Ah, of the women yes.
You understand? However, the girls bring their husband and their family too, to their house.
Sure.
And there I lost a little
Well
Yes, I don't know what
I have six brothers and they all pull for their wives, not for their mother. When they were little they were close to my mom
BUT MARRIED, EVERYTING FOR WIFE
Yes.
Everything for the wife, sure, is incredible.
Yes, that's how it is.  I try to cook special things.  When they come to parties they always say, I want to go to mom's house
She can cook this or that. I have to have something to
Sure.
Drag them to my house
Sure, yes.
Yes, but I don't know. This of the internet and dates. I never thought, being a person of my generation. I'm fifty years old, so I lived in
In the seventies, when everything was accepted and I done, this
Hello?
Hello? yes, my name is Eliana, who is it?
Hello Eliana, this Manuel. I am in Orlando, Florida, where are you?
Right now I am in Miami, Florida, but I am living in Boston
Yes, and how are you?
Fine
Getting into the matter.  I will listen.  You start; what do you think about it?
Look, I really don't know, I don't know what are the regulation, about women or anything like that. I arrived here in the United States only eleven months ago
No, actually I didn't ask
Haven't you heard anything? Some friend talking about it?
No, I have no problem working here, I don't feel any discrimination. I don't feel any difference between men and women. Or anything like that, what do you think?
I've been here longer. I have been here eight years and I think that in this country, you have some rights granted, unlike many others.
Obviously
That's right.
There are a lot of regulations for that purpose, I know it because I have seen it, let's say, in the media, or one
Single complaint from a woman calling the police and they go immediately
Yes
That's how it is And there are many orders of separation after those calls many of the orders come after
No, sorry.
I think so. But, about emotional abuse, I don't agree there, and I think it is in both directions
Although men have traditionally been allowed to do this, man has traditionally employed more of the force to abuse his partner, the woman in turn has
Emotionally abused, and verbally abused, that is very typical. So then when, when there are situations of emotional abuse, it seems that it isn't men or women, in general
I don't know what you think in that regard.
Yes, but are there laws against emotional abuse towards women?
No, but here in the introduction they spoke about the opinion of emotional abuse: if you believe that women are sufficiently protected in this regard
I don't know if there are specific laws that protect or signal this, but if there aren't any and if you believe them, it seems to me that you can't say just
Men emotionally abusing women, it also happens in reverse
Yes, it seems like that to me as that this is very exaggerated like to have it as law, or, or It seems to me that already, I don't know
It depends on the couples if they can talk about abuse, and some even enjoy abuse.
The
To be verbally abused.
The human psychology, humans are complex. It is complex to the point that in many cultures, the matter of abuse is
Things a man does against a woman they see a symbol of manhood
Yes.  That very thing.
And if, and if it's missing, then it puts in doubt like, something about the man's manhood. It's a very complex thing, but, but
The
At the limit of whether this is abuse or is not abuse. It seems to me that this is when
In this country it seemsm to me that it's barbaric, that all of the laws regarding abuse and everything you say, that it's true a woman can call and right away there is
A policeman taking care of it.  On the other hand, you can go to the other extreme.  In some cases
Suddenly if you have the opportunity to speak about it here with people, many men give you, many are very afraid
Act in conflicting situations with your partner about it, because if the call is from a woman, it will always be the man's fault, no matter what he says.
Mutual
Yes
Struggling or against the strongest... now look, there's another, there's another law that has been created and i think it's very good, yeah
It's that happened against the immigrants, so, you know it's very common, for people to get hooked up here, get married
And especially with the regulation in mind, there were frequent cases of abuse
PHYSICAL, EMOTIIONAL, BLACKMAIL FROM THE PARTNER AGAINST THAT IMMIGRANT, SO, OF COURSE SHE WAS TERRIFED TO TALK BECAUSE SHE KNEW SHE WOULD BE DEPORTED
Of course
The other partner would abused her more by making her believe that, right? there's a law that protects them.
After more police calls, she can make the decision of separating and continuing the legalization process on her own
None
That is a very good law that exists.
Yes I think that I feel more protected as a woman. I feel more protected regarding any of those problems.
You never know where the limit is
Maybe in Latin American, there are none of those laws in our countries, and, and so there are much more people that hit and abuse their women
Yes
Here they go to the other side.  You can't act, say or do what you feel from fear of
Going to jail.
Exactly, and another important factor is the children, and those women always abused behind that
That costume, lets say, the one of the abuse well, from fear of losing their children or that something will happen to them, or well, them being taken away
I mean, that's also common here
Sure, also
When homes are very controversial the system, the state, decides to take them away
Yes, it's true, isn't it? You loose for, sometimes you. It's true, everything is very difficult
It is complicated already.
But
It's complicated
Yes
But I also think that, as is usually said, behind every abuser is a woman who lets him abuse her, right?
Yes
That's right. Once I saw in a X movie, a woman approaches and complains, ans she says, in brief,
The person, I think it was a therapist. anyaway, look I've been fifteen years in a bad, into a relation where I was
I have been abused for fifteen years.  I answer, What is the problem?
You'd better say that you've allowed him to abuse you for fifteen years.
Sure
They don't realize that you have to act at the first sign of abuse.
Sure, just like that. The problem is that
Hey have been abused for five years
Yes, but it is also true that abuses do happen much more in Latin countries than in the other countries, right?
Yes
The Arabic countries to say so
No way, no way
Directly of course
It is cultural and terrible
It is still
And laws
It is completely accepted.
Yes.  Laws that support men completely.   The movies that have made about the subject don't lie
Sure
Women who have married men from these countries suddenly decide to take the children to their countries.
The man makes the decision
Absolutely, the true is that this the reason, right? sometimes we are here arguing and so, about laws about this and that, but there are countries that are
Terribly much behind, rght?
It's incredible because of the way you have to dress, under many regimes they can't even show their faces.
Yes, that's incredible. And they can't vote, can they?
That is a full constraint, they can't talk to nobody in the street and even less to a stranger
Sure, and if they want to talk their husband can kill them
Just figure, it's like in industry.  I used to live in New York when I was taking English lessons at a college.
And when I got out about nine o'clock in the night you are starving and tired. Everybody was running to the lift. because it was in a fifth floor
Were going down in the lift, all squashed because there were many of us and there was this girl, a Muslim girl
Sure
Always used the stairs. You know why he did it?
Because
It was a young and quite beautiful girl.  She was the attire.  She only showed the hands and the face.
All the rest in a black tunic with the hair covered. She couldn't be brushed by any man, and inside an elevator you can't help brushing each other, right?
Yes, sure
Figure, to the point that she couldn't use the elevator, Unless she was alone. Alone in an empty elevator.
Yes, that's absolutely crazy.  We just can't understand that kind of culture, right?
Can they think this way?
The most funny is that she told a friend, a friend of mine, yes, she told my friend she was happy like that
I mean, it's a barbarous question, but they are grown up and educated for that.
Sure. How funny. Where are you from?
From Colombia
I see
Are you Argentinean?
Yes
Yes
With this imperative way of talking, right? and using the 'vos'?
Where I come from we do use
Really? I see
In general you try to speak as everyone else, but if we all usevos
Sure
Vos and usted, right
Sure, and it's hard for me to use that on the phone. They are trying to study the Hispanic language
Now that we are here, I speak, in my way, right?
Yes, but really nice. You are all always conserving that and I think it's unique, it's really valid
Yes, there is people noticing that
It's fair that inside those linguistic variations is where the beauty of our language is
Excuse me, what did you said?
Hello
Hi, this is Maria Inez
Hi, Alicia speaking.
Hi alicia where are you from?
I am originally from Chile but I'm living in
Where?
Atlanta, Georgia, in the South.
That's good, I am from Phil- from Argentina but I'm in Philadelphia now.
Philadelphia, at the University
Yes, in Penn University
Yes, where this study is, it seems no,
Yes, I casually work at the university in the part of biology
What or, that's intersting, biology, wow
Yes tell me, what do you think of today's topic?
That's terrible
No, I don't know anything about the laws of the United States.
Yes, sure.
I know it's terrible that there is violence and that it must be everywhere.
Sure, everywhere against women and for men too
None
The problem is that there's abuse within the marriages, and that's the worst thing of all.
Yes, the domestic violence, not inside the houses, the State can't get involved in that and
I was saying to some people that domestic violence between lesbians is much worse than domestic violence between heterosexual couples.
Yes, it is.
Yes, and sometimes, they make quite a drama and they hit and abuse each other and sometimes,
That's terrible.
They even shoot each other, I was talking to a policeman here in Atlanta that
Yes
What's his name, that would be a woman against a woman
Look woman against that's weird I wouldn't have imagined really it was that way
Sure.
Look, that's terrible.
No.
There are laws in Chile, there's something because in Argentina, I don't know the name of the subject, that's the truth.
I think so, but for example, it's not really that useful as it is in Chile. All my personal experiences and problems that I've had and people I've met that have had those problems have never
It was never resolved.
The police don't get involved in this things, no
Sure, they don't and let me tell you this, it's even more dramatic to talk to the police that the violent event per se
Yes
The cops, they have no empathy, they make you feel ashamed of what has hapened to you and to me, the most traumatic thing was to have to talk to the cops.
Yes
Yes.
Look
It woul have been better to forget about it
Yes but the problem is over
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is
No, well now you are alright
Yes,  sure. In this aspect, to me, I don't know of nobody to whom something has happened
I knew a girl in Argentina. She had a boyfriend but she was a girl.
None
Very young, she was twenty-two or twenty-one, she was younger than me, and I was young by that time
Yes
And I remember that she was a very beautiful girl, from a regular family, they had money enough, everything normal.
Sure
She looked like a goddess and had a boyfriend who hit her.
My
He stayed for about one year with that boy. And he hit her, and then he regretted it, and then she cried and returned with him
That's terrible.
Yes i can told you marriage for believe that.
Sure, or from a stranger, a rapist let's say,
Sure, yes, something like this
But that someone wants to be with someone like this, that's the funny thing
A girl with a strong temper, she was not a girl of the submissive kind
True
With all the personality, and however, no, I mean I think nobody should be exposed to something like this, meeting a madman
I don't know, or a madwoman in the case of lesbians I don't know
How incredible. Sure, that's true. But listen, it's strange that, I mean not even, it's strange that a girl like this one, with temper and so, let him hit her
The girl could have had any boyfriend she wanted She was a precious girl, very beautiful
None
Right? And she explained it to me, and I just stared at her and told her 'I just can't believe it'
Perhaps when people are abused they end up this way.
Yes, that's terrible
Another interesting thing i heard, and I've had some pretty funny friends in my life; I had a girlfriend who was into sadomaoschism.
No
You know what I mean, right?
Yes
Sure. Yes, she is into that lifestyle, and they go out to clubs and stuff, she told me
She had met two women who ended up with abusive husband's that are now in rehabilitation.
Yes
But she got into that, how you call it? sadomasochism because in the sadomasochism sexual game they could get over and psychologically overcome of havinf been
None
Physically abused by men like that.
Like shame, let's say.
Sure something like that,  something very strange, yes.
Wow
Playing a role that
Yes
Sexual, but without real violence, like an act I mean
Yes, it's a limited violence.
Sure all yes could, fanatic of everything psychological.
Look
I found everything very interesting
The topic of sadomasochism catches my attention a lot. If you're not in it, you can't understand it.
Yes, of course
I watch documentaries
Yes is true.
I think that if it's consensual by both parties, I wouldn't do it, but it's okay, I don't know.
It's true
I mean it's worse when a person abuses another person without consent, no, I don't know
All that you see in the world of sadomasochism - the most important thing is not causing actual harm. But everything that's perceived as harm is not real harm. It's all a question. I worked with this girl that
He was in the lifestyle
Yes
And on top of that she was one of these types of people who talked all day about everything. I was already almost an expert, simply knowing this
That
But it was interesting
Awesome. Listen, was this all here in the United States or over in Chile as well?
Pardon?
You knew these people here in the United States, or in Chile?
In Chile, they are inside the closet.
Yes, I believe they must be everywhere but what happens if you are not looking for them
Of course
If you know someone who is in the lifestyle.
None
You don't get to, but they must be everywhere, I would imagine, they have to be.
Of course, for example, two years ago I was in Concepcion, which is a very small city in Chile, the south of Chile
Yes
Of course, you find yourself, but it's very surprising the number of punks and of goth people. And homosexuals living in Concepcion, in other words there is a complete alternative world, it's like, it's unbelievable, it's like the society
Look
I would have never imagined it
Look, it's very interesting, it's very interesting, very interesting and I, I saw on television there was a program over in Argentina where they did, like, investigations on this type of, that is, about these groups inside the cities with different customs, and they also did one about the goths
Sure
They were people, that was in Buenos Aires, but I guess it must be the same in every city and it was really a huge group of people who have a
Sure
Their own lifestyle. They live at night and dress in Gothic.
Sure, and they go to clubs and listen to that 'da, da, ,da' music, I don't know
Yes, I would be a little scared to enter one of those, and I guess they are inoffensive, if you don't meddle they won't do anything to you
Sure
Their aspect is a little scary. It scares me.
Yes, I've started to hear about people who go to the, what you call it? the dentist, to put on fangs, with surgery
To look like real vampires
No
None
That's terrific!
Incredible
And there are also the vampire clubs, I don't know what they actually do there and what are their habits but I know they exist
Sure, they swear they are vmpires
Human mind is really extraordinary
Yes, if it gets bored it invents whatever
Just like that
And in Argentina, where did you live in Argentina?
I used to live in Mar del Plata
Mar del Plata, you are the second one, I met some people from Mar del Plata via Internet, we talked to them that way
OK it's big but we still know each other quite a lot, it's like a big town
I don't think that you know some Martin who works in a call center.
No, well, I know several guys named Martin, but I don't know
Sure, I guess so. It's just that I can't recall his surname, but he did work in a 'call center', yes. I used to talk to him, but then he became an idiot and we didn't talk anymore.
Usually happens with the Internet.
Sure, yes it's true, it's funny
Everything starts fine, but then they start acting silly
You are an idiot
I am from Mar del Plata. It is nice. Where are you from? Chile?
Yes, they sent me pictures. It's very nice. I liked it a lot.
It is nice already, yes, did you notice that the America's Summit was in Mar del Plata? I wonder if you heard
IT ARRIVED AT THREE,
Bush was there
I had no idea
Yes,  it was mar del plata
Wow
About one month ago, in November
Wow
Yes I went to Mar del Plata for a visit they were preparing the whole city because all the presidents of America were going there, I guess your president must have been there also?
None
Yes
None
He was, all of them were, they meet every I don't know how many years, all the presidents of America meet to talk about their
Sure, to promote the American imperialism
Things, of course. Well, and they were all against Bush and so
I can imagine.
It was quite interesting seeing it
Listen, I think if I had been you, I would have regretted not being there, it would have been funny
Yes, I was there just before that, but I came back two days before all the presidents arrived, precisely
You saw the preparations?
I saw, yes of course, I saw how they were putting the safety fences, my parents lived right there, two blocks away from where Bush was to stay
They were given, they had to give them two credentials in order to get in and out of their house, because otherwise they couldn't
Wow, no, that's ridiculous
And nobody could visit them without a credential, it was quite a matter
That's ridiculous.
If they had to walk the dog, they needed the credential because they could be stopped at any moment to check if they were terrorists.
Yes, today.
Funny
The same, ridiculous, but also interesting, I've never being in something like that

I dont know very much, either.
None
I know New York and nothing more.

How are you? Where are you from?
From Paraguay.
Paraguay. I'm from Argentina.
Yes, from Argentina, nice to meet you.
Yes. How are you?
Very good, yes.
You are living?
In reality I live in Philadelphia, but now I'm in,
Me too.
In philadelphia yes
Yes.
I'm calling from San Francisco where I'm visiting my brother.
For vacations.
To visit him, yes. For two, three weeks.
And how is it over there? I have some friends that went over there.
Yes. To San Francisco?
Yes, is it good?
It's raining every day.
Is it nice?don't tell me. I putty my friends, they went on vacation, and it was raining
It's all grey, but it isn't. It's cold in Philladelphia, right?
Yes but not that much. Winter is coming super quiet, it's coming very mild.
That's lucky.
Yes, yes, yes. Not so much, there's no snow at all. It's good.
None
It's really good. So, I don't know about that subject, which, which is scheduled for today, in fact I know nothing.
Neither do I. I was about to tell you the same. This is the second time I get this subject and
It's really bad.
No, I've not much to say either. What I said last time, is that I think there's a lot of abuse, when it comes to women
Erm, it is often psychological abuse, it isn't always physical.
Really?
Yes, I feel sometimes women can find themselves trapped in a relationship and its due to being afraid of leaving that they stay
Re-write
Sure.
But, as for the physical thing, because the questions they asked are in regards to the American government,
Mmh, yes.
The law is quite good, as far as I know. I don't know anyone who found themselves in a situation.
None
Being hit.
Yes
I really can make an statement in the subject, because I've never met someone in that problem
I really don't have idea, so, I can make an statement in that subject
So do I
Let's keep talking about San Francisco. tell me, is it nice there?
Oh, yes, is really nice, I love this city.
Yes
My brother has lived here a few years. I often come here to visit him, and we get along well, we are ten years apart.
Yes.  Ten years.
Ten years, I see
I'm 26 years, he is 36 years old
That's nice
None
More expensive?, More expensive than Philadelphia
Yes, than Philadelphia
I see
But there are many places for eating and really good
More beautiful
Places to get to know, and this.
There's a really big gay neighborhood
Yes, there, but, Philadelphia
They told me, I didn't have any idea, they told me that one of the neighborhoods
Yes, there is one street called Castro.
None
And, over these streets and this zone, it would be like the gayborhood of Philadelphia.
None
Sometimes I think that Philadelphia has  a bigger community than San Francisco
Yes?
The attitude here is that everyone is really liberal or all of society is liberal.
And there's a very big and stable community of homosexuals, men and women but, I don't know, I think,
In Philadelphia, I think they're more militant
None
They have their zone, and this zone is really closed, really well defined. Here it's more open, everyone is pretty open, they experience a lot.
Like a more general liberal attitude
How nice. This is good.
Yes
This really great, look at that. now we have to go meet
Yes
Some day to san francisco
How long have you been living in Philadelphia?
No, just one year
One Year. So little
This is my first year, and you?
Five years
Yes, and have you returned to Paraguay?
YES, MY DAD LIVES IN PARAGUAY, IN ASUNCION, AND I OFTEN VISIT HIM
None
I go there every year. Only on holidays, but this time I came here to San Francisco, to visit my brother.
Sure
I am like the ambassador of my family, I go from one country to another, visiting my relatives, or my
That is who you miss the most
Yes
None
Well,  I don't know, my mom lives in Philadelphia
SURE, YES, REALLY?
I know she misses it. But, I think she has more limitations at her job
You have more freedom to handle it.
Yes, more
The times we went to Argentina, last month, visting
To friends, relatives, eating meat.
Nice
That you really miss here, right?
Now, I'm about to go to a restaurant where they cook the cheesesteak here in Philadelphia.
Yes
Because they used the bread from Philadelphia.
Really?
Do you know it?
Yes, I know it
They use that bread and they cook in the same way like in Philadelphia and all that, but here
Why?
Because it's
Don't you like it?
Really greasy, it's really heavy
That's really heavy
I like meat, but not that nice is half baked meat.
I will keep trying and each house, until I find the best
Yes
But, so far no
Regarding the meat, i found the Mixto [or 'Mixed'] restaurant, or, that's very tasty
Yes, in Phil, here. They told me about a restaurant, I once walked outside its door
Yes, they have a dish on the menu, that's the Argentinian roast, but i don't think they use argentinian meat
It's good, it's good, i think it's tasty.
Yeah, i thought so with chimichurri. A little salty, yes
Very good. I'll stop by. They told me about that restaurant, about Latin American foods, and that it was very good.
Yeah, it's very tasty.
Well,
Are you married?
Yes, I'm married
Right
Yes, and my wife is expecting a baby here
That's nice, congratulations
Well, thank you.
Yes
Are you married or not?
No
None
No, I have a boyfriend
Well
No, I can't say that. There's no complaint of abuse of any kind. But, a year ago, we were celebrating. And he's American, descent of
Russian descent
None
He's American.
Yes. Look.
Yes. He's tall
How strange. No?
Yes. It's interesting.
Interesting, yes.
Yes, different.
How's the relationship going?
All good. I think that he's ten years older than I am, like my brother.
None
So, he has a ten year old daughter, and sometimes I think that we're in different places in life, or something like that,
None
Aside from all this, everything is good.
Everything's good.
I think so.
How did you get along with the daughter?
I met her once.
No, he lives here with him
Once, no, he's like, with, with the
None
No, he doesn't have a good relationship with the daughter's mom.
None
Actually, it has, it has been hard for him to have like stable meetings, or scheduled, with the daughter
Poor, that's wrong
Do you have another daughter or?
What?
Do you have another son or is this the first son you're expecting?
It's the only one, that I know
I see, yes
So, no, this is going to be the first
The first and do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
No, we don't know anything.  I think that it's going to be a
The, a surprise
Yes, that's going to be a surprise, like
Right
Like the old times
And is your wife Argentinian too?
Yes, Argentenian
Okay
YES SO, HE'S WORKING HERE IN, PENN. SO YES
Really?
Well, and here we are. The baby arrived by surprise, but well.
Yes. Arrived by surprise.
Will be welcomed.
Came, sure.
I hope he brings a bread under his little arm, as we say. That he comes with, with, with fortune.
What does that mean? With good luck, with fortune, with good luck.
And, good luck, and all those things, it means, that he comes with a bread under the arm.
In Mexico they sat that the child or a newborn brings a lot of luck, everything will change after the child comes, that work will improve and
And all.
Really?
Yes.
You haven't mentioned anything. And not in Paraguay?
I don't know if there are any sayings that I know.
No. And how are things in Paraguay? Is it nice? I don't know anything about Paraguay.
It's good.
I have no idea how it is.
The economy is always unstable
Yes
I think there is a lot of trouble and that, because, because of the lack of money and that, there's a lot of poverty
Sure.
The last time I went, it was more dangerous.
None
The capitol was very dangerous.
None
The people only go out at night with
A lot of poverty, you have to be very careful
Yes
None
It wasn't like that before.  When I lived there, I could go out anytime.  It wasn't dangerous
None
Of not going straight from, right
Yes, they're going to be there with a gun or something like that. Another thing that's new too, is kidnapping, something that was never heard of in Paraguay. The kidnapping of
We had that in Argentina
Is there a lot of that in Argentina?
It's calmed down, but, did you saw that, for a while in Argentina, the dollar was one on one?
Right
It was one dollar per peso.  After there was an economic disaster.
Good evening, my name is Marco
Good evening, I am Gloria from California.
Hi Gloria, I am in Philadelphia
Nice to meet you
Nice to meet you let's see the subject, i didn't exactly understand what it was talking about
Against the violence, lets say, well, against one, as a woman
Yes, but you were asking about the opinion of something he said about the law.
When you as a woman are being assaulted
Yes
When there is domestic violence
Yes
Here in California there are laws that help a lot with that, because when you're a woman, you're assaulted both physically and verbally, or psychologically
Yeah, with
There's a lot of help here from the government, lets say for us woman, when there's domestic violence at home, right?
Yes, my mother is a doctor. I grew up in Paraguay. My mother worked in the Health Ministry in an office as the Secretary for Women.
She repersented Paraguary in the United nations. She was very involved in programs to help, especially Paraguay in the whole world.
The hardest part is that any of this is very emotional, whether it's emotional or
Among the family, or married people, there is another category where it's self justified
None
No, I don't know. Yeah, I think it's hard when a person doesn't want help or give their opinion about other families and some people
For example, when I grew up my dad used a belt.
None
When we were bad, he punished us this way
None
And openly. And this was normal and it was the way things were done
None
I have a five year old creature and more than when he was smaller, I hit him a little bit on his backside with my hand
A bit on his tail sometimes.
None
Once he could communicate, we didn't punish him physically since he's been three.
True it's up, but for example a person who's only used to this can think it's the way that they punished me as a creature
None
They can believe that something barbarous and terrible but it was my dad who wasn't a bad man, it's just the way he did it
None
And in some places they do things differently eh and when it has to do, when you have to accuse the other, eh, the woman always enters into a difficult position
None
None
In my opinion I think well, I don't know, if it's sometimes masochistic or I don't know, but sometimes verbal aggression hurts more
None
No this the this just the problem, it's more mental
That is something that you don't forget when your are a grown woman.
The body is not only that but that she gets hurt and that changes her way of seeing things, the way she feel things
None
Is not is worse, a lot worse, definitively I know that my mother is here in the United States and my father is still in Paraguay
They are separated since they talk well and because there was never a physical abuse problem.
That was the way and that was in Paraguay being there the things are different, she is used to the way things are here
None
It was not I donÂ´t know, she did not justified herself
None
And
I know many women too who are being physically abused and don't notify it to any
No
Lets say to someone who could support them or to the law because sometimes there is the immigration situation and they are afraid of being deported
Yes
And then that leads to continue being attacked, sometimes they even are killed, right?
Many times even when you ask them directly if she was hurt without him hearing she does not want to get him into trouble
She thinks she's going to be punished if she tells.
None
When he knowd she cannot accuse him and without that accusation
None
Nobody can do anything, nor the police, the family, nobody can do anything
There in my country, where I come from, I don't know about laws but they say they can't intervene because that are couple affairs, right?
Yes
That's the reason for the suicides in a home, when there is domestic violence, children have it in mind
Right
If my parents were like this, I will be the same
Exactly.
My dad hit my mom, so I will do the same when I grow up, or even have a worse behaviour
Sometimes after seeing that, they do exactly the opposite, they hate swimming in a swimmers family,
A son of doctors who can't stand seeing blood and hates hospitals, he won't always follow the parents
Right, there are such cases
It's more like
I lived with a person who, who since his parents hit him he wanted to do the same
Yes, that is not very possible
So, he thinks my mom was hit because she surely liked it, so all women should be the same
It is possible, because it depends on who you are with, if you are with people who don't think that way when you are not home
The people in school, the people wherever you go, the way these people think, his behaviour will reflect that
His thoughts will reflect that also
None
It is hard
Right now I am not in domestic violence cases but in my opinion now there are more women heard
Yes
There are women associations here
In general the women have the same rights than men if for some reason is not like that
She is not receiving or is not having all the rights of a man. She should simply raise her hand and tell it and that is going to be fixed
None
Many times they don't do it.
Because of fear or I don't kno
Because of fear,for any reason, there is help
She can or not. It can't, and after that, if she didn't say something is because something is happening to her. Is she going to say that it was her fault?
None
Because she didn't say anything, are you going to blame her? If she killed....it is difficult. It's complicated.
We are still living in the past century. Lets say it is still a custom
When, while there are persons that because you love them or who is going to financially support me if he goes to jail maybe that is in their minds I suppose
Because of that, they donÂ´t report them, right? or donÂ´t ask for help and that becomes a routine of being beaten. I met a lady that when her husband didnÂ´t beat her she didnÂ´t
She cried all day because she was beaten
Yes
And then I think that it becomes a routine like a hobby
Yes everything has to do with it everything has to do with what you are used to
None
And it's
I believe that violence and all of that is becoming more common place in places in Latin America because I come from
Most of the men had at least once gotten drunk and they become aggressive and
No, for example
And even if they are not like that, they do it when they are drunk
They use it to punish their children, their use their belts to hit their children, they have boundaries too, it's not like
They hit a child so that they don't behave badly
To do it again, you are causing some damage
My name's Ramon from Los Angeles
I'm Rafael from Vancouver, Canada
Very good okay, yes, nice to meet you
Nice to meet you
This is a very interesting call for me
None
Because it's the first time I've had a conversation with a person after twenty-five calls. No. Now, I'm close to a restaurant.
Because this call needs to be out of my house telephone
Correct
This yes I'm really happy now that you've connected with me
Ehh from where, like you live in Los Angeles
I live in Los Angeles, I live here
But where did you come from? What city, what country do you come from?
I'm Chicano from Los .
You're Chicano
Yeah yes I was born here in Los Angeles, and you?
You were born in Los Ageles. I've lived here in Canada for fifteen years, I come from Argentina
From Argentina. The topic is domestic violence
None
Here ironically I work in, and I'm a mediator and I work in the superior course of the county of Los Angeles and sometimes I'm a mediator
In problems of violence against women?
Of cases of domestic violence.
You have participation as a mediator
I am the mediator, I am a neutral
None
And I try to build consensus between parties in instead of a judgeÂ´s decision and the person could receive a
A restriction order temporal
None
None
And there are many cases of violence I, so I imagine that
After the mind yes that is a as I work here in this area about three or four months and the papers of the
The United States in this area is very bad in relationship with my part of the situation of how domestic violence is that the people.
The most are men but there are some women is the same but it is with the person wants to call the other person, one person wants to call the person and
And the other person does not want it anymore and wants like to
None
And a spy while
None
Social things and like a million of people here in this country do this
None
That behavior
None
Yes this really bad here in the United States ahh
Let's say the proportion is growing or is shrinking
I think that it's a level that isn't growing but this statistic is ten years old
There aren't statistics this year but typically they think a million people are bothering a person.
None
It's part of the problem of society and since half of the marriages here in this country
End in divorce
Half end in divorce
Half of the marriages have a divorce
But speaking in general or in some communities?
In general in the United States
The Latino community is the same, greater or less
I, ehh, I don't know, I'm sure that this statistic but generally it's ahh
Seventy per cent
Yes, fifty percent and
None
And what's the situation in Canada on this topic
Well, I'm not very up to date on the numbers
None
I think it must be around there
Yes
Could be a little less, but not much less. There is not.
None
There's is not such a big difference between on place and the other about this aspect
None
Because maybe in some other aspects we could talk about there may be a difference, but in this aspect, as far as I know, no
I am about forth percent, he is dealing fifty percent
None
There are similarities.
Talking about probability
None
That is afterwards, I don't know, we should also see another thing, about what happens if inside that fifty percent
None
How much violence does the divorce provoke?
Yes, yes, and yes.
I don't handle those numbers because it is a thing that I have never had violence problems
On one side is the personal
Yes
But I'm not sure, because I would notice, you must notice
You can compare Argentina and Canada and the laws are almost the same, right?
Well
To protect the women
No, here in Canada there is a lot more protection for women
Yes, in
A lot more, I don't know if at this time the United States laws are the same, but here
Yes
Here man is guilty until proving the opposite
Yes
I don't know how is in the United States
In california, if there is one suspect they are acting as one.
Violent action, the police investigates, but there is a lot more legislation for women, and that's fine for me
Yes, also here in this state, if someone, you know, like a violent case, they must go to
A class of anger management
Yes
For a whole year each week
Each week
Each week they must assist to those lessons
And they have to make a reeducation
Yes, re-education
I would not say reeducate
Or teaching, any, that
But, I have a curiosity. The current time percentage you were born in Los Angeles, isn't it true?
Yes
Were your grandparents from Los Angeles or did they also emigrated
My grand parents are immigrants, they moved to Los Angeles after the Mexican revolution.
They are from many generations.
Yes
And you are talking about, what revolution?
In Mexico
In 1910
That's near to 1917
Yes 17, oh no
Yes, 17
Because
It's near Russian revolution
Near the Russian revolution there was the Mexican revolution, I was confused because I had some Mexican friends
Yes
We sometimes chat and that would be a commentary, more like curios, because like they didn't had the chance
So far to talk about a person born from the grandparents
None
That they were already living in California
Yes
It was people from those southern states, who had been living there for a few years, that were the first generation.
Or, yes, in that county, in that county of Los Angeles, a very strange one compared to the country
In a sense
Fifty percent of people here were born in another country
Fifty percent were born in another country
Yes, and in some other places like New York City, Miami, and maybe Chicago, ahh, and maybe one or two more
Big cities, it is similar.
None
The percentage is very big
Very big, now do you live in the very city of Los Angeles?
Yes
Now, violence there is bigger, it is bigger usually than in other smaller cities. How is the environment there?
Specifically in Los Angeles or in the county
Compared to the very city
None
Compared to a county that belongs to the big Los Angeles, right?
Yes, well, here it is like two or three centuries back, the information in the news is that crime is decreasing in Los Angeles.
The crime is decreasing
Yes it's decreasing I can't say specifically the statistics but the police in this city of Los Angeles was saying that crime is at
Is more than two three years ago, so is better here.
Now it is better. A Question that comes to mind is from an article I read two days ago.
That is about the problem with immigration from Mexico. What do you think of the wall they want to erect between the border of the United States?
Hi Lurders, from New york.
RODRIGO FROM NEW YORK.
Have you ever been in a jury?
No, never. You?
Yes. They called me for service but they didn't pick me and the other time they called me for a civil case
And I was serving like ten days for a dispute of eh a renter with the owner of the building where he was living.
I was never so but I think that sometimes that is too much
I understand you perfectly because the truth is that the time that we spent waiting to be picked up was more that they time we had to serve, right?
You want to participate?
No what happens is that if you don't participate, they arrest you. Because by law you have to serve.
Yes that is true.
It's not an option.
Whether you want to or not.
I think it is important, but I do not prefer the system
Democratic?
The whole system of picking the jurors is so slow
Yes.
And takes up so much time that then of course anyone loses interest in serving, right?
JURY DUTY IS WASTE
Exactly.
But what you're talking about doing
If the system was a bit faster and the selection was a process less tedious, it will be a lot easier for people
To participate, right?
I don't know, and yea.
I think the other thing would be, for example, the civil case that I had. At the end of the jury
I gave the same amount of money to both parts. They cancelled the lawsuit and countersuit, right?
What's the problem, what were they fighting about, what was the dispute
The person who was renting the apartment
Yea
Wasn't happy with the apartment's conditions. Because on the first floor there was a pizzeria
None
The way that it was built the apartment it had concrete floors and that meant that in the winter the apartment was really cold and in
Summer it was really hot and but the way that they argued both sides
None
To the jury it seemed like the lawsuit was frivolous
Right, but the good thing is that he won.
And so
Sides came to an agreement
Both sides won both sides lost because they both had to pay but the amount of money that it was the same
At the end it all cancelled itself out, it ended up as zero. And that was the way for the jury to say that your case didn't have any merit.
Shut up and go to your homes.
Many civil lawsuits in this country are frivolous.
Waste time
Time. Time that costs money to sustain in the judicial system for some of these cases that have no actual merit,
It's a shame
Lets see.
The cases that are worth it and the frivolous cases get mixed up and you can't
The ones that really need the
Well
Justice? They can't get it in time. And the other things you said? They are meaningless. They're just there taking space.
Right
I don't, like i told you, i have never been called and i hope they never call me either. I don't
Really
I wouldn't like to take part in that, because I don't have time to lose. So I wish I didn't have to take part in it.
None
You say, if you get called
Or
You have to go
There was a girl serving with me in the juries.  They sent the Marshall to find her at home.
None
It was the third time they had called to participate and serve on a jury and didn't want to.
The first time and the third time you go to jail.
The third's time the charm. But you already know that tomorrow it will arrive by mail
Yes.
Your first your first order of if you go to a jury because whomever doesn't like the case be careful what you wish for.
Don't say this.
None
What?
But look I think that again if the system was if they would fix the system so it wouldn't be so it would be a little more
I think it makes sense because at the end the jurors, the ones that trying to guarantee that there are people like us, right?
That are the ones evaluating the cases, that there's interest created of seeing what touches one to the other, do you understand me?
Of course it's true.
He doesn't want what, baby
Is it your kid?
Yes.
Is it a boy or no?
It's a boy yes.
None
He's nine months old.
Little. I'm talking on the cellular because I'm in the train.
Really?, from the street
Yes, yes
Okay.
I hope that is not cut also
If they don't realize
I don't remember, are those 12 minutes?
There are 12 minutes, yes
Yes, we're missing like 5
Diego my love, please don't cry, what happens so many times with juries is that there is something that
Sometimes, in the example, there are technical things of science, for example, not everyone understands
No
And then, for example at the OJ Simpson trial, there was evidence against him, scientific evidence of DNA and all that
It was conclusive, and that man was guilty
Yes
The people in the jury had no knowledge of the science that was being explained.
Anything they said, that evidence wasn't valid, because the DNA is something that
Is 100% different for each person, Some Technic that you might not understand, and they make the result to be
Not necessarily good and the people in a jury, are persons that are not researchers and not necessarily have
A well  background in science and anyway I don't know if the thing is know clearer it won't because well
No, that's true, Hello?
Pardon? Look, the call
Yes
Hello?
I will stick here to talk right my first call, this is my very first one
Is this your first call?
Yes, and yours?
I've already made ten or eleven
Really?
Yes, he is
So
Because you get to know a lot of people, and sometimes you may get the same person so you can somehow continue the converstaions. are you still there?
I hope it doesn't cut off.
Hello, Roberto? Baby say hello
Hello
Good afternoon. This is Mickey.
Good afternoon Micky. My name is Juan.
Hello Juan
How are you?
Very well and you?
Fine too, I'm in San Antonio, Texas. Where are you?
I have never talked to someone in Texas, I am in Florida
We are not that far away
Yes, not so far away
No
No, what do you think about the subject for today, justice and all that?
Yes I have a question, in this case, the system of Justice based in
Yes
Does this jury system exist outside the United States? This is my question, do you know it?
I think
I think it exists in some
I know that in my country
None
I don't know what country you come from
From Mexico.
No, I don't know the laws in Mexico, I'm a lawyer and I know that
None
I'm Dominican.
None
And
There you have it
Yes
There are juries, OK.
Yes
You can make a comparison between how well it functions in your country, if it functions
Yes it's the same, a bit the same, an but they've never called me, only on time and for me it's something I take seriously, since I'm the first
Citizen in my family and as a lawyer I think that it's something important.  Each person has a civil duty to help the system
In my country and here in the United States the justice system is never perfect.
None
It's my part to contribute a little bit, no.
Yes
But I know that they asked me. I went, and they quickly told me that they didn't need me because many times they don't want lawyers on juries
None
I would happily like to help but I can't
That was in your country or here
That was no here
Listen
Here in the United States
But  I think it's a system that works in a very ideal way, very adequate for some matters, but the question is if
Does that system work the same way in the Dominican Republic as it does here?
Yes,
Is it just as efficient and effective?
Yes same as over there, or same as here the system works this way, I mean that they get a jury, each defendant deserves or has the right to a jury
For any crime. A serious crime is serious. The conviction can be more than a year.
Before that's if it's a crime very
None
Small or if a youth steals a candy from a store or something that it's worth more than five hundred dollars that type of crime no he goes to jail
He goes for a few months and no that youth wouldn't have
No
If for, but for others even hitting someone in a party, they have the right because sometimes hitting someone if that person gets sick
In the mind they deserve a jury, and it depends no because in my country and here
None
Normally is a jury of twelve people and they try to get someone  from different environments so that they don't have their own prejudice.
But that's where the problem is. No, for example, let's say it's an extreme case.
Yes, a girl was raped
Yes
Most of the people will feel really angry against the defendant
Yes
It's possible he's innocent, and that's why there's a process here and there in the United States, but it's very hard
Yes
Even in the, what makes the system imperfect is that many times everybody finds about what goes in the newspaper
Yes
And we use the Internet a lot, and that's why, because of the technology we are more aware of what's happening.
Right
And the system here is made not to include, if there is something in that same example, if a girl was raped and it was on the news
In the country, in television, the radio, the web, it's very hard to find someone that didn't. They say it wasn't stained.
Right
For all that and they go
If you already have a previous opinion on that
That's very hard, because they try
Right, that
What's in that example, they move the case, if this case is in Texas, they say no, too many people is involved, angry
There have been protests and we'll move this to California, but even there, they know about it, it's hard nowadays right?
Yes
I'm talking too much, what do you think?
It's that you know more about it, that's why i started with a question
Right
Right? I thought that, I think that in many cases the system itself doesn't work if it's not supported on a cultural matter of the population
Like you said.
Yes
If a population is easily vulnerable
Yes
As to the influence of the media, the systen itself can't be very closed because of the media influence.
Yes
So, that's part of the precaution that must exist? so the first thing i thought is that if the system really works, the system itself
Yes
That for what it's worth, it's a democratic system, of democratic representation of the justice, but it has its logic
Yes
Of the limits, right? that it can have
Sure, in many cases, yes
In the century. But at the same time, there is no perfect system. And sometimes the authoritarian system
The way he salomonically thinks.
Yes
Like in the case of Mexico, it's very prone to corruption
Yes, yes
No
Sure
In Mexico's case, there is great corruption in the justice systems
Sure
The judges always tend to, in very, in very important cases, to make decisions that go against what the very people thinks justice is
Yes, my country is the same, yes
Right?
In this country, the corruption is
Right
The cover up for corruption is the money
It's been over teen years, that a football athlete, OJ Simpson, was charged of murdering his wife, right?, and he
Right
He had a  lot of money, and everybody thinks he was guilty
Exactly
He killed his wife
Exactly
Yes, and that case shows there is a lot of imperfection, he had a lot of money, he had millions
Right
In his case and that's why, i think that had a lot of influence, and since he was famous, a lot of people felt sorry for him
Yes
At the same time part of the system is that one hundred percent of the jury has to have a very pure certainly
None
There in, pardon in this case it was because of a technical issue, no
It was because they had doubts
Not exactly
When the jury privately votes they have to be 100% sure.  If one person has doubt, it changes ...
Yes
Doesn't occur, but they thought since the glove didn't fit
None
They had doubts that perhaps it wasn't him, I think it was two men in the way that they killed it was very serious, they lifted a man, they took off his head, but
None
They had doubts and as an attorney I understand that if they had even an iota of doubt they can't find him guilty, also because the police made mistakes
The cops
Yes
They stepped on the blood.  They found that man's blood in the car, but since they damaged that
Yes
It can be used
An excess was there.
In that
That was really an excess.
Yes
From the jury
Yes
I guess that in most cases they have some doubts
Yes
I think no
Yes
That there's always a small percentage of doubt in all cases, right
Yes, that's why laws exist.
In this case, money helped
Yes
Would decide the outcome and not
Yes, that's right
I'm still talking about this example, but the fact is that the system is not perfect
No
But it still works a bit better than other systems that are authoritarian
Yes.
Where a judge decides, right
Yes, I agree because, I don't remember myself but my parents told me that in my country, they don't have the history of Mexico of course, all countries are corrupted by the history here shows that democracy in their country
It's wider, it's older, and well, my parents suffered a lot in my country when there was no democracy, there was a dictator and that's why i can only
Compare it to when there really was no jury. There was nothing like that system from the fifties.
Right
I can thank the system for that, but it also has flaws.
There have been many cases of murdering someone and he says No, I didn't kill the guy
You can't understand him because he doesn't speak English very he's Hispanic
Right
Many times, now and in the past, the lawyers pick people from the jury that aren't hispanic. And, the court has been finding that it isn't
No, it's unfair because they have to find sympathetic people for the jury.
Yes
He's saying that he wasn't in that place and like that, many other go to jail that are innocent too
Right, like now in the Simpson case
Yes
The crime and justice system problems obey many complex circumstances
Yes
Sometimes i think about the case of Simpson, maybe he was guilty
Yes
And the system declares him not guilty, and what we could expect is that the guy would behave.
Right
I mean, yeah, maybe he is guilty.
Oh well
In some other cases, the same system has declared innocent a guy that is going to kill, rape or do some other things.
Yes, unfortunately
So
Hello, Good Afternoon!
Hello I'm Arthur, calling from New York
Hello I'm Mayra and I'm talking from Texas
Where are you from originally
How are you? Hello from Mexico City but right now I'm in Texas in fact I live in Philadelphia, but I'm on vacation in San Antonio
Ah, from the D.F. Very good, very good. I lived in the D.F. for a while.
Where?, really, how long?
I was living in the D.F. Two years in '85 and '86 and then from '97 to '98.
Alright, and what did you think? yes?
No, I like it, the problem is safety.
The only problem is that they have not fixed prior pollution issues.
Really?
It's not as bad as in the eighties. In the eighties it was quite bad
Yes, I remember. Traffic does still exist for the
Yes listen, and where are you from?
I'm Chilean
None
The topic of the day is the jurors.  Have you ever gotten to be a juror?
Yes no and I don't think I'll get to because I'm not an American citizen
Yes is true, I think that you have to be a citizen
Yes, have you had to?
I had to once, what happens is that I'm also American. I was born in Wisconsin
Okay
Hold the double nationality then yes one time I had to, they called me to do jury duty and well it was quite boring all that honestly, it was a lot of waiting, wasting time and at the end look that I got a case that I was interested in, I was interested in being one of the jurors
Okay
They didn't pick me, I don't even know why they told ne thank you very much
Only one the attorneys they have the right, for example, like fifty people arrive
None
And then they call them one by one, and they give you a paper form. You fill out the whole form, and they see it, and they can as you questions and start eliminating
Any of the two attorney's can eliminate a juror and
Listen and on what basis do they eliminate, only if they think is a good idea or not? or how is it?
There's no rule that limits it because they can eliminate him because is
On the forms they ask you all types of things like are you the husband of an official.
Okay
For example
Okay
What do you think of the death penalty, things about, they can ask you a thousand things and basically what they want to see is which is the jury that would be most advantageous to them
Okay
Then a district attorney can want, for example, someone who's related to a cop, a wife, a mother of a cop when an attorney for the defense would never want that!
Yess
For example, a woman that was beaten and they are accusing a man I say that the prosecutor will want for the jury to be women.
None
Those kind of things right? It's trying to think how a person in the jury will think. What do you think of the jury system in general?
I was going to ask you how you think the system works because it seems you can practically change the trail will proceed depending on the jury you choose.
Because I've seen the last scandalous trials there were of the CEOs of various companies
Yes
Two that were identical, and the men had done exactly the same thing, but one chose for the trial to take place in the county, and the other chose in New York
Yes okay
One they gave him, one came out innocent and the other was found guilty and with a sentence of I don't know how many years and it really just was, I mean, they were analyzing it in the Economist which is the magazine that I see
They were saying that yes, that the only real difference was that the lawyers of one were sharper and chose in other words the right place and the right jury
It just depends on what attorney you have
That's how the justice system is here, justified by calling it an adversary system
The idea is that they are competing like a tennis match or a football game okay?
None
One team and the other, and the prosecutor team against the defense and the idea is well each one, I mean
It's supposed that in general is going to come out good but I don't think that the system is designed so that there's never a mistake, and that you are completely right and the example is: one single jury, one single person
Can decide that no and the whole trial has to be done again, because one person says that no
Yes
That person could of have been eliminated from the other lawyer, it happens a lot. Randomly it cannot be controlled, and is part of the system.
Generally it's supposed to work
He also does well because lawyers charge
No? If it will make the difference between being guilty or innocent, better to pay whatever
This true, and the most important, for example, I have a friend who was stopped because, I don't know, he was speeding, and he had drunk a little bit of alcohol and here you don't know how strict they are here
None
They are exaggerated with drinking and driving.
Yes, a lot
Yes a tragedy, they arrested him. Just imagine the fine, it's five thousand dollars.
But after you're up, and they've left you suspended without a license, and it stays on your record after
Wow
The insurance costs you an arm and and a leg.  Insuring cars is a huge problem.  Aside from this, there will be costs. He is paying almost $5,000
To get a better lawyer, and with a better lawyer in the case of driving drunk.
None
It really works
Well
Well, I hope a little bit,yes, I think that in the cases,well, in all the cases look at the case of O.J. Simpson you can also see that
There are also many people who say that the jury system didn't work.
Yes
Because he had such a good lawyer who was Johnny. They elected the place where they did it and number of blacks that they had on the jury. People say that
This was an injustice, I don't know, I think that sometimes you don't know, and the job is only a way to try to guess
None
And we can't know if he is or is not guilty
Listen, and compared to the Chilean system, for instance, how is the Chilean? is it like all the other where you are only judged by the judge alone and he is the one who
Decides and pronounce the penalty?
I don't know the Chilean system well because I've never lived in Chile.
OK
So I can't tell you but I don't remember how it was in Mexico, although I lived in Mexico I don't know how the system is there either
It's like this, you don't even have - trials are not open in general, everything is acrrief out with the audience only
None
There is no jury, you just declare in front of the judge, and the judge is the one to pass at the end, to decide whether you are innocent or guilty
And he pronounces the penalty, and that's it but I have seen that you can appeal everything
Sure
So even if you are declared guilty you can spend the next years appealing and there is no difference, you just have to keep paying your attorneys to keep doing the paperwork, it's quite funny.
Well, I think it's the same everywhere, where you can appeal, I think you can appeal in most of the places
What do you think, is a person who studied law and is paid to determine guilt the best to make the decision?
Do you think it's a better system where an average citizen is part of a group who takes a decision?
I don't know what's better, honestly. If I had the resources, it would be more convinient using a jury.
The one which citizens pay. Because then I can actually decide what is going to happen. Otherwise I would resort to the system which I find more fair, where a judge is the one who knows, and
The cases will be presented to only him, and he will take the decision.
I think
That is what we use in Mexico and I don't know how well it works, you can convince the judge to say whatever you want
None
Yes, it's easier that way, it's cheaper, I guess, than to buy the whole jury.
Sure. If you know a person and they've picked him to be on the jury, to have contact with him will be difficult.
Professional jurors would be an example.
That would be a great idea.  I think they are able to be mailed.
None
A jury of normal citizens and you just have to control the news media, you can make everybody have an opinion
I see, and with that you can influence the jury's decision, there's no problem.
That's what I think, I believe that, that's what happens when you have a very specific way of interpreting the law, I mean, just like a lawyer
None
To have I mean to pass a test with certain questions so that you have so that you are deemed capable and logical
None
To know more then the average citizen about statistics you need to clearly understand DNA  for the test . Example the different kinds of isotopes .
LOTS MORE
Yes.
It would be like any other job.
Are they going to be picked, not by the lawyers, to change the system a bit
None
Just a bit so that instead of picking a normal person they would pick someone that went to school to be a part of a jury
Tamara

Alright
We got married last year but, we got married to get the visa.
How nice
Yes because he had a biologist's visa, he's a biologist
Okay
He could be here for three years. We got married and he gave it to me, too.
That's great
We are here until he renews, it and the moment that it's renewed I'm going to be much better. I'm happy, I'm working in a hospital.
For animals
How great, aye, how cool
Yes, in New York there's the biggest hospital.
None
Biggest veterinary hospital, but we won't go to New York
Boston is good
Yes, it's cold
Yes, pretty much
Yes,
Here too
And you liked the move from Mexico to New York?
None
Why not?
Because everything stresses that
Yes, because there's too much competition
There's a lot of competition, There are a lot of people
Yes
There's a lot of people where I come from.
Yes
Here's like more hip public transportation, not so much being in the car like that.
Yes
In Mexico is my whole family, all my friends.
How is the music scene in Mexico. They come out with good bands, but how many of them start and don't make it?
The problem in Mexico is that everything is super centralized.
Sure
There are only two groups and one singer that stick.
Sure
That they support
Yes,
I mean there's only one thing, wel there there's more support but the competition is much more fierce
Sure
The truth I see it the same. There in Mexico I know many people in the medium which that helps me a lot
You have contact? contacts like to record and producers
I produce my own stuff.
None
I'm about to print my first record.
Oh, really nice.
I'm doing that alone, all of that
Yes
But I do know many people in the media that can help me
But, it's alernative pop, like Thalia
No, it's more alternative
Oh, nice.
Yes
Well,
Yes. I would send you a website, for you to listen, and then you can give me your opinion
I would love that. Can I write you back?
Yes.
If you send me the page
I can send you an email.
Nice
WITH A LINK AND THE PAGE, THEN YOU CAN CHECK THAT AND YOU CAN WRITE ME BACK
Cool cool
How nice that I met you, dude.
Yes.  When we are in New York, perhaps we'll go see you play
You came here a lot?
No, I've never gone. I've only been here nine months.
Okay
I was taking exams in March of last year.
Okay
I never had time to travel but I want to.
You should take a trip.
Yes, I want to visit New York, everybody tells me that it's beautiful.
It's fun
But I also have to travel to DF, I have a friend, a very good friend of mine, Argentinian that lives over there
There are many Argentinians
And many actors
A lot of the emigrated
She, her boyfriend is an actor
Okay
And she says there are a lot of Argentinian actors.
It's incredible the amount of Argentinians that are in the DF
Yes
Impressive
There were even main actors in the Argentinean soap operas.
Yes, They're a bit better looking than the
They change their accent
They're better looking than the Mexicans So they stay
No, they Mexicans are good looking too
In general the Argentinians are better looking
But don't you hate the Argentinians a bit?
How?
Are you not a bit mad at the Argentinians?
What happens is that they are taking many jobs from the Mexicans and it's not like we're doing so well
Yes Sure
Some people are bothered bt I studied in a school where there were so many Argentinians Over there in Mexico
What?
I mean like all my life I've been with I have had Argentinian friends
Sure
I feel that
They never bothered you.
No
THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE I'VE HEARD MANY JOKES OF MEXICANS, I MEAN IN MEXICO JOKES ABOUT ARGENTINIANS
I do know that.
I used to travel to Brazil a lot and I never had any problems.  No one in Brazil did anything to me because of my Argentinian origin, but when I went to live in Israel
Everybody hated the Argentinians
In Israel too
Yes, not all the Israelis, no, the Hispanics, Hispanics hated the Argentinians, I couldn't understand why.
Hey
Yes, I never had any problems in Brazil, nobody said anything to me
None
None
They all go to live there
None
The Jews in Mexico have a lot of money so, I don't know
Okay but in general, the Hispanic Jews well
They are immigrants and they have a different ideology.
You, being a Jew, if you go to Israel you can
None
Work and  do all kinds of things, right?
Yes, we the Jews, we have it's like a law, I mean, Israel has the Law of Return, which means that all Jews can go back to
Israel and apply for citizenship
Oh wow!
So it's really cool because when when you start at the 19 and you don't have any money I left when I was 19 years old and I didn't had any money
But that support you and they pay you University for three years
You studied there?
Yes, they help you.
Wow
And so, it was really good for me
It's really cool
But that depends on people. I wasn't around Latins that much, but between Latins is a lot of hate.
I see
There was a lot of hate, with Argentina
Hi, good day
Hi
Hi, Good afternoon, my name is Carolina
Hi, My name is Miriam
How are you, Miriam?
How are you? Where are you calling from?
From New York
From New York, okay, I'm in Toronto, Canada
That's nice
Yes
None
About the question, the topic
Justice
What's your opinion, Miss, about justice?
Well, as they say, here in Canada, in Justice, I imagine that in Canada
It's the same, They find a jury of 10, 14 people to select a case, and then you are called, from the area
Yes,
You have to go to circlair office
None
Two times, two chances, but when you get there, they have to select, I remember some opportunity. Am I hearing some noise back there?
Sorry?
The, what was, did you hear a noise behind you?
Yes, it's my son who's fighting with the other.
None
Yea, big son.
Yes. What they do here is select the jury, to be able to qualify. For example, when I went, I was working at an insurance company.
So I wasn't qualified.
Why would an insurance company not be qualified?
Sure, because like, since I worked for an insurance company, it wasn't good to choose me, because I already have
I know a lot about a person, how treating us and what we say in the case
Someone lived in a house, and I went there, well we always had to
None
Try to tie up and to
Yes yeah
It wouldn't clean the case.
None
So if one already had a compromise, some profession that hid something, then they took you out.
I see
Yes, for example, the other opportunity, the second time i was working for a nursing company, and they didn't accept me, either.
Neither have you.
No, I mean, it depends on what work you do, to qualify for insurance.
I see
For me, for the jury.
For the jury.
The truth is, I wouldnâ€™t want to be part of a jury, itâ€™s a bit hard.
I think so
They are made up of fourteen people, so, they all have to reach a decision, I'd rather don't. As of now, I have a problem with
The court because my son was murdered
Oh mam, I'm so sorry.
I had just turned six months and they will sentence the guy who did it if they catch him.
They've destroyed my life.
Yes, I can see that.
They've destroyed the life of my whole family, I think I will never be the same person again, they've completely changed my life.
None
He's a drug addict, he's nineteen years old.
None
He apparently tried to rob my son
That is even worse.
He had a gun and he ended his life in a second.
No, that's so horrible!  in your personal experience, believe that there's no justice?
I don't think so because I've worked as a translator, too, for the courts.
None
One of my friends used to work at children's court
Yeah
One of my friends, she had to witness a sad case in which the husband took a girl from her mother, but the father, he was a white cop and she was Hispanic.
He had a lot of influence
None
He had lots of money, he would use his influences so that she'd look like trash.
None
Her seven year old was taken
In the United States, this happens a lot.  I am going to tell you something.  In Canada, we do have things like that happening but they hide them.
It's a bit more democratic still.
None
But the Canadian system is getting corrupted.
None
However, if a newspaper find out about it, or if they know that a judge had favored someone,
Sure. Yes.
But
There's no justice, no, I mean, the truth is that, I say, my son is going to rest in peace when the man that killed him is trialed, no
Just imagine, I
Yes
As a mother, the only thing I ask for is justice. I ask for the Lord to make justice.
And
And that this scoundrel, that they end his life, that they kill him, no. That he pays for
He pays.
That he pays from year to year no.
Sure, because
And another thing that they have here, imagine, that justice is this, that this was a boy who wasn't more than nineteen years old. My son already was twenty four.
A young boy.
Yes, you know this guy
So
Imagine that they give him twenty five years. So imagine, when he gets out, he will get out at forty five.
Sure
He's still a young man, no.
None
He will get out and return to doing the same.
Will be allowed out for the time he was in isolation.
They say that there, in the prison is makes you worse, no.
Yes, well imagine,  they don't give rehabilitation.
Exactly, and no. After is he behaves well,
None
He can get out in seventeen years.
I can imagine
Get out in seventeen years for what? To go out and kill someone else?
None
NO,DON'T YOU SEE THAT THEY ARE RAISED WITH THAT HATE INSIDE
What a shame, right? Yes
I only ask for justice. I hope although he already confessed that yes, that he killed him. But he comes, that guy comes from a family of killers
His brother is another killer.
Really
The father is a drug addict, the mother is
He has to be human, I mean, right
It's really a family unfortunately of
What a shame that anyone that crossed his path , God doesn't punish
Imagine. Imagine if
Was he your only son ma'am?
My only son, because I have a daughter too.
What a shame.
But you know that for me to have my son I suffered so much.
None
I had many problems, and I always said that he, no, my child and the truth, I loved him so much that everyone told me that I gave to much love to my son
No.
He was all to me. And the child was very lovely.
None
He was a boy but, imagine, he told me, I got divorced when my son was three, and I never married again
None
I have lived only for my children. I never brought a man to my house.
None
I have worked, I gave them the best I always took them to Catholic schools and tried to gave them the best no. And so, but my son was a very lovely child, a very good one.
He was with a girl - around six years. They want to marry but them two were at college. Imagine that the girl was completely destroyed.
What a shame.
Her family loved so much my son. So may lives my son has touched. everybody tell me that he was an angel, because the truth as he was my son, and the way he is remembered, it is
Incredible, no.
I am sorry, Madam.
Imagine, you donÂ´t know.
The only thing that I could tell you is to take refuge in God. At knowing him, you are going to
I ask so much to God
So much
I tell you he knows why he did it, to take my son in that way. In a, imagine. And so, what am I going to do, but until know I cannot believe my son is death, I tell you.
Oh God
It is
How sad
It's very hard, and yesterday was six months that they took him away from me.
Six months
People say with time it passes, it will never pass.
No, never
That is For me
Sure
None
How do you call it?
I always remember the moment they came to give me the news, and today
My God how horrible. How horrible.
I don't wish that on anyone.
No. Definitely.
But there I go, praying, and how it says like the
Do you go to church?
Yes, I go to church.
Sure, find refuge there and you will see that
None
You will find comfort reading the bible
Yes, I think that only for believing so much in God and for having faith in God is why I'm alive. Because I, my first moment was
I imagine
When I wanted to died together with my son. And I'll tell you that now, before I said, I don't want to die. Now I say, yes, my God, I've given my life to the Lord.
Lord,save me to find my son, because I think that my son is calling for me
Yeah
I always live with the thought of him
What a shame.
On the other hand I also think about my daughter
Yeah
Poor thing I say, what will become of my daughter.
She's younger?
She's already twenty two. But she's studying at college
You have to be strong for her
None
She will lose her mom, too.  This would be really hard for her.  She will only fail you.
Yes
If you weaken
None
Because now she's in college you say, she needs to be strong
None
To move forward in their studies
Yes
Otherwise, she would fall into perdition.  The pain would be too hard for her.
Yes
Get strong
None
Grow stronger and keep getting shelter in God.
Yes
That everything goes to help her in her pain
None
It's an irreparable mistake in my opinion
None
You can imagine no one will ever replace that.
None
That's a shame lady, what you say there's no human justice, god's justice, do you think it exists?
I think so, because they say that sooner or later.
Right
Right? God squeezes, but doesn't suffocate. I think that some day, if not human justice, it will have
That's what's a shame, right?, all the bureaucracy there is, and, and when the judges sell themselves, imagine that
Different
THEY TOOK FROM MY FRIEND,HER DAUGHTER
Yeah
And imagine, and she who's a good woman. The man is rotten, who has even abused but with him, with the power of money, forget it.
The power of money is more powerful than anything.
It's true. Yes
Yes
Honestly, I stopped believing in human justice a long time ago.
Me too
I've also sought refuge in God.
None
Because already you see too much injustice, too much corruption. I'm from Peru. And in
Hello good afternoon
Hello, good afternoon. Who am I speaking with?
Nickey's speaking and you?
Oh I'm Jorge I'm talking from Los Angeles, California
Really far
And where are you from Nicky?
I'm calling from Florida
What part of Florida
From Orlando
Look how nice, how's everything
Very good and from what I see better than Los Angeles unfortunately
Why do you say better than Los Angeles?
In the news, the weather in Los Angeles, the rain and everything
OH NO BUT EVERYTHING IS FINE NOW
I'm glad
What Los Angeles has is that it rains a lot, a lot, a lot but then it stops, if you hear a strange noise is
None
Because I'm doing that we have to make those five calls.
Yes, me too.
Extras no this is the first that I'm making
None
I have just had my lunch. I'm calling from the terrace of a Burger King.
From my cell phone, there may be a lot of noise because there is traffic passing
Sure
So, happy new year to you
The same to you, the same, and what do you think about the subject for today?
The subject for today is justice.
Yes
IÂ´ve never been part of a jury yet
No
I've never been part of a jury, Nicky. not
Not Mickey with em
What?
My name is Nickey, with an en
Em, me Micky OK Micky
En, like Nicolas
Micky mouse, it's an em?
Nickey, have you ever heard that?
Nicky, en, like Nicloas, yes, yes
Yes
Yes, Nicky. Where do you have your Spanish from? What is your origin?
I
Exactly, how nice and interesting
You can see and tell
Dominican Republic, very interesting we were talking about justice
You would like to go why
Interesting, for what they pay you.
Sure
Because they really don't pay you anything but
No, no
Is very little but for the experience isn't it right
Yes
I've yet to go perhaps eventually I'll get to go, have you gone?
Yes, I got to go but they immediately dismissed me, I don't know is very like they always say is something of numbers that they call and ultimately
I happily went because I though  at last I can I thought and I'm an idealist and I thought that it's something that's a civic duty
I gladly wanted to do it, but I am a lawyer and the will know immediately.
You're a lawyer.
Yes they find out and want to throw me out
You're a lawyer
Yes sir
Oh how nice with your title here of
Yes
From Florida?
Yes I just moved from Massachusetts and I'm going to take the exam of my, for my license here in Florida in February
How interesting in what area of law basically
It's not the topic.
It's interesting because I never got to talk on the phone with a lawyer in what area but it has to do with justice
Yes, sure is something, really
What area Nicky?
I do consultations with all religions in this country for organizations in Europe and Africa. I've also worked for their rights
Very good
The Muslims, the Mormons, the Catholics, the Jews, et cetera.
Very interesting.
Yes
What was, the topic today is basically if I understood correctly is about the jury
None
What other question have you basically done.
If you think is a perfect system, if it would interest you
The judicial system
Yes
From United States if it is a perfect system, you have to ask mother of God mother of God what a perfect issue, okay very interesting because I am talking to a lawyer, wow
First we would have to Define what Perfection is
Yes
None
Yes
I donÂ´t think such a thing called perfection could exist.
Yes. I agree
Now if we are going to talk about perfection we are talking basically okay the perfection at a human level does not exist.
Yes
None
The jury system, right.
The jury system is something I honestly donÂ´t know much about.
No. There was no appropriation.
Yes
No, really, I don't know Nicky, the only thing I know is that sometimes I have heard there are people that do that work
Yes
Those are who choose the members of the jury right. I donÂ´t know if I have. That was what I heard
Yes, I agree with the system, even if democracy is not perfect.
I think things and systems like that,as i am an idealist, always hope to try to improve
Of course.
And it has problems, and I do think that there have been many innocent people who have gone to jail, the same way that there have been criminals
Who have been found innocent in the jury system. I would love to do my duty, but I do know it's not perfect
Sure
The man crimed for looking
He works harvesting grape
Yes
He is being accused of killing somebody and he hardly speaks English and he wants to say that he was not in such place
He won't accept jury members who are grape harvesters, he won't accept people from the country of the man, he won't accept
People or men who work as farmers in general, while the other side will look for people who work as farmers, right? Because the will understand
The job, if he says no I was working for twelve hours and one says how is that possible
Yes
He can explain well I understand. Life is hard in that month ? And that is the problem, because often the two attorneys fight about it
What happens is that it ends up being a jury of people who have no prejudice
Such place often are fond juries in which no member is from
None
That can be a prejudice. Yes, I have seen times when the accused is a Hispanic.
The state attorney will try to pick people for the jury who are not hispanic, although he knows that is illegal
Because it's a prejudice but this practice does happen, and that is unfair too because you'd like to choose people who can understand
In general, without prejudices, but can understand in general, how does that person work, and they can be what they call objective, although I don't think that is possible
Things like this
You are right.
Someone that doesn't know about it. For example, the man you say grows grapes.
Yes
How is one expected to be on a jury if you don't know the issue. For example, this man and I don't know anything about growing grapes.
You are so right.
Yes but at the same time that's the system they have, they'd tell the judge that you are a perfect candidate to be on that jury because they want people that
Handle both sides and they are going to explain the issue in a basic way so that anyone can understand it, they know we don't know everything about the world, right? they would want to have people than can't be
Impressed that they can understand the issue. You;d be perfect for it because you've got no prejudice, you're not a spy, and no one in your family has that same job.
And then you could see both sides of the story. I understand both sides. unfortunately, it's a burden that I, as a lawyer, have to carry because I have to pay attention to both sides of an argument.
That's why you are a lawyer, that's your job but it's so interesting, as I tell Nickey, it's the first time, he had never had a chance
Yes,
He speaks to people when I get this calls, maybe it's the same people with different professions but no
Yes
I had never spoken to a lawyer
Yes
The subject is interesting.
Do you think that for example, the system, most of the time, do you have a similar system in your country Argentina?
Is it a fair system?
Well
When someone is found guilty I'm sure that's part of justice or is it something like, I've seen that in this country, sometimes money influences the decisions.
Of course, of course, it does affect, and in Argentina
Yes, good night, this is Patricia, who am I talking to?
Good night, this is Nancy. Patricia, how are you?
Where are you from, where do you live?
I'm from Colombia and I live in New York
I see, I'm from Panama and I live in Delaware.
None
What do you think about the justice system, Nancy?
I don't really agree with it. They make mistakes, and they create more injustice
They should really stick to the justice is blind quote
None
But, apparently, obviously, if you have money, you get the chance to have better legal representation unlike if you are poor.
If you don't have money to pay for a lawyer.
Exactly, you better say goodbye, you forget about the issue.
If you get a public defender it's not going to be the same
You notice this from what is shown in television, the proof of that is that ninety per cent of people that are in jail, at leas in this country,
They are, minorities, people of color or Hispanics.
Yes, that's right
Sure,
They say it isn't that way, it's
Hey don't have money to hire an expensive lawyer
Yes
Have you ever been on a jury, either here or in Colombia
No I haven't been. Never.
None
Never and I would not Aguirre because, judging someone and someone you really don't know, and you try to know it
In the time the trial last.
Re-write
None
No
Yes
We have seen for example in the last Michel Jackson case
None
None of the juries was like him
No
None is like him
Sure, and they took the decision, that supposedly
Exactly, for
It was the right one
I thought that was political; the same happened with OJ Simpson when he killed a woman in California.
The same was, innocent
Exactly, everyone knew he was guilty.
He didn't commit anything,
And well, for political pressure, social pressure, the man is now free.
Yes, because, money,
When they found him guilty in the civil triat that her parents brought against him.
Yes.
How is it that in one trial you're innocent, and in the other you'll be guilty of the same crime.
Yes, either you're guilty or innocent at the same time
Exactly, so it's not the fact of guilt or innocence, but his trail taught us that the card called, How do they say it in Spanish?
Reasonable doubt.
That the
Where, where the only thing the lawyers have to say, and they don't have to demonstrate that their clients are innocent, they only have to plant it in
The minds of the jurors,
That
Reasonable doubt and that's it.
He's ready to get out
Everything was ready.
Yes
How many people are getting out now who are innocent with these new DNA tests
Yes
The ADN have now realized that many people that have been put to jail are innocent.  They have killed many who are innocent.
I served a jury when I lived in Florida.
But
To me, it was an exhausting experience, it left my nerves very altered, and I am not a nervous person
Yes
It was about a guy, the police had made a raid in the house where he was at that moment
None
Because he sold stone
Precious stones?
He sold drugs
None
The police did that raid and he was there at that moment, he didn'y live there
It was a coincidence
SO, NOT COINCIDENCE, THEY MADE THEM ENTER THE BATHROOM ONE BY ONE TO SEARCH ON THEM, TO SEE IF THEY HAD ANY WEAPONS OR DRUGS
And when they finished searching they found a piece of rock beside his shoe
None
Beside, not inside. There had been other people before him
None
That had been searched on, so there was no relevant evidence that it belonged to him, that it came out of his shoe. Because nobody had actually seen it
We let him go free
None
We knew he was guilty
Yes when there's something illicit and one stays,
Exactly, when there's smoke there's fire.
Is as guilty as
But that there were no concrete proofs and also because you hear a lot about police abuse that they do and undo whatever they want.
Yes because is terrible
We let the guy go free, we acquitted him.
Yes
They were only going to put him in jail, not execute him.
Look for me too
Yes they were going to punish
They were just going to take his freedom away. They weren't going to sentence him to life.
His guilt
Nor anything drastic like that.
None
It wasn't going to be the first time that this guy would be in jail, neither, he wasn't a saint.
He had two previous records.
Look girl, I'm going to tell you that after making that mistake of freeing that man. When they let us leave, I sat in the first seat I found and sat and cried like a cry baby.
It was the stress of thinking that the well-being of another person was in my hands.
Without knowing the family of this person
Exactly.
Who went
Without knowing the circumstances, so I also started to think, well, if this man doesn't care about his personal circumstances, because they are important to me.
None
I really feel this kind of person that I am not going to judge anyone, or scold anyone
Yes but
Without
Sure,
And it's a really big responsibility that you imagine if they call you a Judge. Like in the crime of the wife of OJ Simpson. Can you imagine this?
I imagine you would tear your hair out every day.
You go crazy.
None
Exactly, because then there are twelve people who have a ment- a different mentality, who have all come from different cribs. And in their houses they were taught different things
They have to get to a mutual agreement.
To have everyone make the same decision, no
Exactly and I understand them because the future of another human being is in your hands it's huge.
You don't know from here to tomorrow if someone is guilty, in reality, yes.
This is huge and you don't know what tomorrow will bring.
Because you don't know.
All the things the children might have thought about.
You sometimes feel that you are there and,
No, but I did, yes, I believe that in a jury, oh a jury would be more convenient than just having a judge decide.
Yes
No.
Yes.
With a jury, those people are not in your same economic, social or education circumstances but they have to convince the twelve of them.
You have a chance if you can convince one.
Exactly. Specially if you know you are innocent.
None
But you can't prove it.
Yes, That's the problem. I think that when you are there, looking at the person, you can see it in their eyes.
Other days.
Yes, you'd notice it, isn't it?
You can't, I don't know honey, well I just know that the guy that we had to trial
Look at that person
He was a first-level criminal. He couldn't hide it even if he wore a bag over his head. No matter how you'd dress him, he'd still look like a gangster.
You could see that he was guilty
None
But it's
She had a terrible face, but That day she was saved
Yes, but, who know more now?
A no girl, that's karma, you see
Yes, they become more grumpy
If you keep that, sooner or later bad things will happen
Yes, they say justice goes, but it arrives
Celestial justice
Justice, yes
I LIKE TO SEE FORENSIC MEDICINE
Yes
And they were broadcasting a show about a wife, her husband was sentenced for killing his mother in law and raping his nephew
He raped the eight year old nephew
Yes
At the end, 7 years later, the wife didn't give up because she knew her husband was innocent.
The women was able to get another trial
Other trial
Because DNA was more advanced
Yes
And the kid changed her opinion, admitting it wasn't her uncle.
Oh, God
Seven years of rotting in jail, knowing you haven't done a thing.
I can just imagine the bad things they'd do to you in jail
Exactly. That for example in this country, which doesn't happen in our countries, in this country, if they wrongly convict you and later a jury finds there was a mistake made
And the evidence is in your favor, they'll pay you for all of those years that you wrongfully spent in jail.
None
In our country, they don't worry about that.
They tell you see you later, get out.
Yes, exactly, if they even do that right.
Yes yea that happens a lot
But I do believe juries are a good idea.
Yes, some day it'll be my turn, I think about someone's family.
You know how they choose you to be on a jury.
No
When you vote?
Hello?
Hello, Aurelio
How are you? Manuel, I'm in Orlando, Florida.
Oh. How are you? I'm from Washington, DC
Mister Aurelio? Let's get into it
What's your name, again?
Manuel
Nice to meet you, Manuel.
Nice to meet you.
They have never picked me for a jury because I'm not yet an American citizen.
Correct.
They have already picked my wife and a lot of my friends several times.
Right.
The cases that they have dealt with is absurd.
These people are spending money in such absurd cases.
True.
A horrible thing
So much paraphernalia.
Exactly, yes. Is too much, is too much, yes. No yes. Have they picked you as
No, look I coincide with you. The exact same thing happened to me, they summoned me once, but I'm still not a citizen. So automatically
It was disabled to accept.
Sure.
That was in New York, because I lived in New York a few years.  Never again. Regarding what I think of the system,
I would say that it's good. But, I didn't know the truth, as you just finished telling me, is that there was, that they were, em
Doing all these paraphernalia for very silly cases.
Sure.
I thought that it was only for cases of homicides, or more serious cases.
No, the last case that my wife was called for was about a guy
This British that gave the finger there to a woman in traffic.
None
Imagine. yes, man. The woman took him to court, and they sentenced him. He had to pay a fine of
For an obscene gesture.
Exactly,
How can it be? And all of us paying for that? is that, look, what has been said, is a system that's already created
I talk about the justice system.
Sure.
That it includes many things, not only the, the, the part of the prosecutors, the judges, also the jails. So then, they need people so they can continue, well, living that way.
Sure.
There I would fully agree with you. It's incredible they are taking so much of our taxes, when a judge can perfectly have the preparation is obvious and logical.
To decide that in half an hour.
Sure. Without so much bother, like they say in your homelands, I would imagine that you are Colombian, judging by the accent.
Yes, yes.
Exactly, without so much, so much mehollo, man. Because, look, the, the first thing they'll spend forever doing, like, take three hours to select the jury, one of them being my wife, they chose her finally
Yes.
After the judge took about six hours deliberating. If it's one thing, if it's the other, that I just don't know, I don't know that, that maybe yes the man did it intentionally
What is an obscene gesture depends on the type of personality over here and there. They concluded that the guy was guilty of it
They fined him, they put him in jail for two days and a five thousand dollar fine.
Incredible. That was happening
I was left in shock. I said it can't be these people
Incredible. We run into each other often.
What do you think, what's your take?
That case was very relevant in ninety four.
OJ Simpson, yes
That seems to me to be a case that deserved that type of thing. Do you understand what I mean? Because it supposedly was relevant because the guy was famous. But,
Yeah
The guy
Yes it is very controversial
Exactly, including homicides. You know what I mean? Yeah, it's necessary that there be some sort of deep scrutiny. Something where they carefully evaluate all of the perspectives and everything that had happened. Yes, that was deserving of that kind of thing.
But, listen something like this
Even though, there like, I am also fully aware of the jury's conscience, in serious cases even though here, by what I've seen
It's very marked by the race factor. Don't you think?
Sure, of course.
Marked by the race factor.
Yes.  Although they say no, they always deny it.
No, they'll never recognize it.
No, they deny it but up to when already nobody dares to say anything, no, yes, it's true, look, they found him guilty because he's black.
No.
None
Nobody dares to say that. But, you see the things that happen on the television. You hear the national radio and those types of things.
You can clearly see, there is still racism. Many decisions are made at the racist level.
Yes back to the -OJ Simpson case, the race factor counted a lot, because the majority of the jurors, appeared to be black.
He was acquitted, found not guilty.
Exactly.
When to everybody it was more than evident this man's guilt.
Sure. I remember all the eviden
No because if it wasn't him, who? Why did the investigation stop? Why don't they continue investigating?
Exactly.
Until finding the guilty one
No, the guilty person was never found, is something
No, and things stopped there. I mean that, they, implied, they also concluded that he was guilty. But, they found him no
Yes
So there was a also a racial factor there. but in the other sense, they favoured their race
Of course, sure
That's very complicated.  It implies costs
Loss of money, for those who result, somehow, hidden
Sure, figure
Because the companies won't always compensate for that. And what they recognize isn't much I think
Yes, it's nothing, at all. A work mate was three days out of the job because of, of the so called jury duty.
None
They were really supportive with her
They treated her like if
Almost any company does, because they are not obliged to it
Yes. In this case and another case,
Not so absurd, but it wasn't worthy after all. It was a drugs affair. A guy they caught with drugs and many other things.
They were deciding whether he was guilty or not. It lasted for three days, figure.
None
You know, shit happens. I think that people drown in a glass of water. This is what I think in these small cases.
Miguel, what do you do in this country?
I am a journalist
Good
Yes
I am an opera singer.
Yes. I like opera and attended the Metropolitan.
I see.
And I saw, I saw Pavarotti singing some times
Oh, that's great. You saw him?
Yes, but he was still active in 1999
Right, before he retired
Retired.  Congratulations, but are you a professional singer?
Yes, yes, of course, yes. I
Really? and you live in Washington?
Yes, I used to live here in Washington, and I am working in a music school, I give classes there, and sing when I get hired to do so. I've just arrived from Italy two weeks ago
Really? How good. Wow, congratulations! I think it's a very nice profession
It is nice already, but also stressing
Yes, and I guess you also to, to take good care of your throat
Well not, you have to look after all yourself, not only the throat, you have to watch your diet, do exercise all the time
OK
Yes, it's something global. It's not only the throat.
Yes
I sometimes see some singers who do a lot of excesses. They just cover their throat and drink some beverages, but never exercise.
None
No, let themselves do stupid things. It's stupid, trying to take care of the throat without doing exercise.
Sure.
You open your mouth and you put the cake, you, all the time. Exactly, yes. and how long have you been in this country?
Well, it's going to be nine years.
Imagine.
I was in New York for a while, but unfortunately I couldn't with the climate, it's cold, And I even loved the city.
None
The weather, no, it wasn't great for me, I had allergy problems and things, that degenerated into asthma
So, it was when the doctor, the specialist told me that I needed to find a warmer climate, and I came here to Florida, where my brother lives.
How nice
I have been here for a year.
You're in Orlando?
In Orlando, yes.
Talking about the justice system again in this country in each state, each city, each country has its different things manages in a different way
Yes, it's true
Yes.
It's so much that they even have extradition between states, No?
Exactly, yes.
That this, it seems unusual, coming from a South American country, but
Exactly, did you know that they just, something that just happened to my singing teacher, it's a whole thing that, that they just put here, it's new, it's in the city right now, in Washington
You can't drive without an earpiece
Yes
Cell phone, I think it's a very good thing
It's very good, yes?
I think it's a very good think, it turns out that my teacher, he got caught. He was on a traffic light and he was talking on the phone, they caught him. It turns out the man forgot his wallet, he didn't even have his license
None
Those things that happen, and when...
Yes
Exactly, that, when something bad is gonna happen to you, it all happens at once. Well, the man was taken to jail and everything, six hours
And they had to contact someone to know that, because the problem is, he's called Russel
Homonyms
He's more or less a common man, there's also a Russel in the same area.
None
That has more than two
Hello
Hello, Rodrigo's speaking! From,
From where?
From New York.
From New York.  How are you Don Rodrigo?  This is Chong speaking from Toronto, Canada.
Okay
And how is the weather there in New York?
The climate?
None
Quite cold.
Yes.
Yes, it is cold and that is normal. Yesterday we had a rain storm with hail.
How nice. Also here in Toronto it's good it's normal, there's a lot of snow and a lot very cold but that's how the season is of
Of Christmas, of December and January Right?
It's always like that.
Yes. And I've heard that New York is very nice during Christmas
Lot of people come to the big apple
None
But when one has been living here a long time, one already gets bored.
I know new york and chicago and several other US cities
Before there was more crime, more danger, but now they say it's better. Is it true or?
Yes, it has improved a little, but you're never a hundred percent safe
Right
On the streets, there's always some danger. It also depends on the sector where you live.
Right, and where in New York do you live?, do you live in Manhattan or?
In Manhattan
Right
Yes, do you know Manhattan?
I have heard on the radio and on TV that Manhattan is the best place in New York.
But they say that, for example, there are places in Manhattan that if you go further than, upper, the two
We'll wait for you.
Brown [the Bronx] is part of Manhattan, right?
No
The places up from Manhattan, are they safe?
Upper Manhattan
Excuse me?
Upper Manhattan
Right
Yes
They say there isn't as safe as the lower part
Yes, is true. In all parts it has its pros and its cons and sometimes one can be in the safest place, but when something is going to happen, is going to happen regardless.
Yes.
Yes, Listen and are you Colombian?
No, I'm Canadian but Mexican on my mother's side.
Your mom is Mexican and your dad is Canadian.
Yes
Have you lived all your life in Canada?
None
None
Well, sure. Speaking of crime, Canada is much safer. In Mexico there are a lot of kidnappings and a lot of theft.
It's been four or five years that I don't go to Mexico and they say the situation is worse now. There's a lot of delinquency.
Since the people don't have to work and want to make money, then what happens is that the important people on television
That is related to show business they kidnap them,
None
They kidnap them. Then they charge a ransom for them
Yes
Yes.
Just one thing happened to me. Where are you from?
Chile.
From Chile.  Do you know Mexico city?
Yes, the federal district.
Yes
Yes, I know
Yes, they stole my wallet there, one time I was in a truck, I didn't realize, I didn't realize until I was off the truck
And you didn't realize it.
No, I had it in my bag and in the backpack and I had the wallet inside, but when I got down the truck
The opened the backpack
I see
And they removed it without noticing myself
You didn't even noticed
No
YES, IT'S DANGEROUS, PEOPLE IS SUCH A THEFT
Yes
Yes
I used to carry my birth certificate and documents with me but not any more
Other documents with me, that I lost, so now, If I'm traveling or not, I don't carry anything with me
Just the passport
Not event he passport. If I carry the passport, for example- i'm traveling, I leave it in the Hotel locked; I don't carry it with me.
I just bring the credit card and that's id, it's easy, if you lost it, or you get mugged, you just call by telephone.
They deactivate it
None
And did they take a lot from your wallet?
No, It was the documents that caused me more problems.
Yes, when they take the documents, everything's more difficult
Yes
Yes, you haven't come to Mexico for a long time.
Sorry?
You haven't come to Mexico for a long time.
Yes, and also in Acapulco. And I also, this time that I left Toronto I was driving passing through the United States getting to Acapulco.
Yeah.
And where I traveled, more in the cities of the United States and
I was driving from Toronto to Acapulco I was also driving from Toronto to Washington, to Vancouver, and no, I've never had any of this
Any danger
No, I've been living here in the United States for two years. And thank God I've never had any problem either, but I have friends who have.
They had it.  They attacked one friend, then punched him and he died.  In Queens.  After leaving a party.  To rob him.
None
Yes, but not to me, I've been lucky. These things happen at dawn at night when it's really late, only there
You're exposed and something like this happens.
Or leaving the clubs. This is almost
Yes.
I hardly go to bars and this things, maybe that's why I haven't had any problems
If you go to discos or clubs where a crowd gathers
None
And people drink. They drink one cup and another one, and afterwards, the problems start.
Yes
That's why I am always scared of that. But I think it is dangerous all over, also in Canada, Chile, Mexico, the UNited States, all over
It depends
Yes it depends, Well we had, we used to have, I wonder if you heard that in the news, in Toronto there were a lot murders
We are having problems with guns now
No
In the United States there are more guns than anywhere else right ?
Yes
In Canada we haven't had that problem but the use of guns is growing and crime as well
Are there a lot of people in Canada? I know many Chileans who live in Canada.
Yes. No, I don't know may Chileans. Well, in Toronto and in Montreal and Vancouver there are may Latin American people.
Of course there are a lot of people from El Salvador, and many Salvadoreans here in Canada.
How do they manage with the language? Because there one half speak English and the other half speak French, right?
Yes, in Quebec they speak almost only french, and in all the other places almost only english, and in Quebec
They don't want to speak or know anything about English. Well that's their problem, because they are trying to educate their children only in English
It's the kids that loose if they don't learn english. And in this world where English is the business language, and they speaking only french
They are afraid that the French language is going to die and that's why they
They want to teach English
Right
Do you speak English and french?
I don't speak french
She studies and goes to a school where they teach her just, half a day in English and half a day in french. So she know how to speak English, French and Spanish.
It's multilingual
None
That's good for the children, the more languages you speak the better, but sometimes it's a pressure too
Learn very fast. While they're very little
Yes, yes, that's part of, but well, that's good because that helps them, in their opportunities for life.
Yes, that's true
Yes
Is your wife also from, from Mexico?
Yeah, she's Mexican I'm no longer with her
She's the Mexican
Yes, Mexican one hundred percent.
None
She was born there in Mexico, I met her there. She lives in Toronto with my daughter and I came here to visit. I live in Vancouver.
You are, and where are you, in Toronto or in Vancouver?
Yes right now I'm in Toronto, I came for Christmas.
The holiday
For the holiday, but I had returned to Vancouver that Monday
Yes. Have you already made a lot of these calls, How many calls do you have? Several.
I have maybe twelve or thirteen.
How many do we have to make, twenty-five
Twenty five
This already the second one.
Yes
Yes, I started yesterday.
You just started
What's the period of time that one can take to make these twenty five calls? Are they fast?
I was busy, I couldn't call every day.
Okay But does one have to wait til they call you or one has to call?
No one has, one can call the toll free number And that, that's what I always do, I call the toll free number because I'm very busy to we waiting that
They call me
What's the number to call?
I don't remember but they have it in the information email that they sent us.
Okay, It's in the e-mail, some one has to call then to let them know when you want them to call you?
No, you can call whenever you want to make a call.
If I want to make the call I call myself?
Yes, to the number one eight sixteen eight sixty six something, it's there in the information.
Yes it must be in the email. No, I didn't study it well.
Yes, yes, study. It's what I always do, I call the number and I don't have to wait.
You cant make the calls? In a week?
No, one per day, no more.
No, for this, one per day?
Yes
What can you do, seven calls a week?
None
Every day
Yes, it's
Every day you can make a call
Yes
I though you only had to wait.
None
Until someone called you.
This is what I always do. I always call and say okay when they connect me, and that's good.
Well
Good evening, Patricia's speaking. Whom am I speaking with?
Hello, good evening, Ingrid from Philadelphia.
Hello Ingrid, What country are you from?
From Guatemala.
And are you in Philadelphia?
Yes. What country are you from?
I'm from Panama and I'm here in Delaware.
None
Next to you.
We are near.
What can you tell me about, since you are in quite a big city with a crime rate quite high?
Yes, here more than anything the news personally I've been here almost two and a half years
None
And never by the grace of God nothing has happened to us.
None
No.
Do you feel safe where you live?
Well now I have like a month, a year of living here and I feel really safe, in other words that I can walk in the street peacefully
Yes, me too.
When I moved to Philadelphia I got home at 5 pm.
I see
I didn't feel safe.
The neighborhood where I live is very, very quiet. The city is relatively calm. The only thing is that from time to time in what we call
The city's center, Downtown
None
From time to time, things get wild, but that's once every five years. You hear about shootings and things like that, but generally they don't talk about us on the news
None
In my country, crime is very high because of unemployment.
I can imagine. I guess it's the same as Guatemala.
The same must happen in Guatemala, exactly
Just like in Guatemala. Every time I, I mean, I don't even feel like going to Guatemala, I can tell you that. I don't feel like going because
Not me. I don't go that far.
I'm scared
I don't go that far
None
You simply have to be smart and know where you can go, and where you shouldn't go, andwhat time can you be out if you're in a foreign city
Yes, I don't know if it's the same in Panama, but my mom tells me
No?
That she goes in the public transport
None
Do not ride with a gun
Yes it has been known that in panama
Gentlemen here.
The thieves have gotten into buses and robbed everyone
They take away the money and the clocks
There was a time
None
There was a time when Noriega had the power.
None
Thieves used to break in the high-class restaurant
Yes.
And left people without clothes wrapped in the cloth of the tables in the restaurant
Yes
Because they even took the clothes.
It is very dangerous because you can get killed by a nonsense.
Then the youth of today gives me the impression that they are not afraid of anything.
The youth of today is not afraid of anything or anyone.
Yes
They have no respect for God. Do not fear the police, or the repercussions of their actions.
Yes
I think that if you kill someone
None
You should deserve the death penalty.
Sometimes it seems a bit exaggerated but as they say
Eye for an eye.
An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
No, eye for an eye, exactly.
Yes
Especially crimes against minors
Sure
These should be automatically eliminated and taken out of society because they simply don't belong in society.
Yes, exactly, I don't believe in those who repent or this because
Or don't want to belong, no, no, not that they will repent.
If they have the heart to do something bad, it's very difficult they can
Yes, if you give them another opportunity, they will return and do it.
Sure
Instead of spending so much money on war I would like to see,
None
They train more police in the areas that need it to maintain order, to keep the family safe.
To keep children so they are not a bad example for children. For example, gangs.
Yes, and perhaps also invest a bit more in education and the
Education, exactly.
To people because lack of education is what also unfortunately throws people who are less educated, they are the ones who get into the
These acts of violence and robbery and
I've suffered in Panama,two robbery attacks,I was struggling.
None
This was in Panama, thank God it hasn't happened here, no one has stolen anything from me
None
The simple fact that they came to attack me, I felt violated
Of course, of course.
You see?
For me, just once.
And what it did to me, it made me very angry
Yes
Not fear. It made me angry.
No, once in Guatemala, it was about twelve years maybe, I remember that it was your life on public transport
The rear door was open, and I had my gold chains.
None
I don't know why I was carrying them.
None
Damaged the one thing that I felt was something, they didn't hurt me,
It tore.
, well one of them had burst and when I went to see it was a few kids who were eight years old at most
That's what I'm saying.
And neither
If there were more after school programs
Sure.
That the kids, for example, the dads and the moms who have to work, that kids, instead of being in the street, had more after school educational programs
None
To teach them something
Sure.
Police go to the schools. No, they need a stronger presence
Yes. Exactly.
Because they're going to do what they're going to do
Exactly, like they already start from
Well, we have to do what we have to do to protect ourselves.
Sure.
And to me there's nothing that makes me angrier
Exactly. And that
That upsets me.
At least in Guatemala that is more than their gold chain. It cost fifty dollars, just to say an amount.
So that someone comes
They come and they sell it for five dollars.
Imagine.
Is not even that they are going to sell it for a good amount but that they are going to give it away.
And also the people who lend themselves to buy those stolen articles.
Exactly, because because. Crime has two faces
Sure.
I also think that these hot shot executives
None
You see on television that steal millions of dollars
None
Those shouldn't be put in a minimum security jail. Those should be put with the rest of the killers
Of course.
With the rest of the rapists and drug addicts, put them there.
In other words everybody the same. Everything the same but for for the same reason for
Exactly.
They have so much power
Thief is the one that steals a toaster just the same as the one that steals five million dollars.
Sure.
A thief is a thief.
Exactly, but like this how these people can buy
And everybody should be together. That's the system
The other employees
That's another fifty dollars
Sure
The crime is a crime, that you break the law it doesn't matter how or how much you break the law. You should be treated the same
As all the other criminals that did the same thing.
Exactly.
The same with these Catholic Priests that molest kids.
The same, exactly.
Those they should put with the rest of the
I mean that is
They know so they pay.
Sure
Their crime.
At the same time they commit the crime, the church is also committing it by covering it up
Exactly
Because they should pay is that more because one trusts the church with the eyes closed.
A child rapist is a child rapist whether he has a cassock or not.
Sure. And especially those people who are
That's like the toaster and the five millions. Exactly. They are people that you
Trust so much
It is trust because they know your most intimate secrets.
Exactly, sometimes not even fathers of family know everything like these people
None
I'm not like that but there are people that I mean stick their hands in the fire for a priest, they give them their kids
Without any question
Yes.
For these people to abuse like that they should pay
That's already ignorance. That's already ignorance.
Sure.
I agree that they should put them with the rest of the ones that have committed the same crime put all of them in the same jail.
Yes, exactly.
I bet you like that.
Exactly.
The Next time, if there is a next time, they'll think twice.
Yes. And another thing is when minors commit horrible crimes.
Of adults, exactly.
I mean there shouldn't be that because he's a minor and going to be judged differently
No, if you're a minor and commit an adult crime, well, you should be tried as an adult
Exactly
Because if you had an adult mind to form a concept
None
Then you must also have the mind of an adult to accept
Right
Your
None
Your punishment
Imagine that if when young, if they do such terrible thing when they're young, when they're adults, they'll be worse
Imagine when they're twenty one.
None
They're gangsters.
Right, and if they don't get punished, there's the example for other young ones like this one who did this terrible thing and didn't get punished, so I'll do it and what are they gonna do to me?
Exactly. Well, I'm gonna do the same, exactly
Exactly
And there are a lot of kids that know that with that excuse, since they are less than seventeen years, they know that the law protects them in some states
None
That they only send them, they first send them to a rehab camp
None
And second when they turn eighteen they close those criminal files
None
That if at twenty they commit a crime is not known because those files have been sealed.
Sure
It doesn't show that there's recidivism.
He can come, kill someone and and then continue with a normal life.
Exactly.
That is not fair
He turns eighteen here nothing happened
None
Here something did happen
None
I get the impression that the majority of the states are changing that and already if you are a minor
Yes. and commit an adult crime yes, they will sentence as a. Yes, I already see that is changing a lot.
Yes that's good.
Exactly. And so others see that the law doesn't protect them for being a minor
Sure, in changing the law is like that.
You see it in Philadelphia.
Changing the law is like that.  You're not simply punishing the ones who already did it; but you are also instilling more fear in the ones that are thinking about doing it.
They're giving them a warning. Exactly. Now if you want to go crazy and do something, well it will come to this.
You'll pay. Yeah.
You'll pay, because you know the repercussions of your actions and what they will be, and if I go crazy, I will wait that they find me as a crazy person
Hello
Hi. Good evening.
Hello, how are you? My name is Juan
My name is Carmen and I live in Miami. Where are you?
I am in San Antonio, Texas
Oh, Texas, pleased to meet you,yes
Yes, how do you do?
How do you do? Fine, thank you very much.
Working, washing the dishes
, I just got home eh, I'm free already, and then I thought I would have the last bite when suddenly you called AND I thought
None
If I have finished I answer, otherwise I just wait until later
Yes, right, that's alright Carmen, it's fine, I am very pleased to meet you, specially with this subject
What are you studying?
I don't study any longer, I would like to study again, but no
You study any more, sure
Maybe, next year. Are you studying?
That's great. And how is San Antonio for..? No, no, I am already an old lady. I am working
None
No I already studied all I had to study.
I didn't finish studying since some years ago
I see
Listen, I have, I have heard a lot aboiut crimes in Miami, how about that? is it true?
Yes well there is crime I mean sometimes when I listen to the news I think that there are other cities that have bigger problems
None
But I think no city, no matter how small, is free of crime.
None
Because there are all sort of crimes
I GET THE IMPRESSION THAT MOST OF THE MURDERS ARE RELATED TO
Related to drug affairs. Drugs, right? the cartels, the mafia, right? all that
I think that can be very related in some cities, there may be a very close link
Yes.
Just look ,I've been surprised lately because, at least of the little I know about the news
I see a lot of family violence.
That's important, see
Yes,the husband kills the
Yes
Sons and the wife who, for instance this morning I heard that two women appeared dead
None
They were daughter-in-law and mother in law
None
I mean that it seems one of them killed the other and then committed suicide. and it seems that it all was because of family problems, of nature, related to domestic violence
None
That really shocks me a lot. It particularly shocks me a lot because I think the basis of everything a lot of the time is loneliness, similar to how the kids are raised.
The lack of afection
Yes
Many things, right
Yes, it probably has a lot to do with the way in which the person is educated about domestic violence. They are people who, I imagine don't have a good education in dealing with the issues, right?
Yes
So then they hit each other, they hurt each other, they scream at each other and they have no rational way of getting through the problems, right
They hit the first time if one of the two people
Yes, it could be that
Doesn't solve the problem that increases
Exactly, look that here that also happens, here in San Antonio
None
The majority of the violent crimes are related to this that you say, the domestic violence.
Yes
AND ALSO WITH THE DRUGS
None
Both yes that does happen here,
Are you so close to the Mexican border?
Hundred fifty miles
That's close, right
Yes. Very close.
I won't say that you have a great influence there because probably it will be controlled like the cartels in my country, Colombia.
None
Have used all those countries in Central America and the Caribbean and South America
None
None
Pass the drug
Exactly, one way or another everybody has been affected
Yes, yes, exactly. That's what I was going to say. They are entrance doors, they are very important distribution centers of drugs, the problems between cartels, competition
Where there is a bad done business
Between them, the kind of vendettas they have among them
Yes
You can't imagine what happens if you are outside it. They fight for a shipment, rob each other, and kill each other.
You can imagine, but you never, never
So
Never realize how much violence is used, because when
None
When they give the order to kill somebody or do it is like they do it, if they were taking revenge on the person they kill
Yes exactly, they are being billed accounts
Impressing
They have their language, their language that tells for example when the person is being killing because he betrayed someone then they have a way to left a clue to show the reason of the murder, they donÂ´t have codes
Yes
No for example I donÂ´t know, they kill them and cut their tongues
Or the hands or the fingers or
Then that is a sign,
Or they kill all the family or the closest relatives, and left him alive, or the tie them. I don't know how many things they do
Yes, there's always a message, right?
Yes.
In the San Antonio case that is what more happens
None
That kind of crime must happen everywhere right?
Yes
Is nothing more than the drug which is,as bigger the city
And many
It is important the place and the fights
Yes and many young people gets involved in that kind of violence
In
Of crimes
Yes you already know that
Yes, many young people
Yes is the young people, no
That's the worst. No.
Yes almost, always are the young people
Yes, look, sorry to interrupt you, in Colombia there was a time when
And
Those people that were into the drug businesses in one way or another. What people would say is that
Forty years old was already an old age
None
For the people that were involved in those businesses
Yes
Because in one way or another he who didn't end up in jail could be considered up to a certain point lucky
None
Ended up in the cemetery
Yes, and many say I'd rather live ten good years than fifty bad ones
Yes
Look in our countries.  There aren't many jobs.  This is the only way that young people see how to make a living.
Alternatives
A good income, no, exactly, which obviously, you know, you don't usually think about when you are young
None
You live the moment many fall into it because they can't think on the long term
Sure
It is not all the short term, and also what we said a while ago, in education it is very important, in school
They don't teach you how to make long term decisions.
Right
They are the most important at that moment and you react at the moment. It has no comparison parameters
There is a saying, some are born under a lucky star and some are born seeing stars
None
Actually being born in unfavorable economic and social circumstances
It is true to a certain point, but while there are people who get over it I can't understudy why others choose the other way thinking they will solve their problems this way
None
When actually money won't solve every problem
None
Because they can get money, but the education they didn't get that they will never have
No, never
They will never have
Exactly
They won't have even when they have the pockets full of money
Yes listen and what do you think about the other thing they were asking us, do you feel safe in your community?
Yes, I think that well I've been living here in Miami a year
None
Anyways always anywhere I've lived I've been, I've been cautious.
Yes
I've taken precautions that can help one.
To avoid certain dangers
Yes exactly look that
The same in a shopping center
None
Em that's why maybe, I feel a little safer, because if I can't do it I prefer
Also is by areas, right, not because you live in Miami everything is one way, but rather that the area where you live also has its peculiarities
Exactly and the neighborhood where I'm living now is a neighborhood where the people know each other a lot then
No
That also helps, no
None
The neighbor knows if
Is a Latin neighborhood
Yes the neighborhood is Latin
None
I've only lived here for a month, but I used to live in a more diverse neighborhood.
Multiple nationalities and cultures
None
Afro Americans,we even had some cops for neighbors, so it helped
Very quiet
And another area where I lived, my very first neighbor was a cop
None
You feel really quiet, here where I live now I don't have any cop near, I don't have cop neighbors but, but the
Hello
Hello yes this is
Yes. How are you? I'm Marcos, I'm in Philadelphia
Oh very god Marcos, I'm Jorge, I'm talking from Los Angeles, California, and if you hear a strange noise it's because I'm calling from a public phone
Interesting
From the street
Okay
Why I'm at the side of a pretty busy street
None
How are you? Marcos you said, no?
Yes
How are you Marcos?
Very good, happy new year
Same to you Marco, I always ask
Thanks
I'm originally from Argentina, and you?
I grew up in Paraguay
Asuncion what a coincidence
In Asuncion exactly
Of course I know Asuncion, Paraguay. Yes, but believe me that haven't spoken with someone from Paraguay for a long time. nice to meet you, today's topic is
Nice to meet you. I think that it's crime
Crime yes, they've asked us many questions about crime, basically it's
How do you feel about where you live relating to crime?
When I say that I think about the crime in the area where I live,
Yes
Well, I'm in Los Angeles, Have you ever been to Los Angeles?
Yes no, no
In California? Never
No, I have a brother who is in San Francisco who says that Los Angeles is enormous.
Yes
Difficult to know the city because it' big
San Francisco has more characteristics
Basically a big thing scattered everywhere
Yes
It's really spread out, like this is what it has, for this it's so big
None
Basically we're talking about crime in there area where I live, basically I live in Hollywood
None
The area where I live is generally a safe area. There's always something that can happen every now and then
I calculate that it's basically like this everywhere, no
None
Like many places in general that is a sure,you have to know too that you have to take care of yourself, you must know where are you going, it is true, where do you walk
Of course to know where do not walk
Exactly And how is that, how are you are you in the?
Yes I think it is the same in all places
Are you in the city of Philadelphia?
I'm from Philadelphia but I'm in central downtown.
From Philadelphia. I have never been in Philadelphia. How, in general, do you see it there?
It is a beautiful city, but it has to do a little,a population that in general, I am not sure how to say it in Spanish or Afro-American
To do not say anyways to sound racist and nothing like that
No, I understand
There is a big there is a big yes, there are a big amount of blacks in the city
Oh is that basically most of the population?
I think that in the center of the city you donÂ´t notice so much but there are certain places of the city like the south and the west
That is very pure
And how do you see crime rate in the area where you live? Because you are in the downtown basically in the center
Yes
Not so far to the south from here begins a problem with the black race but in this section of the city there is not any problem
So there are not many problems. My sister lived here near that place, but an incident never happened. Everything was great and perfect.
There is another section of the city more to the west that lets say is more turbulent.
For my information, what is the area of that city? Because maybe in the future I will go to visit Philadelphia, I've never been there, so I'd like to know, tell me what are the areas
Yes
You should be more careful, for instance.
There is a part, basically the west side of the city, the downtown is beside the river Schuylkill River
And
What river is it?
The Schuylkill, it's an ancient Indian name, it's written
None
None
Oh, I see.
Schuylkill, the river, on the west side of the Schuylkill, for the first, I'm thinking about the name of the streets, from thirty to sixty-nine more or less
You will notice it is a tunnel, to the road, and you continue until you get out of that section before you, you slow down too much
OK
None
You said from street thirty to street sixty-nine int he west side of the city.
Right
That's the area in which you should be really careful.
And it's pretty close to downtown, which covers a few blocks--maybe ten blocks wide, the corridor
None
But apart from that, there is no problem. Unfortunately I have no way to avoid the part of the city where there are more crimes
Let's say the two more dangerous places, there is the west section, where the are people, black race people and there is, to the
East of the city south I think they call it north, but I donÂ´t know how they call it north because if you look at the map is more to the south in reality
None
That section is more Puerto Rican and  central American that part is  equivalent, basically I know some of that section
Because I speak Spanish, my parents are doctors
How good.
And my mother worked with the Puerto Rican association. In march she worked in the hospital section. In the clinic they had
I know of the neighborhood where she worked.
Yes
It is safer for her to be cared for by this woman who's a doctor than another person who isn't.
I UNDERSTAND
They take care of her but that em I donÂ´t remember anything else
It is okay in general.
I NEVER WAS A VICTIM OF CRIME
Better
I was in an accident where a drunken man crossed on the red light, about
I understand.Well I went
Besides that nothing
Basically I can say victim when I was in Buenos Aires. You have been in Buenos Aires right?

Sure, sue
Was a very traumatic experience
Yes, I think that's a good word to describe it.
I was in shock for a couple of days, and , around that time I was living with my parents and I didn't want to do anything, I was very confused, I didn't want to talk to people, it was a terrible experience but thank God
Yes
The most important thing is, money comes and goes, but the most important thing is

Yes
But the truth is, aside from what they pay you it's been pretty good. Because I've spoken with many people and in truth, I've liked it a lot.
Yes
I've met several people, like this. So I've found out how certain things and other places are like.
Yes. What topics did you talk about?
Many times we talked about the topic of the day. This one I didn't hear well what it was
None
But
The topic is
On
Yes ahead.
None
Yes
But people that don't, they want to go directly to the theme of the day, and we have to get to this point, right?
Yes.
For
But
For them, it's the same because they are here for linguistic studies.
Yes.
If we talk of theme, or in other words, given theme, if not for that we don't know what to talk about
Yes
In general, what's the temperature there like now?
Pardon me?
Is it cold there, more or less?
Right now, no. It's a little, not cold but not very hot.
None
That's strange, because last year it was very cold. And now it's not. In Christmas it was a little warm.
You, very hot
Not that much, but more or less
Ah, I see. Here in Pennsylvania, it's very cold.
I would imagine it must be snowing, no?
Yes, not today, but today it's very nice because it's sitting at around five degrees
None
A couple of weeks ago, we had less than eighteen degrees
None
I assure you that's cold
I can imagine
And more than anything, i mean, I'm not used to it, i come from Buenos Aires, that's, pretty warm
In this season it's neither cold or hot
Well, it's summer now in Buenos Aires, because it's
Yes
It's the Southern Hemisphere
None
But in winter, the coldest it gets, is one degree below zero
When does winter begin?
The winter, in Argentina it starts around June
Look at that, i didn't know that, i thought it was like, like in Mexico
No, it's the opposite
Like here too
It's like to the other side of the world, the same with Australia
Right
We're the south
Yes
The south of Argentina is really ugly
Yes
Yes Patagonia. Have you heard of it?
No, I don't know. What's Patagonia?
Patagonia is in the southern part of the large country of Argentina.
Yes.
Basically, and Patagonia, there's the most southern part, Boreal goes almost to the border of Antarctica.
None
It's very cold there. And so, these zones can have very low, low temperatures. But not, not the rest of the country.
And it is pretty or how is it?
ARGENTINA IS REALLY PRETTY, YES. IT'S AS PRETTY AS IT IS BIG, YOU HAVE THREE CLIMATES. LIKE, IN THE SOUTH IT'S REALLY, WITH SNOW
Mountains
Yes
The North is pretty tropical, and in the middle it's temperate. So you can choose
Where are you from, the South? The North?
I'm from the middle, where it's temperate
How nice. No?
Yes, but sometimes I would like to be a little closer to the mountains. Because Buenos Aires is on the coast, so we don't reach the mountains.
But what do you know about Argentina?
From Argentina, not a lot, I would like to go one day, but for economic reasons, I haven't been able to.
Sure. And what do you do?

Sure.
Yes, I've been very bored.
What percentage of the population there in Houston is Latina?
There is much diversity.

Later you realize. Especially when you go to the Universities, Right?
Sure, a lot of variety

Some and there's also a bunch of Hispanics.
Yes
I think, Texas and California must be the others
Yes, there are many more--Chicano, American, Mexican.
Terrible!
Yes
An incredible amount, some day it was, once it was Mexican territory, so!
Yes
Many have stayed there. They are, are Americans, because they were born in America, but one hears them, or them and they are Mexicans.
SORRY TO INTERRUPT
Yes
No, don't they disqualify the call if you don't talk about the topic?
I've been audited and they accepted stay calm
Okay.
No
I was kind of worried, but maybe not
I wanted to talk about it but others didn't.
None
Then, when you are in the page and check your status
Yes
You enter your password and you can place the states, and then, he says how many weeks you have done, and if they are valid or no
Okay
And I haven't been rejected one
You have talked about other topic besides today's one, right?

Don't worry when you have to talk with the other person
Then,
Yes, you should try
Yes
Do you like Football?
Yes
Play!
I like it.
Do you play there in Houston?
I've been playing for a year. Because it's with the school and a lot of tests, etc.
Sure
I don't have much time. I got on a team, since last year and we're in a tournament.
It was fun.
Sure
And to you?
None
You like it?
Yes, I love it. I love to see it and I love to play it, but no, I'm looking for a team here to play with.
None
Because the one I found here was full, so they didn't need players
Hello, who's speaking?
Manuel speaking, I'm in Orlando, Florida. With whom am I speaking?
Pablo is in Philadelphia.
What's up Pablo?  How are you?
What's up? A pleasure. Everything ok?
Everything's good, everything's good over here
Is it nice there in Florida
Sorry.
Is it nice in Florida.
Pretty
That's good,
He end of the year was spectacular and well, everything's good, the weather's really good
Here the contrary, cold, rain
Yes, I have family and friends there, in the north, New York all this and I know how it is.
Yes but it happens
Yes, but it's
It's fine, it's fine
Yes, the seasons are also beautiful
Yes,
Well let's start, tell me your stories first and then I'll tell you
Today's topic is the crime
Yes
I don't know. Here in the zone we were really protected. I live here with my wife
There was many security
Right
The security, the city police officers, we have from here the University of Pennsylvania, we are here in University City
Nice, yes
It was really reinforced, this topic, as many other things
Yes
Never too much, only last year, one rape. It didn't happen again, only once.
The
Nothing more happened. I feel really secure in this zone.
Here in Philadelphia, there are really heavy zones, really ugly
Yes
But, I don't know them well, so I can talk, but, some people commentaries, well, you better not to walk at night, some people think like that
Bad living and they feel insecure
None
And I see the central zone, University city and we are fine
It's fine
We're fine
I live in a safe unit.
Sure
In the whole area there's a lot of protection, in fact I regularly see that these places are patrolled by the
The police in their vehicles
None
They go to the units, look around with relative frequency
Sure,
I see that the community is also, well, it's always really ready to immediately advise or notify any anomaly that they see
Good.
Yes, now it's the same as you say, well, obviously there are areas, well that don't count on as much security
None
But in general it seems that everything works well
Yes,
But there still are very painful facts of
Yes, in general I see it well.
In fact despite the redundancy the news came this week yesterday nothing less
None
Than a person, close to here in another city. A woman actually, lost an eye, because of a stray bullet, on New Years Day, no
New Years eve
Yes, a disaster.
What a disgrace, nobody knows antthing about it, she was at home sitting with her family, when she suddenly felt something in the eye.
The last thing I know is that she has a bullet embedded
No, incredible.
It is quite unusual, even more around here where nothing ever happens, that people start shooting in the New Year, look what things happen nowadays, right?
Something like this also happened here, last year or two years ago, and a girl was killed the same way.
None
A lost bullet
I guess
The father was walking with the girl behind him
Was it also in New Year's day?
No,
It was a regular day, yes
The similarity is for the lost bullet
Yes, yes
Also, nobody knows nothing, nobody remembers nothing because it was a lost bullet, disgrace
Well another subject we can talk about, not because we are living or suffering it, is gangs
None
It's obvious and no one can deny that big cities, specially, have a gangs problem
Yes
Unfortunately that is almost always attributable to minorities
Yes
In many cases children of immigrants
Yes.
There's not a lot of, to note, but I respect that you don't know all the details of all these things
But unfortunately, all of this involves a big decomposition of many houses of many families
Sure
Little kids who swim in the street from when they're really little.
It's a big disaster
And it's, it's logical that they will end up in things, in hands of those who are, of their friends
Sure, Yes
Yes, you know that this is in New York in Los Angeles, in the big cities there's this
In the big cities yes, the truth is in Philadelphia I don't know anything about this gang topic
People who apparently seen like they were, living badly but not in a group, in, in gangs
Believe me that I, at least with my personal security, the fact of walking on the street and all this, I feel really good, really protected
In exchange I don't feel really protected when it comes to cyber crime
None
Believe me that one time they tried to cheat me, or in fact there appeared a charge on my credit card
Yes
You know that
It's also a topic that showed up.
It's better since the problem was resolved in my favor.
It's like they didn't stop enough balls
Yes, we also have a girl friend who something happened to her like this, they took her credit card I don't know how much
Yes, they had invented a charge, but, well
It seems like they're completely mafia
No
Yes, they're completely mafia and there are people who are getting a lot of money from this
Yes Sure
Identity robbers are connected to this situation. Why is there so much identity theft when there is such advanced technology?
More now with all this campaign that started after nine eleven
Yes
And there's much vigilance, but it hasn't stopped with these people because it's not a person, it's bands
They're organizations, no
Yes, international criminal organizations, and if you don't know anything they say or show, they see this organization disrupted by the traffic documents
Nothing ever happens, no
The most I've seen is that they disrupt these bands of pedophiles or who exchange documents child pornography or something that I've seen but
Yes, I avoid this too.
But, but they break up bands dedicated to stealing identity or scamming the internet, I haven't seen
I haven't seen any scams.
We also have to add today's topic because it's also crime.
Sure
It cost money.
How does it look for you, sure, if with respect, and after the topics, yes, it seems that they were exaggerating
In the television, it was positive to see that much
Okay
I thought that the cases played on TV were really positive.
Some people get sick, it really frights them
I agree with you, obviously, it must not be the only topic, Many media seems to do that
Yes
To look and re look for everything with blood in it. I don't think we can reach that extreme, but it's important to keep us informed about things
They are all media that want to hurt you, highlighting the horrible news.
Yes, only that
No. I don't think that kind of press is the best. It's good to be informed about the things that happen in your country and
In general, because you can aisle yourself and you can close you eyes and try to escape from that
Everything that is happening
That is no right and I know some people like that, That never watches TV news and never reads a newspaper
I also think that's ridiculous
None
That's not good.
Sure
Regrettably with so much tragedy, I hope that no
Yes, there are people that close themselves in their
That think got disconnected that's it and solved their problem, no
In their underworld, yes it hurts them, and if they don't want to see it, they directly disconnect. Many people are like that.
Don't read the newpaper. Don't watch tv. That's how life goes for them. They live in their house.
But there are people that don't need it I had a friend that at one time was depressed
And the psychiatrist himself would prohibit her, would advise her not to watch television because if you are not very prepared, if you are not
In those cases, it seems right
There are people that are very sensitive, there are people  that have depression but there are people that are very sensitive and that if the whole day that's happening to them
Oh, no
It hurts them and cannot walk straight
That already seems like a punishment. I can put up with it for half an hour or an hour but
The whole day, that would be a total punishment.
Yes.
It's a torture
Sure
In life, you have to do a little bit of everything
None
And I'm eh one of the eh ah few people that can say that was able to see eh the ah Eiffel Tower and also the Taj Mahal the same day.
No, I am working a little and I am studying a little English, more than anything, the one who is studying is my wife. She is doing her post-doc here in
Yes
Here in Penn University and I'm here with her
Oh nice
It's more than her, and the principal is that she finish her post doctoral, and sometimes
Work a little bit and the time goes by and you?, are you working there?, or Studying?
Sure, I'm here working. I also live in New York
I SEE
Unfortunately, the cold kicked me out and the doctor recommended I find a hotter weather.
None
For my allergy problems and all that, those where terrible
The cold and the weather, it's really
And the cold, it's hard. I had to take that decision and stay in the city I really loved.
Well, it's a really awesome social laboratory.
Social lab
Many things to do, a really nice cultural life
Really nice
I don't complain, the weather is really harmless
Yes
Obviously the city is much small and there are not many things to do
Yes
Good evening.
Hello, my name's Yolanda.
Carlos.
Carols. And where are you calling from Carlos? From Houston, I'm speaking from Fort Worth, Texas
Okay, just next to here.
How are you today, this afternoon, night?
And you?
Very well, thanks, have you been in the study very long?
Yes, I've been in this since October.
Yes, that's when I started, too. What's the topic on crime?
Yes. Sometimes it heats too much, and other times it heats too little.
There in Houston there's a lot of this. Right?
I suppose so. Like, I really, I've been living here for five and a half years
None
Really nothing, I've never had any problem, thank god.
None
I understand that, yes, it seems that in the last few years crime has been pretty stable and if anything perhaps it's gone down.
I've heard that in the last months it's gone down considerably
Yes
And many attribute it to the refugees after the hurricane.
Yes.
None
That's what I've been told. I have relatives that live there in Houston, and in San Antonio and well, here in our area, in
In Dallas Fort Worth too, we get a lot of the people that went through all that, and yes, there are many.
Situations where, the conditions of the stores that there have been more robberies and more
Like having more stealing. That I know, but I don't know about anything else, like slaughters
Have you had, have you had any problem in the past?
Some stores have suffered. How do you say? Burglary
Yes, we're
They have robbed them and,
When i was thirteen
Right
When i lived in Puerto Rico
Right
Someone came up to me and, i had a, i had a golden necklace
Right
They gave me like a, they just, the, the, he grabbed it from my neck
Wow at thirteen years old
Yes, i don't, i don't know, i mean, that's the only, the only experience I've had
Right
For me, always, I think that, having that experience, it prepared me, emotionally I guess
Yes
I don't know if I had something that good.
No
I feel that if at some point someone would try to mug me, I would fight back.
More or less
It will not be the best in the situation.
Yes
I don't know, I feel that I would try to fight back
Yes
In the situation
Yes
None
I think that I understand the situation,  yes it's him
But
Near, maybe, of getting help, or if they have me cornered and maybe, according to the situation, I think, because I
It's hard to say what you would do, in those circumstances. But O would like to fight back, those are my things, and I have worked so hard to get them, to have
I think that maybe for me you should have an idea of
The things you can do about it
Yes
It sounds bad saying it, but there are occassions in which a person deserves to be robbed because
None
Many times, I see women that are walking and they have a big purse, and in that purse, one sees that she has money there.
That she's showing she has money there.
None
That's like an invitation up to a certain point that
Yes. One has to use their head, I say. One has to be wise,
Exactly.
Put away. When I go to a big city and need to walk around, I put my bag under a jacket or I carry it closed to me.
I just carry it, because I've traveled in many countries, and it is something that tourists throw away their
When they bring bags, they are careless, they sit to seat and leave them outside.
The cafes that they have outside, and they leave the bags and packages
People steal computers
Yes
I don't understand if one is going to be in a place, in a shopping center  and has a laptop
None
Why is no one going to leave the laptop in the car completely visible
Yes
Yes, with my job, I constantly have a computer with me unless I know that I'm going to be some place.
If I have to leave it in the car but I always cover it. I always have a shirt or sweater something.
Yes, something to cover it, yes
That is going to cover it
None
No, I never leave anything within sight
Yes
I don't know
Yes, figure, once I bought a car, it was a car that had been converted from gasoline to diesel
The engine
None
And we had troubles with the, how do you say repairs? it damaged often. I lived in Florida by that time. And, I there were,
How can I tell you? There were a lot of car stealing in that area, with all the tourist and everything. And I left my car, it was a Cadillac, in eighty-four or
Yes
Eighty-five. And I left it with the keys in, open, because I wanted it to be robed in order to be paid the insurance, and
They never robed it
It depends a lot on the area where you live.
Yes
I live in the Medical Centre, I work in the Medical Centre, here in Houston
None
And, well, I have never, thank god, I have never had any problem
None
The differences, the same apartment complex where I live now, there have been some robberies in the past
I see
In other apartments I have lived in there have been some robberies.
Yes
I don't know how it's promoted, to rob a car instead of
Yes
I have been lucky and it haven't happened nothing at all, But I never leave something visible in the car
Sure
Always, when I'm walking, I'm 28 years old and I'm a little big and I don't look really friendly
Yes
It won't be so easy, for a thief to rob me
Sure
In comparison. trying to rob a woman or a skinny man, without so
Many muscle, like that
Yes I see.
I think that when  I walk at night,  I always see some people
They are always, well, I have high sight
Yes
I always look people in the eyes
Yes
I think confidence is one of the things that you have to learn.
Yes, this important, yes.
But,
Yes, a woman has to be alert to everything that is around her. If you park in dark places, and
Only, well, you're asking for problems, because
Exactly
You have to be wise in the society that we live in now because it's not very safe.
There are many people who
Yes.
Don't have good thoughts. Yes, are you from Puerto Rico?
Yes.
Oh, very good.  Do you have five and a half years?
Ah, almost six years.
Six years. And do you have family, or you came to Houston from, from pointing to the map, or how did you come to live there.
I came for work. I work in the Medical Center here in Houston.
I had an aunt who was there in the Medical Center. What's it called?
There are many hospitals there, I don't even remember
Exactly.
She was serious and I spent time in Houston with her. She is better
And was it a serious experience? Everything turned out okay. Yes. And you worked in the hospital?
I am enrolled in Medical School studying medicine.
Okay yes, Very good. yes.
And so, you have time to
How did you know about this study?
Sorry.
How did you know about this study?

You live in New York too?
Yes, in Brooklyn.
Yes, where are you from?
I'm Mexican.
Mexican, well, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
What do you think of today's subject?
I feel that if this works, there's not a lot of crime.  But I think that, where I come from and I think where you come from too, there is.
No?
Relatively.
I've never been in a, thank God, I've never experienced (sic), I've never had a bad experience.
No.
But my sister has, in Mexico.
Yea?
Yea there it's all like that, you
Really? Yes, the doctor.
It's all really dangerous.
Yes, I've been reading books about immigrants, and Mexico's pretty dangerous, right?
Really dangerous. There's so much inequality
Yea.
That people aren't happy.
Yes that's why there's so much crime too.
But, it
BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE SITUATION HERE? WELL, I THINK IT'S ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE HERE. I DON'T KNOW. RIGHT? I MEAN, WHAT'S YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD LIKE? IS YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD SAFE? DO YOU FEEL SAFE?
Where I'm at it's safe.
Can you arrive at any time?
I can arrive at any time. The later it is, the less people there are in the street.
Yes, but, but is safe.
I feel safe. Totally.
And, in the train, or, what do you use, the train, or the bus, or what?
Generally, I'm in the train.
Yes.
And, I walk a lot. But, I feel very safe,  yes I do arrive alone also. I mean, also
Really. How good.
I know the places I go to, the neighborhoods are safe. But, there are very bad areas in New York.
Yes, and what do you think of the parks, of the green areas, where there's
What?
Of the parks or very isolated areas
Well, I don't go to the park, really. I think that there it's more dangerous, right?
You don't go because you think is safer. Right?
I've never thought that a park is safe.
Yes.
I don't think so
Yes, because, well, here, It shocks me a lot, especially the rapes, and murders of, of women by themselves, especially the women that like to go out and run. Right?
To the parks.
None
No matter how safe a city is, I think a park is always unsafe to be there by yourself.
It will depend on the size of the park but if it is a big park then yes.
None
And it's always been known right? that it is unsafe.
I think that yes, because, I think is the opportunity for anyone who wants to do something. Right?
Yes, he goes to a park and waits there.
Yes. But, I don't trust Central Park and, sometimes I pass at ten, eleven at night, that I've passed by
I see people,running in car or something
Do you live in Manhattan?
I don't know how, yes, I live in Manhattan.
None
I live like five minutes, like two minutes from Central Park But, yes, I don't know how people go out to jog.
None
I live by the edge of Manhattan, by the road that and also, I see people late at night alone, walking, running. I don't feel safe.
None
Especially a woman, right? I think doesn't feel safe.
How long have you been living here?
More than five years.
Five
How many do you have?
Okay. Me seven.
Seven years? And what do you do?

None
Music.
Yes
Yes, You?
What?
What do you do?
I can't hear you well.
Okay.
That you do what?
What do you do?
I couldn't understand you. What do you do?
I make music.
Music. But what type of music, you dance, you sing, or what?
I produce and compose.
Really? Interesting, I work as a systems engineer, and work with
Pardon? I didn't understand you.
I am a systems engineer and computer programmer.
Okay. Okay.
I work with tax sites on the internet.
Okay.
I'm a designer and a programmer. What kind of music do you do?
Popular music, pop music.
Yes.
Different genres, but everything within pop.
Within pop?
Yes.
That's interesting. Have you recorded or bought it from others?
This, well, both, I did things myself, and I've done things for
Yes?
None
None
Yes, a lot of little things.
Really interesting. Good.
But,
But what?
But getting back to the topic
But coming back to the topic of security,
IN COLOMBIA, YOU NEVER FELT LESS SAFE THAN HERE?
Yes. Obviously it's not with the prevention, for example, that they steal a car. There they steal many cars.
I had to be aware. One of the closed windows, at the stop light, they break the glass and they take your wallet.
None
These kinds of  going around with jewelry. Or fashion. Here, I go with jewelry calmly, there's no problem. And there are people who tell me, be careful in
Certain parts. No?  I don't know, they don't trust much.
None
The truth after a year of two, you feel relaxed, like you don't have this prevention
In Columbia, it depends on the city, no?
None
You don't have, a bank, if you go to a bank, you have to have miles of precautions.
None
Yes, I think they are stealing less here than there. There, someone takes out five to ten million pesos.
That this, here, like a thousand and something dollars, two thousand, three thousand dollars.
None
There are people who follow you from the bank. They follow you and, are willing to kill to steal that money.
None
So, yes, this is true, here you feel more safe. But, really, New York,  for people, there are people from everywhere.
I haven't been witness, really, to anything. But I've heard, for example, people on the train who are sleeping or distracted, they steal the
The suitase, or the
None
The MP3s, or whatever.
None
No, let's say that no one will, like in other countries. But if there is an opportunity, they steal it, right?
Yes.
Knowing about robberies, no? I didn't know about these kinds of things no?
I only know one person who has been robbed here.
Yes, how did they steal from him?
Well, there in the street, in a really empty zone,
And in what part?
In Brooklyn,
Wow.
It was a night and it was raining
Yes.
And they just took his wallet.
They showed a fi-
In Mexico, I know many people who have been robbed, who they've kidnapped, who they've,
None.
This doesn't happen here
The situation in Mexico is worse than in Colombia as far as kidnapping and all those types of things
None
In Colombia, if you have money, you have to be careful. Here that doesn't exist as much.
Yes, it doesn't exits.
Here, I'm more afraid of being robbed by the lawyers, the ones that do administration, of paperwork supervision, when one goes to do a mortgage
I think there's more risk that they rob one,
None
Here there's a lot of fraud. For example, there's a lot of frauds, right? Especially the Latins
Jeez, a lot.
There's a lot of fraud against the Latins in selling products  especially they take advantage of the people with the issue of immigration
Yes.
Yes, I think that here
Here I think that they try to get money from everyone in whichever way.
None
Yes, exactly
I've been amazed, at the insecurity in that sense.
None
What do you think of the insecurity with e-mails through the internet?
I haven't had any experience. I don't know anyone who's had anything happen to them.
Yes. I do receive them, often
You have to know more.
Yes, they come to me every now and then. You're convinced they're coming from the bank
None
None
Someone here from menso, who gives all the data, you also don't see as
There are sites that are so similar you are confident they will be trustworthy.
I think that it's a lot about the person.
Yes, but
If you're with a bank, you know what the bank page is, No?
Yes but, no. If you get a message asking for tour bank password, there are a lot of things.
Yes.
For example, I live in a neighborhood, I, okay, speaking again about security in the, in the area.
But, well, yes.
I live in Harlem.
None
You mention Harlem to a lot of people and a lot of people say, ugh, this is dangerous. Because Harlem, yes, Harlem was very dangerous a few years ago.
None
Very dangerous. But, not today, well, there are people, you see them in the street
It's not dangerous, no. It's a very safe district during the day.
None
The people that dont know or dont live here ,when i tell them that i live in such an area they ask if its unsafe
None
Then, for example,  that's my experience. And, up to now I haven't had any problem. Now, I have known, for example, in the Bronx, some friends, they broke into the apartment.
Some friends that what?
They robbed them in the apartment and they stole their bike, cameras.
There in Harlem?
No, in the Bronx.
That the Bronx is more
Yes, in the Bronx, that happened to some friends. And, it appears that yes there are in several, in several buildings, there are areas where
Apartments, and
Hello.
Hello.
Hello, who's speaking? Maria here.
I'm Leticia.
I cannot believe you. I was so happy, silly Leticia told me
Maria, from
Well, no, hey, I have been calling for three hours, calling and calling.
Really?
Yes, I got mad. they leave me, Paula lifts the tube, calls and gets connected, and me?
Yes?
I was evicted.
I have been waiting for them to connect me for about twenty minutes
Look.
Fifteen at least
What, you press the one again, like that?
Yes, a bunch of times.
I don't have a lot of patience. The second time I press the 1, I hang up and leave.
I stay doing something else. My husband is watching the television. Like that, with the phone there.
Well it was
Until they connected him, I told them to hold it.
I get bored because I don't have a cordless one.
It is not cordless, but I swear that there are moments that I would like to have a microphone.
A hand free.
Yes, or a hands-free or a headphone?
But those are super cheap, I think, for the cellular.
Yes  I'm not talking about the cellular
You're talking about the fixed one.
Though right now I could, because after nine I could
If you call more than once, it doesn't count as a different phone, right?
No
It's not in your best interest.
None
I get on the telephone, when it connects
Do you feel safe in the community?
Yes, the community in Philadelphia
Yes,
The truth is that I think about Philadelphia must be true. The fame that it has, it's not safe.
The other places in the United States.
To other places.
I don't know, at least, from what I see, I don't know if there are other cities that have an urban, well, by there, the most
Big like Los Angeles and all this but
These places should be half
New York, all the biggest ones, because after it seems like cities that don't have a dangerous zone like you see here
That scare you, no?
Yes, and now, here, West Philly, when, now that the students aren't here this week it's a little bit better, but last week, I went to the gym
Yes.
I came back at eight at night
Yes.
I was scared at times and that on the face
Really?
Yesterday someone confronted me, nothing, the kind, look, it was a crazy guy, he wanted to know if I'd seen his cat
Yes, but, seeing how much they scare you for tiny things
Yes, no?
And, what do I know.
Things happen, I don't know if at this height, but West Philly.
Yes and no, they happen after the fifty
Yes.
Yes, after the fifty there's bullets.
Yes from what I know, and, and South Philly when you come from the airport you want to die, also, the places
The area around the zoo too.
Yes, Philadelphia is nice, but Center City is nothing more.
Sure
We won't count the rest.
The field, walking in the field is really nice, and everything's rich
The field, yes, obvious, but don't go there anymore
No, the center and the upper center, at this height let's say
Yes.
Between Market and the South, it's nice
None
Philadelphia isn't that great
No
Now, the more you see
At all
The less you like
Yes, no. But what can you do?
That's what we have to talk about, what can you do? This Penn
Has its advantages.
Yes, it doesn't have its wave, I like the wave of the city too
Yes the center is good, but if you go to the outskirts you want to die.
Yes, it's a topic, after there are the other outskirts, the other outskirts are getting good
Yes, the others are good, but
You go to the bars like type King of Prussia those bars are
Yes, but I already don't know if it's Philadelphia that
Really good. Ramos Mejias, those places, that is not capital
That's not the Capital, Lomos de Samora and Ramos Mejia is not Capital, but
Not Capital, San Isidro, Martinez
Yes, they're the surroundings but I compare that more with
Sure.
With the surroundings nearby here, I don't know
It is put where he works, but really far, Paolia.
How is it there, was it pretty?
Is very pretty. See that it's very pretty.
I saw it on the map the other day. I was looking at the map and, and I saw it, because I had no idea where it was
I have no idea by where
Is would be kind of like northeast, I think from what I saw
None
None
To the west, passing Brindmore, where Marcela and Mario lived,
Is like diagonal
Yes.
It's good there? yes
And they say how nice, it's crazy, things that the nice people, driving nice cars, nothing to do with West Philly
Yes, I imagine, the other truth.
The two faces of Philadelphia
Yes, I swear that we went to our friendsÂ´ placem there in
Yes.
Sure, they live in a condominium that has a pool, like Mario's.
Yes.
Mario's is the same but good, it has a pool.
A jacuzzi
No.
After a place where we spent Christmas
Yes.
It's a living room, but you don't know how nicely decorated.
Like a common
Yes, it doesn't have a barbecue, it's like a
Sure.
A tent
Yes.
It's better than our apartment
Yes, where my friend who lives in Boston has this, yes
Yes.
It's amazing
With a redone kitchen, she has a good, one of those big televisions
And pays the same as you, able
They pay a thousand dollars and they live in two environments in, no, two houses where she's really happy
And because it's smaller she can, no? San Diego is expensive, what I told Mariana, my friend's Dad, she had to go to the suburbs, what they call Paolia there.
Yes.
They pay a thousand for an apartment and according to her it's minimal
None
Yes, no, not even a pool or anything. The only thing they have is parking, but, without a roof or anything.
Sure, what happens is that Davis is a little town
Sure.
It's like living in the suburbs, nothing more than
You're going to live there,in any little town close by, it's another thing.
Yes, obviously, yes.
Believe that where Lucero worked, that's a little town, I don't remember the name
Wilmington
You go there and you're ableo
Yes.
The rent but there goes half
Yes, just like that. yes.
None
What happened is, seeing this, that we said how good
Yes.
Sure, because it's barbaric, but like, what happens is that here to go to a place you can, but you have to travel
And yes, then, after if you come to work at Penn, the parking costs you a ton
Yes, no?
And yes it's for parking
Sure.
It comes to...I don't remember how much it was
Two hundred? No. How much?
If you pay all at one, it is seven hundred dollars.
Seven hundred a year.
A year.  But if you pay by the month, it's another price
None
The deal is if you go, I don't know, when you start the school year, in September, you pay seven hundred mangos
Yes.
None
And it hurts a lot.
Yes, all together.
Yes.
What, do I know, it's like everything if one has been here to stay, you take it as one more expense and what do I know, the last one you save from rent
Yes renting is the minimum but it's a bunch of disadvantages
Yes.
Maybe rent turns out to be the same, but you live in a much better place.
Yes, or maybe a-, it's less, what do I know.
Yes.
What happens is that those things you realize with time, when you end up finding out it's like it's not worth it to move I imagine
It's not long before you leave, what do I know.
The truth is that I don't know, all the same I'm not completely convinced because it bugs me to travel, I don't know
It's hard. On the morning, above all, you have to wake up an hour earlier to get there at the same time you used to arrive
Yes.
The day ends at six here, but you arrive at your house at seven
Yes, it doesn't seem it closes
Yes.
A-, the truth is that
Marcela, every day she had to take the train and then she had to take the
Yes.
Every day of your life, it bothers me already to do it to go to some place in particular
What I hated about Buenos Aires is here is well
Sure
Because, I don't know, maybe you are not so used to it, but I, since, all the university was like train and subway
I lived in a place that is not very well communicated, so I had
Forty-five minutes on 'bondi'
None
It was one single 'bondi', the problem is that it gave many turns, it was not far actually, by car it would take ten minutes
Really?
The car was a good option because you can park anywhere without paying.
Sure
And the Mard del Plata is not that big either,  you do a pair of turns and you find a place to park, for sure
Yes. No, if, to me, that is what I hated there, travelling
Sure, in Buenos Aires of course, when I, the little time I worked in Buenos Aires, I had to catch a train and a 'bondi' every day
Yes.
It was fast, I got there in twenty minutes, but I had to catch the two
Yes
Yes
I could get there in forty-five, but I had to catch two of them.
None
The average was forty-five when everything turned out right
Yes, it was a piquet
Yes, no, The truth is that, it would annoy me travel
I really like that, getting up and 5 minutes later I'm in the faculty walking
Yes I understand
It's really comfortable
No, you are really close
It is really comfortable, but you have to be on that side.
Yes, and it has its advantages and its disadvantages
Yes, you know what?, At night it's really ugly and when you want to go eat out, there, you have like 80 options, here it's
Three or four options, to see the most attractive.
Yes.
Going downtown annoys you, I mean taking the bus to go downtown
Going to eat, only
None
You probably used, it's the Penn Bus
Yes
It's free
Yes
And drives in front of your house
Yes, now Paulo, today took, did you see Lucy?
Yes.
For
That's from Penn also.
Sure to come home, because he went by train and returns by train
Yes
When going he went to take the Lucy coming back
Yes, because that's free, it's really good.
Really good. It's incredible. You save two sixty per day
Hello?
Hello, yes, this is Jorge calling from Los Angeles, California.
How are you? I'm Leticia, I'm calling from Philadelphia.
Philadelphia, and you're originally from Argentina.
Yes.
Me too. How are you Leticia?
You are also Argentinian?
I'm from Argentina also, yes
Oh, but you don't have the Argentinian accent.
It doesn't seem like it because you still haven't talked me for a good while. I think that i have a lot, but what happens is that I have
I left Argentina twenty years ago.
It's been twenty years since you left Argentina?
Exactly.
None
None
Sure.
And I've never returned, I mean eighty six,
But you're from Buenos Aires? Right
Nineteen years. Yes, I'm from Buenos Aires.
Because in any case you have the Argentinian accent but from the interior, not from Buenos Aires.
I don't have an accent of a person from Buenos Aires.
How funny. no.
I was born and raised in Lanuz west.
Look at that.
Do you remember that neighborhood?
Yes.
Valentin Alsina. you do remember?
I admit my arrival here was too long ago.
You haven't been in Philadelphia long?
It's been eight months.
What neighborhood in Buenos Aires are you from?
I am from Villa Ballester.
Yes, i like it.
Also from the urban Con.
Yes. I'm glad, I remember. I lived for a while in Florida
It's very near, yes.
In Florida, I was going to a school there in San Martin avenue yes, sure, sure, how am I not going to remember
Has it been a long time since you returned to Argentina?
Since I left in March of '86 I have never gone back
No.
No, I haven't returned so you have a fresher information about the breakups, That has
That's nice, it's crazy, right? that you haven't returned to Argentina, that's why you don't have the accent
None
You are influenced by Central America
It seems that I stayed in several places South America, in central america for a year, basically in Mexico
None
None
That's why our accent is very mixed.
Yes.
We don't use the fijate.
Did I said fijate?
Yes
I forgot.
That's typical Mexican
Yes.  After a year to get credit from this talk today.
I would like to keep talking to you.
We have to talk about the topic
But, apparently, to get credit. If not, we take the risk of not getting
Yes, you're right
The credit, for this, 12 minutes
Yes, well with respect to couples, lets see I think that, what you suggested in the proposal if it is easier to break up when you are younger, I think so
So
Good.
I think so.
Yes, I suppose.
Because, it looks to me that when you are younger, you donÂ´t have so much ties with the other person, right? and I suppose too that it depends too of the time that you have, that you have with the person, right?
I agree with you, I suppose that ah to break up is never  an easy thing.
No.
No, starting at that
No.
To break up is never an easy thing, but it depends on the situation. Sometimes, there is another solution other than breaking up, right?
Yes, it is logical.
Sometimes in a couple, a person loves the other, but love is not enough.  There are people that love each other
Yes.
But besides everything, they have a lot of things that don't complement that they don't work as a couple
Yes, or they hurt themselves
Exactly
Right? in any other aspect.
If it is possibly better for them to break up in that situation, maybe they could be friends.
When things don't work and that is all.
None
Oh my god. There are subjects we must discuss for twelve minutes.
None
They are looking for a subject
Yes,no?
Yes, yes.
Sometimes I don't even know what to say.
No, have you been taking these calls for a long time? Did you start
This must be the tenth.
This is my fifteenth
None
Sixteen, more or less.
Yes, how did you get involved in this conversation?
I found the information on the computer.
In a website
In website, yes.
A survey website
That's right, what did you say?
In a survey
Something like that, yes
Yes, because I ask everyone, and I'm intrigued about how people finds out
It's when you...
Because we are in Pennsylvania, and I work in the in the University of Pennsylvania, where this study is being done
None
And
Really?,you work in that U...this is the first time, I haven't got that before, You work in the University of Pennsylvania, where this study is being done?
No, no, sorry, I'm not related with this study at all
You work in the University of Pennsylvania?
I work in the University
One of the university's department is making this study
None
Look, yes, it's
The page says its from the University.
It's from the University of Pennsylvania
Sure
Exactly, look, that's interesting
So, that's
None
But then, I'm intrigued how people from other states find out
Yes, it's like
Sure.
You are the fourth Argentinian that I've talked to.
Yes?
I talked with an Argentinian from Vancouver, Canada, with another from Toronto.
None
A girl in Boston and you
You don't remember what she was called? Because I think she's my friend.
Leticia, no
No, I'm Leticia.
No, Leticia no, in Boston it's Tamara.
Tamara?
Tamara in Boston.
Yes, I know her.
Are you sure that it's her?
Yes, I know who she is.
I don't know, she's Tamara, she's just came.
From Israel.
Yes.
Yes, it's her.
Wow, look how small the world is
I know her personally.
Look how nice,  just getting with your partner
Yes.
She's from Israel, and she's working in the area of veterinary.
Yes I know her.
Look how small the world is.
Yes. She's a friend of my friend who lives in Boston.
Perfect. Speaking a little more on the couple.
And how is it in LA, with couples? There's a lot, it's very
Couples in Los Angeles
Yes.
I don't think the city really influences society and culture.
Yes.
California is basically a very liberal state
Sure, it's famous, yes.
You know? It's basically very liberal everywhere in the world, from Canada to the Falkland Islands.
Yes.
What I want to say is that this thing has, where you are apparently has the reputation of being a little more conservative on a lot of things
Yes.
In California, the relationship of a couple can influence the sociocultural aspect
Yes
My cousin from Argentina, that is in
Yes
Visiting
None
He says that people generally does not get married in Argentina
Yes, it's true
I think it is really expensive to live with a marriage.
They make other arrangements as a couple.
Yes, concubinage
Exactly, you know that better because it have been 8 months since you arrived
Sure
And you know more how the Argentinian reality is. I got out of there 19 years ago. Do you understand what I tell you?
Sure
But it's true, isn't it?
Yes, it's true
Because, besides the fact that getting married by law can give the couple more flexibility
Sure
They are not tied to any social norm and all the problems tied with divorce
Yes
If people get along then they live together. I don't, I respect both points of view
It's alright to me.
Yes
I have no problem, but, I don't know, what do you think? from the Argentinean reality? you who came eight months ago
No, yes it's true  there is a great tendency not to get married to just live together and on one side I think it is because of the economical situation on the other side it is
Because of the compromise matter, right?
Right
Otherwise, many people feel somehow tied up to the the other person and have the theory that
Not getting married, they have the faculty of choosing, everyday, that person. While if you get married you have her chosen already.
Although you may regret it, I mean it's harder
You who have just arrived  not getting married these kind of couple realtionship
Are they more common nowadays, right? in the Argentinean society?
Yes
So you can find it among your friends, you know people there who don't marry right?
Yes, or ,many people who just live together for a while, and then get married
That's alright
At that moment, maybe lot of them decide to get married when they have children.
Hello?
My name is Ramon from Los Angeles.
How are you? My name is Maria Ines from Philadelphia, yes
None
And where are you originally?
From Los Angeles, yes.
You were born there, and are you American?

A year here in the United States
None
Really nice, the topic is Couple behavior
Yes
What is your opinion?
And I don't know my opinion.  the questions that they made, I think it depends a lot on every couple and every person, I don't think, that it's something about age or
I don't know, I think that
Yes. Do you have a boyfriend now? Or
Yes, I am married.
I'm not married. I have a girlfriend now
And?
For two years.  There's the possibility that there's a future, a marriage, but she lives thirty miles from me.
None
In San Pedro.  I live in Los Angeles and it's difficult to have contact with her because I can visit her three days out of the week.
She cannot visit me here because she has a
Yes.
A problem with her kidneys
She can't travel much.
For this reason. Yes.
None
That's my situation now.
All the same. If you see each other three times a week it's a lot.
And what
No? Ah, yeah.
Now it's enough for the growth of the relationship, I think that we need more
More time.
More contact, more time and
And possibilities of going to San Pedro
She doesn't want to. I'm stuck in the middle and I want something new for me.
And I'm
None
Trying to increase my contacts in the legal world
Sure.
Legal disputes.
None
And that' why, I need, to he here in Los Angeles and, downtown Los Angeles and she's like
In the South of Los Angeles.

Yes, it's huge, five hundred square miles.
None
So, it's like three or four States in this area.
There are a lot of people who live here.
How many years?
How many?
On the city I think it's three point three million.
None
I think about twelve million.
None
Philadelphia is three million.
Yes. I think that in total they're three or four million but I'm not sure. As big as Los Angeles, I'm sure.
How many years have you been married?
It's going to be three years soon.
Oh, three years.
Yes, January 11
None
Yes, we got married in Argentina, and after a year, we came over here
None
It's been a year that we've been here and we will stay a couple more years.  It's not definite us staying here.
We honestly like it.
Yes
Yes.
What type of work do you do?
And I studied Biology in Argentina.
None
I came here to do what's called the post - doctorate , which is a job in a laboratory for a couple of years.

My husband is a photographer but now he is working on whatever he finds.
None
He's working, at this moment he's cleaning offices in the suburbs

Here in Los Angeles, Photography is very popular.
Yes? Like a hobby?
Yes , for example I have an invitation to one in Beverly Hills.
Like to go to photographer exhibit.
And exhibit.
People like his photographs in color.
None
And, perhaps that is like art I can't exactly describe directly
Here in Los Angeles, for the reason of the movie industry also
Ok, sure
It is very popular here for that reason, but I think that in New York city it is more
Yes.
Popular.
I think so. I haven't really seen much here.
None
He didn't speak English well when he arrived.
None
No, he couldn't find work for that photographer, because all asked him to speak English, and he's studying.
Yes
But until next year I figure that he won't be able to find a job.
None
And on the artistic side I haven't seen much. There's a lot of art in Philadelphia, but photography specifically, the truth is no
Yes you have a museum of art
We haven't seen many
That's extraordinary like the Philadelphia Museum of Art
It's beautiful, I went. I went twice and still didn't finish seeing it all. It's enormous.
Yes
It has everything,the famous painters were fron there
Yes
The truth is impressive.
Right
It's very cute. And then there's another one. That's the Rodin Museum, a whole museum, very small with all the work. It's good.
Right
With the movement of expensive art around in various museum, a narrow minded thinker in the art world is cute.
I haven't gone there because, because it hurts a little to spend that much money, but there's opera, there's Ballet and Choirs and Symphonies
Right
There's a lot of cultural mobility
Yes, I worked her in Philadelphia for two years.
None
Two years. I'm a mediator, I work with unions.
None
A union of my work in Philadelphia was to organize a union against
None
Like other syndicates
Competition
Yes, competitions. So, every time they needed workers for another union, but there are like two of them, and I think that I was in Philadelphia like three weeks ago
Did you like it?
Three weeks, yes, I really like it, but
It's not really different from here.
Really different, the weather is not like Philadelphia
The weather is horrible
I really like it in Los Angeles
Horrible. In Los Angeles it's not that cold in winter, right?
Generally no. Now it's a bit cold. The lowest temperature is like, 60, 68
Really nice
But you'd be cold here.
Fresh, No for us is really hot, it must be like 35
Really?
Yes, it's not cold, this winter is really nice, there is no snow nor Ice
I see
Normally, well, I don't know if you have been here in winter, but the path froze. And you start drifting, and you can't walk because it's all ice.
They have to trow sand to the ice to melt and being able to walk some bit
In Argentina, i saw a commercial to travel to Argentina, like 5 days and Buenos Aires is like
Now is really hot
Is it hot in Argentina now?
It's summer right now in Buenos Aires, so it must be in the 80's.
Eighty?
Yes, we should have around 30 degrees, I think that's around eighty six or eighty seven.
None
Fahrenheit degrees. It's pretty hot in Buenos Aires, it's summer.
Yes. Yes. Are you specialized in anything?
None
Are you a doctor or what?
No, im a biologist.
Oh, biologist
Yes biochemistry
None
I studied biology.
None
I'm not from Buenos Aires
Yes, do you work at a university or what?
I'm at the University of Pennsylvania.
Oh.
Here, yes.
That's why you know about this program right, about these calls!
Yes, I met a guy from Argentina too.
Right
He saw the sign at the door. He works in another laboratory away from mine. He let me know
None
Yes
Right
Because it's from Penn, the study. But I don't know nothing, not even the building where they do this.
It's huge, well, it must be like, the one there must be huge
Right, yes, yes, and I have five more calls to conclude this program for me
I think this is number ten, but I think I still have some left to do.
None
I have 10 left.
Yes I need to make those phone calls on ten different phones.
Yes. Have you used the five phones?
Yes, i'm near the market
In a public one?
Yes, in the public one
Oh, do you know how lucky you are that they, they put you through quickly because sometimes it takes long, you see?
Right
But well, I don't like it in the cold, that's the good thing of Los Angeles, here you freeze if you go to a public one.
Yes, you have to talk twelve minutes from a public phone, you end up like a penguin
Yes
You just can't
You are speaking with Ingrid from Philadelphia
How are you Ingrid? My name is Eliana
Hello, what's up? How are you? Where are you speaking from?
From Boston
How nice, and where are you from?
I'm from Argentina, you?
From Argentina,  I'm from Guatemala
Look nice
Yes
I've never been but I want to go to Pical
It Is very pretty. I was there when I was young and I hope to go back.
I would very easily go
No, you know all the places in your country.
Guatemala is really little and to get to the capital it's about twelve hours by bus or an hour and a half by plane, but it's not very accessible to get to
Tell me, what do you do in Philadelphia?
We lived in Maryland and we moved here, my husband is in medical school and I graduated a year ago and now I'm working
Good, great
Yes
How long have you been here in the United States?
For ten years
No, I know one.
What do you do here?
I am doing a post doctorate in genetics
The good it's for some hard for me
No, if everyone thinks that it's difficult, but if someone talks to me about history and it sounds very difficult to me
That depends, my husband is, how do you call the ones that are science oriented, I mean that they like science, I imagine like you, and they have to.
None
That what was your degree in genet-, no it wasn't in genetic and  it was two I had one in bio chemistry and the other one in
In yes, I think that, no cell biology
None
He worked with his foreign mentor that was a genetics specialist
So that
Good and I say I don't know how they can learn so many things but I don't think I he likes it, he likes
Yes, it's like I am dumb when I write. I make many spelling mistakes and I am PhD, but well everyone is also
I can't play the drums
Each one has their talent.
Sure and the topic of the day is is interesting but
But strange I keep on thinking well, really. I don't know what to say because I met my husband when I came here and we started to go out since high school
Then we got married and we have been married five years and five years, so ten years in total.
Wow
And before this well I had for example a relationship since I was  really young that isn't anything well, I got bored
We didn't go out since it was difficult.
Just the contrary to you. I'm thirty, and I have been single for a year. To break up like this seems strange because
Yes
It's difficult to break up because to me it seems like it's always difficult
Yes
To not be, like you're the bad person because tho whom you
I imagine that it doesn't matter the kind of relationship, f you've shared time with someone, I imagine that it's like
I put myself in the position that if I left my husband it would be very
No, I can't imagine how diffiult it would be
Sure
After sharing so many years, it's a life.
Sure even if yes for example you stop loving him or have a problem
None
Same it's the custom to live with him at his side for such a long time.
Sure
If you stop loving, it will hurt
Always, yes, because even if something is really ugly and you way, I donÂ´t love him, I don want to live with this person but itÂ´s that
Up until now it's ten years of my life with memories, with things that we share, with things that
That I alone, doing them without him would feel really, really ugly, really strange
Yes, it's weird, sometimes, even if the subject is better, the other day we had to talk about, women's rights,  I don't know why. I've been here for only a year. there are subjects I don't know anything about
I don't know either, I had to speak about that too, I believe it had to do about abusing women
Yes
I had to talk about it for a while, I mean, I was once happy of not knowing too much about it because I've never been in that situation
Sure
I've never met anyone who is in that situation, it's weird because, there's always someone who's been there and there are lots of people that suffer because of that but
I have to talk about a boy in Los Angeles
Yes
So, he explained to me what was done in cases of domestic violence and stuff like that
Sure
I learned a bit with him.
Yes, it's interesting to talk to someone from another
Yes
Country, sometimes the subject is interesting and you start talking, I got to talk to a girl from Argentina, she was in Philadelphia too
Aha, yes, oh okay
Through friends of friends, we both told each other that we are from Argentina but now live in Boston.
We started to talk about them and they talked about these calls
The mother of one of my friends is also taking part in this and she's from Mexico.
And here name is Olga, I believe, she's older but.
Yes
You have to make twenty-five calls, no? she has already thirty and something. she loves it because she says it's an experience, whether or not they pay you or don't pay you.
What she likes to do is speak with other people
None
But it's a very different experience, in that you speak with someone you don't know, who is very different, from other places, and you that is, it's interesting
If it's truthfully good, that's very interesting. I hope they keep doing it, but it seems to me that, no
To be honest,  I am working here
None
I am obligated to participate in this program.
None
At the same time I like it in itself that you share with one another
Of course, what is it that they want to see?
I'm from Guatemala and you are from Argentina and they are studying here with us.
Yes
We speak Spanish very differently, I mean your accent, the words you use, how you use them
Of course
What we need is to collect more information.
Yes
We later transcribe what is recorded on the computer.
None
I don't know that the those who are in computer science.
Yes
They have their programs but the same for any programs you first have to teach the computer like enter the information.
Sure
And since the internet sometimes has sites where they say you can translate
Sure
First you have to enter information, and this is what they're doing.
How nice, how interesting because
It is interesting.
The next time they will do classes of Guatemalan Spanish, Argentinian Spanish, they'll say
Sure, because you realize that already in Microsoft Word when you want to translate or use Spanish it tells you
Argentinian Spanish, Mexican Spanish and
Sure
In this way they can identify each each Spanish
How nice.
Yes, and there's another project that's called mixing and this involved one hundred and fifty different languages.
None
Also, like, it's payed and it's also for people, example Chinese, who speak Chinese, or Russian, there are rarer languages
Ahhh how nice
Also really interesting
Sure look, no the truth is that this is really interesting, and, is it cold there?
In Philadelphia, there is such a crazy weather, that today for example, I was in 50 and was in lunch hour and it was a nice day
There was no wind
Sure
But, it should be really cold in this time of the year
Yes, here also, still in Boston, there should be
None
Also know that we felt last year cold
Not even for Christmas, because regularly by Christmas you should use a huge jacket and you should be really protected and this time I was wearing
With just a sweater
Did you see that it's always about the weather.  I remember dates and the clothes.
Sure
It's like if I have my birthday in October at the end of October.
None
And it might be hot and sometimes it might be cold
Yes, like that.
When I tell how is the weather on my birthday and I see some photos I'm with shirts and in other with a sweater
Yes, in my case is not worth
I'm from August and it's always hot
Sure
There is always hot, at least in this area
Sure
What I'm scared about now with the weather is that we've had really good weather in comparison to other years and I don't know what will happen here in February if it will get really cold
Sure
Snow sometimes happens with the chances of the seasons
Yes, you always say, will the weather be good? No, it will be worse. Here people are all pessimists
That it will be the worst year, that it will be the worst
No
It still isn't cold because it will be worse in February. This is what everyone says.
And this is funny because I remember that I had a friend at University who would say to you, I took my
Aurelio from Washington D.C.
Manual from Orlando, I think we spoke these past days, I
It's true Manuel, how are you?
Very well, how are you?
How's everything going, is everything fine?
Everything's fine, yes
That's good
Good, let's get to business, I'm listening
I'll tell you something, these subjects they pick here, i don't
Yes
Breaking up with a partner is something difficult man
Yes
Breaking up, in my experience and what I've seen, it's something that is very hard
It's always hard, whether it's only a casual relationship, or a serious relationship
Yes it's still painful.
Sure. There is always going to be something awkward. It is always going to happen. There is always going to be something that makes people uncomfortable. Do you know what I mean?
I have seen in a many cases, right?, co-workers and friends, where, in fact very close friends, that, right now, they are
They're a couple but, a year ago, one of them was living with us and when his partner broke up with him, that was a mess
It was, the man was completely devastated, i mean, hurt
Yes
Depressed and lost weight,that was a horrible thing
Yes.  I think the same that you.  I cannot talk because of much experience.
More stable
None
Yes, obviously I know cases, even close cases. My siblings and it is a very painful situation and sometimes involves all the family. His as much as hers.
Of course
You should not exlude yourself.
None
No, they didn't exactly say that in the introduction, but I do well, and we have an epidemic of divorces
I was reading that here in the United States the, the statistics show that more than a half the couples get divorced
Imagine that
Definitely, people don't know each other or they are very immature.
Yes I think that too, there is like a, exactly, much immaturity and not only that, is like they go into a marriage as lets say, thinking that it is not a
Not a serious issue. It is a thing that they take lightly, and if it works it works and if it does not work well
They go with that mentality, with that predisposition to end quickly the relationship.
Yes, the family therapists themselves and all the people who are linked to that are alarmed
Of course, yes
But on the other side there are people that I have worked with and known people, especially when I lived in New York.
That say that they are not interested in marriage, or that, both men and women
None
I met people that, women that were, professionals, with a very successful career, that, they're not interested in
Yes
That's very respectable, lets say it's like something that has brought us the evolution of social evolution
The woman's access to the job market.
None
I think it's healthy in the way they know each other
Right
The saddest is to watch someone that doesn't know, cases of women that get married for some reason and that they knew that wasn't their destiny
Yes,
They didn't want to be there, or well, having children
None
That's the saddest
A bit pitiful.  You know what else?  I see a lot of examples where I work, the music
Also homosexual relationships
None
When the couples end, I have a lot of friends that are queer
Yes
Look, i mean, like they where heterosexual relationships, it's the same
No, and, exactly, and just at this show, of Dr. MarÃ­a, Ana MarÃ­a Polo, i don't know you have ever seen it sometime in the
Of course I have seen it.
There was a case, like those, where she pointed a case where even a woman filled a divorce because the husband was
He was, excuse the redundancy, he was gay
I see
She said that there are people that take fifty years to recognize.
Figure that out
Or recognize and then--exactly, there are many casuals.
Sure, it's too much
I think that all go for the same thing, when people assume that compromise, it must be serious, maybe it's not the moment, they are not mature
I think that that maturity
Or lack
It's about maturity. I think the same, it's all about maturity, what people ends to do in that moment
It's done without thinking, they are shopping
Exactly
They liked, and they bought it, and that's it, do you understand?
Exactly, and I say that initial attraction is really common, they magnify it and think that in that moment they really like her
It's forever, but they don't sit to see other things and watch
Sure
If really it's the person they would like to be for the rest of the life, they don't
Sure, that's the difference
Yes, because the first stage of being in love is quick and then there are more important things
Yes, are you married Miguel?
Yes
Oh, me too
Yes.
Me too.
I cant talk on my own experience
None
Yes, I've lived other people's stories close
Yes i have been through about five serious relations I had before I got married
And my wife and I, we will soon be six years married. We have just been six years in December.
Honestly
Not that good, we can't complain, not she or me
Yes
I won't say it is the perfect relation, because you know
No, it doesn't exist.
Doesn't exist
No, and whoever says so is lying, that's it, and there are amny who say
Right
So, you know he is lying.
Sure, we can help each other, but I have seen cases, my parents for instance, my parents divorced, it is a horrible story because
REALLY
It's not horrible. My siblings are always there playing. They say you don't have to be together
None
No, I have
That isn't important to us in fact that never should have been important to us as their children
No, and yes, it's true, and there he is
Second, they already see
Got to a point of no return so that....
My sister is already married and my brother has been married three times already
They touch in their relationship with my parents. I told them why didn't you get divorced since you should have been divorced.
Long before us
That really is how to say to them I hit the nail on the head because that's what's happening
Of course, and he didn't see, and
None
They got divorced, and later got together again.  Then they separated again. I just talked to my mom.  Not much is happening.  She called about two hours ago, and was telling me that.
My dad's new girlfriend called her to insult her
No, but they're like kids again
They are, I'm saying, but what that is more
No but, I think that if you have to cut to the chase, and like the family therapists rightly say when a relationship is toxic.
Exactly
That has to be decontaminated, the separation
Sure
If not definite at least temporary
Better for the healthy, certainly, yes, yes yes, and You know? that doesn't only happen between couples you know that also, that can happen in any type of family relation
None
Type of toxic relations exist between brothers and sisters.
None
Between kids and parents, any of those types of relations that exists, of those things
This, no and what you point out is super important, because later if we repeat it to the couple is that also in the heart of the home there is another type of relation
There too
Sure
People living together and you pointed it out they are very strained relations very hard
Exactly, true, and the majority of the people don't realize that then they live in a quarrel, is
Like a gorilla within the same family, and the people don't even know what it is, and that comes from that type of relation, you understand me?
From toxic relations that happen before between the family, happen between a couple, between friends, also sure the friendship is a different issue because the friendship, the people
Cut off a friendship
Yes,
More easily than a romantic relationship or family because
Family, yes.
I think that everything happens on a level in all on a level that happens I had to once end a relationship
Friendship, but it wasn't something from the other world, also, I mean, we met for like, five years, we met in the University
We had an impass, I said this is not going anywhere if we keep this up.
The hypnosis followed, and it had repercussions in anything, it grew and this is not going anywhere
It's better to cut this on the nice side
Yes
I was, I mean
That it's a decision maturated sure
Sure, because figure out if we are trying to keep a live thing that does not exist, that's the same it happens between couples. Do you understand?
Yes
When I moved here, for example, I left a girlfriend, a really serious one that I had in Venezuela
Really?
I had to left her, because I came her with
The
Here, but I wanted to bring her here
None
Do you understand me?
That's other important thing, the circumstances
Exactly, that was it and in this case, it was the circumstance
Honey
Good evening.
Good evening
Hello, my name's Marco
How are you Marco?, my name is George
I'm in Philadelphia, and you?
I almost can't hear you
Sorry, is this better?
Yes
Okay, I'm Marco and I'm in Philadelphia
And I'm Honey and I'm in Florida.
Breaking up depends on how close it was to begin with.
None
I agree that with age it's easier or more difficult.
Depending on the experiences that you had before, I think that, and yes. With the age, it can be that you react more strongly.
That it's more difficult to break up  sometimes for a long time already living in the world and knowing how it works, and practically hoping for something like this to happen
I don't know why because I have my parents who are basically all ages
Yes
And some not for the age but for maturity, I have people who also you see the point of view for the age that you have, well they stay with partners that they shouldn't
Yes.
Because, he is afraid of starting, or getting alone, or anyone they have
Yes
But, in my experience, I was a teenager and it was easier. You know, I'm up and down
As they got older, it's difficult to know new people
Yes, that's definitively true, but, remember also, that teenagers' emotions are not necessarily strong but
At least, more colorful
Exactly
When, you are a teenager, it's, breaking up with the couple you can imagine a teenager talking about wanting to killing themselves
At that age, it was something strong
How?
If I remember right the loves from high school were more healthy, this was going to be for all life
Yes, yes
I want to be with him, and you get so involved and you didn't sit to analyze the pros and the cons of the situtation
Yes
And after you start growing and getting up earlier with bad experiences, you get more realistic and the situation changes, it's not the same
How would it be, the passion of being in high school was really innocent
I remember my friends, I went out with them and they kept the same girlfriend from three years ago, I thought they were all married 2 years ago but none of them were.
It was like a practice
As you get older, you get experience of not having
The same social activities you had in high school
None
That there were much more people of your same age, basically with your same tastes, then you grow up, you go to work, you meet people from different ages
Yeah, you know, I think that age itself is something
Different
Merely mental because, for example, there are people of old age. Fifty or sixty is not very old, but
That feel like a lot less than that, they feel younger, you always remember the father of that classmate, that came out and played football with us
That the way they
They are young at spirit
That are young of spirit, but at the same time there were people that were twenty years old but who were serious and stayed home and didn't go out
It was like an older people, two person can be together in a relationship or
I find people of my own age very immature after hanging out with a few.
I always, i'm always with, i get along fine with older people too, people, people way older but i always got along, i get along fine with people
Younger, for example, i have some friends, I'm thirty years old, i have some friends that are twenty one, twenty two, that i understand the way they think and i get along fine with them
Very
I can barely hear you.
I'm sorry, i get along fine with younger people, almost as much as older people, like people older than me are almost the same in their behavior
Of several relationships, I once had the brilliant idea to date a person much younger than me. I just turned thirty two...
None
I still refuse age, but thirty two
Yes
He was very mature for everything
Yes
In relation with the relationship ideology. there were somethings that made me look at him like okay What era are you from?
None
Because it did not fit with the age
Yes, yes
You know in relation with business he was very mature. but as to the relationships it was like he didnÂ´t understand because I have children
Yes
And then I had one
None
And was a thing, it was like my head could not explain to him. that you are in an age when the parties do't
Are not so important like when you are twenty.
Yes, of course
I was very happy with my relationship, my home, my son, my partner.
None
Where he was, but sometimes I thought that he wanted to be with his friends and explained to him that thing of the age gap, I understand that you are much younger than me
None
There is a part of your life you have to live and that I have lived.
But if you are going to be in this kind of relationship, you must understand that I am not going to be with you because I have a child.
Of course
Look, you are going to have to choose what is most important for you, I mean, or if you are ready to take this type of relationship, or
You need more timei to live your life.
Yes
I found the biggest difference, and leaving that relationship was much more difficult than any other relationship, because it was a matter
I now have so many years, I'm going to begin, go back to meeting people, it's like returning and I'm going to put it like that
If I live with my fiancee with whom I've been with like four years or something, she has a son, eh, I've been with her since her son was just one year old
She was married briefly, and then divorced, I knew her before she had her son,
The difference is large before and after her son.
It's very different, or is it that before you had your life for you
Yes
This difficult to explain with couples
Yes
Jealousy comes in, a series of things come in, what I'm explaining with age it's easier, it's more difficult for everyone the compromises that that you have to
None
Let's see, for me it's difficult to explain that before I became a mother, I could love you and adore you, but the moment that you interfere, with my relationship with my children, or my ability to be a mother to my children
Yes
You are putting me in the position of choosing between one or the other, and I can guarantee you which one I'm going to choose
Yes.
I've had relationships where I've had to leave because of this
There is no animal that you can come near to their young, it's the moment that is most
Fights harder and the moment it can harm you the most
Do you know what I have seen, generally it is about stupid things that could bother my sonÂ´s father
For example, the girl is two, she is naughty the boy is an angel, he is eleven and better son he could not be
The younger one is sent by the enemy because she knows the bible and is very close to me, and knows she needs attention.
And it is a thing I have to explain, I understand it is bothering, but she is a baby. she will grow up and the naughty behavior will be gone little by little.
I don't understand that relationship at all.
You are talking very low and I can barely hear you
Pardon me,  I have a little problem here with my telephone okay.
Hello, my name is Miriam.
Hello, how are you? My name is George, and I live in New York.
Hello
How are you?
Fine, George, thanks.
Good. Where are you calling from?
I live here in Toron
Where?
In Toronto, Canada
In Toronto?
Yes
Really?
Yes
I went over there like six years ago
We're you by here?
Yes In Louisiana
You didn't like it?
I was studying English there for three months, and you only
I see, how nice.
What do you think of today's topic?
I think that when the relationship is really deteriorated, and there's been a lot of lack of respect, the couples break up.
Yes
There's no trust, it's better to break up.
Yes
But it's very hard making that decision, because sometimes the couple is so used to each other, it is very hard getting out of a
None
Of a circle.
Yes
The people get used to it and the person has to be very strong too
None
To make the decision of leaving
Yes.
The age, I think that already, perhaps when the person is younger, is more
Easier.
Easier breaking up, I would already say that. Because younger you have like more friends, you see the future differently, right.
Yes
Like an older person sometimes thinks that already they are not going to find more.
Yes
Its' already the last
And he's right of down
Because you are older, no one will ever trust this person again.
And what do you think, for example, when there are kids?
Kids, this is really difficult.
Yes
It's a mistake because people sometimes stay together who don't have love, just for the kids
Yes
They actually really hurt the kids.
Hey, you know what?
Tell me.
I've finally found someone who agrees with me.
You agree?
Totally
Yes
That is my point of view.
Yes
I always say sacrifice, what sacrifice. I think that it's sacrificing them.
It's them, because they perceive everything, kids aren't stupid at all.
Yes, they are the most affected.
Yeah,  then they suffer
None
If it's a woman who islike her dad who doesn't love her and doesn't respect her.
The cycle,
You repeat
The chain continues.
Yes, do you think that it repeats?
It repeats, many times it repeats. It's really true that the, the
None
None
Yes
Takes the same, or the children of abusers, abuse themselves and others.
Yes
Abused
None
And abuse the other kids. Many pedophiles have been abused themselves.
Yes, in many cases. Yes.
Sure, so this chain continues, to not be that person
None
Ends in therapy, or goes to a church there
None
There are groups that help.
Yes. What has been your particular experience? I don't know if you want to tell me or something.
Yes, my experience in particular
Have you had?
What I said is I'm a coward,
Yes
I almost see a relationship that doesn't have love or anything.
Yes
In the three, I'm forty, but in the three relationships I've had in my life
None
I didn't finish them. But the relationship has been really
Yes
Already empty of this love, and I waited until the person told me, this is where we've come to.
But did you realize?
Yes, I realized, but it was still pretty hard.
Yes
It's strange. And by a mistake you think you, should keep going.
Yes. They're relationships.
Because
That come in relationships with permission, yes.
Sorry?
There are relations that become sickening.
I don't listen to you
I mean sick relations.
It's true.
Yes, they don't get along and have problems every day. I know children from families of these kind, where they don't get along, but I have seen that the kids suffers the most.
Than, children from separate people, right?
Yes.
Do you currently have a partner?
Well, I'm now separated.
Yes
We were married with kids for six years.
Yes, I see
I, now, I'm now going to a church, a lot
Yes
Then, I think that it's becoming me stronger
None
I took the decision that I can't keep being with him, unless he changes
Yes, where are you from?
I'm from Peru
I see
And you
Me, Colombian

The topic, that we are going to be hang
Yes, I understand you
It does not matter
That's bad, with all those wasted, I had some friends, but they moved somewhere else
I see
Yes no, really I think that, that we agree on the topic. I think that it's one of the few people with which I've been in agreement.
Tell me about your experience then
Yes, I think No, the same. We're in the same situation. Three times
That's it, now, and are you sepparated?
Yes Exactly the same situation
You're separated And do you have kids?
Yes.
None
I have always said no I think that you should not sacrifice them. That's a tall tale.
None
None
How many kids do you have?
Yes I have five.
Five?
Yes, because, like I've had three, I've had two, two, and one.

That's good, that is
Yes
Good, it's a shame what happened, what they couldn't understand
None
Their children are a great comfort, right?
No, yes, and I don't know. In your particular case, you understand yourself with your ex-partners later, or not?
The first two partners, I never saw them again
Yeah
Nothing happened, I didn't have kids
Yeah
Unfortunately, my sonÂ´s dad, I have to see him, all the time. And argue, and fights and all that.
No, thatÂ´s, thatÂ´s really awkward
Then it's enough. But that will have to wait until my son grows up.
Yes
Until my son.
No, I mean, I, relationships have been really
Really what?
They've improved
Improved?
Later, after all the problems, you have a good relationship
Some people can't live together
None
TheyÂ´re, uhmm, pretty incompatible
Yes
I have sister that, she has huge fights with her, with her husband

None
No, they talk to us, but then I try to get along
Yeah, that
Right?, and how long have you been over there?
That's good, what?
How long have you been there in Toronto?
I can't hear you, I don't know if you
How long have you been in Toronto?
It's, ten years
Ten years?
Ten years
Yes.
I can't find a job that i like. Lately I've been working in
Yes
That finish, because they're just contracts and nothing else, and after that i have to find
Yes
I'm unemployed now
Yes
Some of the jobs are ridiculous and pay little.
What are you gonna do about it?
And so, it's a little tough
Yes
And you, how is it going over there?
No, for me, fine. Since the beginning, like always no, as it happens to all of us, no. But now fine. I'm a, a systems engineer, and I've been with the Internet, and all that.
Things are going well
None
How did you find out about this program?
I also once went on the Internet, looking for work, and I saw it there. I applied,
For one, in what site did you see it?
I think that it was in Cool Joe
Okay, well.
I couldn't say one hundred percent. It was in that or in Joe Cool
How many calls have you made?
I'm just in, I think that it's already the eighth one.
Really?
I should be close to eight or nine.
We are, more or less, the same in that also
And you?
I'm also like by there, everywhere. Yes
Will they pay?
Yes, of course
Are you counting the calls?
Yes you well
Hello.
Yes, hello?
Hello. What's up? My name is Felicidad.
Hello. My name is Blanca and I live in Arizona.
How are you? I live in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Uh-huh. I live in Phoenix in the Mirage
Where are you from?
From Colombia.
From Colombia
Yes.
I'm from Argentina.
Yes. I can tell. In the tone of your voice.
None
None
Yes. The topic was the break up of couples.
Yes. So difficult
I don't know, what do you think?
I think I spoke about the same topic last week.
Neither.
They repeat right
It could be If you want to we can talk about something else
No it's ok. I don't have a problem. I don't have a problem talking about this.
Good.
What do you think about breaking up?
It's always difficult to break up with someone.
Something happens or the person did something to you It's always difficult.
None
I suppose that it has, it's more complicated when you're older than when you're younger. Because things change. No, no.
Go on.
It doesn't seem to me that any moment is easy. For me it never was easy to break up with someone.
Yes, I think the same. No, it's not easy. It's never easy, breaking up with someone. Where there's a long term relationship, because I think there are very volatile relationships.
That are like that.
Yes.
Temporary and not for anything. But I also think that you. It's very difficult and more so if you're young.
Sure.
Right?
None
It's more difficult to do when you're young.
Yes.
It's very difficult. You have to learn, to live, with what happens in life
Yes, I think it gets more complicated when you break off with a couple
When you haven't been with that person too long, or when there are no children to think of,  it will always be easier. It is different when you have
Been married for years, I figure it can get much more complicated
I'll tell you about my own experience. I have been married for five years, and I only stayed with my husband.
Yes
We were boyfriends five months before we got married, but I'd had two long term boyfriends before.
Was my first boyfriend
Yes
And it was very hard for me to break off with him, actually I didn't do it, it was him that broke off with me when coming here and so
It caused me a terrible crisis. But it was because I was very young, very immature
None
I thought he was my one and only love
Sure
Now, with this one I broke off six years ago, before coming here. I was the one that broke the relation, and I think that
It didn't hit me so hard, actually I didn't feel it at all
None
It is because you are already mature, you have the experience, the capability of deciding what is good for your life, what is bad, what benefits you, what doesn't
Although there is love, you think more with the head than with the heart when there is
Sure
Maturity, because when you are young, I almost died with my first boyfriend
Sure, in all ways, everything more passionate than with
More intense, right?
Sure. The first experience helped you manage it.
Yes, for all these things.  They help a lot, they help a lot.
Sure.
This helps a lot. I think that, yes it's difficult to break up. Whatever the circumstance, but there are factors that help it to be more bearable than others.
Yes. I agree with what you say. So in breaking up I don't have. I'm married here four years
Yes you're right. This is easier, when you had an experience when you already know what you want and these things
None
Yes.
Yes.
It makes sense.
It's not that I'm twenty two, I'm speaking from my experience. It can be that for other people, it's not as easy.  It can be that
That the first love was something without feeling that has arrived and then another that fills it more.
Sure.
It will be more difficult for that person.
Sure.
Getting out of this relationship. This also has to be taken into account.
Sure. Sure.
Because there are many things. I think that there are many things. It could be yes, it could be no. It's difficult for a person to get out of a relationship. It depends on so many things.
Sure. And you have been married for four or five years?
It will be five years, yes.
Look, and do you have children?
I have two babies
How nice
I have two babies, a boy that is three years old
None
The girl is one year and a half
What are their names?
Alejandro and Elizabeth
Beautiful names
I have two crazy dwarfs there
None
They are crazy like myself
Do you enjoy being a mother?
I am happy. I am happy of being mother. I was mother very old. I am already thirty-seven years old, so I was mother old already
Yes
I already lived my time
Sure
I went to university, I graduated. I head my time for myself, and afterwards, when I had already graduated and realized myself as a professional, then
Because you don't always realize But at least I have already finished my studying objective
Sure
The first part of it, right? I still have one more part. I decided to have my babies,
Yes. Sure, more or less the same happens to me. I have been married for four years. I am twenty-seven, twenty-six years old
None
I haven't finished studying yet. But I've always thought that as soon as I finish studying I will have a child. And yes, with a station similar to yours, but some time ago
None
So, yes, we will see it
Yes
We will see what happens
I didn't marry before for the same reason, because I thought, marrying implies devoting to the husband, and having children
Sure
Start the arguments because you don't want to have children yet and I feel like I want to live
Sure
I lived, I enjoyed, did my stuff and I formed myself professionally and afterwards, luckily I got married
Yes
I, let me tell you, I as a matter of fact came to this country escaping from marriage, because i came on my own
None
It was a senseless relation, kind of
Sure
You know, I came here, like, running away from it and it turns out that I hadn't even been here for a year when I met my husband. And after a few days, we moved in together, and five months later, we married.
That's very odd
After all those years of relationships, with two previous boyfriends that were my previous relationships
Right
None.
Yes, but you found him and that's it
And that's it.
And
He was the one
Very well
He's keeping them for me here.
No, I got married young and we came here together
None
We kinda started a life together but before marrying, we agreed not to have children. my husband knows that
I want to finsh my career and get a degree.
Yeah
I'd like all of that before if possible. If they come than that's perfect. I love...
None
Children, but yes, I can plan it better.
Sure
None
Look, it's very difficult, believe me, it's very difficult.
Yes,
I have dedicated to my children. I have had the luck but it's very hard when I have wanted to do something at this time but I think about the kids.
How I'm gonna leave them, what i'm leaving, what i'm going to do... a lot of things.
Yes
Very hard
I'm gonna work
No, i don't work
None
I don't work
It is okay.
I'm here at home with my children all the time
Do you like to be with the kids?
Well, at this time, i love to be with them at this age
They're certainly fun
I think that these are the most important years, so I thought, I already worked, I worked until i got pregnant
I said, lets go, and when i was halfway through my first pregnancy, i said i'm not gonna work anymore, my husband told me no
Stop working already, and I went home, stayed, had the kids, and there
I'm still at home, but i want to do something
Sure
I want to study now, like doing a specialty or something, because there's always, like you still miss something
I thought it was over but no, you always want something else.
Yes, of course, and you surely have met at the kindergarten, at school and other stuff, right'
I'm starting to be alright, alone and that, i say, a time where they
Sure
I can work. I'll do something for myself
Sure
Yeah. I [was] very [interested] in the first years, but later on when the went to school and kindergarten
You can dedicate to yourself again a little bit
Yes, and my mom says the same thing,  she stopped working when she had us, i have two more sisters, the three of us
None
My youngest sister was eleven, twelve or thirteen years old and she was like yeah, you're old
That she didn't had to do, because she had nothing else to do since
None

How nice, and where do you live?
Yes,
None
I'm sorry?
Where do you live?
In Manhattan
Manhattan, that's good, so we both live here in New York, and how do you like it, what do you think about receiving phone calls?
Fine
Do you want them to call you and bother you at any time trying to sell you stuff?
Yes
Well, so, what do you think?
It's good
Yes
What do you think?
I think it bothers me, and I don't want them calling me at any time selling me crap I don't want to buy, if I want
I'll go and find it, not you calling me and bothering me
Right
On the internet, do you like to receive offers too?
A little bit, yeah
Yeah, and have you bought something over the internet?

None
You don't have, don't worry that they can get your private information or
Yes,
You've also bought things by phone when they have called you
No
No, okay, how nice And what else, what do you think because we have to talk a while, and if you are only going to say yes or no without giving your opinion
None
Hello?
Yes,
Hold on a moment?
Yes,
Hello!
Yes,
Hello, how are you?
Yes.  How are you?
My cousin says: what's the topic?

Of the spam
None
No, I don't like them too much

Eating
You have to, and they charge the calls
Yes, exactly, so then we covered email, and we covered the telephone.
Yes
And what else
You answer them And then hang up?
I do answer and then I hang up because I don't want.
We are eating, and it bothers me that they are bothering me when I'm eating
And right now they made this call to you
What?
Yes, right now, they called, were you having lunch?
Not yet, I have long around seven in a little bit the starts are just beginning this one
I'm participating in this research, so when I see the number on Caller ID, I pick up
None
So it's a bit different from when I get other calls, and I receive calls at night, mostly when I'm sleeping, and we often go to bed early.
They will call you around nine in the evening.
Yes,
Yes.  It's a bit of a problem.  It's a bid hard.
I don't like to be called at night, because sometimes I'm worried I don't know where are getting my number from.
They exchange numbers with other people and they buy lists. It's kind of dangerous because you have personal information.
That bothers me too, but you've got to be careful with your stuff and don't give too many information over the phone because there are lots of evil people out there
None
How long have you been here from Chile?
About fifteen years
Really, that's good, so, you already are, have you lived in Manhattan your whole life since you first got here?

Hi, good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
Yes, my name is Sean. I'm speaking from Toronto, Canada.
How are you? This is Manuel speaking, I'm in Orlando, Florida.
Orlando, Florida. How is it over there in Orlando?
None
None
Although, at night, in this season it's lower. But, obviously not so much as in the North.
I lived for a few months an hour to the East of Orlando, over ther by where the Kennedy Space Center is.
I'm at about two
Very good.
Near, yes.
Yes.
Yes, there's a very nice beach to the North, right by Kennedy.
Yes, I think it's a nice beach.
Yes,It's like all virgin, well without anything that is Nothing
Yes.
Not shops, no restaurants. Only, virgin land, it's, it's, I think it's the prettiest thing that, that I saw when I was in Florida.
I have been there  well it's that one the one that you I think it's that one very quiet a place that's very quiet.
Yes. One has to pass, near a, near a reserve of the, of
W-we-
For the animals and nature to get to the beach.
It's correct.
Yes.
Good, entering in the material, Sean, I hear, tell me, what are your thoughts?
On what?
About the material, about the topic of the day.
About the topic, I almost didn't notice it, I almost never talk about the topic. They told me that it's only a suggestion, that's all.
What's the topic?
The spams
None
About spams, if you've ever bought something from unwanted emails.
No, i almost always delete them.No? Never, i don't even read them,they almost always have an attachment,and some virus.
That can be, that can damage. No?
Correct-
Yes, have you bought something through spam?
Yes I make many transactions on the internet, but never from span. I'm also really afraid of them.
No.
My account is with AOL. They have a distinct series of optional features.
They come nevertheless, you're not safe. And well, obviously, the mail whose origin I don't know, I erase it.
Right
They ask if there should be a program similar to don't call, i don't know if it exists in Canada, there was a program
You sign up, and after that, they don't call to offer you anything over the phone
Yes, yes.
I have it and I think it's excellent, they should do the same with the e-mails
Yes, it works, it's not a scam itself, they they just gather your phone numbers to request
To request, at the request of everyone that signed up to this... to not receive calls
I couldn't stand the phone call here to my house phone, offering me a series of things I don't need. I was sick of it
I signed up and, of course, they never called me again.
Right, i don't know in Canada
I think that with the spammers, there's a mafia behind that.  There are people who are earning a lot of money
And they don't want to stop it, because, imagine
Yes
It's millions and millions of spam that they drop everyday all around the world, we all get them.
Yeah, can you imagine the traffic, the internet resources that, that they need just to, for spam
Yes
Yes, that's a
And
How do you say?
On the other hand, i think it's also very unfair, to me, that they're making money on your data, with your data, your address, your stuff
You don't perceive any of this. so, they pay us a percentage too, to manage all this personal data.
Yes, for example, I don't know, the United States, ask for your social security number if they want some paperwork from the bank, some paperwork from
From, whatever, wherever it's necessary.
Right. Exactly. Because, it's, there's another more serious case that can be associated with this, this topic, and that's identity theft, that this, here
Every time, more dangerous. Many people have been victims of this identity theft.
Yes
I don't see that they're working, really, many, with respect.
None
You know that they're completely mafia companies, people who are making a lot of money with this.
Yes, I.
Stealing identities, and buying everywhere
Yes, and yes, I think, someone has to be making money, I don't know, there are many people who are assholes, who
Much money, yes.
It's worth it that I'm going to grow a meter if I buy these pills
This are. yes, no one had, to ask, there money, there wasn't
I see that there are still many people who are really deluded, really innocent.
None
How is it possible that they call me, X, an they say, you have just won a cruise, that costs five thousand dollars, it starts
Please, give me all your data, including the name of your card, How will I do this? One moment. It's obvious that no one is going to give me a cruise.
Yes.
And, and there are people that fall for it, because we see it in the news, people that let themselves get scammed.
None
I Honestly don't understand how they can be so gullible.
I have some friends that have some timeshare left.
That is very different, yes, very different.
They give you a vacation, but you have to be in a, for three hours so that
No.
None
That, is very different, because I also have acquaintances in those programs. They pay an annual fee
None
And they are supposed to register for the place they want, they have selected it months before so they take them into account. That is not that
If I decide to go to Mexico today, I can be there in eight days but will not get anything due to the people ahead.
None
Is very different. The truth is that I don't know. You are there in Canada, in what city did you tell me?
I came here for vacation but I live in Vancouver British Columbia.
Really? And, do you have Latin American origin, or do your parents?
Yes, part, half, from my mother.
None
But I grew up, almost, purely here in Canada. But, also there in Mexico, in the -DF, in, and in Acapulco, I lived and studied.
You've been around a lot.
Yeah, and where are you from?
I'm from Colombia. I'm an immigrant. I've been living here for nine years now.
Right
I lived in New York and now, a year ago, here in Orlando
Why, did you, did you, did you find it better there in, in, in Florida than in New York?
I had problems with the weather.
None
I had a lot of problems with the cold, I started getting a severe allergy, that degenerated into asthma, so, well, that's when the doctor advised me to search for a warmer weather
None
I was there for seven, almost eight years until I decided to move here. The weather is an improvement and much better.
No, New York City is unbelievable, i love it, that's, that's why it's the world's capitol, right?
Yeah, i don't know that, i have to know that, I'm very eager to, to see it
It's wonderful, too bad about the weather,
Right
It's an amazing city, there's so much to do, so much to see, the cultural life is intense. I find it amusing.
Specially now, they say that in Christ- in Christmas, New York City Gets more
Yes, and in New York you see people from all over the world, from wherever, and just by using the subway
You're there watching the world resume, you turn to the sides and see people of every colors, of every size and every expression
It's very funny
Yeah, here in Toronto it's almost the same, right?, but not, not so big. There's people from everywhere in Toronto
Yes, i love all of that, the, the diversity
Yes. It can cause trouble if they keep to themselves in a neighborhood.
They don't hear from the outside world. And that's why the new immigrants come here and they don't learn English well, and after that they don't know the resources
Yes
That are there to help them.
Yes, but there are also programs to correct that or, i mean, to assimilate them in some way, not to let yourself get run over, rolled over
Right
I think that you have to preserve your essence.
Yes.
Yes, there are many cultures that prove it.
None
Whatever corner of the world he's at, he's a Jew, but anyway, he assimilates his environment, for what it's worth. The language, the costumes.
In his private being, he's still a Jew
Yes
The world would be really boring
Yes. The problem in France is the other extreme.
No
That they're completely isolated ?
Because, it's terrible that you also see it here sometimes, what they call ghettos. But you know, that's more because of the lack of opportunities, it's because the people is being rejected since they're little.
Right
People getting put into a corner, and, and the governments have done a little bit to end that. So, they're still being exploited heavily.
Yea.
But, it hasn't been so, that they've wanted, it's that they've been obligated to do that,
And because of economic factors or
There are some people who are really racist and that discrimination is really ugly.
Yea. Yes, more than anything
No. It's people, to me it doesn't seem to matter a lot, the color of your skin doesn't matter. More important
The most important is what's inside, your values, the way you see the world, and all that.
Yea, that's the problem, like that with the with hunger, and, and, and the, and poverty
Hello, Aurelio from Washington -DC
Adrian's speaking from Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
Hi, how are you?
Yes. fine, and you?
Very good thanks.
A little cool by Washington
It is cold now. The cold is very pleasant.
Yes, more than pleasant is a little painful but
I can imagine.
Yes
Look, and have you ever bought something by, through this type of marketing?
No, nor do I intend to either.
Pardon?
I don't intend to either, I never did it, nor will I ever do it.
I've received many offers of buy here
To buy Viagra
That's another thing. Buying Viagra.
And
Or enlarge your
Your penis, yes
Big your penis.  Look it returned too much. Every day, I receive, tons of those emails. And
Yes, my wife always tells me, why do they send me this, if I don't have a penis
My wife also tells me the same thing. My female co-worker says the same thing. Why do we have to receive this?
If we don't even have a penis.
To enlarge it, yes.
I have bought things on the internet, but not because they have sent them by, what they call in English spam
I get on the internet and buy things. You understand me?
Yes, in normal things, yes.
Sometimes, you know that another thing, that they send me a lot, mortgage offers.
Yes
Yes, that do your mortgage, what I already do is erase it, I don't pay attention to it. imagine, if one starts paying attention to those things, forge it.
One goes crazy.
No, the problem is that someone buys from them, if not they wouldn't do it, is for sure someone has to buy from them.
You think somebody buys from them? I don't, look, I really don't know anyone who has bought
If not, they would stop doing it. Yes, if not it would be, if not, if not it would be some one hundred thousand, some, I don't know, of how much, of a million
Somebody has to buy from them. They wouldn't waste the time and effort in sending all those emails.
Certainly, you're right, because is true, if not, they wouldn't send them, exactly.
I suppose that it is like, that it's like the illegal drugs, that any other
That
Kind of strange thing. If there is no if nobody bought it the problem wouldn't exist, right
Exactly, you are right, you are right, yes, yes, yes. I'll tell you what, I guess they send millions of that kind of messages, right?
If they send one million and the one percent answer, then we are talking of how much, one thousand?
Yes
Or ten thousand?
Ten thousand
Ten thousand, figure
It's a lot.
Right, a lot, right, you are right
At five dollars each, it is a lot
Listen man, this is incredible. The other day, I don't know, I'm gonna tell you a story, because,something very interesting happened to me.
The other day I got one of those messages. This one to buy something, I don't remember, I think it was a telephone service. But I just got the message
I didn't pat any attention to the message. One month later, I get the telephone bill in my office,
And there is a charge. Twelve dollars, for voice-mail service. So I called and told them, look this and that, you are charging me this service
That we don't have. Yes, that is a service that Aurello ordered on the Internet. I told him no, I haven't ordered anything.
Yes, you did.  Then they started looking for the records they had, and told me, yes, we sent you a message and then you
Ordered, and I said no, I didn't order anything, all I did was deleting the message. when you delete it our computer automatically
Takes your data and charges you for it.
Have it here, and I have never used it, so please I am not going to pay for this. But look, that's how they are doing it. I didn't even
What company is the one that did that?
I didn't open it, I just deleted the message, and their computer automatically takes my data.
No, I don't think so. What happened was that those emails, they are more than spam. It's a scam of some sorts, but
Sure yes it has to be that's why.
The email says, if you don't reply we will activate it
I called and immediately deactivated it because they keep on charging me twelve dollars a month.
They were charging me for a service that I supposedly had signed up for.
Voice mail for my phone, I didn't even own a phone at home.  In my house we don't have a phone, we only have cellphones, my wife and I
This service was being charged to a telephone bill from my job, a voice mail service for my home, I don't even have one!
And I said, no, this is a mistake, please, and they were like yes we are sorry, it's a mistake, we've made a terrible mistake.
We've made a terrible mistake, she told me. So, please, forgive us, this no, you don't have to pay, don't pay and I said, but of course I'm not going to pay
I'm calling so that you take out those charges so that you know that I won't be paying and that's when they did it.
You have the account, imagine if they do this with ten thousand little mistakes of around twelve dollars per month
Exactly, it's a lot of money.
Like the amount is so big,
It's a small amount of money for the the the each transaction
Exactly, yes
That's how they make money, all the telephone companies
Sure, sure.
With minutes and seconds
Yes, two minutes and seconds, men, it sucks,  let me tell you hey, one thing, haven't you, no, haven't they send you things like,
They send them to you and automatically charge you for them?
'm very careful with with that type of thing, and i try to always read everything and
None
Understand if, if contracting some service ask, forty times  I'm a bit bothered with that type of thing.
Or if it's true or not
Yes, and I try to not go about contracting things because always the problem is to unsubscribe, and
Of course.
To have three months free you have to have three months to unsubscrube and spend three months calling.
No, yes.
On the phone to cancel the service.
Exactly, there is always a trick there. Always, they always look for Yes, hear one thing.
No, it's what I
Where do you live?
Toronto.
In Toronto, that's in Canada. I didn't know that people in Canada were involved in this study as well.
You see that they didn't, you see that they didn't get enough people in the United States and started to send mails here as well.
I see, they signed you up by means of email, they sent you an email message?
No, I found it on Craigslist.
Craigslist, yes, that's where I also found it. okay.
It was published in Montreal
None
In Canadian cities too.
That's fine because I got it right there too but in my city, here in Washington
Yes, the
Yes
My wife said, they are not going to pay you anything, and it's all a lie but
None
None
Oh, you see, no, I don't, this is my first time. In fact, I spoke with one of the coordinators, I think that
She told me that she was coordinating this program, I talked to her and she said no. Yes, this is serious.
It's a legal program
I spoke with
She liked it because it was interesting, in fact, I've spoken with so many people from some many different countries and in very different circumstances it's really intersting.
I spoke with a couple of guys from the University of Pennsylvania, that were studying there and they told me that they alwaysdo this, that they did a similar program last year.
They have to tape thousands and thousands of hours and they use the conversations to train voice recognition systems
None
Yes, when you speak on the phone and they ask you to please say what you want to do, say if you want to talk with I don't know what, with turkeys.
None
They need people with different accents, people that speak at different speeds and people talking about different subjects
I can't imagine training the machines.
That's what they told me. That's one of the things they use it for. They have government grants. They have the money to do it.
That's incredible, look
I want to finish this call.
Imagine that. It's been a while since I went into my account to know how it is, because I've been travelling and I haven't had the time
Let's say, get in the computer and see how much time, and how many calls I've made, or something like that, the truth is i haven't done that for a while
I have
I will finish next week, that's for sure
How many are they? It's twenty calls max.
None
Twenty five
Yeah, so i have three more left
You're ready mate?
Yeah, I'm getting close, where were you born?
I am from Caracas, Venezuela
I believe you are the first Venezuelan I've spoken to.
Yes, where are you from, Argentina?
Yes, exactly
Ok yes
It shows, it clearly shows
It shows in your accent, yes, it shows in your accent, accent
Have you been living here long?
Kid's accent.
I was going to say of a Caribbean, I was by there.
Mine yes, of course, is accent
Yes
Inge
Hi, who is this?
Inge
What's up? This is Maria Ines.
Hi, Maria Ines. How are you?
Everything's fine. Where are you from?
I'm from Chile
From Chile, I'm from Argentina, we're neighbors
I thought you were from Argentina, I recognized your voice tone
Does it show that much?
Your accent,to us Chileans it does, and, did you know i was from Chile?
I'm listening to you, when you told me the name, i realized that you surely weren't from Argentina
Sure
No, I didn't know where, now that I'm talking I do
That's so funny
I'm telling you, I know more Chileans now that I'm in the United States than there are in Argentina, where we're so close
Yes
I don't live very close to Chile, but it's hilarious, I met a lot here, where in the United States are you?
I'm in Maryland
In?
Maryland
No
Is the west coast.
Ah, how nice.
The East coast
I'm on the other side, I'm in Philadelphia.
Then we are near.
Coast?
East.
I understood west, yes
At first I said west, but then I corrected myself.
And what state are you in?
No, I'm in Montgomery.
Mongo
In Maryland
No, I don't know much about the geography of the United States. I don't know anything.
Yes, Philadelphia is like four hours from here.
Nearby.
Yes, near
Have you been here in the United States for a long time?
A little over four years, and you?
A year and a bit.
You like it? Are you used to it?
She like to my teach
I really don't want to get used to it that much
Yes.
I came for two or three years,
None
I came for a job.
Perfect.
So, no. You came to stay?
Yes, I have my family here.
None
Yes, my husband and my son.
You'll stay, you have kids here. Americans
One of three years and one of five years.
How nice.
Yes
It's the sweetest age. I have little nephews so I don't have kids yet, but it's the age where they're starting to talk. At three, they're devine.
Yes, they're exquisite. They're the best there is. The topic was
Yes, that subject.
Yes, the subject of
Yes
Of people who speak on the phone offering goods
Yes
That you don't want, yes, have you ever bought any of them, in that situation.
None
Sure.
There were, but I couldn't hang up. They wanted to sell me an insurance or something and I wasn't even  paying attention because I was doing other things.
Yes.
Doing something else and not actually listening? so, I told him yes to everything and then I realized he was about to charge me for it and I was like no no no!
That was the only time it happened by phone, but it's pretty common by email
Everything.
Yes
I can't see the  registered address
Yes,that's bad
Did that happen to you too?
Yes, it happened to me once, I would get all kinds of offers but, in yahoo for example, it has some options in which they can't, no spam
You can register?
Yes.
Of the different things, but is a bother because one wastes time.
Yes
You have to look at the mail and all that.
And also but see, you put the filter, and by there later they filter the messages that you do want to receive
Exactly, yes
Is an issue, and with the mail also
Yes
You open the mailbox in your house and you find a bunch of envelopes. It makes you super happy and it is all advertisements.
Yes, it's a bother.
That
Yes, but
I don't know. In Chile does it also happen, that they send you by mail, by paper and things?
Not by phone. I think that the people in Chile, would not receive those things that too well
Sure.
Let's say they wouldn't have an option
None
Because is bad manners calling you house by phone to offer something
None
Then
No in Argentina they call a lot, they are quite annoying, yes.
How boring.
They call you by cellphones a lot.
None
Promotions of shared times, it's seen in different places around the world too.
Of course.
And they are jerks, they do not let you to say no, yes, she is interested and doesn't hang up, see it, they keep talking and you have to be rude and hang up, becuase
Yes
It is awesome.
They don't let you choose another option.
He is an employee that has to
Not because he likes it, but because it is the job he found
Exactly, yes.
Then I try to be good, see it, but
None
If it happened to me, I would not like all the people treating me badly but it happens.
Yes. yes, yes,I donÂ´t remember to buy something offered to me in that way
I never thought that.
No, I think that
Because they have to offer you something you were looking for, that you are interested in, because if not only by talking on the phone donÂ´t
At last you pay attention and then you look for it in another place, because I like you would be afraid to buy something on the phone.
Sure.
I don't know because I never did it.
Yes.
No
According to the culture of my country, it is an indicator of a bad education that they call your home phone offering you something you did not ask for.
Sure.
I think they shouldn't do this.
Sure, no.
Suddenly you're eating or doing something or you're busy and you have to answer
Yes, you know what happened with the people from the bank, it had just arrived because I'd bought the computer from the internet
None
I was excited, and when you're opening it, you're so excited to see and then the telephone rings. I didn't know who it was for so I'd left it for the answering machine. I saw how you answered it and said no.
This women calls, I want to go and see my computer, funny
Yes.
They're pretty annoying, truly.
Yes, and you haven't bought anything either from
No. They call me less in Argentina. Many of the people there do not have telephone.
What I get is a lot of mail, envelopes, cards.
Another thing
It's annoying.
Yes, that's terrible because it
I don't know how many credit cards are offered to me each day and then denied.
Sure, the worst thing is that they give you different, I mean, every month I get the same things so it's like, I didn't answer the first fifty times.
They send it again
Sure, I, Capital One doesn't even know how to send it to me, the last time they sent me an enveloped, what's this? Nothing, it had the same letter as before and I was like.
They are really creative, yes, they send
To
An envelope with your name handwritten in it.
Really?
The last thing that they sent me was a, it looked like a newspaper ad with information from the, it had to do something with a car
You see all the profits that they are making and their market share and how cheap they are but
It's an ad, it's not really a newspaper article.
Yes, yes, yes.
It's quite funny, the way they try to catch your attention
Why? I think they should do some research before sending it. They must have, but I don't feel like buying them
Me neither.
The things that they sent me, they tried to confuse me
Yes, exactly, it's like
I mean
They are invading my privacy I think you have to handle those things, it's a lot of crap
Yes.
All those things that you receive maybe sometime in your life you're going to buy something
And for sure the day you're going to buy. Surely you already threw it away and you will end up buying from another place because as you were saying, what is the chance that just on that day in which you get the envelope
You're in the mood to buy that, or the need to buy that
Sure.
It's
There's people that read the ads and they think
Sure. Maybe I dont't know, one that wasn't raised here, but there should be someone, I don't have American friends to ask them, but
You were born here. It's like they are more cued up because you got used to it from early on.
Yes.
The truth is that I don't know.
Yes, it could be. What we set up on the phone is a filter now.
That's what they told me.
Yes, that you see on a screen when someone is calling you.
Sure.
If it tells you that the number is hidden, the number is from a company and I don't answer. I let the machine answer.
Sure.
Because it was exasperating
And then they told me that there was an internet page where you can sign up.
Yes, I didn't
Yes, and you put it there so they don't send you, I think, I don't know if it's by mail or phone, but I think that it's by phone,
None
They don't call you
I know that there's this too but
None
I didn't do it.
No, I didn't look for it because it happened to me one time by telephone. I'm also not at home very much, so if
They call me but yes, I know it exists a friend of mine did it.
Yeah, yes.
They drove her crazy and she did it and they only call
It worked?
People want to sell her something and they put it in her bank. the bank has the right to call her.
Sure.
Yes to the rest.
Yes, for example the last time, what bothered me the most is that we have a line with Verizon
Yes.
They called me on the phone, sent me things by mail. They came to my house and rang the bell.
No.
What are they called? I don't remember the name of
Internet?
No. They put the fiber optic.
None
Sure.
Is
With fiber optics, no.
None
I'm not going to change my mind. Please, no.
Are they going to ring the doorbell in your house? It's the last thing I needed, I hadn't heard it yet.
The day before yesterday
None
It was cold outside, I felt very bad for him
Yes, poor guy
He told me what they offer and yes, but no.
The majority of places they go there must not be anyone else
Sure, imagine, poor man going around like that in that way
I don't know
But like you say, they must make money some way, they must make their
And I think so, I imagine so, because if not, it must really be costly to, pay a person to go
Ringing the doorbell I don't know.is brilliant that yes, one feels a little invaded with
Yes.
Lets say this that the bank call me once ina while to ask my opinion about something
I have a complaint. I'm going to call you
Yeah, don't worry, they'll call you
Don't bother, besides they have your number here, your office's
Right
They call me at the office
None
You don't say stop, I'm working, i don't want to tell you if i like the checkbook or not
Yes
It's a plot, yes, it bothers me more or less
Yes
I don't know.
Yes
I don't know
From work, they bother you at work too? Let's say, you get things related to work, that they want to sell you stuff, or things, yes or no?
They come to the lab where I work to offer a service, a product or give free samples
But, it's not heavy
Yeah
No, there is no truth.
It seems that's not a type of massive sale then.
They come once a month.
No, they are desperate.
And they are companies
It gives me the impression.
Good night
I am Manuel, how are you doing
My name is Marcos
Yes it is okay
I am in Philadelphia and you?
How did you say?
I am in Philadelphia.
No, in Miami
In Miami. Hello how are you?
Well, thanks.
Lets see pardon me unfortunately I am in the middle of something didnÂ´t hear exactly which was the topic?
It is about unsolicited emails. Spams
None
None
Lets see it do you use electronic mail
Yes
I imagine you receive spam.
Not so much
No not a lot.
No because I donÂ´t receive too much, very few of them in the past it happened to me with another mail but now I have not authorized anyone
I receive some three or four from discos only
How nice it is, let's see.
None
I use the net a lot
None
I use the computer a lot too and it is a problem, a serious problem, I have ways of dealing with this problem
None
I have for example different filters I use. Which is a way to report that basically that way
That way they throw out the
Yes right?
That's a good system
Yes, a lot of advertisement.
There's simply too much, there's no way of
None
There's no way of stopping because it's not even a question that your address is in the open.
I'll be back in a bit sure eh it's not even a question of that they leave in the open the address of the electronic mail but that they use back
Use programs that are sending electronic mail to random accounts
None
Servers in reality don't send you only mail that is to your address
Your address
None
It sends it because it takes it for granted that perhaps is misspelled
Probably yes no
Then that way and it's received. I receive my name is Marcos I receive electronic mail for Marcia for Emanuel, for Michell
None
That goes to the server that I use
None
None
In putting some sort of like a stamp that cost that there's a cost
For each sent
So that there's a cost for the electronic mail
Yes I understand
I see that would be a good idea but not that it's a cost for sent mail because that's ridiculous.
Is an animal but free is something
And besides, it's not free because you pay for it
No that is precisely the problem
Nobody has free internet, right?
What?
Nobody has free internet since you pay for the monthly service
Not necessarily
You paid the university's tuition in some way you pay it indirectly
Yes indirectly or directly we are  using it from one place to another
Sure the same someone pays it right? is not you, someone pays for you
But, for example with the spam what they do is that specifically because the electronic mail for example if you send
To the other electronic mail or receive you don't pay either way
No
You don't pay if there is a cost even if it's a marginal cost. That is not a thing of a matter of
Let's say for the access to be able to send email you have to pay a dollar a month
When the ones that send the spam arrive to your mailbox is costing you money
And it is costing you money, they are wasting or stealing your it, in which, it becomes a legal matter. Therefore, it can be attacked, meaning, you can
You can fine the person who's sending the spam but the problem now
It doesn't cost you anything to receive that garbage. You don't have to complain.
Pornographic spam that for example there's a basis that is that if your mail gets to a person who's under age
Then, you are breaking the law. In that way they were able to attack that instead of having an explicit spam, with explicit sexual notations
Instead what they do, is send things that don't offend but rather it simply fills up your mailbox with garbage but Is that they do it as if it was that
Is costing you money in which case is a theft. Start attacking that. Also, there's not that much already.
There's still a lot of spam and explicit sex but is not as popular like before for that reason precisely because is a
None
They legally can attack the person
I don't know if they should charge
Yes
None
I always thought that no
I think that if it's free it's better because there are many people who can pay but in other places, no.
Methods of communication and education it seems that
It's not a dollary a month but a cent a month. The objectives is that it's a cost so they can legally
They can persecute those who send spam because they don't need, even if you buy something from spam, that you're seeing.
Yes it's the only one time that you see that for the doubts, yes
Really follow one of the links and then the server will show that a person visited it and that's the only thing they pay for
By hit
Not by visit
They only need you to accidentally go and see
None
Then you'll also see if you go to a place that has a very similar name to another, for example hotmail
None
Yes. It's what you write. for example, I say Hotmail instead of ail
None
I'll go to another site where many people accidentally spelled bad
Show you a lot of explicit photos and but the servers show these as a hit so the person who owns the site where hotmail
Is getting money for this.
Probably.
That's the way it works
None
And the thing is that since it didn't harm you in any way, legally, you can't perceive that from a person who has that
For example in the email even if it's a marginal cost, that is simply a tax to your connection
Of some type but it has to be minimum. Is not that it has a use. The money, for example, the city taxes. They use to
To fix the streets to repair the sidewalks for all that
They say that?
In any case there's a huge need for money but in this case I'm trying to find a way
I am trying to understand and see a way of stopping the spam. It is getting to a point that it is getting worse each time. It keeps mounting.
But it really seems such a serious problem to you
The more
To me it doesn't seem so
I think that more of.
I don't think many people deem it a problem
No
There are some people that work with Hotmail for an institution. But, I think that for most people it just causes them to waste time, and sometimes the time spent is not worth the money.
It really is creating a problem. For example, the isp, the servers, the places of
The traffic goes through the internet
Okay, mm at its height
Fifty percent now is spam
Yes.
Hello
Hello,Honey's speaking
My name is Gloria, here from California
Yes, here in Florida.
When there are promotions on the internet, have you bought something?
Okay I specifically have bought things through the internet, but not for not things that are not requested
None
I don't think that already.  I can't say that either because I think that once I did get one of those strange messages and it was something that I was looking
None
I don't know what was the situation like so
What you hear well is all not truth.
On internet
Yes I do get scared because there's a lot of fraud sometimes, sometimes one thinks that it is safe but is not one hundred percent safe, right?
That all depends if it's a good way of looking.  You go to their webpage that has
None
And verify what the product is. If they are authorized, they have to have their own page
None
My experience up to now? I've never had such a problem, that I've ordered something on the internet
Be quiet my daughter
And has had a problem until now
None
But as for as that they should have some way of being able to stop you know, that one receives in the mail,the
Yes.
Is chronic
None
Yes I agree that there should be something for that
None
The same way one blocks when they call the house and bother you.
It's happened to me that sometimes at night they are calling for promotions that sometimes I go into some pages to see how the promotions.
I already have the call there in night in the house then no
That they get your information and they call you
Yes
Do you have your number registered with the do not call registry?
Yes, I have it but I don't know what happening, because sometimes there's a lot of deviousness on the internet. I am somewhat scared of the internet.
The only think I do suggest is I joined to my bank account and a specific card, just for that. I don't keep a very high balance just in case
You know? no, if they get my card or anything that shouldn't happen happens is easy to cancel and is not the card, from my main checking accounting nor anything like that
None
Which is a measure that I've taken so if anything happens at least I don't have to worry that I have to cancel my checkbook or anything like that
None
I know of another way, which is to have a card in which you only pay a small fund you know, so if anything happens, at least
You know? you don't have to cancel everything, you just cancel that account and that's it, you can report it as stolen, like you do with the visa
Shut up girl! I don't know but I didn't take part in the purchase of it
Some people, it makes your life easier
The internet
So you know sometimes
That's right, isn't it? but I can't afford it
Sorry?
I can't afford to buy things from the Internet and I don't think it's one hundred percent safe.
Well
Maybe they know more and me.
It's the technology has
In my opinion, no
It'will reach a point in which the stores, all of the stores where you buy groceries.
None
They will allow you to buy things online.
None
To look for
They are making your life easier.
None
None
Visa and mastercard they have now a protection system
Yes
That if it's a thing on the internet, if they've had problems with fraud or there's a chance that there's fraud, your card doesn't go through
None
If you pay with your card via the internet, it rejects you.
None
In other words they have also opted for security measures to protect the consumer
That's good, right?
None
None
Because I tried using it on a site and when I called and told them look, my card is declined and I don't understand why
They told me that it was the visa that didn't accept them to get the card
None
I said that is good you know,i knew that something strange was there,and that you know
None
I told them that no, I have no interest in that product, because if visa doesn't want to do business with them, it's because of something
None
Yes they have taken certain precautions, but as far as the garbage that one gets in the mail, there's nothing that annoys me more than that.
Too much, right?
None
None
To block the popups, the little windows.
None
It says that in fifteen minutes you will be able to access the website that you were looking for.
Sometimes I've found six to seven hundred that go straight to the trash because I have it programmed but they always get in.
None
That's the safe side of it.
Have you tried? Do they still send you the same message? To pick it up and send it to, do you have an email account?
No, I haven't tried that
You pick it. It's the latest thing that I've done when they keep sending me the same thing. I've already blocked it. You take the address
And you report it to your provider and they do some research and they go and cancel their account
They pay it, right? They send us spam
Spam is any email that you are getting in your email that you didn't request.
None
If you didn't go to the website and register in their lists, it's something you did not request
Anything that you did not request is considered spam
None
And that's it, about that you know that there are programs to block them.
None
I know hotmail has put up some filters and if they are not in your list of
Friends or address book that you know
None
They will send it to the trash folder
That's fine?
Yes
None
Yahoo still doesn't have it, I believe that if you file a report with the provider they take it and they find out and if they see who is sending out the emails they ask them why they are doing it
None
You know? There have been lots of frauds lots of people are inventing them, yes
That's better, yes
No,
I hope that this company that we have would update more often because even if I block them, they still reach me
They find ways to
None
It's a robbery, a computer goes and takes lots of addresses, for example, they put a very simple thing
For example, everybody with an address that ends in m and everybody that has that
Calm down sweetheart
That's fine, it's weird because they are trying to do their best
Shut up.
To improve the situation as such
None
Is that one also, you understand me? how do I tell you have to protect yourself what gets me mad because I have, I open my mail and there are, I have to clean it for
Fifteen letters that I didn't even ask for nor requested
None
And after I clean all that I come to see what it is they are sending me
Sometimes it comes out like that error because I send it to the trash and later it comes out that many errors, that I don't know what
Even if one wants to protect themselves sometimes the same company I don't know, they are like associated with those companies, I don't know if it's not working for me
Every time I want to block and all that it already sends me the error. And already others get in that cleaner that I don't know what, that I don't know such
Is pure business
How strange
None
Because I know that, with what I have in my account, thank God up to now I haven't had problems, because every time that I've reported the things
They investigate to see where it's coming from
None
But they should have a list for your email, like you have for the phone because already thank God they don't call my house
None
It was Sundays at seven in the morning.
How terrible
An agent calling to sell me something, but if I need services I will call you.
None
We put the phone in the no-call list. As soon as we informed them that our telephone number was in the no-call list, they have to take notice and take you out of their lists.
So I have, in order for my number not to be published, they always do and now I'm even paying for it not to be published.
You have to report it, there's a special list to block the telemarketing calls.
None
And you have to inscribe your number in that list and, it happens because when you have to fill out a request or whatever, that has your phone number in it
That person sells you information
None
Hat happens is that, your number comes up and wherever you put your number in, they have a list with all that information and they sell it, so they earn some money
None
If your number is not registered in the national phone book, they are allowed to call you, but not if you have registered it.
You have a private number does not mean that they don't have access to get it from certain operations.  Do you understand?
None
None
My local office.
None
And I asked them for the eight hundred number in which I could register my phone and it took about three days and they registered it there and I don't get those calls anymore
They had to take my number out because when they now look for your number it doesn't show because it's in the do not call list
None
They can't call you anymore.
That's good, right? Because they have sent me unwanted mail as though I had accepted their proposal.
And if you don't read well and here you have a contract with them
Yes, this what scares me the most about the internet, more when you don't know, you don't have a wide knowledge of the internet so sometimes I prefer
Going to see if it's my family and if there's nothing, I disconnect everything stays there
No
When you don't know a lot, you're the victim of scams
Yes, you have to be careful but like I told you, it makes life easier for example, this
Yes.
Hello
Hello?
Hello, yes what's up, my name is Soledad.
What's up. My name is Mariano. Who are you?
Mariano, are you from Philadelphia?
Yes, I am from Philadelphia.
I'n Soledad in Philadelphia
I can't believe it.
Look at that, how funny. I said this, this is Mariano
She sounds Argentinian
How funny.
How funny, I can't believe it, how are you
Yesterday was the first time I called andbf
Yes
It's a Colombian girl from Phoenix. I say to her, what is your name
I don't know what I said and I'm Soledad. I'm from and she said at the same time, Argentina
Argentina. yes.
She told me pretty bad, and I started to talk about you seeing that there are means, you think that you go with a bad intention
It's what happens to me each time I talk, the same thing. I said two words and they told me you're Argentinian.
We really must have an accent
Yes, I just explained to Laila so she could get on it too.
Also
I told her, it's incredible how aggressive we are. When you listen to people from other countries, there not for us.
Yes
You realize what you do, it's very
Sure
It's really authoritarian, how we talk.
Yes, it must sound bad
Sure, yes. Very, the, it's very
Yes, I think it's strong.
It's amazing.
Besides like that
Sure, yes. It's very strong. How, how, we're talking about what happens to an Argentinian, when I said
How
I said, yes, I'm Soledad, what's your name, you said Mariano, and I, Mariano where are you from, from Philadelphia, I said
Mariano
It has to be Mariano.
Yes, this my call twenty three, so I'm here.
How nice. And you called from different telephones?
Yes, I called from five different ones, so now I always call from the same because I'm in the laboratory and about to go, but
Sure
I make the call from here.
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Dude, how was the moving? Fine?
Fine, it was fine, we did this thing that, I'm telling you, it was exhausting, moving
Terrible
Moving stresses me out. I hate it.
It's horrible, yes
It was really a very [...] experience, i don't know, it was, it was hard, i mean, maybe the, the day of the moving itself
Yes
I was dead because i more or less put all the things from the department, because Martin had to work, and he couldn't help me much, so, i was beaten
Sure, i mean, you were stuffing things in boxes all day long, more or less
Beaten. But anyways, i mean, we did a lot, in an hour and a half, we finished in an hour and a quarter.
Were there a lot of you carrying things up?
There were eight of us.
Oh, very good
That Marcelo came
Yes
No one else.
Right
They came with their partners, we first did, since we were four only, we would go up and down, see, but the stairs, really, kill you.
No it kills you.
They kill you. It's four floors up, four floors down. And later, when the rest came, I said let's do the human stair, which is the best way. Then
Yes
Me and another girl, would take the boxes our of the boxes and once they took out the big furniture, like the bed, and those things
Sure
They took the boxes like that from the apartment up to just to the tip of the first stair. And Marcelo was there and he would take it down one floor.
Then there were two guys that would take those boxes another floor down
Sure, and not three floors, that kills you.
Then sure, you just moved one floor only, up and down, up and down.
Yes
And we did it like that. The truck was the smallest of all and Juan said all this doesn't fit here.
Juan said
Yes
Then we said, how depressing, I don't know. Let's put the most important things first. And Juanm did an engineering job. You do know Juan the Cordobes?
The short one.
Juan The short one, yes, how you call him short, but he's strong, because he lifts weights and all.
Yes
Andhe started accommodating everything in a way that everything fit.
None
It was incredible, it all went in
Incredible
E closed the truck and that was the first part
No, but it's a lot easier when they're a lot, because the truth is
Yes
I, the last time i mean, i suffered moving twice because i, obviously [came] from Buenos Aires
Yes
My parents house where I left the stuff.
Yes
That killed me. And i came here to Philadelphia, i go to a su... i have a sub-lease, where you came to look for me, over there in West Philly
Yes
And also, after a month and a half, we weren't many and I'm telling you I ended up dead.
Yes
Dead. There was Paula, Maria InÃ©s, Paulo and no one else, so we were, i swear i ended up
Sure
The next day, everything was hurting, too.
Right?, it's terrible. the other day, well, i went to pick up Federico at the airport that day
None
The day before i had gone looking for... because they also come to work like that, for three months, his sister, he and her boyfriend, who are also biologists
Right
To do type of an internship, but, but are, are in the career so to speak. Just in third year, so , so they are little.
Sure, sure
We all went to Baltimore the other day.
None
And they helped us, you had a dock where you would pull up the truck, and it was like that near the elevator
Then
You would go by elevator then
Okay, itâ€™s much more comfortable
Is much more, also, it was an hour and fifteen minute, an hour and a half, and we had already gotten everything out of the boxes. They also helped us to dismantle a little, not everything, but everything is almost done.
You are in Philadelphia now right?
Now I'm in Philadelphia, yes yes.
None
Yes, this week I'm here, and now on Sunday I'm already going to Baltimore and Martin is staying what happens is that the papers have to go out.
Sure
It seems that it will be two more weeks that he will have to stay here.
Yes, I called Marin, to see I mean, where he was, how you guys were
Yes today I also got a call from Nati, today I felt so bad in the morning. When we returned we were both super sick,
Yes
With a cold I don't know.
Sure, dead.
With this stress matter, I'm telling you, the body
Yes
I thought it wouldn't work anymore
Yes
This week i almost did nothing.
Yes
We're looking out for it this week and i don't know, we stayed there
Sure
I dont know how Martin goes to work, I was laying there in his house almost everyday
Yeah, you are completely stressed right now.
I couldn't think
You can't wait to be in Baltimore, quiet
Yes, I want us to be there already; he's making me really nervous. The matter of Martin's paperwork
Right
I have to go, I have an orientation next week.
Sure
I have to go there, but we'll see
Yes, no, everything's gonna be fine
I'll have a heart attack if I get any more stressed.
No, logical
What are you guys going to do today?
Us you know that nothing. In reality, no, I think today there's no plan,  pre-meditated, so we are kind of
I just recently talked with Martin
None
Marcelo told us, invite whoever you want here to our house, they have a barbeque.
None
That is not too cold. Martin is going to buy meat, and was going to tell Fede-
Yes
Federico and Laila, would you like to come eat barbeque?
Let me check with Leti to see if
Well.
See, because I know that Leti was also talking with someone to do something, so, of last
If you want to come
Yes, it would be super good.
Okay
Tonight.
Today, yes today at eight thirty, nine, call me or if not call Martin, at the
I'll let you know.
I'll let him know that I told you, and that's it, no problem.
No, yes, super good and, then where are you going to
None
To Baltimore, next week?
I'm leaving this Sunday
On sunday, it's OK
I'm driving there
It's ok
Martin doesn't know, he'll probably have to stay two weeks more here in Philadelphia
Sure
On the weekend, not this next one, but on the twenty, i have to comeback because i have a wedding here, from an American girl
Yes
I'll probably come look for him, lets say, that same weekend
Sure
Don't know, because after the twenty two, I'm starting college
None
I hope he can come here fast
None
I'm a little down because of that
Yes, oh my god
I don't want to be alone.
Yeah, I'm with [...] now, I started looking for tickets to Argentine
How are you going to find it.
No, I don't know.  I mean they are more expensive from here than over there
Yes
In the end, no, I don't know what's beset, if you should buy it from an airline and put up with it even if it's more expensive and to accumulate miles
Yes
Or what do I know, to look for a cheaper price
We always look for the cheapest price.
Yes no
The truth is that we do, it hurts, you feel the pain in the
It was $200 more
To pay that much money and to accumulate miles, how many, I don't know, I don't know, what do I know.
Four tickets and you get one free
Yes, that's also true.
What do I know.
If you think about it, you are actually paying for that one too because two tickets are, two hundred more, two hundred dollars more for a ticket to Argentina.
It's like another ticket, yes.
Six hundred dollars.
Cheap, yes, I now have a credit card that luckily doesn't charge me an annual fee
There's a credit card, no, it's a mile, Marcelo has it.
They give you fifteen thousand miles
That it is supposedly good.
In general, all of them have an annual fee, but this one doesn't.
Look at that.
US Airways gives you fifteen thousand miles, at front.
I see.
With two passengers and more you are
None
It is not bad.
It's okay
I think that I'm going to do it because it's the cheapest option to go to New York, do you always fly from Philadelphia?
No, we've flown out of New York and Philadelphia twice.
None
Twice from Philadelphia, it did to Martin, not to me, the flight got canceled, I mean, if it rains a lot, no, I don't know, it's a bad flight sometimes
We had back luck, it doesn't have to happen but
Yes
Our flight got canceled I don't know why and in New York, the only good thing about it is that it's a direct flight.
Sure
You know you won't lose your baggage or anything.
Sure
The bad thing is that you have to go all the way to New York.
Yes, that's it
Since not long ago, the one Paula took, but since not long ago it was not expensive taking the truck to the airport there
Now it seems like it was fifty round-trip
It is a van, like a shuttle
It's a shuttle that takes to to New York, or halfway, or to the airport.
It's not a bad idea
It's fine, but it is fifty dollars
Sure, but you still save more than one hundred
Sure
Of
If your flight leaves tonight, bear in mind that it is all day long.
You should be leaving by, I don't know, half past ten in the morning from your home
Sure
Because with one thing and the other it is four hours or five hours
Sure
To the airport.  It is not only the distance, but it has to pick the people house by house.
None
There you loose about half an hour, forty-five minutes
Sure, it gets
Or one hour. It takes an extra hour; Then let's suppose you find a little traffic. It becomes four hours, so you have to calculate
If you leave at ten to be there four hours before, you have to leave like at nine in the morning. Between this and that, understand.
Sure, it becomes long.
I don't know. But it's not the end of the world. I've done it.
How much did you pay for the last ticket for example?
Eight hundred
Eight hundred and something.
And something. Eight hundred and something, and it was in November, no it was in December.
I don't know, December should be a thousand and
When are you leaving then?
No, we feel like going in April, what happens is that we still don't
Hi, Lucas, what's up?. My name is Marceliana.
How are you Eliana, where are you from?
From Argentina, you too, right?
That's it, how did you recognize out my accent?
Yeah, you can tell right away.
And are you Portena too?
Yeah, me too
Where are you living?
In Boston
Me too, in
No, it's in.
Happy New Year.
Likewise
Did you go somewhere on vacation?
Yes, i went to Miami was with my brother who live there
That's good, and was it hot?
Yes
None
Obviously a lot more than here
You went into the sea?
No, I got into the pool of my sisterÂ´s house that has hot water
There are sharks this season?
The truth is that I don't know. I didn't get into it. Did you go somewhere?
I was in Spain.
Where did you were?
I was in Madrid. I went to the north of Spain by Portugal
WasnÂ´t it cold?
A little, it was snowing in the Basque Country
Did you know Portugal?
I have known Lisbon, but we were in Portugal now, where there are many churches. I got tired of seeing churches.
Yes
Europe, yes, there are churches more or less, so you have to stand those things
I'm fucked when it is that
Which is today's topic? That thing of buying on the internet, No
By telephone
It is fine
That one called I buy things for my work by phone.
No I get caught sometimes. After seven at night when they begin to call anyone and they offer you things. You don't understand what are they talking about and
You donÂ´t know what to say and, I accept and they send you something
No,
As soon as I arrived to the United States, a friend of mine called talking in a language I didn't quite understand.
And told me that there was something to call within the United States, and if I wanted to join, and I didn't understand a thing,
I didn't get to tell her that no, that we were not interested, and I got a ten dollars bill, the first month, and then since I cancelled after the second month was started they charged that too
The second month. But like this on the Internet, I buy nut. It is not things that
Did you give your card? Did you give anything?
No, they charge you directly.
None
You know there are several companies to call within the United States. It is a company and they, they keep you around until you say OK
Anything to get rid of them
That didn't happen to me.
ThatÂ´s usually when you have a telephone, not a cellphone, and your number is over
None
The cellular is much more private
Sure
Everybody. Terrible
Sure
So
At what time is it? at what time is it?
After five o'clock in the afternoon they start calling and they start talking and you just want to stop them
Sure
Yes I didn't tell them no, I'm not interested, but very clearly, those people immediately
How annoying, wow
Had the sun
No there were some cloudy days but since I was with my sister who was pregnant and she's like resting because we were, she's really fat and everything
Yes
No, happy to stay at home
Needed to give her.
Supposedly a month, but if she's dilated one and a half and is bedridden, the hospital, the girl said bedridden
Yes, they have to give
It is in this county, no one wants to say in case
How's the hospital where he will be born?
It's good, so, I went with her to do the ultrasound, it was the week, I don't remember, thirty six, thirty five and good, everything good, the truth is that it was great
And yes, I also had a lot of vacation
Does she have other kids or is this the first?
No, I have a little nephew. It's more her son than it is my nephew, who's learning more every day, he's two
He was born here in Miami?
No, they were born in Boston, they lived in Boston and he was born one winter day, because it was November here and
None
Sure,
That's good
The parents are in October
And anybody else there in Miami?
My brother also lives there and he worked everyday and at night he would come here every night and we dined together and there was also a friend of mine
He slept with my brother and I slept with my sister and so then we would all see each other. Besides, a new holiday for Christmas holidays for the new year
Friday he would leave earlier to work
Yes, you put for the child.
No, he was in school since we are Jews
I also left
Look
Never.
Hanuka? No, because my mom is going to Buenos Aires with all the candelabra. It was the last day. We won't do it.
Your mom went from Burnos Aires to Miami?
My mom alone will stay two months in Miami to take care of the future son
The mess
To help so she moved forward the ticket to see me two
She's going to visit you in Boston
She doesn't know yet, depends on how everything is with Layla.
Did she bring you something
Yes she brought me a bunch of things,
Yes,
A bunch of things, a book and a bunch of clothes for summer.
It doesn't grab my attention since I'm tired
It's not too cold these days.
Everything was good, I had a great time, it was cold in
And, more or less, that we took the jacket for the cold
None
When it is cold in Madred, we put on an overcoat as to not be as cold.
None
Here if you wear an overcoat and is minus five you are already cold
Sure
It was good, nothing to use it a little for hours or, not like here that you are the whole time with hats and gloves
None.
Walking was good, but we didn't have any sunny days.
Brilliant and where did you stop? do you have friends?
Yes, we have a couple of friends, and then were four days traveling so we stopped in different hotels and on the way back was when we to Madrid, were there four days
At some friend's house And there we spent Christmas and new Year also
Look at that
We were with their doges; who are awesome. The truth that
You know them so to speak?
Yes and one came from Argentina she went to Israel And another I mean And both they took them to Spain and are already there, they adopted a cat also in Israel that they are also taking to Spain
I need to get the Van through. That's why.
Because they were from the street
They call that ahorcada [hanged]
The dogs, yes, they justs got them off the streets, right?  for nobody, but
Sure
I found the Kitty in a dumpster and i gave it to... i wanted to raise her but my partner didn't let me
We gave it to those boys who took it to Madrid
Sure
You can't even touch her
Really? oh, the dogs don't do anything to her
No, they're very pretty, it would be good if they showed the pictures...
No, what's your name? Tamara?
They call me Luca.
Ok, Luca, I'm sure we'll meet in a few months and we'll remember our names and maybe I'll catch you suddenly on Boston
Yeah, I'm going to
We talked for a while
Do you come here some day
No, not really
There's a restaurant- there's a really good one
Yes
Average natural food
Yes, it is in
If you come it is good, they give you food.
I understand, and
Free things, you go there before one o'clock
Sure, yes, I used to, but I gave up with that because I gain. Even without hunger, sometimes I passed without hunger
A friend tells you to try things they have there and then you buy the package and end up with strange things to eat at home.
That's right
Yesterday I eat some chicken rolls
Yes
Yes, it was good
Look
Yes, note it down
Spring
If you are there one of these days get in and we may meet
What do you think of the cold? It's not that cold, right?
It's great.
Yes
Yes, I hope it stays like this for a long time.  This is the first winter I spent here
Sure
You were saying? It's gonna be cold
Yes, not now really, but the snow subject, the snow, i love snow, yes
Yeah, but if it snows you have to be sliding and that, i keep travelling and i don't even know the hour
None
But
Of course
Well, now we have a car, maybe it's going to be a little bit easier with a car
Oh, look at that. Do you plan on going anywhere this weekend?
I do not know is there any good place and I have to work tomorrow.
I have a friend, Juan Luna, an Argentinian, he sent mail. He plans to throw a party at some place for his farewell.
Tomorrow
Yes
Are you Argentinian? thats cool.
Sure, lets see, give me your email
Write it down
Hit it
Alukada
Yes
At [@] Gmail dot com, alukada at [@] gmail dot com
Perfect
None
I barely know that, he must be about to write, he told me
Ok, excellent
It's an idea.
If not, if not, we can do a movie night, i don't know, maybe you come to watch a movie, it's more or less good
Another idea
That's good. If not, we'll meet at
Sure, but I'll call you tomorrow as soon as i find out about the party
None
Hit it
Hi, my name is Eliana, who am i talking to?
Hi, what's up?, My name is Soledad, nice to meet you
Nice to meet you, Soledad, where are you from?
From Philadelphia, right now
And, where were you born?
In Argentina.
I thought so, what are you doing?
Yes, i was gonna say you're Argentinian by your tone, it shows right away
I spoke to Mariano and Leticia that I don't remember who she is but she knows some friends of mine, maybe you know them.
Yes, Sole, we call the girl Sole because she's shorter than i am, the other one
Who, Leti?
The other Sole, do you know Mariano and Leticia?
Yes, Mariano and Leticia
Do you know them?
Yes, i know them, they came to visit me, I'm here in Boston
Look at that
I spoke to another girl from Mar del Plata. She also knew Mariano and Leticia. Do you know her?
The girl from Mar del Plata. what's her name?  I can't remember. Yes, I met her just on Christmas day when we stopped
We ended up eating in the, in the house of some fiends in common, and i met her and her husband
Look at that
Yes.
What are you doing there in Philadelphia?
There I've been living for about four years, Philadelphia, and live, in reality I came with my husband because he works at Penn, he's a biologist
Yes.
I'm studying to be a social worker. In reality, it doesn't have a loot to do with science but
Sure.
Now we're moving with my husband to Baltimore because he's going to work at Johns Hopkins, another university.
Look at that what a pity.
So, and yes, you know how nice, yesterday too, I talked on the phone and it was Mariano.
No.
I say, I can't believe that I'm talking with you Maria, because you see, we're here and it's fifteen blocks, twenty blocks.
Sure and the other day, a friend game, because seeing that if you call with another telephone line they give you fifty dollars more.
Yes, I'm in the house of a friend now
Sure, so she came to my house and I gave her my cell, mine, and in reverse, and they communicated with both of us, so we were there watching ourselves
Talking on the cell phone
Seriously?
Yes.
In the same, in the same room?
Sure, yes.
How funny.
Yes, it is super funny.
What is your name? I already forgot.
If you do Eliana.
Eliana, that's good.
I'm the one that's in Boston that they came in November to Boston to visit me.
I'm going to ask Mariano I'm sure he must know
Yes, February twentieth is the holiday President's Day.
Yes.
I'm going over there.
Ah, good.
We will meet
Yes, I'll be in Baltimore. Yes there's a holiday or something like that but I'm sure that I can drive.  I'm about an hour and a half away,
Really good
And we have all the friends from here, so probably, if we're not too busy I guess we'll come here too, I imagine.
Sure, look I am here with a friend from Argentina
Yes.
That will start to, he will be a social worker, no, he's a psychologist.
Look at that.
And he will work as a psychologist at the end,
I have a friend that is an Argentinian psychologist.
Seriously? And he works as a psychological clinician?
No, he works in an institute. In reality he's a pharmacist and after he got a psychological degree
Look at that.
And so now he's a psychologist, he works here in a clinic. It's called Gustavo Clurf- Clurfman, or something like that.
I don't know, I don't know it. wow.
His wife lives and works at Penn.  She's about to be a professor.  She's applying to different universities.  She's a biologist too.
Wow, there's a lot in Phila
Yes, and what do you do in Boston?
I'm doing a post-doctorate in genetics.
A post-doctorate too? Martin just started the the postdoc we say.
He's in Hopkins to do the postdo-
At Hopkins, yes.
Sure, I'm here in Tufts University
Now he's doing genetics, Something in neurology, I don't know what it is.
That's good.
I don't understand anything
I always say, I don't understand the couples who are scientists
None
It's crazy, right now I'm single because I don't want to have a scientist next to me. there need to be two different conversation topics.
It's crazy, here, everyone we know are people from the faculty and we're all like that, the majority are biologists, or economists, who we know here at Penn at least.
Same as here.
They're, you see? They're always the same topics, or, what do I know? It's funny.
Yes here for example, in a moment I was tied because I had friends from Berkeley which is Tufts University
Yes.
And I go out with them sometimes and it's another vocabulary
Sure.
Recently someone asked if I was a drummer or a guitarist.
They seem similar to you and sound really musical
None
They laughed and I didn't know it was like this, it's good, really.
Look at that - And how did you get into this Fisher thing?
In exchange. Mariano told me, when I came here and she told me that they had
None
I work close to a hospital in
Yes.
Human Nutrition is a whole building dedicated to studies.
Sure, obviously.
I enroll in a lot of them, they're on the, the fifth highest floor of my laboratory
Look at that, around the corner
I had to go six mornings and on one I stayed there all morning with a
Yes.
They take out blood and it's six hundred dollars a month
Yes. Wow.
I started to tell them this whole story, and since sixteen I'm doing one to talk, I say, and the date passed, and in some way I have to get some money together,
The money I'm making here, I say with these two hundred dollars, I can go skiing four times.
If you want to go back to Argentina, it is part of the trip.
So no.
Between Marin and I, God willing, we'll make between two fifty and five hundred dollars.
Sure, it's great, it's great
You see?
Yes, I signed up for all of these.
I've never got into these things that here there's a lot of in the universities.
Don't trust, maybe they're going to take an organ.
No it's too much.
Sure, no, I was in a room, sequestered, with a needle, let's say
Why? Because they were taking blood? Sure.
Sure, so, and I saw the study they wanted to know, see the times when you have a glucose analysis, if you're diabetic?
Yes.
I don't know if sometimes they give you a they give you something really sweet and they take your blood?
No, they never did this to me, but I've heard of it.
They want to check if it's the same if they give me bread or juice, so one day they give me bread and the other juice.
Look at that.
And you see, the amount of money they spend in trying to find out if it's better to eat ninety grams of bread instead of drinking juice. That's amazing, oh.
They have the grant's money to do that, so that's it.
Sure, no, sure.
I think scientist have money saved to buy telescopes
Hey have it saved for that since, so these
It's okay, I had never taken part of this things, I mean, it seemed too complicated for me, I don't know, it was weird. But that, when, when Mariano mentioned it, we met for lunch just before Christmas
The four of us were talking when suddenly he
Yes.
I was like, how much are they paying you? I though he was going to say, fifty dollars but then he said, two hundred and fifty and I was
Sure.
Where do I sign up, and he sent me the info that same night
I see
So we signed up and now, this is my third call.
Oh, look
So
And you know what happened to me? I spoke with a woman from Guatemala, and she said Were do you work?. I told her
What do they get out of this conversations, what is this for?
Yes
I work there
She told you?
Yes, then she told me that in reality I didn't like it that much, at the end
Why? How is it?
See, for example, Word that has Spanish from Guatemala, Spanish from Argentina, Spanish, Understand?
No, I don't understand, I don't understand, what, what?
See the programs, kind of like Word, that has
Yes.
In the dictionary, of the Spanish of different countries.
Yes.
Well, they want to make a program like translation, and they need to gather information from Spanish.
None
Then it goes to a computer file that they are training to be a good dictionary, understand?
What are they going to do? Because I mean, our our Spanish has nothing to do with the rest of the Spanish of, of other countries
What?
That's the way we talk in Argentina. It's very different to how they talk in Colombia or in Venezuela
They use our talks to gather information
Yes, I knew they recorded it, I mean what I had understood was that it was a linguistic study.
Sure, I thought that it was that.
Nothing else.
Yes. It's more commercial-- Bill Gates must be here.
Ah. And well, what are you going to do? Everything is done for money
Sure, everything to go skiing four more times.
Where are you going to go skiing? By there near Boston?
And near Boston, fifty minutes away, I didn't ski in Buenos Aires, let's say
Yes.
None
Is much more expensive there, or more inaccessible because you have to go up to the south.
Sure, that can, here I have friends with cars, we go in car the closest one is fifty minutes away
How nice.
Yes, for example, and is open at night, then already a couple of times, we left from work early, four in the afternoon
We were skiing until 10pm
How pretty, you know how to ski already? The hand, was it easy to learn?
Look, the truth is I picked up fast, since last winter, yes, I picked it up fast but,ski but now, this winter I'm going to devote myself to snowboarding that they told me was a little more
Look at that, mate, how good, how good. I would like it.
Yes, in a month and a half I'll let you know.
For me, we would like it, what happens is Baltimore is closer than Washington, then it gets harder, but just the same with all the friends we have here
And we have another Argentinian couple that live in Vermont
Yes.
Obviously, there's much more to do in Vermont, but they go skiing all the time.
Sure.
What is their name? They always tell us come visit and lets go skying I really want to
Sure it's okay. I like to do , it allows me to
Yes.
Long for the winter.
Yes. Hold on a second. Yes, it is in my wallet, I think. What was I saying? Oh, yes, about skiing. I want to learn how to do it.
Sure, yes, that would be great. but, I'll tell you latter about snowboarding
I heard that Snowboarding is really good, one of my friends, well he's restless, he's an Argentinian guy from here
His name is Frederico.
Since he skis, it's like you have a lot of things to
Oh, I see
You never stop to try to perfect your skying.
Sure, that can be true, but the ones that practice snowboarding say it's funnier. They never go back to.
Skiing?  Really?
They say it is much more fun.
It seems hard, snowboarding, I believe that even, when they should, I feel like it's easier to learn how to snowboard than to sky.
Sure, no, I don't know, I've never been able to get on a skate
Yes, it is complicated.
So
And the lowest salaries of the country.
None
The move, all my friends tell me I started. The move, the culture, the ones who make the
None
Snowboarding is similar to surfing at the beach.
Yes? Are you serious?
They get into a good time, then I said, let's go to do it. I bought, then they bought
Ah, do you have the snowboard and all the stuff?
No, I say they bought me
None
William, Orlando, Florida
Good evening, Aurelio from Washington DC
How are you sir?
Very well, thanks. What's your name again?
William
William, what's up?, nice to meet you
How are you?
Very thanks, I'm driving here, can you imagine
None
Equity, maybe we could write a book
Where are you from?
I'm originally from Venezuela
From Venezuela
Yes, from Caracas.
The Venezuelan and the Cuban together
Exactly, they're now there with Chavez in the new set
How's equity there in Venezuela?
I will tell you that I haven't been to Venezuela since ninety eight.
Yes
I grew up and lived there. I came to this country when I was twenty four years old.
Wow
There was lots of inequality in Venezuela
Lots
Sure, between the rich and the poor
It's something similar to this country
It ws different because here is has to do with race and over there it has to do with
Yes
The social class
It's about the economy
Exactly, do you understand? In here, at least the ones that don't make much money they can still have some things that the poor people
They will never be able to have the same circumstances as the ones from our countries.
I understand
This inequality it's different here than the inequality from
It's mostly about race, I for example
Religion is something else.
I used to live in Miami for a long time.
Or twenty-four or twenty-five years old and now in Miami you don't really pay attention to race because everyone is
Well they come from the same city, which is mostly made up of Hispanics, if you speak Spanish, everyone can understand you
This is a county of inequality but it's not so much because of the money, like you said, I think that money is the biggest race in this country
Sure.
You make money or you don't make money.
It's true that here in Washington is such that enough money and the race I say .
Yes and the race
Yes, that's another thing in this country. Depends on where you are. If it's here, for example, in Washington looks
Yes
The other day I had to go to the police department because I had an accident recently so I go there to settle some issues
None
It's the first time I've gone to the police department .
The first time in your life.
The first time in my life.
Okay
And the car burned when I was traveling in Italy.
None
When i returned after a week out we saw the car burning
Hell
It would raise and they neutralized it completely, it burned with this thing called paint center
Right, but why is that?
Exactly yes, well it turns out that I had to go to the police look at all the people working there in the police here in Washington all I didn't see any. not even hispanics, all black
None
All black friends
All the blacks same as here in Miami and in Orlando because almost all the mulattoes the blacks you can say so.
They all have the jobs that are in the state, federal, in the city, everyone
None
Here until the coast the girls write on the computer, what they receive
Let him write
The people who pick up the garbage are all of black and mulatto origin.
The same here too, the guy who drives the bus is black, the guy who picks up the garbage is black, it's a crazy thing
It was incredible because not even one Hispanic.
We are waiting behind.
The big concentration of Hispanics in this country are from Central America.
Yes, the majority
The great majority in the area of Washington come from El Salvador or come from Honduras
From Mexico
There are few Mexicans.
This is really surprising
When you go there it's clear that they are from El Salvador.
Let me ask you something, There in the north the total percentage of the city.
What would you say is the percentage of the Hispanic population there?
Sometimes here I would say it's about
Yes
Five percent more or less
Nothing more
Depending on the area where you are. There are parts in Washington that are totally Hispanic, also stores.
The restaurants are Hispanic, you're walking on the street and it seems like I don't know if you've directly seen in El Salvador something like this
Yes you know
You have people selling popusas in the streets
The Hispanic things that we are looking for.
Exactly similar
Yes i well known
Look for me, I'm going to tell you something, I know something else that doesn't get a lot of attention either
No
It's mostly the majority of Americans here thing that I'm Italian.
Yeah?
Yes, there are some who think that I'm Puerto Rican, and there are others who think that I'm Italian. I say no, and they fight for the two.
None
I'm Venezuelan
From the city of Caracas
Yes, exactly, and another thing, I worked for two years, I worked in Radio Shack in a shopping mall
None
A really big mall and I saw that the Arabs who came thought that I was Arabic
They'd start speaking in Arabic and I'd say calm down man.
I am not. But you have never been in Miami, Orlando.
Yes I've been to Miami and Orlando many times, my family owns a
What do you think about Miami?
I love it
Nice, come hear, let me ask you something because I'm quite curious about it, I signed on to join this program but I really didn't read what it was for
Why are they making us do these calls. I'm not sure what I signed up to but it's been a while and I don't remember exactly what it was for.
This is a linguistics study that is conducted by the University of Pennsylvania, no? I'm not sure if it's the University of Pennsylvania or not.
They are trying to do a linguistic studies on how people speak Spanish.
To train these machines that can recognize who is talking
None
Machines that you tell them anything and then
Yes, like when you call Fedex and you just have to speak to the machine and press a
That's the same thing, well, that's what they are trying to do
Wow, but do they do that only with Hispanics or with gringos too?
You can tell a native English speaker by their gringo accent.
Sure
They also included them here so I think there's people that talk to those machines and they have an accent
Be able to recognize the accent someway
That's amazing.
Yes, but it seems to be a very interesting study
I have family in Venezuela, it's incredible!
Really?
I have two cousins, aunt, aunt's husband and two or three people over there and i'm really worried about the situation
None
In Venezuela they're fine, they don't live badly now, and what I want to ask them when we can see each other, when they will come to the United States
They say that they can't in the next ten years get out of there
Things aren't easy right now to come here from there.
The thing is really complicated
Yes, before moving here we came here many times, my dad had a visa.
He's American like to come here, well as a tourist
Sure
But you don't think that it's as easy right now
For what they tell me, imagine living as well as they are living, there's money for things, there's job
Family to keep us mythical
Sure, yes
I personally compare it to where I come from. I lived in Cuba for nine years and so this is, pardon the language, tremendous shit, so what happens when they tell me they're living so well I let them
It's comparing to how they lived in Cuba
Sure
I say damn, you're living so well and you can't come see us, it needs to be a little more complicated than this
Well I am going to tell you something. I was with Cubans here in this country and they tell me that the situation is not very good as it is said
None
They are not well, they are bad and there are others who say that they are well so it is a thing like I tell you it is difficult to
It depends on each person.
It is difficult to generalize
It depends on the perspective of each one, there are people that say the situation is good, we are fine, there is not a problem
Yes the worst maybe the one besides you is all fucked
It is difficult to tell it
What can you do in Washington at night? It's very cold in Washington today.
Yes right now is not so cold, I donÂ´t think about it because if a
Yes
We have thirty seven grades Fahrenheight. That's is like.
Fuck you bet here in Orlando there are forty and I am freezing here the air
Good evening, my name is Martin
Hi, good afternoon, my name is Jorge and I'm calling from
From
Los Angeles, California, where are you calling from, Martin?
Martin from Philadelphia.
And you're Argentinian?
Yes
You're the fifth Argentinian I've called on the phone.
Really?
When was it? The day before yesterday I spoke to another girl from Philadelphia.
It must have been Mariano
No, a girl from Philadelphia that's called Leticia
Yes, Mariano's wife.
What's this?, do you all know each other there?
This couple of friends dragged us into this oppurtunity
Yes
We all know each other. My wife just talked to a girl that was also a friend of Mariano but lives in Boston
Yeah, well.
This is very funny
Did you say that Mariano lived in Boston?
No. Mariano lives here in Philadelphia
Mariano, the interesting thing is that I've been talking with Leticia before yesterday and she tells me
Yes.
The other day I spoke with an Argentinian that lives in Boston
Yes.
Yes, she tells me, and what's her name? Her name is Tamara. She tells me, oh I know her, is a friend of a friend of mine.
Yes.
So we are all well connected. That's good
Yes, no, is that we are
What place of Bue? Are you from Buenos Aires?
Yes, you?
Yes, I mean that, Yes. what place from Buenos Aires are you from? from what neighborhood?
In reality is outside of Bueno of Haedo.
Yes I'm from a neighborhood called Lanus Oeste
Yes.
Valencin, Alcina, but I've been in the United States almost nineteen years.
How terrific.
None
It's been four and half years, more or less.
Pleased to meet you. The topic that we have to talk about, today, this people find such topics
Yes
That make you philosophize
Yes
The subject they want to make us talk about today is equity.
Yes
I think i have never seen in these nineteen years, with all the talks about equity
Yes
None
I find that kinda unbelievable too.
Yeah, and you are seeing that already in.... In these four years you've been...?
Yes
I have really witnessed it a lot with these nineteen years.
Yes
Equity has been discussed for so long in this country, it's been so long since they talk about the good, the constitution of the country, everything
Racial differences are so evident that I never saw that
Yes
Anywhere else in the world
Yes
In Argentina
There is inqeuity in Argentina between the rich and poor.
Exactly.
There's inequality but s not so much. What happens in Argentina with the immigrants. The immigrants arrived and got mixed among everybody and you still see that here on the west coast. The immigrants are from other
From other countries, but here are the same from the same countries that went to  Buenos Aires. The Italians and the Polish and each one has their neighborhood. This is the Italian neighborhood. This is the Polish neighborhood. And, they don't mix.
Even in Philadelphia?
Yes in Philadelphia
When I went to New York
New York also. But in Philadelphia is the same. There's the Italian market and they are all Italians.
None
And they are still fourth generation Italians and are called Italian-American.
None
As if I was called Italian-American simply
Is your family of Italian origin?
Yes but that is third or fourth generation, then
Sure. Me too
Is as if I said I'm Italian and would talk with a strange accent that's why I thought. Then is like it was always very marked
Em from where you come and well, and your origin and everything makes you different and that's why the racial differences are marked also.
Exactly.
I don't know.
You are the third person I spoke to from Philadelphia. The other day a guy from Asuncion told me that in Philadephia
Yes.
A great one. Also I tell you, in parenthesis, if you hear a lot of noise is because I'm making this call from a public telephone.
None
I'm almost next to the street, what happens is that these twenty five calls, I don't know, my plan asks me to make five, I don't know in your plan,
Yes.
In my plan, it asks me to make five calls that are not from my house.
Yes, the same,
This is the fourth time I passed by a public phone.
Yes, they give you fifty dollars more.
I was telling you. The other day I was talking with this guy from Paraguay and he tells me that in Philadelphia
Yes.
I can get to say that the majority or a great majority of the people are of the black race.
Yes. More or less.
Is that also your impression?
Yes, if it's not fifty percent, it is forty percent. The population is very big.
How incredible, right? Look at that.
Yes. It happens a lot here in the cities. New York not so much because it's a huge city and is very cosmopolitan, but even Washington DC or Baltimore which is
In fact we and they are going to move now to Balitmore.
Look how nice
It's also about forty to fifty percent blacks.
Exactly
Is like that.
Have you ever been in Los Angeles?
No
You've never been, In Los Angeles
No.
There are many types of races, basically
Yes.
There are Italians. There are many people of European race.
Yes.
But also other types of minorities abound. Well the Hispanics are very big here in the United States.
Yes, sure.
Especially here in Californina, in Los Angeles.
Yes
Many minorities from Central America.
Yes.
There are a lot of Argentinian people.
Yes.
Every day there are more Argentinian people. There's a big colony
Yes.
Armenians here in Los Angeles.so that they have named one of the areas of Hollywood Little Armenia
Really?
For example, the neighborhood I live in is a big
Yes
Russian immigration
Look at that
Sometimes, you're walking around the block I live in
Yes
And the only thing I hear is Russian.
None
It's very interesting, i think. It's like I was in Moscow, or i dont know where, right?
Sure, yes.
The problem of equity, here in Los Angeles, to be more specific
Yes
They make you feel like they don't have to talk about it much or there's nothing to talk about.
Sure, yes
Arnold Schwarzenegger
Yes, yes!
He's basically racist.
Sure
Against minorities, especially Latin minorities
Yes.
And he has basically declared himself against many of the laws that favored the Latin minorities, especially the Hispanic minorities.
Sure.
He basically is a citizen of the United States, but he wasn't born in the United States either.
No, it hasn't been that long
Because you know that he is German.
He hasn't been an American citizen that long, Yes.
I think he's from Austria
Yes, he is an Austrian.
He is the one that should least talk about those type of things.
Yes.
In class we are analyzing a law in California which may give you an idea you might have heard.
Yes.
That they wanted to give the opportunity of having, how do we say it in Spanish, we call it the driving permit.
Yes, the driving license.
There on the east coast?
Yes I heard a little
Well.
Sure because no in - the federal law doesn't let you get the driver's license if you don't have.
None
A valid visa, basically
Exactly a social security number.
Or social security number, yes.
So a large percentage of the Latin or Hispanic community in Los Angeles don't have valid visas.
Sure
You know there's like eleven million in this country
Yes
That are fighting to correct their legal situation, so he basically
Yes
Spoke in favor against the law
Sure
You see there's a lot of inequities there, another thing that was
Yes
A couple of years ago, here in Los angeles, there was a very famous case about Rodney King
Yes, yes, I remember, yes
Maybe you've heard about. Oh, you were still in Argentina at that time
Yes, I was in Argentina, that was on ninety seven, something like that.
It was a huge mess
Yes
There was an incident and they beat him, do you remember the trial they held for him?, [riots] broke through
Fires were alighted in the Los Angeles area
Sure, because people wanted to protest somehow. Yes.
It was pretty serious, it was huge. I used to live there and it was something so big, was badly destroyed. So, oh, equality.
Is something that in theory sounds interesting but doesn't really exist, equality.
Yes.
In the United states , in many other places
Yes, I agree.
None
It's like-
Hello!
Hello!
Who am I talking too?
Hello, my name is Leticia. I can't really hear you that well.
Excuse me, are you able to hear me?
That's better.
What's wrong? Where are you calling from, I'm sorry?
From Philadelphia.
Philadelphia. That's fine.
And you, what's your name?
My name is Cris, I'm calling from Houston
I can barely hear you
This is Cris from Houston.
From Houston
Yes.
And, what do you think about today's subject?
I think it will be a while before we reach total equality between the sexes and races.
We still have some segregation going on.
Yes.
Types of races
How is Houston in there? What are the bigger minorities over there?
Houston is very diverse; I think that it's one of the most diverse of the United States, including New York
Yes.
Yes there is a big Hispanic presence.
Yeah
Yes, in comparison to others in other states. Because it's Texas, right? it's close to Mexico
Are you Mexican?
Excuse me?
Are you Mexican?
Yes, what do you think?
And I haven't been here long, living in this country. The truth is that I still couldn't live very close
Here in Philadelphia, there's a very big community of African-Americans and no. No, there's so, so many Latinos for example, yes there's a lot of Asians, mostly Chinese.
Yes
The truth is that inequality shows itself. What I see is each one, how they are
The African-Americans between them, the Asians between them,
Sure
And I wonder well, the Latinos take care of it, I don't know, or rather I don't know if it's because there's a segregation or because
The people tend to group together to be a determined minority
Sure.
The truth is that I can't define it; but the neighborhoods are very distinct. I don't know at the national level how
If they contribute for it to be that way or if coincidentally, for example, the Blacks are poorer.
Yes
I guess no
In general
Yes.
I imagine they are
Well I don't know what the government is doing for it to be that way or if it's a problem derived from the society in itself.
Let's put a law that says that we are all equal and we are not going to discriminate.
It's true, when for example, someone is looking for a job, a person from
Yes.
A person of that race
Yes.
In that respect, yes, there's some equality. But the reality is different in my opinion?
No, we are not all treated in the same way. I believe that reality is quite different.
And something that is being shown, they want to make it look like
Yes, sure.
Yes, I was impressed looking for a job.
Nobody states in their curriculum how old they are, what genre,
Sure.
What Nationality, when they got to this country, it's something that one should state
Yes, in your curriculum
Then here nobody asks for those things
Where are you from?
From Argentina. And that grabbed my attention. It seemed good because
Yes, sure
It means that the employer in some way chooses ot by the sex, the age,race, by
Yes, but rather by the abilities no that
Yes.
For being an individual
Yes,that I've been here a long
Easy to socialize with Latins, Spanish, Europeans but hard with Americans.
How long have you been here?
Is the same.
What?
No, I didn't hear what you said.
And how long have you been living here?
And since it would be eight months,
None
I don't know. Do you socialize with a lot of American people?
Of everything.
Of everything.
Yes. Almost no. Well, with people of Indian origin.
Indian. Are there many Indians there?
Yes, well the University that I attend there are you see many Asians and
None
Many white people.
Sure.
I do like to relate with all kinds of people No? To get to know different cultures.
No, it's logical that's interesting, And did you ever feel any kind of discrimination?
Well not directly. I don't remember one  I arrived here and well because of the language no? that
Because of the language.
Isolated. So people discriminate you and they push you aside.
Sure.
Well, at least it's not experienced any type
Yes, the truth is that it's more or less rare here. Because on the other hand it's a country that is so cosmopolitan.
That has so many people that come from other places, I must be one of the most cosmopolitan in the world
It could be?
And I don't know, to tell you the truth. I haven't felt openly discriminated,
You think what it has to do with the country where you come from? Because I have noticed many people
According to the country or the situation, socio-economical of each individual, I don't know if you have noticed that?
Yes
But,that is not only here, but all over the world, right?
Yes, maybe it is related.  They open their doors to everybody, right?
Sure yes. Or even the skin color, right?
It happened to me. I talked to a lot of Asian people who complained about being discriminated. Or mistreated
Where?
I don't know when they go shopping, when they need to process something, they told me they were discriminated. And
And I told them that never happened to me. I have never been mistreated.
Also it may be because of the bad temper of the person, but it is not against me. So, I don't know, that may exist, honestly I don't
If it is.
I think that is to certain people, don't you think so? Some people are very racist, others aren't, don't you think so?
Yes sometimes I hear you so that it is hard to follow the conversation
No, I'll put it louder.
Yes please, because
Do you hear me now?
Yes, that's better
Ok, sorry.
Do you hear it right?
YES
I don't know what happens but
Perfectly. I think is the distance Right?
Yes, I don't know what it is. Are you talking with a hand phone?
Yes.
What were you telling me?
Some people have certain discriminations toward certain groups.
None
Yes,
Don't you think?
Yes. I think that some Asian people, perhaps have said the the African Americans didn't treat them well but
I don't know if its real or not . they are sensitive  Right? Because there are times, that also you have to
Differentiate between what is discrimination and what isn't. Have you lived in the United States for a long time>
Yes, I've been living here seven years
It's been a long time. And always there in in Houston?
Yes.
Do you like it?
No
No, What part of Mexico are you from?
I'm from Cuernavaca, Morelos.
None
Do you know Mexico?
Yes, i know the south
OK
San CristÃ³bal
Let's see
Yucat'an
You see, last time I spoke to an Argentinian boy, and he also knows Mexico, but the South too.
None
Yucatan and Chiapas, all those places in the south
Chiapas, yes
Yes
Hello
Can you hear me?
Hello?
Hello, Silvia here. with whom am I speaking?
I am from my home
I'm,in a suburb of Chicago
I'm in Texas.
It's called, in Texas, very good
It's the first time I've done this. And you?
Yes, no, this is the sixth call already.
Yes?
And I've talked with, it seems that it was four men and two women, and the topics were varied, vary from being able to break up in a couple.
The religion
These were the topics, but no, others have told me that it's not necessary to speak on a specific topic.
I already forgot what the topic was on. the equality, right?
Equality between the sexes
Yeah, or globally, because for me there will always be discrimination. Discrimination against any person who's not the majority there, so
For me, coming here about five years ago, the United States will have for me, more ah, people, ah, mixed with Hispanics and people
Of color, and very few will be people of completely white blood for me
Yes, it will be very rare to find, and from now forward I don't know when
None
And it's been happening for a long time, but as far as equality of the
None
Jobs and that the problem that exists now is that although the women can do the same job as a man
None
They don't pay them the same.
Exactly, that still happens a lot in fact, I finished doing a job, because I do insurance, and they send me to different states to be able to represent the company and its benefits they offer that year
None
And in two or three weeks we are there with thirty of us as employees, and we explain the benefits one on one.
I got to Louisiana and sat with
None
One hundred and sixty people during that period of time and they were whites, blacks, Indians
None
They had French names because that area was Creole
Yes, yes
It was very popular, being Indian
Yes
Very few spoke Spanish. I stayed the same. I thought I was going to learn what was the difference of an Indian and a Mexican
Knowing well that originally we are Spanish mixed with the Indian, but which Indian? I still don't know,
Should I?
I haven't been there a lot
Where are you from
My grandparents are from Mexico but my parents were born in Texas.
Oh, okay
I was raised in Laredo, Texas.
Okay, look
My grandmother forced us to speak Spanish when we were little, when we were around six or seven years old ,and I thank God for that, as I now speak Spanish
I moved to the congregation
Yes
Yes, Spanish to continue and it has been of a lot of help in my job because
None
I was always needed at work. They even pay me more for that. Twenty five dollars more per day as I speak Spanish, so, it was pretty useful to me.
Really? Well, I've been lucky, I
I see
I'm from Puerto Rico.
Okay.
When I got
People from Puerta Rico have an accent
None
None
It was because, when i got here, i found out that no one wanted to give me a job because i had an accent
Right
All these years i have done everything i can to lose the accent and everyone in my house speaks English
Wow
After i've been established.
Right, right
Because I've been here for twenty years
None
I'm starting to use my Spanish again and trying to find more people, because i never, since i got to the United States, I've always been with my husband
Right
How do I say that? I separated from
Right, well, you forget
Latinos, except when I go to Puerto Rico to visit my mom and brothers
None
But aside from that, I'm always with Americans here.
Yeah
It's a habit I have, and everything I have, what I cook, everything's American
Yeah
I don't know what has gotten to me
I've missed from time to time, i need to find more.
None
None
One needs to be able to pass on to our kids and grandchildren
Yes
And those
Yes, my daughter has been interested in learning Spanish and customs and all that,and she's practically the one who has brought me more
Ah, how nice
Again, and in fact I was researching online, to see if I could be an interpreter
Is
I wanted to be certified
None
Because,what is it? now I've been seeing more jobs that need interpreters and all that and that is something that I would like to do, you know
You should do research for the courts because when a person is going to do citizenship papers
Yes
They need attorneys, here is something that is in high demand
Wow
But they said they want you to go to school
Yes, well I found on line here to do I just saw online classes
Oh excellent
They come from Washington, but I don't have to go there, I can do it all on the computer or by phone.
What is the company called?
I'm looking at that. No, I have it at work, I was looking at it at work, I have it in the favorites.
Yes
At work
Okay yeah
I don't remember now, I think it was something like that
Very good, because
I don't remember but
I have been investigating. I found I want to travel to a country outside of the United States.
Okay
And what I did find is that if one goes to teach English as a second language, then I was searching for a Latin country to be able
Teach English so they pay me to travel? but what it has shown through the computer it pays hardly nothing, it's five hundred a month.
Yeah
Or if not they give one housing, a house to share with other teachers
None
They give twenty dollars a day which is very little,i know the advantage is travelling,but
Yes, but in what? Are you telling me you are working with insurance now?
I did it for twelve years of medicare.
None
None
The insurance benefits of the big companies, no? Where instead of them being a great board and announcing all the benefits that they get
The company sits with the person individually with the computer and they show them everything that's free.
Pay, voluntary, voluntary services, and this happens in many different states. I'm almost at home. I'm almost never
You don't have kids?
So mine are twenty five, twenty six years old and I'm forty four, my daughter
Yes.
Isn't a girl anymore, my daughter who's twenty five stays with me, she doesn't have kids, she doesn't have a boyfriend, she goes to work and comes back.
Yes
Every day, I say, this one will stay with me until she's fifty, I can't get rid of her
Yes, you are not married?
Yes, I divorced after twenty years of being married
Yes, now you have time to travel and enjoy and
I want to travel now
Yes
I looked for this little job that brings me to different states and I've liked it a lot because the company pays for everything
Yes
And when I come back well I fix my situation but I have my mom who's almost eighty
Yes
And I like to check with her because it gives me the opportunity to see the states that I haven't been able to see, because I didn't travel in my whole life, only on three or four cruises
Wow
I was able to go to San Juan
Yes
Cumule, in the Caribbean, or to Hawaii, aside from these four trips I haven't traveled at all, but this is where I knew my country, I don't
Know Mexico at all, I don't have family who I know, but all my family is in Texas and there I don't know anyone
None
So I would like to maybe travel as much as possible in the United States with this job
Yes
If the
How did you get into this thing you're doing?
This work?
Yes
In my company they all talk about it. When you see a person from, when you have experience in this area of work
Yes, many talk about what they will do, and now they call it networking.
None
When you stop working and go through the phases
You've been for many years, this is something in the past. The company where I worked for twelve years, they treated us really well and paid us well.
When the government didn't want to pay for the HMO, then they really cut down on us.
Yes
They already cut our officers from five to one and now they offered us packages to leave.
None
The ones that couldn't live with that cut were
Hello
Hello, good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
My name is Elena.
My name is Rodrigo from New York.
Hello, how are you?
Good, and you? Vancouver?
Yes
Is very far
Yes, are you Chilean?
None
No I'm spanish.
Oh, how do you know by the tone of the voice?
Yes, I have a good ear and many Chilean friends
You already know.
Yes, and I've talked with many people from Latin American so immediately immediately I hear the tone of the accent.
Yes, that's what happens when one already talks with a couple of people. You already know the tone and all that. I also know Spain, I lived in Madrid.
I'm from Madrid.
Yes I knew Madrid. I was in plaza of Spain in the, train stations, in collao and all that, I liked it there a lot.
I was there two months.
You there on vacation or for work?
Yes, I went on vacation and took photos in the little castles.
How long have you lived in the United States
Yes, I've been living in the United States for two years.
And are you going to stay there, or no?
Yes, now I'm thinking of staying.
You like it
Yes, I like it because I came, like I told you, two years ago and now I've gotten used to it.
Sure
I started studying and start a little business and now i got sued to it. i like having come other times.
None
Twice before. But this time I want to stay.
Super. How great.
Yes
And the business,is it going well?
Yes. It's a business that we Chileans have here in New York, that's about pineapples, selling this, mani, cacho, almonds, and all these things
None
I don't know if you know New York.
No, I don't see why is it particularly a Chilean business or
Because those who started the business were Chilean, so now the company has grown and yeah, there are others from other countries but those who started the company were Chilean.
What are dry fruits?
No, did you see that? What do they call it? Peanuts or things that are cooked with fire in a fogoco
You pour water and sugar, you warm them up and they sell
Yes, what we in Spain call garapiÃ±adas [sugar-coated]
That, that's it, sugar coated
None
We put sugar and honey on it
That's very tasty look at that
That's what we sell, and that's my business, i live from that
None
I have an apartment and i have my business
That's wonderful because it's just that New York is very
Cold?
It's very expensive
Yes, life here in New York is expensive
Have you been in other places?  I was living here in California and the truth is
Week ago, I was in San Francisco and I love it.
Yes
Yes, that's
No, the places i know here are only in New York and New Jersey
Have you never thought to go to California?
It is said that there are many Hispanic and many laws, many things I donÂ´t like a lot.
Yes, I don't know. Well, the truth is that, I was, the firs time I went to the United States I went to the east coast and I like most the west coast. Because of the weather, the people, for the
The quality of life. Inside the United States is much quieter, people are least materialistic and
Yes to me, where I would like to go is to Miami, live there in Miami.
Yes you can go
Because of the weather.
Because of course
You know that in New York is very cold. We have almost eight cold months.
Yes
And we only have June, July, August with hot and others are colder. Right now is cold, it begins to snow and all that stuff.
Have you heard today's topic that was put
The equality
Yes have you notice?
Yes
That inequality in the United States
There is much difference.
None
There is much difference when a person is an immigrant and comes from another country now. The single women.. they donÂ´t want them to come anymore
None
Mexicans, one died, one was killed short ago.
Yes
I find that there is not equality here, so much injustice.
Yes
Because if Mexicans come and jump is because they want a better future for them, for their families, for their kids.
None
The people in it, I don't like it.
Immigration, they also are dancing that, they treat them bad as the worst. I found that is not fair I donÂ´t like it
None
I do not think that there is equality here.
I think that it does not exist. Equality never exists
No.
A better thing, right? I know that I have seen for example in reference to Latin countries including Spain for example between men and women
No
There are more differences in Spain than in Cali, Canada, or the United States because in Spain, the woman
Because she is a woman she has less work, she is less paid and, besides that, also the job offers, and in Chile is the same.
They ask you questions that in Canada and the United States are forbidden. For example, your civil state, what is the other one, and things like that
In  the United States would never ask you if you are an illegal, in Spain they still ask you. The curriculum, I donÂ´t know if you call it like that in Chile
None
You have to put your picture. There are jobs where they require you to be younger than thirty, so there is age discrimination, there is sex discrimination,
And there's also, discrimination of race, right?
In Chile a woman wants to work in a supermarket that says, needed cashier up to twenty five years old.
Sure
Security guard up to thirty five
None
They put the age already by that limit you are already bigger, older, you can't opt for that job.
Yes is the same
None
I have a friend. His look is interesting, the opposite in your case. He was living in the United States for ten years.
He had his papers
Okay
But he didn't like it, he didn't like the United States and at the end has gone to live to Chile, he's been there already three years
I'm not sure how he's been doing since he was exiled from Chile and went to France
And then was living in the United States.
Sure.
And it was quite hard for him because he didn't know the language. Did you speak the language when you came to
No, I just recently started learning because I'm going to school to learn English.
None
Yes, it's hard, but you know that here the people are understood well. It is not impossible, I work just the same, in English.
Sure
Do you know what I didn't like about Spain? That I wanted to work in Spain and if I didn't have the job offer, I couldn't work
Sure
Job
If you don't mind,
No, ask me anything you want
Yes, what did you, what did you work on in Chile?
I worked at one of those markets
In Spain you can get a work permit because, for example, I know many girls that work.
Babysitting and they give them a job offer
Yes, i tried to get that job offer, but it was almost impossible, right?, it costed a lot, so i was there for two months and my ideas was to go
From Chile to do my life in Spain, but I went with two more friends. We were three
Yes.
And we were four
Right
Two stayed and two came. My other friends stayed there as well.
In Spain
Others in Spain
None
We went there on like two thousand and two.
Right
They have three or four years here and I think one resident.
What are they doing for work?
Having no papers they went to work in the fields to harvest the olives or
In southern Spain right? Almeria
Yes, but I did not like had a theater workshops
Yes
But when I saw the boss he didn't want to pay
It happens without shame.
I wanted to pay because their passports and held me all that I did not
I have family members here.  Excuse me a moment to say hello to Mary and give her a hug.
Your dress can you give me a kiss? I'm talking on the phone, but I have to go now, okay?
We are celebreating the cinco de mayo, iÂ´m sorry January
Yes that day
The three kings day
We celebrated yesterday with rosca
Fact
Rosca de chocolate (chocolate bread)
A chocolate cake
Yes
I've been here about ten days and I have not spoken to family members.
I'm gonna keep doing this, right?
How many calls have you made already?
I have around five, and you?
I have four or five
OK
I want to finish already, I told the operator, Can they call me three, four times a day?
She said no, it's only one a day, it's one a day, right?
I don't know, sometimes they call you more, it depends, if you have the call or not, but it's interesting, the truth is that you get to know people and you can see a little bit about the
The differences, right?, and, do you have friends in New York?
Yes, i have lots of friends here in New York, i have lots of mexican, dominican, puerto rican friends, I have everything
Yes
I'm one of the few Chileans that hangs out with them. I hang out with them because i don't quite get along with my race, which is chileans
No?, but why not?
It's like a very... like very envious people
None
None
Yes?
Sometimes you have a little bit of, of people from your own country, and you find friends in other countries that are better
None
It's not the same
Expensive, In Chile always, The Chilean people yes, have always been people very they have always given me the sense that they helped a lot.
Yes, we
They helped a lot among themselves and were very cooperative.
Yes that is true. We for example, the Chileans
None
We give them and where are you staying? Come stay here, you haven't eaten? We will make you food. We are like that.
None
We are very, loveable with the outsiders.
None
In the United States, they are not like that, it's very cold.
Sure
You come from outside and the people distrust you, they donâ€™t open the door, they donâ€™t give you a glass of water, they donâ€™t help you at all. Here one doesnâ€™t know the neighbor.
Okay
No, doesn't know how, that lives, no, they don't even know each other. I've been here in this apartment a year and a half and I don't even know all my neighbors.
None
I don't know them.
You
I live in New York.
Okay
In Manhattan.
Wow.
Yes, I like it here.
Sure I, you like it? sure, here, what happens in
You're in Canada, no?
Yes, in Vancouver, I told you, I lived in the United States
Yeah
Yes, I like it a lot, I'd go to live there but in terms of visas and everything, I can't get the green card. I was working legally
Yeah
My husband is from h ere. That's why we have visas today, because it's his family and, they're Canadian so I came here and I've been living here for two and a half, almost three years.
You are Spanish and your husband is Canadian.
Yes, yes but we're going to Spain
Yes
I always say we're going to Spain. Now starting in January, a course on import export and well, if I find a job I'll stay a bit but
In theory in September we'll go back to Spain.
Here in the United States, many Spaniards came to try their luck here because your country is good.
Yes, there's more in the United States, I don't
Hello
Hello yes a pleasure, my name is George calling from New York
How are you, George?
What?
What? yes I'm Antonio, I'm in Florida
How are you Antonio? How is it going?
How are you? fine, getting into the matter, I hear you.
Yes this about the inequalities, right.
Of inequality, discrimination, integration, all that fits there.
There's a lot of that, right
Yes,
I tell you let's see.
How long have you lived here?
Me is five years. You?
Always in New York?
New York.
Very good
How long have you been here?
I've already been here eight years and I lived in New York a while.
Yes
Yes
Got tired of the cold.
Well, so tell me your impressions
Man let's see, well there's inequality because of the economic issue but also there are inequalities
Yes
I think here that is almost, almost opportunity for everyone, true.
Yes
If you put in effort, there are opportunities, but many people don't bother to take advantage to overcome inequality.
I mean one part depends on the system
Correct
Of the government, of the people themselves and another part well man if I feel unequal, well I try to improve myself and get ahead.
Correct do you come from Colombia?
Yes I'm from Columbia
Me too
Yes What part?
Yes, from Medellin.
Maria, well you don't talk paya anymore.
Eh, barely. Where are you from?
I was born in Ibague but I lived in Bogota for more than twenty five years
It is good and very close to Bogata.
Sorry?
That Ibague is also really close to Bogota.
They're like three
It's very close, there in the neighborhood.
Yes
No, well, I agree with you, this is the land of opportunities
Yes
The evidence shows discrimination is crazy in some regions.
I don't know if you know that in Europe there are countries
Yes
That by constitution
None
A nationalized foreigner can't occupy public office
Yes
Imagine you have immigrants since they've been here to prepare. Here the only preserved office is
The President and the head of the Supreme Court.
Yes, the rest, everyone can have any office
That there's people, there are many success stories.
Yes
There are people who have a lot of prejudices.
Yes
In ours it's not so much the color of the sking but their status.
Yes
Bogota north south such enormous differences
None
And how the ones from the south there's no integration and and there's not much access to certain places.
It might even be possible to find more racist people amongst the Latin and the Black populations themselves rather than amongst White people
I mean that
Americans
Yes is that many times
Very racist, that the Puerto Ricans, the Dominicans, the Mexicans
Each one starts to put their country above,
Yes
In that vicious cycle
None
In a city like New York for example.
Yes
What as far as the integration?
No New York, since there are people from all over the world and there's a place for everybody.
Really
But definitely well like each region is, is closed. I don't think there's much integration. Suddenly one sees the Asians, the Chinese
The Hispanics and within the Hispanics the amount of groups there are each group is closed.
Yes
Basically, it seems to me that there is very little integration.
Correct that's also what I witnessed, but above it all you can
None
Say something grandiose. There is the coexistence, together but not in each other's pockets. They are not killing themselves because of race issues. And there are people from all over the world.
Yes.
Then there are places where
Yes
You say there live people exclusively of one ethnicity or race or region.
None
Yes, they coexist.
Yes, no and for example one finds for example in the English classes those types of things
Yes
I see many people that like the same, I try to integrate with Russians, with Japanese, yes and I've never found any type of rejection, within those people or nothing like that.
None
Is correct.
I think if one wants it one can do it, a lot of the racism and those types of things is a little bit of ignorance of the people.
None
Yes definitely the people, I see how ignorant the people are, that the first thing they put is the color I've had black friends, yes
Yes
People tell me And how do you understand black? no, I have friends two three, but And they have been like special with me, and I say, I don't know
One has to know the person
Yes definitely, exactly, I also think the same, that the people that put their racial prejudices or any other type ahead, are very low people.
Yes
Definitely you have to go further, man, why not see someone at the end for their values, for what they think, for what they do
None
Not just for the color of the skin.
Yes
Yes but unfortunately that's how it is. Just look
None
What just happened in France, where
None
They themselves had put a blindfold saying that everything was fine, everything fine, and everything wasn't fine.
None
It seems they have some belts almost of misery and they never wanted to see them.
And you would never hear
That all they talked about this country you know that in general the Europeans are always knocking on the gringos.
None
There I saw some documentaries from the Spanish television, done over there not from the gringos,
Yes, I was surprised with that.
With the ghettos that the gypsies have in the
Yes
All central Europe and especially in Hungary, Romania, they don't want to see the
None
Any misery neighborhood in our country is more than that
Yes
In Europe they close their eyes and say everything is perfect.
I really didn't have any idea of that situation
There you do notice a certain racism of the other where the people are not allowed, to advance socially.
Yes definitely the inequalities are the same in all the countries of the world maybe in some is more deeply rooted, or in some they cover it up, or in some they manipulate the situation
Yes, because inequalities, definitely in all part-here. One I admire when ones goes to certain part of the country
Is true.
I dont see shacks in the agricultural states
Also
Yes, I didn't imagine.
Yes, one.
None
In his country
Yes
Everybody lives very well. Well at least all the whites
No, I've seen many people that
Sure because there's also other people that I've known that don't care
Yes
Make a fortune, that's not their life ideal Then they live and survive but
Yes
They are not interested in sacrificing tim, to make money, that is what's happening last.
Yes, here there's not a culture of saving, of making capital, that many people live
Many people yes, well obviously, they do dedicate themselves to capitalize
Live no, yes.
There are others  that you have to respect. People that don't care say no, I'm not going to change years of life, precious time to enjoy submerged in money.
Yes but let's say in our countries, for example in Colombia everybody has a goal, their house, their savings, the education for their kids
Yes, like everybody has the same but not here. Here there are some that businesses or make money without caring too much about stepping on whoever.
None
Correct
Another sentence that doesnt make sense to me
For the mone. But yes you couldn't say they were unhappy, perhaps they are happy like that.
No yes, no, they don't worry about that situation they live there day to day, yes
I know there are people that are fine like that.
None
That is
But the problem is that this country goes around with it's head down and so then the people aren't watching that, because
Yes the last couple of years have been difficult
Because
What country is that?
Here, nothing is going to happen
No yeah that's not that the stories that they tell that they tell those that came here forty years age, that's not no
Yes
That they would go out in the street and the bosses would fight for them
Yes, not right now, right now right now for example top executives, executives who rare fifty, fifty five right now there are a lot of people in the street
Yes
Here with the pension plans, there are a lot of employees that are wanting to file for bankruptcy
Yeah that has been huge, that was an enormous tragedy
THEY TAKE THIS FUND THAT TRUTH, NOT THE PEOPLE WELL YES I HAVE BEEN READING STORIES OF PEOPLE THAT WERE NOT USED TO IT AND EACH TIME THEY WERE CHANGING JOBS GOING UPWARDS
After two and three years the situations getting worse
You see that, right?
None.
Addendum to this What do you think about interracial marriages or interracial couples?
It's hard between some, between some races I've read a lot about cases where, especially people married to Arabs.
None
It is a difficult case for the family due to the submissive nature of Chinese women
Yes specially for women, right
Correct
For women from here from women from, married to to people from middle east, it is difficult.
Sometimes they don't bother doing a little research.
Yes I have a daughter
They take very unpleasant surprises.
I don't think they are able to free themselves
Like prisoners, thatÂ´s correct
Hello, my name is Eliana, with whom am I speaking to?
Hello Eliana, Leticia speaking
How are you doing Lety?
It's great to meet you girl
No, this is incredible, look at that,
You seem like a serious girl and everything

Sure. Let's go on the weekend of February 20.

Yes, is it President's day?
Great
I was going to tell you that.

It wears out in time, right?
Dude, i don't know if you're so lucky
That's why I'm not going to marry. I don't know if I feel like it, right? In time you wake up.
Everyday and there's the same person next to you, that's
Yeah, a bummer, yes
That's why I want to be single. How many years have you been married?
Three
Oh, but it's not too much, you're like, you should be like still on your honey moon.
No, but a year and a half goes by right away and then the problems, the coexistence, you see, it's not the same.
Boring
Yes
It gets boring
I don't know it's not torture
But, you're plan on separating now, right?

What age are we talking about?
Fifty five.
How old are you?
Twenty eight. No, I lied, thirty three.
Thirty three. Yes, that's good. And with time this will be a problem. Have you thought about this?
Yes I don't know, love, you know. this never happened to you.
No, for now I'm thinking about, in what you say, what do I know, for example with, with sex, when this person is eighty you will be
Forty, you will be a young thing
Yes.
And what are you going to do?
And I donÂ´t know.
Sure is complicated, not everything is the money, no, the money doesn't fix everything.
No, it better not , it better not
None
But it helps.
Sure, I can imagine, to the topic of the day, which is the marriage of different races, do you have any race
In particular with whom you would have liked to have gotten married to or is not, is not, is not an option for you?
No, I never thought about it, I have nothing against any race.
I don't mean against, I mean in favor that you like one race more than the other for the future, no since this man is older, perhaps one day
And no, and don't tell me that.
You have the option no, but with good vibe, I don't know. Perhaps this poor man one day
I don't want to think about those things
Leaves you the bank account all in your name. I expect to be alone in life.
And I don't know, but then you tell me something. I start to find you way.
Sure, it could be.  Well, you can give me your mail, so that perhaps in the future we can connect,
No, but I'm married. How am I going to give you my mail?
Let's keep talking of the races, do you like any race?

Strange.

Look at that, look how incredible. how nice that, I love that, I love for the races to mix.
Let's return to the topic of marriage, what are you not happy with in your marriage
I didn't say that
You weren't happy you had told me.
Yes, but I don't know, yes, you're right.

No?
Yes, what do I know. I don't know.
Sure, and like I have it apart, just in case I, don't plan on marrying at any moment.

I don't agree with this big wall they are building against Mexico.
Yes,
You, what do you think?
I think the same, that everyone
None
He came, the majority of people come for a better future, to have a better economic life, to help their family, from the country they come from, and here this country
Help people to have this opportunity. They give them the opportunity, including my dad who was an immigrant, for many years. Now thank God he's making enough money.
Yes this is good. Have you been living here for a long time?
Yes, I've been here fifteen years
You're used to it, you like it, no?
What did you say?
You're already used to it if you like to live here in the United States
I love it. I went to Mexico and I love to go, but only on vacation. You're already used to it here, going to live there again, I don't think
I would be comfortable. It wasn't the same when you've been living in a country and you've adapted to the culture of that country.
Sure what happens is that people
You know?
People get used to a level of life. You're already used to living here in the United States. And after going to live in Mexico, since you
You would only like to go to visit because you're used to living here yes
None
The same happened to me, I lived in Chile
Yes
My parents came from Chile, but I'm used to live here too
Have you been here for many years?
No, I go and I come back, I come and it's like the fourth time and now I'm here again, yes.
I understand. I'm Mexican and going back to Mexico, I don't think I could do it.
My dad cooks No, don't think that you can go back to your country and get used to living there, right?
But yes, no, not any more, I would not be able to get used to it again any more.
Yes it's hard to get used to it, and that's why I'm telling you, I think that this country gives many possibilities of
Yes,
Like what they call here the American Dream, so everyone that wants to come here and I think that's good. Give an opportunity
What one earns in a day, sometimes a person makes that over there in a week
Then so used to a way of living
Sure
That and a hundred dollars a week.
None
No, we wouldn't be able to live.
No because you know that here
No, I mean It would be difficult for us
None
For us to get used
No, here one can earn a hundred dollars daily. Over there I tell you they earn it in a week, as you say Eh, one has to get used to that standard of living.
Exactly, yes
Yes,
Imagine it's be, rather the country
Yes
What damage
Exactly, I don't know why those men
Personal
Mean men I don't know what they are called Who are against the
Yes
We come to contribute to the country.
The labor and production
Yes
They aren't coming to do harm.
It seems that I heard that
There are so many racist people pardon
It seems, I heard that, the founder of that organization
None
Is an immigrant
Imagine that
Hhow can an immigrant do that to his people, understand,
Yes, I also know that
When
There were some Mexican people that were saying they were like accusing, they were in charge of looking for people that were coming through they themselves
Being Mexicans or from Mexican parents that are into that too, how can they be like that.
None
That's not all right.
All Hispanics do the jobs that Americans reject.
Sure
And that
Just imagine how it would be without them.
It's everything this country doesn't want, they don't want to acknowledge the fact that they need the immigrants and that's why sometimes, they do grant asylum to people, to people from countries like El Salvador.
Sure, that's why they don't want to acknowledge the fact that they need them, yes
Yes, so, for example, this lottery thing, have you heard about the visa lottery?
Yes, the
Yes, it includes lots of countries that have been excluded from the lottery, I mean, because, they chose to let in some countries and leave some out
What happens is that, the, they include them because they have already filled their quote, they have a quote for example, there are lots of Mexicans, so we have lots of Mexicans
They don't want to let in more Mexicans, so that's why the are left out but, there's still a
They also leave the Salvadorians and Hondurans out
Yes
Guatemalans.
Yes, because I don't know how this works so they I believe they fill their quotes and they need foreigners from this country
They don't need more. I don't know. I only know that Chile is not excluded from the list.
How?
I the only thing I know is that Chile is not excluded, no, we can
No
Well, before it was very easy for us to come to the United States. You got a visa, anyone who had a good job, who had a
Regular economical situation got one, but now it is almost impossible. Now for a Chilean to come to the United States, he has to be almost millionaire
Yes.
A long time ago he got the visa
What?
He got his visa a long time ago.
I got it in the year ninety-four
It's a long time ago
The important thing is to keep you coming and going. They give it for six months or one year, and you must respect that date
And that's it
Yes, but it is nuisance travelling there. Every six months spending on two way passages is expensive
The idea is staying here for a while, but it's illegal.
None
I told you, from Mexico it is also difficult to get a visa to come here
Yes, really difficult.
Too much vigilance
Even, in my country, it was easier for a person who was studying in the university. Regular students from the university applied for it and got it.
He may come to stay
Yes So many people opt to leave the hard way also hello, okay
Yes
It's hard but they come and opt to leave the hard way
I can't hear you because there's too much noise around you.
You can't hear well
No, it's all the noise in the background
Okay, hold on.
I can hardly hear
I'm going to move to another room to talk.
Do you have a party there?
Hello
Are you having a party?
Yes A little party of the magicians, that we 're still going with the magician's party and Now yes. Now you hear me fine right?
Yes. Okay.
Now I came to the room, yes
Better yes than no. For example, they want to build the wall which will divide Mexico and the United States.
But the funny thing is that the Mexicans think that the Mexicans themselves are going to do that because they can pay them cheaper and the
Yes, I understand. He found the bar, but the cafe for the Mexicans
Near the border, what you see is the immigrant. An American is not going to work for five or six dollars an hour
No
They would have to have a great need, and then, unfortunately, the Mexican or immigrant would have to
It is like an irony that they themselves have to build their own barrier
Yes, that is what I was saying
Their own wall
I heard in Primer Impacto the other day fashion shoes, been sold in New York, in New York
Yeah
They are being sold around two hundred dollars each pair, and the designer of those shoes went and gave them as a gift to immigrants
Yes
Because she made a promise, and the immigrants have very expensive shoes, and here americans paid around two hundred dollars to have that pair of shoes
Yes I saw the all terrain shoes.
I suppose they have a compass
Yes
Like air under them
They were all terrain shoes, prepared to cross without a problem
Yes, those are the shoes. How funny that an American has to pay $200 for a pair
Yes
Those illegals are going to have the shoes for free. All is an irony in life right now
There are some things that also help. For example,
This
I have friends that They have, they work with a cart, so they sell on streets Yeah And time ago that person could have a license
Now a law was enacted, after October, November That the person that doesn't bring papers Can already get their license, the only thing they need to get is the Tax Id
Yes
Yes
Yes, because
So already
Yes, I heard that the immigrant couldn't get, for example, a license because the process became harder in light of terrorism
Yes, And that more than anything had affected the immigrant a lot All, all the terrorism that there is that there's been lately, the attacks and the threats
Has affected the whole nation whether you're an immigrant or not, because still
Sometimes I think that is too much
Yes, but they are doing it for your security, of your family and mine
Yes
And certain things are good, for example in the airports. I don't know if you have traveled lately but in the airports
No
Sometimes you canÂ´t even carry a razor
No
In the cabin Because they take it away They wouldn't let you carry it.
Now they are allowing the use of scissors again.
No, that I haven't heard
Doris
Maria, hello
Yes hello good afternoon
Yes good afternoon the topic is the immigration
Yes
What do you think about a little bit the topic that they posed the impact of the immigrants inside the economic structure of the country
No, I think that the immigrant has been the great majority structure of the country because nowadays the immigrants are the ones that work in the country, the major
Source of works are done by the immigrants.
Sure
None
In the beginning history of the country, the presence of immigrants was very important, especially before and after the the wars.
Sure
Already having an established country with a social economic and political structure don't you think that the presence of the immigrants can affect what the
The social structure
What happens is that
For example the fact that the social minority transforms into the first minority of the country don't you think that can have an impact
The natives from here don't want
Yes but the Latins are the immigrant already turning into the majority of the country each time more and more immigrants arrive
I think that after they come to do a job and help the economy of the country right? because they also contribute to the economy of the country, of the country I think there's no problem
I think that the immigrant presence is positive in any country.
To a growth, right? I think that interchange and multiculturalism is positive
Sure
Yes, I think that in other countries, and specially in the Latin American countries they are much more tolerant with the immigrants and offer much more options for them to stay and settle
The policy of this country is often too restrictive
Yes, I think so, because I think that, if they come to work, and they come to take care of their family, and they contribute to the country because they work
Contribute to the economy of the country. Although they are immigrants, I don't see the reason for those laws and that pressure. There are other countries where they can have a chance.
Without all the requirements of this country
But, I think that beyond the economical impact there is a social impact that I think affects, I think this is a country with a structure
A social structure quite conservative, more than is often shown
Yes, that is the real problem, I think that what affects them most is how their culture is being affected
And is getting mixed with the immigrant's
Thinking about cultures from different places in the world, I think Latin culture is not contradictory
The American culture, because I think that for the Hispanic community, the religious values of the families in the United States
And some certain policies have a big support among the Latin community, which may be different in other communities, in other cultures
Hispanic immigrants have a positive presence because of their values.
The American hold
Culture diversity is very good, I think that people
The American can absorb a lot of things from the immigrant and they can live normally, it's just the laws
Don't help the immigrants
And why do you think the American has this negative attitude towards the immigrant and the Hispanic often?
I believe that it's because it's turning into the most of the country already has more rights and things are changing for example, regarding the language
Spanish is now becoming more important than English. All those things I know that more immigrants are arriving and the country is filling up with immigrants. They have more rights and they can
They can have the right to certain things and be able to take decisions, because the number of immigrants is growing
I believe that the United States is afraid of, of loosing its basic beliefs so, I think that the majority of the
Hispanics arive, and then they are given a voice and power to vote on the nations matters.
I don't know the basic beliefs, I'm doubtful about that, yes, is it a matter of belief or a matter of
Racial discrimination. I had a situation when I was in this country that I didn't know about it when I was living somewhere else, but now I see the discrimination.
Racial discrimination, this discrimination started against the black Afro American population, the black people and I think it's now against Hispanics too
I don't know if it's against the culture or against the core principle of basic beliefs of the North American culture and Insist, to me, one of the
Basis of the American culture is that it's so conservative and very religious and I think that I share that with the Latin community
That might not be shared with the Asian community because they are different, they have a different vision of the world, no? But I think they are similar to the Hispanics.
The discrimination is racial
Yes I think there's lots of racism here and I just got here and I've seen that and I'm
I'm an American citizen without an immigration problem. There is lots of racism, fear, and confusion here.
They treat you like you were inferior because they were born here.
And you think that most of these controls, the patriot act, the real ID, all those new things that were approved in 2005 that are going to be discussed in 2006
The references to immigrants, do you think it has to do with what happened on September eleven?
Yes, I think so, yes, I think that they are judging all the people because of what happened on September eleven and I believe that
They judge us and are afraid.
It might not be an immigrant that does something like that again, it might even be an American, you never know
There are many people out there that are not well mentally.
None
And and it can be from the house. It doesn't have to be an immigrant. Understand that for me. Maybe an immigrant can come with good things just as he can come with bad things
It can also be an American who has good things. Just as it can also be bad things.
Yes the topic of security is not a matter of ethnicity let's say
Pardon?
The topic of security because all the laws that are emerging and all those things that are being done they are shielded in the national security almost all come from
The department of home land security  and I think that's also a way of creating a very negative awareness towards the immigrant
Because of security then we are going to close the doors then i think that there's an idea
Using that idea to justify policies that deep down have nothing to do with a topic of security like you say
The security, the insecurity is independent from the race of whatever person right? this can be the same American in fact in this country a thousand atrocities have happened
The problems in the schools, and the rest that have been in focus; have been caused by Americans.
Exactly
Where are you from?
I'm Puerto Rican
From Puerto Rico - I'm from Argentina, and how
I arrived here and then I also received rejection even though I have American citizenship, understand ?
None
You know I didn't go through the hard work that immigrants go through to enter the country
Sure
You know I got things like if I was totally inferior to that you understand me and that many people that are not even American also get
Sure
You know that one comes to the country has luck, it all depends I think that we can't judge anyone understand
But even when you are Puerto Rican and come here, you feel that in some way they judge you with the same stick as any other Hispanic, with or without papers
Yes, of course. No, they already don't look at you as if you were. I have the citizenship but they already look at you as an immigrant, also
Sure
They don't look at you as if you came to the country and you already have, you are an American citizen, you know many people don't but many people look at you yes
Where are you from? You are an American citizen, but they look at you because you are Latin.
None
That's what they look at and I think that no they judge people a lot because of that
None
It shouldn't be like that I think that all, we all come to give something period and the United States lives a little bit in fear of that and I think that the immigrant comes to give
Like the same American that lives here he is offering his country but the immigrant there are some that know but there are others that you know everything is
Sure but do you think that they really are scared of them in reality because to me the fear of the immigrant is an excuse to cover up another fear
Yes I think so I think that the United States is afraid they will stop being the world power.
I am
Hello.
Hello?
How are you doing? My name is Adrian.
How are you? What is your name?
Adrian
Adrian, where are you from?
I live in Toronto, Ontario, Canada,
None
I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
I am Chilean.
Yes, and where do you live now?
Now i live in Maryland, near Washington
In Maryland?
Yes, near Washington DC
Near the sea?
Not near the sea.
No? Not near the beach?
About three hours from the sea.
None
Well, not very close
The only thing that we have here are lakes.
None
None
Well it's still water
I don't know
None
Have you lived here for long?
Four years
That's good. More or less like me.
Do you like?
Yes, it's a little cool at the moment. But,
Yeah, the climate's tough.
Yes.
Yes.
Over there it's not so cold. Right? In Maryland.
It's pretty cold, yes, in Winter. Not now, but, mostly in winter, but in winter, to
Nie, There's snow and all that?
Yes.
Yeah?
Yes.
No.
No. It's cold, yes.
I don't know, to the south, where the snow gets to. But,
Me neither. I know it comes here, yes.
And,
What, mm,?
Were you born in Santiago?
Santiago yes.
Why did you leave?
Because I married an American.
Then you didn't leave.
They took me, yes.  They brought me here, yes. Exactly.
Where did you meet him, in Chile?
I met him in Chile.
None
In my country, yes.
Was he working there?
He was working there, yes. He had a company over there of consulting company, or consulting, or something like that.
Yes, exactly.
And you? Why did you left to Canada?
I was tired of Argentina, How can I explain it? I know, I know that things are a little different in, in Chile, but
The way of how the country is, if you want, or, or society, or the people, or the politic, or the economy, or everything together
Not being able to make long term plans
None
And, basically, tings like that,
None
Buenos Aires is becoming a city, quite different of what it was like when I was little.
Yes
Is a much more dangerous place, I don't know.
None
I don't know what else. In my life I remember at least three of the important economies and
Yes.
With everything that has brought me. Right? Is not only the economic, but there is an issue I don't know if it's psychological
The situation is very hard, for the Argentinians. Now, and, and, we, I think that we've taken from here, from there to here, in the sense that the Argentinians traveled to
Chile had problems and we traveled to Argentina when they had problems
Yes, always yes
With the matter of currency exchange. We knew what was happening in Argentina. Really, it's a chame because a country, with peopole
I like the Argentinians
Yes. When they are all together, holds back so much
None
Yes. More than two points, no
Yes. they have their things. But, I would say that they have good things also. But, I don't know if it's bad luck, the truth, no, no, I don't know.
No, it hasn't gone too for them. But, we have to talk about the topic of immigration.
It would be a little subjective in our case but if you wouldn't have married an American would you have left Santiago or not?
In my personal case no because I didn't have many reasons to emigrate. I was working and making good money. No, I had no situation that would tell me or that would push me to,
To leave to another country. Then, but I think that there are many people
Did you get married and leave or you got married in Santiago?
I got married and left.
None
I knew that. I knew.
Obviously, yes, they fooled you, that's true
No, but I want to say, that it wasn't something that
None
That came in the way and they told you, listen why not? No, I knew, And, the truth is that I'm very adventurous, then no, I wasn't scared.
Okay. But, for that it was, when you accepted the package, it was with the tickets also.
Exactly, yes
But
Yes but, I don't know, I, the truth, no, the topic of immigration, I think that it has advantages and disadvantages, like everything. Isn't it true?
I find that legal and illegal people come here.  I think that the illegals, of course is a complicated situation to handle.  Illegal people don't have,
They don't have health rights. You can't have a control, but you don't know who they are. You have no record.
Of that people. It's complicated for a country to handle that.
The health, no, I don't live in the United States but if you don't have money, you don't have access to it right? If you don't have money to pay for healthcare
Does it matter if you are there legally or illegally?
It has nothing to do with being illegal, but in my opinion, the
Of the country, it has its advantages and its disadvantages. I think that it has both. It has both, I also think that many people take advantage of it and they pay lower wages and all of that.
It favors the economy.
Yes. That's why from the outside, they complain but nothing changes, everything stays the same as it wouldn't suit us
I believe you advantage of paying them low wages for their job and they can't complain because they are illegals
They are illegals, so, I don't, I don't know. Look, the truth is that I don't know. I think that I don't really believe in, in, in countries, they have the Internet, and with that
The information comes and goes and in the end, the countries are going to end, so, I don't know, it's a bit
No, I don't believe so, I don't.
How?
Like that, yes. It's quite a romantic idea, but
Yes, I know that, but, the truth is.. no, I don't know. What do you think?
No, I don't know, when you spoke about control and you don't know who they are and I don't know what, what, what, what, what, it's the bad side of
This, that could happen. Do you think it's wrong?
I think it is wrong. You know why?
The illegals they don't know who they are and no, they can't control but, why would they have to be controlled then?
No, it's not about control, but, it is in a sense, if you live in, in a place, you have to know your obligations and your rights.
I see it from the point of view of the rights, for example, if you work, and you get a wage, you have the right to have that part of your wages and to have a retirement fund and to have health coverage and all of that but if you are here illegally
Consider how you are going to get that. It's hard.
That's their fault, the problem is for the illegal or for the one that has given him an illegal job, or?
No, I think they share the blame, of course, this, the illegal, I believe, he doesn't, I'm not sure, I've never asked them if they are illegals or not, you never know.
I believe that if someones is traveling to another country and leaving their family behind, is because they have a lot of problems in their own countries.
I believe that they share the blame or there are situations in both places that make them
Promote that, you see? In some way, they receive information in Mexico, or wherever the immigrants come from, about the best possibilities in here
Who are giving them those opportunities? It's the Americans like myself, so we share the blame
No, but I think that for them to leave their families and all they have behind to come illegally to the United States is because,
They are desperate,
Sure.
Whatever that means. It is
Sure.
The, I always think that, that, that, to me it's not, that doesn't make them a bad or a good person, a better or a bad one
No.  you are not coming here to play.  If you are an illegal migrant, it doesn't mean that you are a bad person Most of the times
No, oh well, I've never experienced it. Illegal immigration, it basically doesn't exist. The,
I believe the difference is because everybody can come to Canada and file for political asylum
None
I think that for default, they don't refuse it to anyone.
Sure.
Starting from there, you can start the formalities.
Sure. Yes, politics.
This is why I tell you no, there isn't a strong market
For illegal immigrants, there are some pretty obscure jobs.  The boy I met was Chilean.  The Chileans don't need visas to come here.
None
To study and to, because of NAFTA.
None
You can come, but I think that you can't work,
Hmm, yeah.
For example, he, illegally, in quotation marks. He, and there are some jobs in this call center, that do like scams and some fraud.
None
With.
This is everywhere.
Yes, but this is why I have problems
They don't need illegals, or immigrants, do to this.
It's something that's obscure, the work in this
Yes.
If you go there, you know that you're losing something,  it's gray, with respect to the law, and things like that.
Yes.
That goes more there to the,
Carlos
Marla, hello, fine, and you?
Hello, how are you? fine thank you, how are you?
Fine
Oh, good.
It is the first time I've done this.
Me too
Well anyway we are supposed to talk about immigration
I have no idea because I didn't expect the call
What? But do you want to do it?
Yes, of course I do, go on, I listen
Yes I'll start. I don't know. They asked about immigration.
None
Whether you agree to an indiscriminate immigration here in the United States, or not.
Yes, I think that this is the country of freedom they call it, right? But there must be some parameters, also.
None
Because it might become a social problem.
Aha.
And a cultural problem for the United States, because certainly every person, depending on the country you come from, whether it is Central, South America, or even Europe
Absolutely
They bring their culture, for example, now, with Hispanics, we know our culture so then there's a clash.
Yes
There's a culture clash and social clash, because we also have to get used to all of the culture of the United States
None
But most of them see that we are Hispanics and that also affects the United States
All together, the whole of society
Yes, even in religion
Why religion?
Because, for example, the United States has mostly a protestant society
Hispanics are Christians, yes
Most of the Hispanics are Catholics there's a religion clash and not only a cultural one
That's right.
Religions, where, if we put ourselves in the United State's shoes
Yes
We know that they have to handle it and I think that they must have it under certain control
None
They must have a certain control over it because the moment will arrive when this will get out of hand so, they have to control it
Yes. I believe immigration should be regulated.
Everyone, in general I believe that
None
So the country would have to evaluate the kind of immigration they want to benefit, so to construct a stronger country
To do not happens what you are saying, so I for example if I had, if I were the United States
Where are you? Which country are you?
If I were the United States
Yes.
Not if I were in the United States. No, I am in the United States. I am here in Boston. If I were in charge of the United States' politics
Look at what they do in Canada. We need a labor force with sectors of the economy
I would let people come who are
None
Of course positive for economical development and on the other side I also would let those who make doctorate here who want to stay post doctorate
This kind of immigration that raises the education level in general of the country I think that is good
Yes of course, I think that anyway, here come
None
To me, in my way of seeing things and in the little I know from the time I have been here most of the people who come here are very in need and they are people from low income from another countries
I talk of a country, Hispanic or Latin, most of them.
Do you think so yes, but are you talking about illegal immigrants
Most of them however is not our case. There come so many people that come here because they have very bad economical problems in their native countries or in the countries they are living
None
Then they come here with what they have called the American dream
Of course but
Not everyone is professional and not everyone is studying. And not everyone has had a career.
None.
They came here searching for a better future.
Sure but I mean with the immigration laws that they have now if you have that profile how do you enter the country
I entered as a refugee
What is that, political refugee, okay okay I understand already
Yes is for a situation that was out of our hands already and we got to leave
Where are you from originally? Columbia
From Colombia yes from Colombia then that is a situation but I do think that they should regulate some more
None
Avoid that cultural clash and that religious clash also that whether they want it or not it's going to affect this country
Yes absolutely
None
None
They do it, they do it I think, sure, then is an issue quite complex but I think that there should be a control, I don't know if there is I think there must be but but I think that
Yes, I think there is. With the Green Card drawing, that lottery
Yes
For example there are countries that cannot participate
Yes
In that lottery I don't know I think that China can't participate Jamaica cannot participate either
Yes but the same I think that there are many people that, that are, that have arrived to this country and are here illegally
Of course
And I think that there is where they have to become more hands on, pay more attention
Yes what happens is that I mean I don't know they have to decide to control it in some way
Yes
I don't know the people that enter illegally, I don't know how you can control that
That there should be some way also
None
But for me that's the biggest problem as far as immigration
None
The person that arrives here illegally
Do you think there are many that come illegally?
For me is - well I think so
Yes, what happens is that, I don't know I can't even think of how to do it I mean is like I don't know
No, but I think that there is where they most let come in.
I think I don't doubt what I don't doubt what you are saying look I'm telling you I don't know how you do it cross the border I don't know without anyone seeing you
None
How do you do it? Every time I enter the country I have to provide several documents.
Yes I entered before requesting asylum with the visa and without any problem. but I don't know how the rest might have entered but there are people that don't have a social
A document and are here illegally
Yes, I am
The great conflict is on the border with Mexico.
Of course, okay I know someone
For me it's all a big problem.
Okay
It is a big problem.
She lives in Miami
She came as a tourist and never retured to her country
Yes
She really bad happened because I had no access to any health service.
Because being illegal is terrible.
I think we all need someones's help because we are all human beings.
We are all human beings.
I work in a school where most children are from illegal immigrants.
You can not deny education to a minor.
Of course.
Just because parents came here illegally.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello, who's speaking? Leticia?
It seems we agreed.
I've been calling  you for two hours. I'm here calling, yes.
Really? I went in and it sent me. Sure, we were waiting.
I was watching TV
It had been such a long time?
I don't know. But yes.  Ten minutes, fifteen for sure.
I'll probably get someone I know, but i didn't know with whom
He already called five different ones?
And, I told him, yes.
None
Because he used one of
From the laboratory.
The secretaries also. He got in the laboratory to talk. Since it didn't call, he said,  I'm going to start calling, because if not...
No, I can't believe you. It has been a long time since we saw each other and we have a lot to talk about.
It's been like yes. Less than twenty four hours.
Yes.
No, i already did this topic once.
Yes? I didn't get this one. They do repeat the topics as I've gotten them repeated before.
Yes they repeat them, that's why I already got this one.
None
And I don't remember if I talked to someone on the topic. Who was I going to get? I was intrigued...
No, I don't know. I was convinced that I wasn't going to be able to communicate in reality. Then, since I saw that it wasn't connecting, and that for sure I wasn't going to be able to talk again. And I was, come on. I had no expectation.
Yes. And what are you doing? Waiting for Paulo to eat, or?
Yes. I mean what happens is that
What? yes?
Waiting until eleven thirty, twelve, like you start snacking.
That's why. how do you do it? Is a pain waiting so long.
But, I also don't like, I don't know, for him to come and eat alone,
No, yes.  You'll make the effort and will eat again.
Sure, like I snack something there. I have soup envelopes. if I get very hungry I drink a soup, something
You cook for when he arrives?
Sure. yes, now, just now at this time I start to cook. So, can you imagine? for eleven.
You have a ton of time.
Yes
Yes, obviously.
Really? How nice.
Not me since we just arrived. We came in the train bus. Since it's so nice. See that is twelve degrees?
Is very nice
Yes, and then we decided to walk a while. We took the train bus until the twentieth, and then walked. At least that way we do some exercise.
Yes.
Then the man made me make milanesas, for the oven.
None
So we made-
How's the diet going? Did you catch Mariano again and put him in line?
No, mariano is
Already is.
Yes, no, no.
DIeting take discipline. Once you break a diet, your diet is screwed.
No, yes.
Is like quitting smoking. You stop smoking, you smoke one of these, and already you started to smoke again.
That's it. No, that's why, yes, is very hard. I don't know? And, I don't know. I'm like controlled, but I'm not doing. In reality I'm not doing the diet that, that, that
That my sister gave me, nor any diet in particular. like
You why because you gained weight? are you eating too much, or because of the change, of the quality of the things?
I try not to eat sweets, basically. I don't know? Honestly, I don't know. This last month, I figure
But have you weighed yourself? Are you sure you gained weight?
I was eating yes. Some one kilo, two kilos yes. I mean more than what I brought from Argentina, that already it wasn't what I wanted, Right?
None
But for me, it's the lack of activity in these last months.
Yes
Because last before
With this cold on top, sometimes you don't even feel like going out to walk
I started to work, and started to walk less.
Sure.
Every day they had some cookie that someone had cooked. It was incredible.
For the holidays, they give each other things,
Every day there was some cookie.
Sure.
See. I mean, you pass by there, in the morning you get hungry.
Yes, ues
You pass by where the cookies are and eat one.
Like now, that the German girl came from (?) and brought chocolates, and you think that? Just from the tray I grabbed one.
Sure, that's why, is
Are you bored working?
I get hungry.
You're going very early, right? Eight?
No, eight thirty or a quarter to nine, depends of the bus I take. That I took. No? But, I don't know. Ten thirty, eleven I get this voracious hunger.
Yes.
I ate an apple.
Sure,
I eat it.
Yes.
I swear that in December it seemed as if everyone had to take something because of the parties. Many people cooked, and then they would take things,
Okay, and if it's a big laboratory, like they wind up and many come like that.
Some that were good, yes. It was fatal. Also, I received little gifts from everyone. Everyone who's closer to me.
No?
Taking cookies, all my close co-workers, they gave me some gifts.
A chocolate
Chocolates, a little soap, another candle, another CD with Christmas music.  No
How funny
It's customary to do that, and
I don't know. My boss gave me a card, the only one.
A card to Mariano, the boss gave him. they, Mariano gave him a gift because the Chinese guy told him that last year the boss had given gifts. Then they anticipated
They gave him a gift, the Chinese guy chose a fruit basket.
Between all of them.
It seems kind of strange
But, on the other hand, that's customary I saw in many places set up fruit baskets.
Yes, the Chinese guy was insisting that it was customary. I said And they gave him that. But, then the boss gave them, some bomboms and a
What's it called?
None
For twenty five dollars, like how nice.
What a son of a bitch. My boss is call-
He was reported.
My boss only gave me a card that she made herself on the computer.
Really?
With photos that Paulo took. One day we went to eat at the house
No. She printed some things and done. No?
Sure. Went to eat at the house, and, and I said, aye, i want to take some nice photos of the kids to make a Christmas card for my family because I have family in Germany and Africa. that don't have anyone.
None
And I didn't have a camera there, what do I know. So, Paulo took photos of the assholes.
Put together a card. Yes, sure. She gave one to each of us in the laboratory and sent one to her family. It's printed there on the computer
Yes it wasn't anything like that.
At the time I was happy, but now that, that I hear it, I don't like it that much
Not playing. I didn't give anyone to anything, I mean,
Me, nothing. Not anything
I didn't give anything. I didn't know if there would be this vibe in the laboratory. When I came, for me it was almost -
It depends on the laboratory.
I had just started and for me it was little
Very jeered.
Since it still wasn't in the vibe there, I don't think I ended up badly because I had no reason to know that they were giving away all those things
Nothing. I don't think that is what is customary. Is that your laboratory is like that or Mariano's
But buy there he could've talken something.
Not me, mine nothing. And, the one in front, Paula's, nothing also.
Yes, there because they are American bosses.  But Paulo's is also American, what happens is, that he doesn't care.
Yes, but is seems that Paula's is very cheap, see that she counts?
None
No. for the holidays and,
Yes.
They brought a basket with oranges. And, they put the basket there. No, no, fatal.
Look. Look at my laboratory. The German lady did, because they were used to celebrating the sixth of December more than the
Twenty fifth. I don't know why the sixth. In reality the sixth is the day of Saint Nicolas
Why the sixth?
Christmas is the day when Jesus was born and on that day Santa Claus gives the gifts to the kids.
Really? Don't they go the sixth of January?
The sixth of December. We only celebrate the kinds in January with a small gift.
Ah. Look.
A matter of making some cookies, then they give us some cookies.
Yes.
Fatty things that come apart in the mouth
Delicious.
No, no, no. I asked her for the recipe, but well. I have it written down there. But, they are hard to do, I mean, not hard, but they have eighty thousand steps, and kneading, and
Yes, you have to make them, yes. It goes in Sure.
I don't think I'll ever do them. If some day I do, I'll give you
Yes. go then.
I don't know what they are. Is something incredible. Kind of like the dry pastries of over there.
Yes.
Thinner. I don't know how to explain it. They are more delicious. More delicious.
None
But that was the only thing. My boss was the cards, and the fat guy nothing, the other guys nothing, me nothing. No,
Yes. Yes, I won't know why, in the laboratory, I don't know what.
Really good.
It was done like that, and I said
The same next year you will have to take one.
Next year,
Candies, something.
I said When I go to Argentina I'll bring something.
Sure. Well I didn't go to Argentina, I brought them.
Sure.
I brought chimbote candy.
Yes, when I go to Argentina
Yes.
Mariano was already looking at the prices in that page you sent him. The one of cheap, and told me he found good things.
Did that page is super good?
Yes.
They have very different prices from all the rest.
He told me there are good ones, but some don't tell you the airlines
No.
Is it like priceline?
Sure. It doesn't tell you the airline, and doesn't tell you many of the times. It tells you, put, such day comes out. But, but it could be from the day from zero to twelve.
Sure.
I mean if you are going to travel
There the schedule doesn't screw you so much.
For a weekend, it really screws you. Because, is, is very different to leave at a time which is twelve hours later.
Yes.
For a long trip, no.
Yes, no. For that. Right?
It doesn't matter. The truth it doesn't matter.
He was looking, and, because he had already looked before, in other pages, and up to now it was the best.
Yes, I don't remember, because I always looked, and they said, but I don't know, because I put it on cheap tickets.
And, cheap tickets is terrible. It's a scam.
None
None
What's it called? Than despegar, than Asatec, than any.
Whoa ohkay either im having a stroke or this sentence doesnt make sense
They had no offers for April
Also the things from the last minute. No? I don't know what they are.
Yes, it's good to get it at the last minutes because before you had to look for the flight earlier.  Now, it seems like the offers come morre at the last minute.
Yes, when the airplane is left empty.
Yes, when they see that, they won't fill it, they put it on sale
None
None
I went when it was the holidays. When it was on vacation, I said, if there's something on sale for Spain, we'll go, we said.
Yes. no?
No, there wasn't anything. It was really discounted for January. It was after. For the holidays there wasn't anything, it was really expensive.
Sure.
Now in this time, going to Spain is crazy, two hundred dollars for a return.
Yes, it's crazy. And well, the Spaniards wen-
Hello.
Hello, good evening.
How is it going? I'm Manuel.
Fine, thanks. How are you? My name is George.
Pleasure.
Yes, And what do you think of today's topic?
About the immigration, I don't believe they reduce salaries at all, right?
Yes.
I don't believe they have anything to do with that.
None
Rather it would have to do with the poverty here in the United States. Right? That, they also take advantage to pay little, since, the people that need the money, will get it regardless.
Yes.
But, they don't exclusively depend on the immigrants.
Yes.
There's
I think that here, the system, a form of double standard. Right?
None
They blame immigrants.
None
They want to have cheap labor.
If it's true.
Sad, with the benefits of to have a right to a, personal and to legally established here, Right?
I'm not very well informed, but I believe that Mexicans mostly do all the work on the farm.
Yes, no, all the farm labor, and all the low, low, low level work
Yes, well, right?
We say that how they've been displaced from the mid-ranges
None
That they've been forced to, begin and to take some low level positions, right? Before they wouldn't have taken
Yes
Soon, because of the economic situation, the situation is changing a little bit.
None
But, if you look at the majority, I think that seventy, eighty, ninety percent  of the hard labor, the tough work is done by immigrants, legal or illegal
More than anyone else, illegals have working conditions that are most times sub-human, right?
Sure, because if they don't have papers, it's more difficult for them to reclaim their
Exactly.
The stability
None
Ay, this, also the owner, or the, or whoever's in charge of hiring, they take advantage of that. Right?
Yes, well, I always, I always said that it's a double standard.
None
The businessmen as the government, know very it's very easy bringing a illegal person.
Probably yes.
They, the only thing they do, is, present before the public opinion. different positions. And, that's what's happening right now with the Senate and the House of Representatives.
Sure, I also don't understand why they build that wall if all the laborers are Mexicans.
Because
They aren't going to throw them out, right?
Now, there are elections coming up
None
Many politicians need to start pleasing the people that vote for them. Right?
Sure, probably for the wall
Then the
An act for the electoral propaganda. Right?
Yes, they are always in favor of the immigrants or against the votes.
Sure, because there goes, a good sector that doesn't
Yes.
More is a little like xenophobic. Can't stand immigration.
None
Because
Yes
Yes because the state has a double standard.
Yes because that's not, it's not hard, to determine, by means of an employer, to determine if someone is here legally or not when they hire them.
None
Sure, they can easily get to know that.
They do know, they do know, who is going to do those jobs
Yes, yes.
Some jobs have been taken to other countries.
None
Yes, for example, maquila to Mexico or Central America or to China but some jobs like in the farms they can't export those because the fields
They must keep those here, right?
The fields are here and they have to farm it, no?
Sure, and no gringo wants to.
No
Well, some gringos do, some are farmers too, but not that many, well, no?
No, and they pay bad, they are farmers but, they are used to work with their
In their own lands, maybe?
I think so, yes, and with modern equipment, they won't stand working that many hours, under the sun and all of that, no?
Yes, but this is for the illegal immigrants that are farmers and pick crops.
Yes.
Oranges, tomatoes
Yes.
They have to do it, with, with people with illegal people. Right?
Yes.
Nobody does it.
I tell you that I had the experience, I worked in a factory five years ago, when I arrived here
None
And it was an egg processing factory
Okay.
There were two lines, there was a line operated by pure immigrants
Yes.
The majority were illegal.
None
Another one operated by Americans.
None
That's supervised by a person from the government. Every day, the machines have to be impeccable.
Okay, the facility.
Has to be, yes, the facility has to be, at six in the morning has to be completely clean.
None
Processing eggs,
None
Yes, if they find any egg thing, they wouldn't authorize that day.
Yes.
Turn it on.
I already understand.
Not a week would go by in which the line of the Americans didn't have work for one or two days
None
Of the badly done work.
I understand, okay.
Yes and the manager, would tell me, it's incredible, here the illegal people, because they are the people that work. The others don't work.
None
That's true.
Yes, there isn't a big necessity.
Imagine it happens like that, because, definitely, the culture is different.
Yes, any job if you've had one or worked anywhere, you realize that sometimes
Yes
The Americans, are not too interested, in the small jobs.
No, they take their time.
They get them to pass the time.
They talk a lot.
None
They don't care about changing jobs. Mm? They change jobs as if nothing
They can jump from one side to the other. The illegals prefer to keep a job if it's good
If they like it, they prefer to wait there a while.
Sure, and they have to take care and be there.
To produce. No?
The American, without a job, he'll go to look for help from the government.
Yes, they pay you eighty perfect, I think, from what you're earning. No?
Exactly, while an undocumented person, the immigrant person without papers
Yes
Who, has to work
Sure, has to work.
Has a job where we have responsibility, here responsibility in our countries. When you come here, then, you, what you're worried about is work.
Work, and work.
Sure, because here, the immigrant finds work at the beginning, but badly paid
Exactly
Sure, everything you do is a lot in your country but here, it doesn't cover much either. I think that it's like you say. No?
They say many things
Now, another situation, for example the, the poverty in the majority of the Latin American countries, have been provoked by this country.
Sure, no?
None
Yes
This is the consequence of what they have done over there.
None
The people have had to immigrate because, What else can they do? there are no job sources
Right? They come because there's no work over there.
Because there's no work.
Right? It's not because the country is bad but rather the individuals are bad, especially the ones who are unemployed.
Yes.
That's the reason that propels them.
Now, this country has been one of immigrants always.
Right?
It makes me laugh to see thirty to forty year olds fighting against immigrants. If you look at the origins of any person...
Sure, all the whites from here - well, Irish
Yes, Europeans.
Germans, Europeans, Right?
Asians, from all over the world. Then,
None
I don't know who,
But,
Who isn't an immigrant here.
They go to the Latins and Chinese, but not the blacks who are already established.
Yes - well, they really were immigrants because initially, they brought them here as slaves.
Sure
Yes. They bought them because they wanted to.
They were forced. No?
None
Yes, because also, for example, for a European immigrant, it's easier to get the papers, it's simpler immigrations than for a Latino immigrant.
None
There's
But why?
It's a bit, well, for him, it will be, well, for the racism, no? still, in North American culture.
Yes, I don't know.
Obstacles to
I don't know.
No, if immigrants don't have papers to be able to be working here, they kind of have to take what comes.
But it's not easy either to put the fault on the immigration for the decrease in salaries and all this, since this responds to commercial strategies
That administrative policy will take advantage of what they fine.
Yes, there are many businesses here that like cheap costs, they take them, it's because
None
They have workers--badly paid
Yes, well.
The people who come to look for work from other countries.
It's like this. No? I can't remember, what was the last?
I think that the qualified workers
None
I don't know, I'm in a very special situation. When I came here three, four years ago,
None
With the development of the Internet, and the rise that it had, all the companies were asking for authorization
None
Yes, to bring
To bring people who worked in, computers, No?
Exactly. And that year, no, there was the great collapse.
None
They complained that more than one hundred thousand. And no, this quota didn't fill.
Definitely the fall of the internet, many businesses fell, and no, people.
Yes
Now they are bringing many people from India to work in systems.
None
Now they're hiring, over there.
Yeah.
There are many business that are taking everything to India, above all, support.
Yes, this happens, no? Many people from India, it's
None
Experts in informatis systems, no?
For example, support for, support for, I think that there are some accountability programs. So, calls for support
Inge
Hello my name is Miriam
Hello Miriam, how are you?
Fine, what is your name pardon?
Inge
Inge
Yes
Right, and where do you call from miss?
I am calling from Washington
Is there much immigration in Washington?
There is quite a lot.
Yes
Where are you calling from?
I am in Toronto, Canada
In Canada.
Yes
There, the immigration situation is different
No, there are also quite a lot of immigrants, quite a lot, but I guess the United States are more saturated, because even the people from here moves there because the sallaries are better
It looks like
The sallary is better than in Canada
In some places, maybe. In some sectors
Yeah there's a lot of people here from El Salvador, not so many Mexicans, but a lot from El Salvador. Where are you from?
I'm from Peru
None
From Lima, Peru, and you?
You've been living in Canada for a long time
Yes, ten years
Oh, quite some time
Yeah, yeah, and you seem young to me
Yeah, not too young but you can talk to me informally
I see.
How long have I been here, is that what you're asking?
NONE
Four years
Where are you from?
From Santiago de Chile
Santiago de Chile, that's good
Yes,
I didn't recognize your accent because i know many Chileans that have a different accent, a little bit, like yours.
Yeah
But i didn't get any accent from you, that's why it was a little bit hard, maybe the province, i don't know
Maybe, yeah, they speak different in different parts of Chile
Tell me, what do you think about immigration? Do you think it's saturated and that they shouldn't take anymore? Or that they should take everyone?
No, they're two extremes. Not to accept any more and accepting them all, two extremes
Right
I think they should regulated immigration a little bit more
Yes
I think it's regulated, they're probably the illegal people the ones who have more problems
That is very true.
Illegal, yes.
There's plenty of illegal people
They don't say they're illegal but i imagine
Yes, because i have seen on tv, i have also met people here that come here from the United States but then they don't like any thing here
Why?
Because Canada, first of all, I mean people that come from different Latin countries to Canada and goes to the United States. They like Canada, and people that go to the United States first and then come to Canada, they don't like Canada. They think the country where you got to
First, you liked it there and you got used to the people
Uh huh, sure
They go back right?, anyway, I have heard about a lot of people that go back because in Canada, for example, they speak English a lot
NONE
I don't know id they don't in Washington, i don't know, it seems there are more latinos, where people can work without trouble
Without speaking the language
Speak the language yes
Yes.
However here in Canada is very indispensable to know English
Okay
Although it's becoming really, for example you find Latins everywhere.
None
You will find it everywhere and there they give you a hand translating, but it's always necessary to speak the language, and also that they pay is really low
None
And that I don't know the cost of life here is high, and you can't find work because
There aren't a lot of jobs.
No, there's even employment agencies that pay little they exploit them a lot, but there aren't many.
Sure
The government put as a restriction that the same employment agencies ask for the social insurance number
None
Many might fabricate it, I don't know.
None
But it's a little hard finding cash jobs here in Canada
Do you think they should allow more immigrants or make it easier for the immigrants or qualified people
What can I tell you, Canada is a country different from the United States, Canada has a lot of land
Sure
What happens is that they all gather here in Toronto
That needs to be exploited, but the people don't go over there, see
Well it's also very cold there.
If the government or people would invest in other cities it could impact traffic
None
The traffic, because the traffic annoys a lot. That's why the people want to stay in Toronto because they find the buses and the train fast see
Sure
But if one goes out of here is hard, with a winter, I tell you that is horrible
I can imagine
Because waiting in there in those stops with that cold, that's horrible
Well that's why they don't have that may immigrants either.
Already in Canada there's a lot, but I think that the problem of the United States is much bigger
None
It's already much bigger
Yes I think that too.
I knew an Argentinian lady okay she had spent like more than ten years living I don't remember where, but it was in the United States, without any problems
None
Without papers or the need to speak English, however she felt very inhibited when she came to Canada because she couldn't speak English and needed favors from people.
And she couldn't find work. They left
Sure
And then I men a Colombian woman, same with the thing that she didn't like Canada, yeah
Yes here
You have never been here, come one day to see
Here there are it's practically, there's everything, restaurants, there are television channels in Spanish.
Yes from here we se over there
Radio stations
Many channels that we watch are from there.
None
I mean the production of Canada is more
Sure
Yeah
Sure
It's a nice country. It is developed, but I think
Maybe life is very difficult there.
It's a bit difficult and the more conglomerated it's the United States.
None
It has diversity in many things
There's a lot of people  for example immigrants generally work in mowing lawns in the summer, to do everything that
None
Patios, gardens
And so you think that one of the questions was:Do you think that they deserve the salary of a resident and why?
No, I don't think so.
Or they bring new energy. Alejandro hold on, Alejandro stop
Yes
Look you are going to fall, sorry
It's OK.
It was my son who was climbing on the window. Do you think that he damaged it or brought new energy?
In reality I think I don't know how to answer that question
None
Because I think that on one hand they benefit from being able to perhaps have a salary that lets them live, I think in comparison with, with their situation in their original country.
Yes
On the other hand it doesn't have a lot of benefits. They're workers but they don't have benefits or
It's sad yes
Or health, or any of this, so I don't know perhaps it's worth it for them to come and live here, and if the government lets them come legally and this
Perhaps they will have a lot for free and there won't be enough work for them, I don't know.
Also because there will be a lot, who don't want to see everyone, sees the United States as half.
Yes, they all think that.
Or Canada also sees it as
Life is easy there, or they can make a lot of money.
Yeah, look, professionals come here, but the English barrier is very strong, because I don't know if in the United States
None
Is like that, but in Canada, the English barrier is very strong
Sure.
They demand a lot more
Right? Well I imagine it depends on the area, right? Since here there is a lot of immigrants.
That too
The residents are more sensitive, so they're not so closed with their accent and their words. They have a lot of interest in learning Spanish.
That's good, that's good, but like i told you, I've met many professionals here that, they don't get, they don't get with their papers and they can't find a job, they can't perform in their area
Right
That's, it's very sad
I think that if you talk here, in a professional level i think you'd have the same problem
To the United States
There's people that don't speak English. There's people that does work, like manpower, fixing gardens and don't need to communicate.
Right
Or take out the snow during the winter
Right
That sort of construction that don't need
Construction pays
They pay it, yeah, they pay them they pay them i think
Yeah, here in Canada many people look for jobs in the construction business because you can make money, itÂ´s hard but you get money, the money
None
If you go to a factory or something like that, you get
Sure
A lot of sacrifices. I'm giving it all up.
Sure
Giving many things up to save money
Yes
Rents are very expensive, too expensive, theyÂ´re
Yes, this area is a little expensive.
And
There are sectors of, just immigrants, latinos, and they all speak Spanish
Yes
It's different, it's like having a country inside another, sometimes
Yes how interesting
Yes, but some people don't like it.
Here itÂ´s not like that, everything is mixed
None
I wouldnÂ´t say there are sectors, people do tend to look for each other, right, and there are some areas where more of them
ItÂ´s not exclusive, there are other people with them, but itÂ´s like they
None
They look for them that way, they try to live close to each other.
Sure
For example, Polish people try because they are white and racist. The Europeans talk to a lot of people but they don't actually accept them.
Sure
They are just polite
None
I heard they live in a city away from Toronto.
I see.
I've heard that they look for people like that. Yes, that's true.
Yes
I see
Hello?
Hello
Who is it?

Very good.
Yes, you. What do you do?
That, and, internship in what?
Of what?
Yes
I look in Buenos Aires, I am in the second or third year.
Of what?
I don't have much working experience.
But, what are you studying?
I'm learning a couple of things.
What are you studying?
What?
What are you studying?
Biology
Very well
Yes, you? What do you do?
I'm biologist
Oh, look at that
Yes, I work doing research, I'm doing a post-doc
Oh, about?
About rapid development in mice
Development, what?
Embryonic
None
In mice
Oh, that's really good dude, that's good
You see
Interesting, interesting, it's really good
Have you been in the United States for long?
I got here ten days ago.
Newly arrived? I've been here five years.
You, five years?
Yes.
Whoops
What do you think of immigration?
How is life here?
What do you think of immigration? Let's touch on today's topic.
The topic, no, that it concerns us.
And it concerns us, exactly
That topic concerns us, of immigration here, in the United States. And, it's complicated. It's complicated. There's a lot of people. A lot of immigration. Especially
But, do you think immigration is good?
From Mexico.
Do you think that it's good? Is immigration positive for the country?
Immigration?
Yes.
Yes, let's say that it is too excessive, I think the immigration to the country. What do you think?
No, but, I think that it's good, that it's something natural
Yeah yes, it has
The people don't have to work on this side
Sure.
He comes.
Yes, has its things. What happens is that
Also, the Latin people are the only ones that work.  You go to any restaurant, and the ones that are in the kitchen, working, washing dishes, are
Are all Latins.
Yes
That's true.
Or Chinese, all have big.
Immigration is good. What happens is that
There is
There's a little bit of regulation missing.
Same in the university, All the post-grades and all the doctorate students the majority are foreigners
Sure.
I think that is something that's good.
Sure, but there's certain immigration that perhaps is not, is not too regulated, by the state and many people
Yes, the state can
Work in conditions more or less, labor
They come
Semi-slave.
Sure, because they come illegally.
How?
It's not regulated because it is illegal.
Sure, yes.
Or to establish a more permissive immigration law, so this matter can be better regulated.
Yes, that is right
Yes but instead of establishing, instead of establishing permissive laws, they build a wall, and that and that only makes it
Sure. Hello,
Hello,  Can you hear me?
No, I didn't hear that last part.
No, I didn't really say anything.
The last part of what you said, I didn't
But, no, the reality is that with these policies the only thing they are trying to do is
What do you think that, those policies have?
To stop immigration, yes, there's something about it, I believe that the policies are meant to
Xenophobia?
No, it's a policy. In order for the government to be popular, people who are middle class or working class
They are upset about immigration because it takes jobs from them. Most people hire illegal workers because they are cheaper.
Yes.
That's why they take jobs away from the local people
Sure, that's right.
To show that it is visible that they are working on it.
About the wall, yes, it's very exaggerated, I think.
Build a wall, sure but it's something that, I mean, the people that cross a river, and cross a desert how are you going to build them a wall.
Sure
I think that the matter is another
Yes.
No, but yes.
They'll cross in some way
The way of stopping immigration is developing, or investing money in
I can not hear you very well. Developing, a little
In other countries. And developing the other countries, especially all in Latin America
None
Giving money to Latin America. The people I mean, the people won't come to the United States if their country has money.
Sure
I don't know, what do I know.
None
Sure, yes.
That the United States, finds the easy solution, that nobody crosses. But, but the truth is that, is very, the wall, is kind of
It is bad, and yes, it is very messed up. Many cross and then they hunt them with trucks, as if they were animals.
And they returned them. I don't know, everything is very, very bad.
Yes.
What?
Yes, that you do need to know.
Yes. The truth. And life here in Philadelphia?
No, living in Philadelphia is fine. Yes.
It's good?
Yes. we miss Buenos Aires,
Yes? From one to ten? What do you give it?
None
If you have to give it a score?
I don't know, I don't know what
What?
I don't know.
You wouldn't put it.
No
None
I don't give it a score. No, but it's good, you live good. It's fun, there's a big group of people
A lot of friends?

Yes
A long stretch to finish.
Yes
Yes. SO little by little no.
Yes
T-step by step
That's good, no, it's good. And do you think about returning, would you like to return or
Return here?
Yes.
Yes, if working conditions are very good.
That's good. Do you like the work you do?
My job?
Yes
My Job is good.
What do you do?
I'm learning about culture
What are you doing?
Cell culture, basic experiments with gels, PCR, things like that
That's nice
My boss is a pain in the ass but, well, you can't have everything.
Yes, it always happens, problems with bosses
He's a pain the ass
There are problems, yes
Pain in the ass, but the truth is that, my job
What happens is, that
The work makes up for it
What happens is that in my house, the graduates that are here are quite lazy.
The undergraduates, they are lazy?
Yes, they don't want to work
No, who, they don't want to what?
I don't work as hard as I used to in the past. They don't want to work like we used to work.
And yes
When I was a student and worked in Argentina, I worked without resources, and I worked many hours
Sure. Worked full and here
I didn't complain much.
Here they are more
There's almost
They're served on a tray here. Of course they have it.
Sure, they complain a lot.
They complain a lot.
Yes.
And yes, this is true. But here it's good. There's a a lot of resources, a lot of labor
Yes, yes.
Wow and there aren't many who, apart, this orientation, from science. People who live here
Yes
Or no? They're nothing like outside, no, the way they suck.
Yes. In general people doing a doctorate put themselves in a foreign state.
All foreigners?
Disciplines like bio engineering or computers are ninety percent foreigners.
Engineering and computing?
Yes, it's what the people
I can't hear you
Americans instead of going to graduate school, to study for four years and earn fifteen hundred dollars per month
Yes
They go to work at company and earn four thousand.
And it all goes to the
Sure
In the economic area.
Sure, yes, or the, private companies, the development, whatever it is.
Sure.
They think differently
More in science and yes sure, it's more
Yes
Don't pay much, that's why
Yes
It's like in coso.
Well, the same.
In Buenos, like in Argentina.
No, it's eve worse in Argentina.
It's pretty bad in Argentina. Also
It's pretty bad in Argentina, yes
Yeah, it's fucked up.
It's not
I don't know if before when you were there, it was more, a little, worse or better, i don't know if it's bet- you have gone back
What do you do in Argentina besides study?
What do I do?
In yes
Basically it consumes a lot of time.
Do you have a girlfriend?

A company that distributes chicken.
None
I will go to Washington and from there to Virginia.
Yes, a lot
Yes, it's a lot of travel but I love it because I meet many people, and I chat with them. We're always about thirty employees and we all stay in the same hotel.
None
Yes, I don't know anything about this immigration.
None
At least what's in the news
None
But they say that we can talk about other topics
Course so, I think so. The last time I talked with another person on another topic.
Yeah for...
We didn't talk about the topic of the day.
Yes, for me the immigrations are, yes I support them. in opinion, it's what we owe to the Americas.
Here in America they have, This idea that anyone can come, no?
Yes.
But there's also abuse when the person has to die to be able to pass, yes. Sacrifice so much. He can at least help to make it easier.
Is it a process to help them?
Yes, it's good.
In the events, because I grew up in Ladedo, Texas. And they told me that there the tourism business is finished, it doesn't exist anymore
It's
Yes
Simply because there is so much crime due to poverty. I don't know if it's the drugs or
Yes.
Where there's a big market in the streets, there's nothing
Yes. Above all.
For me, this has to do with the police who don't have control.
Yes, this.
Or the government when I get these calls. It could be any
None
Moment in day and here he found me. Searching for a key for my hotel. I will find it now.
Yes
Where are you from?
Me too.  I'm speaking, I'm from Houston, Texas.
In Houston. There I have a brother that works for Federal Express.
Where?
He lives in Caiti, Texas.
Yes.
But he works for Federal Express.
None
He's already been seventeen years with that little job. We're always asking him to come and visit and he doesn't want to. He says that.
None
They give him very little free time.
None
Although he does have vacations
Yes.
I have to make a trip over there, to meet the wife. And they have already been married for five years and I don't know them.
Sure.
No, but yes he's Mexican, no?
Yes.
None
Mexico
From Mexico. I see. I don't know much of Mexico, only the areas we have been to on vacation, on the Cruises, which by the way were only Cancun and Coserle
Yes
And when grandma took us to the 'partillas' when we were little. And we were a queue of kids, four kids. With just 'tortillas', but by that time
None
Right? there was much more free time. You don't have to, our grandma advised us not to talk to people
Strangers, right?
I agree. Please hold on, I am getting another call from customers.
Yes
Seven or eight calls
None
When I first started getting calls, I forgot the PIN, then I got like thirty calls
Wow. I have, how long?
I didn't go back home, I was in these assignments
Yes
I didn't know where to look in the house. Then I finally remembered where the number was. But I forgot how they pay, I haven't got any check yet
And you?
No, they pay January about March
Oh, Until march
Once when the study ends, it depends on how many calls you've made.
Yes. If I've forgotten.
They send it to everyone now.
None
I think that until March, but it's not immediate.
But it's not regular, so I forgot how they paid. It was from twenty.
Yes.
Five calls but above it was two hundred dollars, no?
Yes.
Hopefully it will come to us.
The and five times calls, and five different telephones. They give you fifty dollars.
None
Extra.
Are there different telephones?
None
Telephones?
It can be a cell phone. Of a friend, your cell phone. At the house, five different, different numbers.
Yes just to test a telephone.
Yes, me too. But how many calls to you have?
With this conversation maybe eight.
No. Don't worry. I barely have three with this one
I have talked with thirty to forty people.
None
None
Yes.
I talked to a lady named Olga and she lived in Detroit
None
Or no, that lives in Canada. Another one from Houston. That's why, it seems I recognized the voice. It was a young man. A man from Uruguay. Another from
South America nationality.
Argentina?
Yeah I spoke with a man from Argentina. And with a man from Colombia.
None
But the call to a Puerto Rican girl was disconnected because my phone wasn't charged.
None
I didn't know how to get in touch with her.
I think that
Yes
No, I think it is like an automated system. right?
None
It connects you and disconnects you, so.
Okay.
You lose the contact, the communication.
What other type of study do you do in Spanish? Is it the only one?
Is the only one that I'm doing. yes.
I used to converse with many in English here in Chicago.
Yes.
They've paid me up to two hundred fifty for forty minutes of doing a study on new foods. For example, KFC wanted to introduce
Change the recipe of its the coleslaw
None
They had us tasting and taste and taste the recipe, the differences. And they gave us a sheet of questions and to write what it was you
Yes.
Noticed if it was wet, that if it was dry.
None
That if it's hot, if it's spicy. The Baskin Robbins that they added, the custard or
None
Something different, but it has a lot of criteria; you have to make a certain amount of money.
None
But, that's what I like about Chicago. One can go during work hours or dinner time and you finish in plain day
How nice.
Yep. I think I'm going to go down to find another key because yes I lost it. yes here it is Is strictly in Spanish. There's thirty of us
I don't have a big family. If I have it, I don't recognise him. My whole family is in Texas.
None
Yeah
None
No. Some cartridges, yeah. Look there are the bosses as well. Okay, thank you Ma'am. Oh, great. So I'll share. Okay, sorry.
Oh, don't worry.
Yes
How is the weather right now in Chicago, Is it snowing, is it hot?
Snowing, we're expecting four inches this year yeah
None
It was more or less good this year.  We had it good.  For example, we were in the fifties some weeks ago.  I don't know if it broke the record or not, but
You've been doing OK
None
Because for example right now, to get in front of the Field Tower
None
Almost one has to be on his side to be able to walk.
None
That's why I come to the South here for this assignments.
None
They sent me to Arkansas. However, they have the central offices in the North and from there they put you to work. I said, OK I didn't count on that.
That's why I'm leaving tomorrow. I have to go to Washington.
None
But
You already finished a lot?
What do you make a living of?
Pardon?
What do you do for work?
I
None
I don't work. I study.
No, you study, that's very good. And what are you studying?
I study at the university.
Is not
I'm studying economics.
Thank you for the card. Tonight, room, room. two sixteen. Yes. I left it inside. I'm sorry.
Well, no
Yes, I'm going to study at school to be a real estate investor.
Good evening, my name's Marco and I'm in Philadelphia, and you?
Good evening, my name is Vilma and I'm in Maryland, how are you?
Hello Vilma no, sorry, I was trying to adjust my ear piece when they were saying the question, did it have something to do with relationships, on the internet and that?
In the, exactly
Meeting people I remember when I was younger, let's say
In the good years
Because of course I'm still young
At heart, right?
Sure, I remember that they said that love from afar, eh, love of fools
It's the same in my country.
Sorry?
Yes, I think that there's the same saying in my country, where are you from?
Yes? I grew up in Paraguay
Okay, I'm from Bolivia
And you? Close, very close.
Yes, neighbors
My father has an estate in Charco Paraguayo, approximately sixty
None
Kilometers from the border of Bolivia
How nice!
But, as we used to say
Regarding relationships, for example I think that when we were growing up, we didn't have this Internet thing
No
I've had the chance to meet one of my partners in
None
To fall in love through the phone was in the past
Yes, you still, I also remember when, hours and hours here in the United States, at least there's the unlimited
Calling, local calling, we didn't have before
The bills were for the parents, they'd pay any amount,
Exactly, that's something that my dad is always going to remember
I see
He's always going to remember that because the telephone bill's that he'd get
Do you think that this new invention, the Internet,
None
It'll be useful to get to fall in love over the Internet, with someone that you don't know where they come from, because there's so many lying that you might not be aware of, because you don't even know how their voices sound
You are not too sure if the person you are talking to is really who they say they are
Exactly
If it's not a she, or if she is not a him
None
Those things, I remember, one of my friends, she was not my, she was not my girlfriend but for all practical reasons we were dating
I see
I never kissed her
None
I keep hitting my head for not having done that, but, memories
I see
We met on the phone, she knew a person I knew and for some reason, I can't remember what it was, I think she was about to do
A telephone and needed somebody to
None
She asked me to sponsor her.
I see
And we talked for years - it was not just one call of course, but we talked for years and got to know each other
And
I think it was months until we met in person
I think that romances before were a little more romantic because
Yes my darling
They want to go too fast
If it is on the Internet they want to see naked pictures.
None
If it is in person, it seems that, I am out of the market since some years, but it seems that its is like 'let's go out tonight'
If nothing happens tonight, well, maybe tomorrow.  It must be very fast
Yes, it's, it's very rushed, I believe that all that romanticism that we had in past years, it doesn't matter in which country because I believe that here in the United States it was like that too.
Yes.
People used to be more romantic, they would go slow and now it's like in the first or second dates they're having sex and then it's over.
Yes, exactly, they do it on the first date
None
I think that's a reflection of one in every two marriages ends up in divorce in the United States
Yes
That's an overwhelming number. It's quite scary
I'm not aware of the percentage of the couples that get to marry and then start to fall in love through the Internet. No I don't have a number or the percentages.
The way in which I count them is through the number of people that I know, that have met through the Internet,
No, I haven't met anyone, I don't know anyone that has
I have. Yes.
Well yes I'm lying. One of my coworkers has a daughter and she loves to go out with people from the internet. What do I know?
None
Every time that he goes on a date with someone from the internet, they go out and it's a fraud. They get nowhere and as I was saying, on their first dates these people want to have sex.
Yes, they don't really get to know each other through the Internet, you don't get to meet their friends or their families.
Exactly, that's another disadvantage
So, it's completely anonymous
Yes, totally
In that respect, in Paraguay they'd go celebrate. I never understood why they'd use this word, celebrate, but they'd use it to say that two people were going out together
None
When they went out together, when someone goes out, if you and I go out my first question, like, yes, on the phone, starts
What are you wearing
Hmm,
It's hot down here, they're starting, wait a moment, because we're talking about, what do people talk about normally?
Now in these
It seems like the art of conversation has been lost
Like I keep saying, there's no romance to get to know a person
Yes
I think that maybe people are turning more frivolous or more materialistic because now they ask if you have a car
Well, especially in this country, you have to have car
Yes
But in our times there wasn't, at least in our countries. The boy went how he could to her house and
Yes,
And they got together, like I think it's all changing now, and it's a shame because, well, I have young daughters but I don't see
That my daughters are living what I lived
No. Don't forget too, that, at least, for example, here in the United States, something that I realized is that
The Yankees do each stupid thing
None
When I was in Paraguay and they were there, I always was in, I went to an American school in Asuncion
Okay
I always met many people from the embassy, American people, I simply met
None
It can be said that sometimes the American does such stupid things but also have a view from the practical side.
The American is quite ignorant, there are many Americans that you give them a screwdriver and they don't even know what side to grab really, but one thing that I remember, I would defend
Yes
Yes, is true, there are a lot of practical things that they don't know, but, one thing yes, the American works
None
The American works more than a worker from another part of the world in number of hours and in amount of work
But perhaps that is another thing that jeopardizes a couple because they are so bottled up in their work, the work absorbs so much
One doesn't have the time
There's no balance.
Yes, there's no, exactly, there's no balance, I'm I'm, engaged, to be married with my girlfriend, who is here
She has a five year old son
Is she American?
She's American, eh, is funny, her name is Hernandez but she doesn't speak Spanish but she is American - she got married, basically she got pregnant, and what does a Catholic person do when she gets pregnant? she gets married
None
She got married before of and immediately
She got married before falling in love.
She got married with her boyfriend of many years
Good
They broke up, he was the boyfriend again, they broke up again.
Several times, but what ended up happening is that she got pregnant, they got married quickly and, the creature was born, and had his name
None
She kicked him out of the house before the kid was one year old
None
I knew here before this and had lost contact for some years.
Yeah
We started seeing each other when the kid was a few months old.
None
After having the kid she was starting to be able to leave him at night
Yeah
I've seen how at the beginning you need to still be really attached but when he started to get a bit older,
None
One to five months.

We lived in Boston.
A really pretty city, but it's a bit cold.
Yeah, this is why we cam here, from one extreme to another, no?

None
The weather in Phoenix must be incredible.
Now it's an incredible climate. It's three very cruel months with the heat but the rest of the time is really beautiful, really great.
Is it too hot in summer?
Yes, too hot.
None
Too much
Of course, because they always portray it as a place with nice weather that never rains, but in the summer it must be very hot.
Yeah, but during the summer, it goes up to about a hundred and fifteen, more or less, the temperature
Thats like 45 degrees
Yeah, more or less, yeah, it's a lot
It's a whole lot yes.
It's a lot.
Is it at least fresh at night?
It's fresh at night, but during the summer not even the night is fresh.
Right
Not even a little
Right
It's pretty hot
You have to put up with snow now
I prefer to put up with this summer for three months
Yes
Than that winter for six months, you're locked up in a house without being able to go out
Sure
It's easier to beat the heat than that horrible cold
Sure
It's very horrible
Here is not so, the winter is not so terrible, it's a little bit better than in Boston. It last less, at least, it's three months. It's cold but,
No, It's so terribly cold in Boston.
But in Boston the spring and autumn are like short.
They are very cold. Is that it starts snowing, sometimes, since October.
They are short. Sure.
Then, you don't have like a lot of time to
Sure.
Of good.

Climate, and when there's good sun, there's humidity that's unbearable.
Sure
An unbearable humidity
Yes, it's true. And what, what do you do, work, study?
No, I'm a housewife.
None
No, here I don't do, at this moment, I don't do anything.
Okay.
In Colombia I, studied librarianship, I'm a librarian.
None
But, here I don't do anything.
How interesting.
Here I'm dedicated to the home and the kids.
Sure
None
That's good.
To the maternal state, I'm dedic- Yes,

I have two babies, one girl who is a year old and another a three year old boy.
How cute.
They are very little, they barely walk
Yes.
Starting life...
Sure. And is the older one starting preschool already?
What?
Is the older one starting to go to preschool, or to the daycare, or does he stay home still?
He's still here in the house, we already registered him, this year already he starts to go to preschool.
None
None
Sure.
Already this year he's going to go to study.
Sure.
Because it is already time.
Yes.
Do you also have kids, or are you married?
I'm, yes, I'm married, but, no, I don't have kids yet.
Not yet?
No, we are thinking of having in the near future. But, in like one or two years.
Yes
Yes.
That's good.
We want to start trying.
Yes, already
No we do want to have kids badly, at least a couple.
A beautiful experience.
We'll see later. Yes.
I took a long time to have my kids, a long time.
Yes.
Because I had them when I was already older. I've enjoyed them so much, maybe it's because I had them already older.
I had leapfrogged.
Sure.
That has helped me a lot to enjoy my kids.
How nice. Yes. We see, our friends who had them older. She is young, but he is a little older. He's forty. Forty two, something like that
She is.
None
Thirty one, thirty two, only, young. But, and we see them that they enjoy them so much, they have, had twins, and are very fun, is very entertaining.
My baby, I had him when I was thirty four years old.
Yes, That's good. is also young.
Yes.
Yes.
No, Young, also. Yes, almost forty
Now people are having kids in their twenties.
None
Is very common.
Yes, that's true, that's true.
And, on the other hand, one can take advantage of the best of both things. Be independant and later enjoy the kids at an age when one is still young.
I've always thought if you have them too young
Yes.
You are not going to have time to study, to do that things that you want to do.
Yes, sure
It will be difficult.
Yes, it's difficult to even go out with friends. Or anything, to go out to eat, it get's complicated because
None
If you have a couple of children, you have to movilize the entire family, but, the same, I mean, we would also love to, the truth, in a couple of years yeah
Start with that stage, but on the other hand we know that we could've have a good time being married without children, and it's nice too.
Yes. That's true
None
It's very nice.
Yes.
But very nice and children were very nice, I live happy with them.
What? I couldn't hear.
That children are divine, I live happy with them.
Yes, sure.
They are, I don't know, they fill up your life.
Sure. Yes. Em, Yes, I don't know what else to tell you and
Above all, about the topic,
What do you want? let's talk about the topic, then,
Or about what? I don't know, whatever you want, however you want.
We can talk about anything. we can talk a bit about the topic, because we didn't talk about the topic. What was it? It was dating.
Something about relationships.
What's that?
I don't know
I forgot.
Me too
Let's talk about something else then
Yes, about what?
I don't know, i don't know, tell me a bit about how the city is
This city is pretty nice
Yes?
I didn't think it was a pretty city. I thought everything but that because I thought it was a city.
Completely deserted. In fact it is, but on the outside
Sure
And in the city, the surroundings are very different.  I missed that a lot about Boston, because in the summer and spring
Yes
It's completely green
None
There is plenty of green with the plants, the trees, the vegetation.
Right
Be here there are plants and everything, but it's not the same
Sure,
It's not the same as there. Nevertheless, there are some buildings, some really beautiful structures.
None
The city is bas
Yes, the only thing I know is by watching NBA and they show the city in general, the sky scrapers and it seems like a really modern city.
It's a really modern city. Pretty modern, yes.
Yes.
It's a pretty modern city.
None
It's a city with very new
Sure.
Last year we came for a visit, because my husband has family here,
None
And there was a lot of land that was vacant and all this, and now everything's going, everything. buildings, there's a lot of these, houses, these, what are they called? Condominiums,  from
Well, a lot of things
Sure.
They're totally building the city.
It's growing a lot. Yes.
Yes. It's growing a lot.
Yes, they're building many cities too, here in the United States. But no, people are coming back more. Before people were going to the suburbs to live.
A lot of young people, professionals, young people, their families with children are going back to live near the city. And also makes them develop a lot
Right? I don't know
None
Here, in Philadelphia also. This started about five or six years ago, more or less. And they started building in an extensive way, all over
Yes
Areas that used to be, a little poor, or were sub-developed, with voids, developed a lot. And, I don't know, now we are moving to Baltimore, andÂº
It's similar, they are building a lot
Yes. Here too, here it is incredible the way they are building. But, it's amazing how people want, I mean, that people like me, I include myself in the group,
I want to move. What am I doing here in this desert.
Yes
This is not the typical desert we are used to. It is a very rocky state.
None
It's pretty rocky, so there are no plants
Sure
There are no plants there, that's why it's a desert.
Yes
There is no way. No, that's why they call it
Lourdes.
Hello, Lourdes. How are you? My name is Eliana.
I, you are from Boston, Right?
Yes
Good. How are you?
Fine. How do you know?
I talked to you a while back.
How do you remember my name? I don't remember. Let's see, tell me where are you from?
We talked about living in the city that you would like to live in
Are you in Los Angeles?
No, I'm in New York
Then.
You, had said that you would like, going to a little island with a cocktail when
I remember.
How have you been?
It was plan -B.
Plan B.
Yes, Look, I didn't know that you could, that, it could be repeated.
The combinations of participants?
Sure.
Yes, because since they aren't, there aren't so many people, I imagine, At the end of the day, it's very logical that it happens to you connect
Sure.
For me, there's a girl in Florida who, we talked like three or four times, and I asked her about home buying because she's a broker.
Really? How nice. Wow! Now, the topic of the day is relationships.
Yes, tell me, are you single or married?
Yes, I'm single, look, I'm thirty, so all these ideas
Good.
In any moment will come up. And you?
No. I have been married for two years and have a nine-month-old baby.
Sure...I remember you baby.
Yes, yes, yes. Well, tell me, How are relationships, then?
None
Have you done online dating before?
No, never. I don't know if I will get motivated to do it.
I have, yes, tell me.
NO, because the topic is the language, it should be in Spanish. To me English is still hard. That's my problem here.
What were you going to tell me?
No, I was going to tell you that one of my, before getting married, one my roommates did online dating
Yes.
She had stories from each, from each person she met.
Yes, no?
Why?
Yes, did any of them end up being normal?
She'd do the screening and keep in touch via email with the other person
She didn't want to get to meet the person quickly, she wanted like to let time pass so he lost his interest and stopped
He stopped talking because what he wanted was
Sex.
To go out everyday, meet lots of people, so if you are throwing the net to them, you get whatever sticks in it, and everything that fell outside the net, you just let it go.
I was told some stories how they did get married and they met via chat but I believe those are not common
Yes, no, I believe that, only few stories end that way.
I believe that too, I'm still single, hello, in all the lines,
I believe there are lines to look for Hispanic partners,
No.
I do
I am going out with a guy from Argentina.
None
I haven't looked for anyone.
Sure, so.
How old are you?
How?
How old are you?
I'll be thirty three year old February twelth.
Right before Valentines?
Let me tell you about this relationships,it's like a trial marriage.
In the end,nothing changes just leave your tooth brush in just one place.
Yes or no?
But, this dynamic, the communication that has to, sometimes, you have to guess what the other person is thinking
Sure, that doesn't change, let's say, for sleeping. It doesn't go through the sheets.
No, it's not through osmosis, no, it doesn't work.
Sure, that's a pity, yes
It doesn't work. That,
My mom just got me now. I'm telling you I'm fine. I'm 30 years old and I have a doctorate. I chose to work, to have a professional life
Sure.
I did have boyfriends and well, that's what happens? Nowadays everything is delayed but my mom has a nervous attack
None.
She gave me a book that says, I want everything and I want it now, the thirties, this decade changes your life, right? It talks about the divorce at thirty because people married too young
The relationships and if you marry during your thirties, and I'm reading it and it's the first time that I read a self-help book.
None
That my mom sent me and I'm reading it now but I think it's funny, what do I know?
During your twenties, everything is experimental. I can take this, taste this, make decisions, change my mind.
When you reach you thirties, you begin to think, wait, for example. I did the same. I finished my doctorate.
I married early, I got divorced, I finished the doctorate, all that, those that, those things that are in the book, all that
Of course.
When you begin in the thirties, wait, I have my career that is important to me, but I want a family too.
And then there, you begin to go out with the goal. The goal is not only to find someone to be with now, but the goal is
Let me think with whom I would like to form a family. Yes is him. Do you understand me? If that is what you want to do.
Of course.
So you get more
Finest.
More, yes. Not more, you donÂ´t accept anything. Do you understand me? you donÂ´t accept foolishness from anyone.
Of course.
Yeah, if you are going to go out with someone, you are not going to go out and loose your time, you are going to go out because, because you are looking for something more comfortable, something that
That makes you feel good, that, that the company is not only a thing that, lasts two or three hours, and then is over.
Of course, yes.
The courtship becomes something different after the thirties.
In,in, the more remote, in the back of the brain.
No, sure
That is always, you, or you are thinking on it. Right?
I want to be with a partner and feel in love.
Of course.
I know that everything gets if you are nervous about it. You become desperate and you won't go anywhere.
Exactly. So...
It's true, lots of times you realize why can't I find it, why can't I find it? And maybe it's because you are, chatting and maybe the guy you are chatting with
It's not the man of your life. You will probably be introduced to him by someone that is in your same circle.
Exactly.
If you go to dance in a place, it's less likely than you will find a husband there.
This thing about chatting
It's just temporary, no? maybe for women as we are always looking for love and we, to me it sounds like a
None
Sure, not at all.
It's just an easier strategy, to get to meet more people without even having to fix your hair or wash your teeth in the morning
Sure.
You also have to think about how technology has changed lots of things in our lives,
Technology is changing the way we fall in love and find our partners.
Yes.
Right?
Yes, that's the change that is happening to us, to our children, and your daughter.
None
She's going to start chatting with boys when she turns ten years old.
Exactly and look, for example
For example, I know that there are some chat groups about music, so, you will also find it there
Sure.
Someone with your own tastes.
Sure, look, if you think about it before...what's the name? The celestina? Matchmakers? The matchmakers?
Yes, yes.
That was the way through which people used to get a couple, no?
Sure.
The social changes, people weren't looking for that type of things,
To go out to look for someone that is kind of similar to us, that was not the way in which things used to be done back then. Back then, they did
It was because of an economic compromise or to strengthen political alliances between families, what do I know! That one had more cows than I and I needed to have more cows.
A bull, maybe.
He had the cows that I needed, I had a bull.
Sure
But even if I now feel like I don't really trust the chats, I say so because my sister is one of the ones that's into them
She's started to meet lots of guys, she's trying to go out and she's using the internet a lot. I tell my son, that's what he's going to get to know, and for him
For him, it's going to be normal, no?
As is.
The way in which things are done.
Yes, that, maybe, due to us being women, we are afraid, no?
Its a safety issue because any psycho can log into a computer and say what he wants.
Sure, of
Hello
Hi
Hi, How are you?
How are you? Fine. My name is Roman, And yours?
How are you Roman? My name is George
What?
From New York b-George

What's up?
Fine, and you?
What do you think about the topic?
From where?
What do you think about the topic? I can't talk too much because my throat hurts. What do you think about the topic?
Well I would say the topic of internet dating
Yes
The truth is that I never had one
No
I think that I have two comments that sometimes they were positive and negative, you never know what you're encountering.
Yes
It can be that you talked with a person and suddenly you find them, it can be your grandmother.
None
I don't know.  Have you had any experience with this?
No, yes, this isn't right, a date with someone who you don't really know, to see it, and nothing happened,
You had an internet date with someone you met on the Internet one time
No, I don't believe many opportunities of meeting on the Internet. I had a contact on the internet but nothing happened.
It's very difficult
Did you meet on a website and if so which one?
No, I don't remember, this was like two three years ago, I don't remember, I don't really remember, someone on there wrote me and made a date but no
None
No, she wasn't my time, so no
Yes
Everything ended
Are you married now?
Yes, like no, I was, yes I was but I yes, Internet really difficult even today people use it for the lack of time, lack of
Sudden opportunity to go to a social event or one of those things to know people, sure
Yes
I think that it's a good way. What do you think?
You told me that you were married, so you're divorced?
Yeah right
You are divorced.
Yes
Did you divorce a long time ago?
Excuse me?
How long have you been divorced?
Last time I was on that process for about
You said, where did you tell me that you are living now, in which city?
Yes, I'm in New York.
Oh in New York, how, how are women there?
There aren't many
Are they easy over there?
Very few, you don't have the opportunity to ... there's plenty of social life I still know very few people, no
Yes
It seems easy, there are lots of clubs, discotheques and all of that
Are there many Latin women over there?
Sure, there are many but I don't really know
That's fine
There are lots of them.  Where do you live?
I'm in Miami
No, it's still better there
In reality here, there are more Latinos than Americans.
Yes, sure yea
It must be more difficult because the topic of cold doesn't leave or not?
The issue is stupid, it's not a question of
Sure, here everything's open all day.
Yes.
Night and day
Yes
It seems like a Latino city
I was in South Beach about three years ago
Yes but there's a lot of ambiance and a lot of ways to meet people, no.
Yes the truth, the social life is closer to the Latino
Yes, I had. I'm Columbian
Yes
I worked in a company that hired some people from Orlando, and there was a woman who said, It's not that Miami isn't in the United States.
She was American, and she said that Miami isn't from the United States, it's another different world
How long have you lived here?
For five years
For five years
Yeah, five years ago, right?
Yes, and you went straight to New York?
Yes, I came here directly. I'm open to go anywhere, but I've spent the last five years here.
Yes, and how do you put up with the cold? Isn't it very cold there?
Yes, I really prefer the cold than the heat
Oh yes, i'm, yes
Yeah, well, no, it's really something, i have a bad flu right now
Yes
And later on you have to go out with a coat
The thing about
But
The soccer thing, you can't play football there.
Come again?
During the winter, they can't play football
No, but there are closed places where people play a little. There a few. You know New York, right?
What?
You have been to New York, right?
Yeah, I've been there twice
Yes, on Manhattan, on the riverside, there are Piers, there are warehouses out in the open, and they play there
None
There they play a little and it's really like two months...no more.
None
I really don't if the people attempt to play Saturdays or Sundays in a park or something.
Yes
Last year I was trying to play after five ears, then I got messed up and broke my tendon and didn't go out
But there are groups I imagine that try to play a little
And I
Is not too cold
I broke my internal ligament
Yes
Yes playing soccer also but yes
None
I've been here seven years of which
Yes
I lived in Tennessee
Yes
Tennessee is totally different to New York and Miami
I imagine calm for one
Yes it's very
Tranquil
Very calm, very Americanized, all of it, it's nothing like our own culture, you are not going to find it there
Yes
Nowhere
Are you married?
No, I'm not, you can't be married in Miami
Single
With all those women in Miami one can't be married.
Then tell me about one experience you've had in your relationships, so as to stick with the subject
To discuss the subject, I'm a person who stayed with a girlfriend for a long time.
Yes
Always with one...or the other...
None
Between break ups, but I try to enjoy as much as possible before I start dating another one
Yes
When , when you are near, when winter is coming, I need to be with someone to be warm, I need someone to burn me up
How do you find girlfriends? At discotheques, parties or on the internet?
My three ex-girlfriends
Yes
They used to be my friends
I see
So I already knew her, I had known her for a while
Yes
And things happened, and then we realized that we belonged to each other.
Yes
And all of my other girlfriends, we dated during six years and I dated with another one for three years
None
And with the third one, eight months.
Are all those women from your own country, or from here? How is it?
Two were from Argentina
Yes,
And the other one was from Peru
Peru, haven't you dated Americans, don't you like American women?
Yes, the Peruvian was American too, we were together for three months while I was living in Tennessee.
Yes
The truth is, I don't know if this also happens to you, but it's different. You reach a point in which
None
It's not that you don't understand it but you get to a point in which you don't get along with that other person, and I'm also
No, yes, that's my opinion too, but you have lots of experience so I'd like to know, what was the difference, which points
Are different. What should I know about it?
Yes, yes. The truth is
Which one?
In reality, when I started dating the American, it was something new for me, she was a pretty girl
Yes
But at some point, you need to use your own language to have a better communication
Yes, I believe that's a huge barrier, it's very, very different to talk in a language that is not your own, to express your feelings, that's true.
Yes
Yes, I believe it's hard, I mean, the relationship cools off pretty quickly
That's right, part of the heath is different
Yes, and
The feelings that you have for the other person
I mean, the way they are
You can tell
The way they dress, is it very different?
Exacty, latinas also take good care of their man, it's completely different than the way American women treat their men
Yes, very different, they all live on their own
And they are very independent, Latinas are different, they rely on their boyfriends or husbands, their partners
Yes
Americans are more independent in that regard
None.
It's like they are more open, open mind, I'd say
None
The Latin woman is dependent, she always asks you what to do, what to cook, everything
Yes
I think that's nice to have something to look for, I like that, because they
Yes
That's why i get more hooked up with latinas than Americans
Yes, and, are they passionate or is it a very cold attraction, how are they?
And
What was the reaction?
You're talking about sex?
Yes, it's important because
No, the sex, i assure you that the Latin woman is hotter than the american, it's not that the american...
No, yeah, that's the concept i have, right?, suddenly the woman is too cold, too practical sometimes
Yes
I think you're very used to the Latin woman, to be indulged, to them being passionate
It is exactly.
To them dressing, get dressed up, them worrying about their things, even the way they cook, all that stuff, isn't it true?
Exactly
None
Sex is more that you find out
Yes, OK
Good evening
Good evening.
My name is Nancy.
Luis, nice to meet you
Nice to meet you, what do you think about today's subject?
Yeah, it's, ok, about meeting someone through internet or
The
Well, not through internet, no. Personals, well, I don't think so, it's never worked for me, and I've never tried it, but
None
No, I don't think that, not for me
It wouldn't work
No, it wouldn't be essential
It is better when you meet the person face to face.
Sure
You can get to know them physically and know what they think and all that.  Through the internet, they can write
Yes
A lot fo things and you wouldn't notice
Sure
Or what kind of face they will have, yes
Yes
I've never participated before
Pardon?
You've never participated in having a relationship by internet or by an ad.
No, nor would I like it because well
Yes
Is the same
Yes, let's say in that.
Pardon?
Have changed a lot, the courtships have changed a lot, before it was very
Yes true
Very different, yes because, from what I understand before they would sit, in the old times somebody would sit in the living room in the middle of the boyfriend and girlfriend.
Yes
Yes now it has changed a lot
Yes, and even the courtships that last less time
Yes that's two months.
Yes
Never know or no
Yes
Or if not goodbye and thanks, yes
None
That's true
Have you met anyone on the internet or, or some personal ad?
No, I haven't been either. No I'm not. I don't have that way of thinking, of meeting someone over the internet. I'm not interested.
Yeah, you prefer to
I'm sharing with the person.
Looking into its eyes, face to face, yes
Yeah, sharing and knowing each other better, having a more.. contact
Of course
More intimate, and that way you don't share that
Of course, what have been your worse dates?, well, if you have had
That way of thinking
That you've had
Suddenly, when you're at school, that was like just to mess, and then you said uh, no, i don't like that boy anymore
None
Yeah, i remember once that, insisting, insisting and since that day i will never date anyone anymore like that
That, i know that like in my country, that's called meloso, when they take your hand, kiss you, right?
And lets say, you're not on the mood
And
At that time you're not just looking
Pardon and where are you from?
I'm from Colombia and You?
Colombia, Mexico
Yes Mexico.
Yes
Of the tone of your voice
Yes.
Yes, Imagined it, yes and have you had long relationships or what
The truth no, and I don't like it
None
I think it doesn't work because, well I've always focused more on my studies, right now I'm in the university.
Yes
That's my priority right now
What are you studying?
I study economics.
Very good
Yes
Now you should give priority to your studies and later,
Yes, I already studied the rest, no and at work, entertainment, etc.
Yes that, there's time for everything, I mean there will be time for everything.
Yes
In reality no, Because that right now, they aren't really for me, I don't share the idea that, they receive
Their boyfriends in their houses for as long as they want alone and in the room, I don't share this idea. Because now they say
They say that is modernity, so no.
Not including the thirteen or fourteen years old adolescents.
None
None
Yes
It is not much different than previous times.
Yes you can't at least, since they're a little bit mature. Not today. They're, they're kids.
Yes, they don't think about the consequences
No, They don't think about anything, they live the situation. But they don't think of what can come out of it.
Yes
They get unwanted pregnancies and this
Yes
Due to this for me, what they said is that kids who are thirteen, twelve, sexual relations and
Yes
Their relationship was the best.
Yes, right now, yeah.
No yes
Before no, one would remain, the women
None
Will remain a virgin until marriage, right
Now is very hard
And now
Totally hard already
Yes
That's practically impossible.
Yes
For the liberation that we have in this time that they are not going to let like their partners or something
They have several boyfriends and have their sexual relations and all that doesn't interest them anymore
Yes, okay
Before
Do you currently have a boyfriend?
I'm married and have a baby
Okay
Right now i'm enjoying that baby.
How nice.
Yes because he's six months old.
Six months
Yes,
Barely knowing each other.
None
Pardon, and where are you from? Where in the United States do you live?
New York
New York

In Houston
I have a friend there in Houston.
Yes
He works in the cancer hospital
In the

In the MD Anderson or in which one?
Yes of Anderson. He works there he's also from Colombia.
Yes
Then,
Yes, and what do you do?
I work in Real Estate
Okay
Not rented, but they own the building here in New York And they rent them. They're the owners of the buildings, not like the Real Estate that
No agents for renting.
None
They are the owners directly of the building, so I work with them
None
I've been with them four years now and yes it's like one gets on the rails with the story. And this is even nice that of real estate.
I can imagine
Now I work, two or three days. the rest I'm with my baby.
None
So that I don't leave him alone such a long time on his own
Yes it's flexible. No, the schedule.
Yes let's say they are very very accessible to that, they know how the situation is that you can't really leave a little baby with anybody
Yes
You can see how they mistreat them, one says no yes
Yes for working, a lot, no
And suddenly when I realize it's that now I have his girlfriend here and you have to careful dating too soon
None
No
Yeah
No, that I don't share the the dating nowadays. There is I don't know now with time now when
What was the other question there? I didn't hear anything.
Yes
What was the other question?  I didn't get to hear it.
About the courtships on the Internet, of the ads, and what has been your first dates.  That's what I managed to hear.
None
There were four topics but, I didn't get to hear the other one
Yes, me neither.
I was blocking the phone.
Yes
I honestly don't know.
What do you think of the dates?
In Mexico...what?
Of the dates that you want to meet a girl,
None
I see it as a date unless the person is not interested in me.
To impress the other person.
Yes
But in that sense
Yes, no, that like, one has a very different way of thinking, like more mature, I think
Yes
So then no is like One is like more old fashioned a little. not so so much
No, sometimes I do think that techniques that were used before work.
Before, yes
You want to be more original, no, I say
Yes because all of a sudden, before anything the respect, if one already exist, first the friendship, the courtship a respect then like, like is a nice relationship.
Yes
That's the way of thinking, Yes.
Sure
Let's say that like that way of thinking was how I was raised, then, also. come here
Yes
Yes no Also not that in the dates no But yes, is different, having them respect you, one has to value oneself also as a person.
Yes
Then that's important too.
That is
None
Yes, your parents.
Imagine that in the university
I can hardly hear you well, like it's getting
The signal is going.

For example, this.
None
Do I turn off the light from here?  Through internet.  Yes, no, the truth is that they don't work.
Don't work in what sense?
I don't know, since you don't know the person.
There are people that, who meet, get married, everything via the internet.
And yes, there are so many things that when they're there everything can happen, anything can happen. But, what do I know
And so
I prefer to meet the person before. In any way. I don't know, able to happen to me in the future.
How did you meet your boyfriend?
I met my boyfriend at the university.
At the university.
At the university.

He wanted to get a kiss from me at any cost.
You were a stupid person who loosened

You? How was it?
None
Yours. How was it?
And mine was a lot of suffering
For?
Yes, I suffered a lot
Why?
My love wasn't reciprocated.
Really?
It wasn't reciprocated, it wasn't reciprocated at all.
I think. Let's see. Tell me.
And it wasn't reciprocated, that's why it cost me so much, I had to fight it. I had to row a lot against the current.
None
Do you understand what I am trying to tell you?
Yes? It was very like that?
Yes. She didn't give. I'm going to mess up nothing.
They haven't told me the same thing.
What no?
I went out with Sole.
I keep lying.
I talked to Sole today
With Sole, and what does Sole know?
Sole told me what she knew
No, Sole didn't tell you because she doesn't know anything.
No.
It was hard for me, really hard for me, and well
And well
Do you regret those things?
No, because, sure
All for nothing, all that, for nothing
All for nothing, I died
How
You die
No, you die that
Sure
Yes, but, you have to see, that one thing does not remove another one
Yes, with one, it might be good
What?
Does not matter, other thing
Well
We have talked a lot about love. What do I say?
We need to talk about love.
You have to take care of it
You have to put bronze parts everywhere; the ones that are bronze.
Of brass
To oil it, sure, Everything, you must put everything original. Sure, what did you do you change one part that is brass and you put something that's cast iron, it doesn't go
Yeah.
Cast iron breaks sooner
Sure.
Do you understand what I want to say?
Sure.
And well.
What else can we say?
This like we are, that's how were.
That's how we are.
No, there are people that are more and more crazy then it ends up that one thing and another thing and and it doesn't give, doesn't give, doesn't give, doesn't give.

Yes.

That's great.
Great, really excellent.
Great.
And nothing, what else? I'm working hard. Eight hours, every day.
Hard and even.
Eight hours
Eight hours a day, they're making you work?
This is hard.
Little.
And
You're lucky
Lucky, yes.
You're lucky, you're working fairly little.
Liar.
Eight hours a no this is nothing.
No, you're not used to it, it's another thing.
It's not
Do they pay you for working more or for working eight hours?
They pay me almost nothing
Why do I ask? What's the point? Why do you work so hard, silly? Leave at five and stop whining.
What's?
Stop busting your ass before five; if they're gonna pay the same, they don't pay you more or less
What do i know
We have to buy things.
What?
You didn't buy it
What did you say?
You didn't buy the spice
We have to buy the spice
None
There's a reason we buy them... stop
Come up right now and that's it
Son of a bitch, damn
No, but, why would i take off my hood? Hold on
What?
I'm gonna take off my hood, wiat
I'm taking a crap, Toly, I'm leaving it, wait
Hello.
I took everything apart.
Fool! What did you do?!
I don't know, that
What's Ian's last name?
What else do you think of love?
None
Of love in the times of cholera?
Times of cholera, I don't know.
Did you read that book?
No.
Toly, what is the last book that you read?
The last book that I read, I think, was the one of Coso
The one of Omar?
The one of Nietzsche
What?
The one of Nietzsche.
Of Nietzsche
Nietzsche
That's very complicated
Yes.
Your head spins, your wig spins.
What was it called?
The anti-Christ?
The same.
The same?
Yes. But I read part of a book, I don't have this I read, this, I read this One and the Universe too and
The anti-Christ is very complicated to
I read the other, the one in English
You're readying the other book?
Now I started with
That's good.
No, I had to read it again because I realized that.
Which?
I'm not really, I read it twice.
You had
They talked about botanical and biological things and the first time I didn't understand that.
None
After I read it again
That's good.
No
And What else?
Why am I joking?
Ah, what was I going to tell you? How nice, no? How interesting.
How interesting? To talk like this?
Talk like this about things, talk a bit deep, right? of
The topic of love.
The love of a couple, right?
The first couple and
Why, what do you think of love outside a couple?
Is super fun, the couple
What?
Is fun.
I'm not talking of nerpo this is something of love.
Of what?
None
What is nerpo?
Yes, I'm talking of love.
None
None
What's the love for couple? The love
None
Yes, is super fun.
Idyllic.
Yes, love is very fun also Because
It will be like that Toly.
Tell me, because I've seen you have a lot of experience.
What?
You tell me something since you have so many experiences.
I don't have many experiences.
You were saying how many crazy things you had done in your life.
I'm a man of little experience a man who has been, beaten
Oh, sure
Beaten by life, beaten by everything, right? By the women, by rock and roll, by soccer, by everything, again everything fell to crap. Damn it.
What are you doing?
I can't talk on the phone and try to arrange those boxes.
Finish.
Is exasperating. As I was saying, I'm a very beaten guy
Tell me, you didn't say anything, why don't you tell me?
Life has treated me very badly.
Tell me one of your experiences
Excuse me?
Tell me one of your experiences
What
I don't know, teenager, 16 years old
Excuse me?
Some experience when you were 16 years old
When I was 18?
Yes
Which experience, and yes, it would be annoying that
Yes, it's annoying, so what?
Yes, Were kids
18?
Excuse me?
18?
At age 18, even worse
What was it?
None
When was your first time?
At age 25
Go on, man
Seriously
What a jerk
At twenty-five
Go on, tell me when, don't be silly
I don't know, I don't remember
Well, more or less
I don't have good memory
Go on you fool. Why don't you tell me?
What would it be? Eighteen
You were old already
None
You were old
Seventeen. No, I don't know. Fifth course. Sixteen, seventeen
Alright
No, fifth.  No, fourth.  I don't remember
And with whom?
I don't know, I don't remember
A club girl? A club girl?
None.
Yes or no?
Yes, but I think that, I don't know, that
Where?
Yes, fourth year. I don't remember
Carlos from New York, Carlos from New York
Carlos, hi I'm Pilar
Good and you?
I'm Pilar, how are you? is not Carlos I thought I knew you but no
Oh no, where are you speaking from?
From New York also
From New York? oh how nice
Yes but you are Spanish or no
No I'm
Man forgive me is that
None
I know your friend Carlos who is from NewYork.
Yes.
What?
Then what are we going to talk about, the equality
Yes, what do you think of this topic
Hello, tell me
What do you think of the topic of equality?
Equality there's no equality right?
Yes of how can the inequality that's in the United States be solved or
None
None
None
You have to talk or else they won't count the call
Sorry, I don't understand?
You have to talk
No
...or the call won't count.
Yes what's happened is that my friend passed me the phone because she's pretty shy, pretty stupid
None
I'll talk better because I made the other calls, I already have around seven calls
None
Out of twenty five, right?
They're twenty five
Are you Spanish?
Yes
Or French?
No, Spanish
I was in Spain, I know Madrid
Yes, I'm from Madrid
I used to go a lot to there near Spain Square near the Collao Station and near all those places
Did you like it?
Yes I liked it. I have many photos in those very big castles that were there
Castles in Madrid
Yes ther are some castles, like museums
None.
Those palaces, the exactly many garden, some big gardens and the palaces and all that
Yes
Yes, I liked it and I was there in summer, very nice.
It was sure hot there one
I used to live in hostels, I did not like it because the rent was high.
Yes it's very expensive; it's as expensive as New York
Yes, I like New York more
I like them both
Have you been a long time here in New York?
A year and a bit
Oh, and are you used to it?
Yes more or less it's that I live at the University
You are
And here at university yes I've gotten used to it, I don't know much else but well
You're an intern at the university?
No, I live in an apartment but I have a lot of work that I don't have a lot of time to go and see the city
No, I know the plan like a tourist, I've been
Sure yes
To the tourist sites to visit, but I don't go a lot
After you are there a year then you'll go back to Spain again?
No, I'll still stay longer
Well you're studying there
Yes, I'll stay a few more years and then go back to Spain.
Because you have a student visa?
Yes
That's why when someone's calling, I'm here but I could pass the telephone to my friend. She's guieya. She's guey.
Since she gets pretty shy when she speaks with women because she only speaks with men, she's a little shy so I listened to what she said
That whenever she wants with someone, I said, I bet you're talking with a woman, because I'm talking with a woman, and she's talking with a man, so she's happy
The topic of today is equality, right?
Yes we haven't talked about the topic
You know even if you don't talk about the topic they don't say that it doesn't matter, what's important is that they want to hear you talk a little for twelve minutes
Yes
The topic of today is equality so yes it's like if there's equality between the man and the woman
He no, in total, in general equality between rich and poor, equality between men and women, equality between
Between all
The races all the equalities
Sure I don't think there's equality here
No, there's none.
Nowhere, there never will be that's what we all would want for there to be equality of rights, equality of opportunities, equality of everything but that's not like that
No but you believe is possible for there to be a way to have equality
I would like for there to be some equality but like I tell you it's almost impossible I mean I don't think
I think it's in the human core to be unfair with others, and
Yes
I mean if you meet two people and you like one and the other you don't
None
Already you are not going to treat them the same, it's normal right?
Sure that's why I tell you I mean that as much as we want for there to be one hundred percent equality that is equitable, there won't be
That's like in the way I believe of the people of the humans, we are like this there's no equality that's why I don't believe in that of equality
And I say that there should be for example I find it unfair for example in my country, I'm from Chile
Yes
When they would put a job in the newspaper it would say lady cashier needed up to twenty five years old
Yes
Security guard up to 35 years old; in other words they already limiting people that are older than that and cannot give them the job.
Yes, and that's allowed because there's work discrimination that's prohibited, but
But they do.
In general, almost everything is permitted.
Exactly, i mean, there are lots of thing that shouldn't be done but they're done, and even if we try to change the world and make things change
Everything is going to be a never-ending story and it is always going to be the same.
Do you think there is more inequity than in the United States, for example in Chile and other places?
For example us, look, me and my friend, we're guey, right?
None
And there in Chile, we're like more limited, i mean, if you're guey, uh, you have less chances of being taken seriously, they make fun of you, they do heavy pranks to you
Yeah
I love this country, I feel really free here.
This country, because you're in New York
That's why
There are also other parts of this country where i think you'd be probably worse than in Chile
Yeah, that's why I'm telling you, I choose a good state to live in and now I've been here for almost two years like you
Yes
I'm not going back to Chile
None
I'm staying here to live because i like the way of life, because here we have the same rights as anybody
Yes
Even though now
There are also rights here, but are there gay marriages here in New York or not?
No, not here, in other states, Massachusetts, Washington, right?
So, of all the rights, that's still missing, right?
Yeah, no, it's true, but i don't agree with that too because if i got together with someone i wouldn't like to marry either, have children and all that, right?, i think it's going too far
Right?
Yeah, the truth is that I don't know what to think about that because my marriage is something so
Important, so serious
Right, but i mean that it's something so risky like the tradition of men and woman get married andÂ that's it
That, simply, to me a marriage between two man, two women, it just doesn't add up, right?, i mean, that
Sure, i mean, me too, i think so too, regarding that if i like another man, i can live with him, share
Have a relationship and everything you want, but from that to marrying like what Elton John is doing, spending i don't know how many millions with his boyfriend
That they're going to... one of the largest weddings of this time, one of the largest and most mentioned, because it's the first wedding
With such prestige because they have a lot of money and they're important.
Yes
But that happens at all levels
Yes.
I'm not a fan of marrying or adopting children because imagine the babies will grow and they won't know who's the dad and who's the mom
No, but the, what's true, and i think the United States does have a partnership, or it's called
None
That's, if you, that what's unfair about two people of the same sex not being able to get married, is that for example, if you live your whole life together
One of they die the person's goods go to the family of
Yes !
The one who died instead of the other when the marriage, if the husband dies, he gives money to the wife or the opposite, no?
Sure this what they're fighting about, they want justice that if they're two couples, to men have been like you say, all their life together, and one dies
It's right that the material things should go to the one he spent his whole life with
Sure this the only thing that yes, I see that
Yes
I think it's good what seems stranger to me is what you say, the ceremonies and all this seem to me
This is what chocks me, it's not that I'm an animal, it's simply that I haven't been educated like this
Yes and no
It seems pretty strange to me
Me too, imagine I'm with my family,  and I'm not used to is because I find it strange I'm put there, but this, no, no.
I'm not a supporter of this because I think that they don't have a reason to get married
Yes
Why get married with this marriage, it makes me laugh, it seems pretty ridiculous to me because you don't know which one will wear the white dress, the other in a suit
Yes if they're two men or two women
No, the two men dressed as men I say
The two
Yeah so the that one of the men dresses like a woman yeah
This is more as a joke.
It is getting worse
Yes, it makes me laugh but as I said, I find it that it's not necessary to get married, to have a wedding so that two people that love each other, two men or two women that want to be together
They can do it.
Sure
They don't have to show it off in from of everyone else and have the weddings.
None
That's why I'm telling you that I find it that there's no equality
No
There's no equality I find it unfair that women too, when some women can't when they are getting to good positions or when they are climbing up the social ladder
They just reach a certain topic and they don't let them climb up more as women can't get to those places
Yes, that's true.
I don't agree with that. For example, in my country one woman is trying to be president. Mrs. Michelle Bayalet in Chile is going to be the first woman to be president
And is she going to get picked, is she going to win?
She wants to on behalf of all feminist women, she's in favor of women showing men that they too can be
I think that's all right. That it would be something good for our country to pick a woman for four years.
In Germany they already have a woman that won the last election
None
The first President woman in Germany, she's going to be Chancellor of Germany the first one in Germany history.
Isn't she the iron woman?
No. That was in England.
Right? that was how she called
Yes, Marc Anthony.
That was Margaret Tatcher.
And this one is, Angela Merquer is her name.
In Germany.
But it has nothing to do with Margaret Thatcher people thought it was not going to work because is a little bit weird woman
And of course,
They donÂ´t have the. Margaret Thatcher was a very strong woman, very strong right?
Yes, it looks like that to me.
You saw her with the power but this one is like she was a physics teacher in the university and she looks a little bit shy it is so curious it has happened
I say to you that I would truly like a woman from my country. There is Mitchell Bresalet that was a defense minister.
None
I would like her as a minister, and very important everybody loves her because we have always have left side presidents, and the ones from the left side the same as always steal money and promise a lot
In the moment they do the things they do not do it right and then sometimes is always good a change and to try another alternatives
Yes I think the best are the real changes
Yes then we had our left side president and now we would like a president from the national right side and another right side party
Yes, because when the party changes there is always so much enthusiasm. Well, not always, but
Exactly. That is good.
They are so enthusiastic that they do well at first.  They legislate good things; then things begin to turn bad and then it is time to change.
Hello, good evening
Hello! Good evening.
How are you? Whom am I speaking with?
What? Pardon.
Whom am I speaking with?
Maria.
How are you, Maria? You are speaking with George here in New York.
Yes, sir. how are you?
Fine thanks, and how is it going? Where are you?
Me? In Ohio.
In Ohio? How nice. What do you think of today's topic?
There's a lot of inequality here
Yes.
They are topics as if there is racial inequality.
Yes.
None
None
Economic inequality.
Yes.
Maybe in our countries you don't see that or you see it a lot,
Yes, sure.
The tries to have more.
Yes, I think that all the countries more rooted in inequalities are more rooted in inequalities.
Yes.
From here.
Yes, in our countries, yes.
Yes, but it's too much, the situation here is that everybody is equal and no, no there are inequalities like in all places, right?
Yes.
Not everybody has a right to all the resources or has access to all the resources, and do you think there's some solution or what would be the solution?
Well it's hard changing this because let's say that
Already too much.
That has to be made equal. Africa is different, there's a lot of poverty
None
There never will be any equality, because there's a lot of hunger also, so the ones that get it is for that.
None
None
And I don't know what magical solution
Yes, is hard, for that.
What magical solution, well I think that something can be done right? like in fact start by making the opportunity in education equal, by making the opportunity in,
The health means
None
I don't know those type of things, no we have to start doing something, right? It could be one, no.
Yes, at least in I'm from Mexico
Yes.
Let's say crossing here is hard.
None
They always look at you as if you were different.
Yes.
There are people that are fleeing.
None
I wish it was but
Yes.
Suddenly they just come to work and work
Yes. The border situation that's a different topic, right?
None
It has the inequality, that on top of it the opportunity to work is here, right?
Yes.
And
One does a lot to work and
Yes.
You forget the other
None
The other factors, studying, and learning other things, the language
Aha.Yes. We can insist that it's also the fault of someone who's a part of the inequality. No, he doesn't look, doesn't try to overcome it, suddenly, no?
Yes, it's the problem.
The thing is that what they give you are the ways, and another things is that you contribute to overcoming these inequalities, right?
Yes.
Yes, there are people
Yes, because let's say they're presented with an opportunity but they suddenly reject it.
None
None
They have to go somewhere else to look for opportunities.
If it's difficult, well they have to look for it somewhere else
None
Or, with a sacrifice
Yes, it's like this.
Try to overcome the inequalities. Say to a friend yes, definitely.
You see
The directors of the
Would lower
Of the country, of the world we
I would first help poor people a lot, Imagine to be able so that there is some equality and but it will be very difficult
Rich people won't want to give something to the poor
None
It presents
Oh, God.
Obstacles because we are in you saw too, people from Nicaragua
Yes.
And they don't have the means to get over
None.
So it's difficult for them too.
In what part of Ohio are you?
In Cleveland
In Cleveland?  How far is that from Columbus?  Three hours or more?
None
Yes?
Two hours. it's good to live in
How the environment there? yes?
To live well
There's a big difference
Well the hard thing is because doesn't have transportation.
Yes.
Because not,
You have to get around in car, yes.
A lot of transportation, hum
There's a lot of disparity in the city, as far as the neighborhoods.
You don't see that much
I don't know
There is more equality
Yes, because there are cities where there's a tremendous amount of poverty in some sectors, right?
Yes.
Yes, but you tell me that
None
That over there does not come up.
But not here because let's say one has the necessary and you can get it and the people don't look like over
Yes
That factor didn't doesn't
Yes, there are cities where maybe you don't see the disparities so well?
None
Well each person goes, does what they can, works. They each have their house, car but they get what they can. That's the problem, it's in almost all of Latin America, right?
Yes, that is the problem.
Where we have different treatments
Yes.
All different qualities. Everything is different. Here the majority go to public school and whoever wants goes to private school, right?
Yes because the countries. One has to pay the school
None
Universities
Yes, is very costly and very
One doesn't have for
None
None
Yes, Seriously. The majority of the people from the university and all that
But they maybe don't think in the future.
None
A lot of people like spend more than what, what they make
None
So then they don't plan that, they have a lot of problems like that
Yes.
There one has to go out oneself
None
Bettering oneself
Yes,  how long have you been here, in this country?
Of Eight years.
Three year?
Yes
Married with kids?
Yes, sir.
Yes?
Yes.
Your kids got into the city here or?
Yes, there's two.
Yes?
Yes, they've gone.
And how do they go?
What?
How do they go?
Fine, they have gone to Mexico but they don't like it.
No? They already feel
No, they say they are Americans.
Brothers of age?
Yes.
How do they get along?
Good, they get along no. But like they always that they are Americans.
Yes.
We've tried to instill in them that they are all the same.
Then you have the voice of instilling equality
Mm? Yes, because few end up instilling that no that is not the same they are
Sure
They are siblings and there's no reason to have differences in that sense.
Yes. Every morning.
Yes
If you don't have
Yes, because doesn't know it.
It is a very good job
Yes, they've gone and no, they don't like Mexico because
So that
That there's too much they say that too much filth, too much pollution
Yes
And the transportation
No.  Sure, because I can imagine
So
Yes, and, in the sense of that
They are sued to the routine, so, no
But
They didn't like it
You know that it's important to get them insisted to recognize
Yes.
Really?
It's celebrated the day of Kings, and the next day is for giving and gifts
Yes, so
Then, the problem is that you have to give the 25 and the 6
And the 6
Instead, other kids, not, because they are used that in King's day they are used to not
Yes, they get used.
None
You have an opportunity there to comment
None
The equality to know, right?, and other people in some conditions, right?
Yes
Not so good, because they might, not, and what happens if you have the opportunity of also, going out an comment, right?
Yes.
This happens with a lot of people from here. So they don't know the inequalities as much as we do, when you come from outside. When people from here go somewhere, they realize that there are really people who
Really precarious?
There are many poor people
Yes
And in Mexico there are many poor people.
Yes.
In the United States there are too, that that you don't notice much
Yes, you don't notice anything.
They are there.
You don't notice the inequality as much as you notice in other countries but it's there
Yes because, Yes, because many kids start, the kids are dirty
None
No, yes, they explain it as an economic condition
They have to explain it.
No
Yes, this is important.
Yes, but they told me that the fact that they were poor didn't mean that they had to be dirty. And, in this well, they were totally right.
Yes, this true. Yes, this true, like they tell you when you're
None
Small, you can be poor but clean and proud.
Yes, another because it's like that. They are poor but why don't they clean themselves?
None
One wonders
None
That suddenly no has gone
None
They sell those
Yes, they haven't had education, they don't have a habit
Yes.
Of doing these type of things.
Yes.
Your other kids
That's why I said, there's no equality
Yes.
We don't have much but we are clean and okay. suddenly like they start talking a lot in English and then
None
They look at them weird there also.
Really? Exactly.
So they don't like it either, yes.
Neither the issue, right?
I thought that they were out of school.
No, don't they?, No, but, if you have to go to them, si
No, suddenly
To really know their origins?
None
To be conscious and help in the future of someone else, right?
Yes, because if they say that they save, that save to
And, then
To when they are able
None
To buy something there, it's
None
To have in case of going, but not to get there
Ah, well, yes good
Yes, so they
How is school for your other children?
At first it was hard
A lot
They arrived with 7 and 10 years
Sure
Then, it was hard
Yes.
They fully got into it.
None
They felt strange.
Of course.
They said that it was hard and that
But
That they weren't going to be able to learn
None
No they are already fine.
They overcame all of that.
Yes, now that. Find the money too.
Good.
To study to continue their studies.
They are already big to continue
Yes.
Good.
Then  we go to continue to work.
This is good.  I feel that it's giving, to overcome the inequalities.
Yes, this is true.
Yes, because I think it also has to do with
Hello? Yes.
Hello? Yes. How are you? My no
This George calling from Los Angeles and where are you from?
Hello, my name is Adrian.  I live in Toronto, Canada.
Are you from Argentina?
Exactly.
It seems to me that some time ago, I believe, we spoke.
Yes, that could be.
Adrian, how are you? All is well?
It's not very cold.
How is everything going there. Is it very cold there?
No, to the contrary.  At this moment it's raining, it should be more than 5 degrees Celsius. It's about 15 degrees Celsius more than it should be, but
Or, basically that is, what temperature is it? Put me, it would be more or less?
It's not five. It's  more than five, positively.
Wow, that's pretty low, my goodness, my goodness.
No, but at the moment it should be ten below
Yeah. Really?
Yes.
Listen. Where are you from in Bueno Aires, from Argentina, Adrian
I was born in Villa Devoto
Villa Devoto, yes, I already remember. I'm from Lanus
In
Valentin Alsina
From the west, no, not me, I'm from the south
The Luz west, yes, Valentin Alsina Very good
I remember a sister of my grandmother lived in Valentin Alsina, yes I have an image like that, of my childhood of.
Of the ditch and the
You made me remember those famous ditches from when I was little.
The ditch like deep
The water is letting off a foul stench.
Yes.
I remember when
What I, what I remember is that you had to jump it, that it was, it was like the curb
Yes, it was disgusting
From Buenos Aires
I remember the house on the street where I lived for a long when I was very little. I was probably four or five years old.
My grandparents lived there, the house was of, no the street was dirt
None
Disgusting, those ditches,  Adrian
The dirt, the
We have to talk.
The street the, it was dirt but the pasture, there where the ditch was and where the land of the house was dirt
Yes.
But I don't know why it wasn't in the street, but
Yes, it was a, it was, Aye, aye, aye the worst was the rotten smell that came out of these ditches
The mosquitoes in the summer, also.
Today, Adrian, for them to credit our conversation we have to talk about equality, a really philosophical topic.
No, I don't know if it's being, I don't know how it is, I don't live in the United States
None
I don't know
You don't live in the United States
Yes, no, it's Canada, I live in Toronto, Canada
No, I understand that you live in Toronto. I know that you're in Toronto.
None
Canada is another country even though many Americans don't want to think of it as more than a state, it's another country, with another flag and
None
Another anthem and another culture and another
Exactly. how many years have you lived in Toronto?
I've lived here for four years
Oh, that's little Good.
A little bit, relatively little.
With-
Yes, but the topic of equality and a couple of things here that, that in that, that demand my attention
For example, the federal ministry of health
Yes
It's one, I don't recall the name, but it's a person of Hindu background
None
He speaks with an accent. Not a strong accent. He has probably lived in Canada over 20years.
Just imagine!
I know he's a doctor, but I don't know, it seems really satisfying that a person with an accent can be in charge of such an important federal government
No, just imagine, Adrian that only after some 20 years of living in a place, basically
No, 20, 25, the difference isn't that. To me the important thing is a person who was not born here,
Exactly.
And didn't go to school, didn't go to primary school here because he wouldn't have this accent otherwise.
And that
You understand what I'm saying, right?
Yes, I understand you. This really signifies great equality. That apparently, according to what I read, to what I see on television or hear.
You are saying, this type of equality is something that happens much more in Canadian society than in American society
Yes, do you understand what I am saying?
I would not imagine
I like it.
I know that there's a Latin group with Bush but it's an exception, right? it's very, some of Bush's advisers have last names
They must be Mexicans or but, no, no, I can't imagine, Bush's side, in a speech, someone talking with an accent
Or at least with a non-Texan accent
You are so right,
Or a different skin color, that too, the
Exactly, exactly!
There's the one thing that I value most in Canadian people is
Oh, that they suck it up - they respect all the people, but there's a bad side to that too because you have to accept things that you don't really like
The talk that I often have with my wife, so well you can be open minded but you have to suck it up if something else comes up.
Exactly.
So, you can't later say, I'm open minded but not so much, I am not for this, I don't like this or that, the
Exactly. Exactly.
One of the typical stories about that took place in the eighties when one person that wasn't born here, he was of Sikh descent
The one's that use turbans.
His family was from where?
Sikh, Hindu, the ones that use turbans
Oh yes.
He came here pretty young and his dream as a kid was he wanted to become a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer.
Oh, yes.
The ones that have the red uniform, and the little hat
Yes, yes.
Brown like Yogi bear and
Yes.
He his dream all his life was being a -R-C-M-P after he registered in school, he and, took the exams and passed and started to study
The moment of the graduation came, the problem was that he couldn't use the hat because he couldn't take off the turban
Oh my goodness.
Well and, what do you do there? and I know that here it was the .... not too long ago I saw a documentary on TV on that and
I know that the discussion was important. Up to what point is it good to bend the tradition to accept someone who is different.
In the end, they did it, they changed, they made an exception with the uniform and when he was dressed in gala, he uses, the Sikh turban
Color, the same color as the hat of the -R-C-M-P
Okay
Something like that I don't imagine, in a marine of, in
No,
I don't imagine the U.S. Marines
Unfortunately no, many people tell me that Canada is a great country
In many things really is a great country in the equality, in as you say in the open mind
In the possibility, in the in the multiculturalism and apparently, in the freedom of expression they apparently have many positive things that here in this country, in the United States
I still haven't had the opportunity to visit Canada because it would cost a lot.
Is in my immediate plans
Now that the Canadian dollar is high, it will not be as cheap as before. But this place isn't perfect either
I met two or three people that came from the United States to here and because they had bad experiences,
Two of them were Chinese or, or of Asian background and one of them was muslim, i don't remember, pakistani or
Yes
I don't know where he is from. The number one reason why they left is because they could not stand
I'm not sure if estimation is the proper term. I don't know if estimation is a strong word, the
I don't know, the problem here is that you're never going to become a millionaire because taxes are too high, you're going to die of cold
They're very high, right?
Yes, you're going to freeze the whole year and
That's true, except if you go to British Columbia, it has more weather
Vancouver
Peaceful that resembers the one from Los Angeles.
It's like Seattle. It's not the problem. The only problem of Vancouver is, it's a beautiful city, gorgeous, but it rains for three hundred days, like in Seattle
None
Oh, it's a
Yeah, always something
It's very similar to Seattle
Hello, my name is Yolanda.
Hello, Yolanda.  My name is Joe.  How are you?
I'm fine. Where are you calling from?
I'm from Puerto Rico, but I'm calling from Denver, Colorado. What about you?
I'm from Texas and I'm calling from that same place, Texas.
How are things over there?
Pretty we had a nice day and everything is fine, and you?
Well, it was good too, the weather. It's nice here in the city, here in the mountains well it's pretty dry near the mountains and there are many fires.
Oh, yes. Does it snow over there?
I don't know, yes, lots of snow.
No, not today, I think I heard we had around seventy five degrees.
Over there?
Oh yes
Oh, that's nice.
Yes, wonderful, we had a nice afternoon, yes.
Where in Texas do you live?
I live in the Dallas Fort Worth area.
Dallas Fortworth
Yes, but I'm in Dallas right now, this is my last call to complete the twenty five, thank you
Yeah, congratulations, that's great, really great.
It's been a very interesting study talking to people from all around the world
Oh yes?
I admire there's so many people from different countries, and they're good, and they're making a better life for themselves, and i know that it's hard to be away from
Their countries and relatives
That's in the United States, right?
I'm from here
And you were born there, I mean, here
Yes, this is my country. And where were you born in Puerto Rico?
I was born in Puerto Rico but I have been living here for twenty six years
Almost
My daughter, she's native from Colorado
Right
The loves to have the, that inheritance, but she's also half mexican, son
Yes, right
Yes, her mom is from Oaxaca, Mexico
Ok, Oaxaca, yes
And she's super funny because when she's with one or the other
Right
Her accent changes
Yes
When she's with her mom she speaks with a Mexican accent. When she speaks with
None
The woman with the Puerto Rican accent was with me
How interesting.
She's very adaptable, she's a lovely girl, I love her a lot.
Aha. And how old did you say she was?
My daughter?
None
She's going to be six next month.
Yes, what
She's in kindergarten, she's reading.
Oh my goodness, yes.
She sings and I'm teaching her piano.
None
She likes sports. She's a very active girl, and has a very beautiful heart.
How nice. how nice. And just
And you, Yolanda, do you have kids?
Yes, I have two kids. My kids
How nice.
Are already, they are males, twenty five and twenty three.
Yes, you know that your voice sounds like, almost a girl.
Thanks.
How nice, what a blessing.
Yes, they are fine. The youngest is married and living in Nebraska.
Yes, Nebraska
The oldest one lives with us. Right now he decided to go back to school.
Hopefully he'll finish. Right? How nice.
Yes that's what we are working on,  you already see, when one has kids, there's always something to do
Sure, sure.
Yes, and you've always live in the Colorado area?
I breifly went to New York, but from there I quickly moved to Denver.
None
And I have always liked it here.  I like it a lot because
Yes, is very pretty.
One can enjoy a lot, like the four seasons here in Colorado. The mountains are very beautiful, if one wants to go camping,
Yes
Fabulous places, and there are a lot of historic places to see also, here.
Yes, a lot of history.
Yes, Have you come to Colorado?
I've passed by there several times, and I've gone there to, ah, Beaver Creek.
How nice, yes.
Yes, I saw, very nice
Have you gone skiing over there?
I just went to see, because, I don't put on the skis
Yes, Beaver Creek is beautiful, yes.
Very beauty
If you go more to the center of Colorado, you would see places that seem like paradise.
Aha.
The beauty is incredible. I got my last vacation. I spent it in Colorado, two weeks exploring the state
None
I had a fabulous time. Some of my friends came.
None
We went to the mountains and some of the passes were intimidating at a certain height.
Yes.
In the ten thousand, twelve thousand, and fourteen thousand feet, this one looks like that
Yes.
By the ravine you lose your site looking
Yes.
It is very intimidating. I always get a little bit of anxiety when I'm so high up like that. But, it is something good.
Yes, is something awesome?
Awesome, yes
Of the greatness of the mountains, yes
That's true
And we went rafting too, on the river. Which river did we go to? The Colorado River I think
Yes, that's one.
And we were rafting and that was an experience too
What level did you choose? You don't remember?
Yes, oh, no. I don't remem-
There are some that are, the truth is that they scare you to the last, and others are more soft. But in anyway, rafting is pretty strong
It was fine, soft. But, it looked dangerous but no. I was thrilled with the journey
That's cool.
Yes
Did you go on Spring Canyon?
It was on the ninety
Around then?
One, and i don't remember where it goes, it's that, when you're there for the first time, and everything is running water
Yes it's true. But yes it's beautiful
Yes, it was very nice around there.
Well, and speaking of today's subject, even though they allow us to talk like that, it's OK
Right
I think there are many things that still separate the American people.
Yes
Just like in the whole world, there are political ideas, nationalist ideas and races. Racism is still common in many places.
Yes, very. And, excuse me, but I didn't understand the word you used, what did y-....?
Immigration?
Was it..
Oh, immigrants
Was it immigrants? I didn't quite understand the recording
Yes
That was what they said. Immigrants, OK
Yes
OK
How do you see the situation here in the United States?
Yes
The kind of things, political aspects, races and things that cause division and still.
Yes
OK
Sorry.
Sorry
Well, you see. Among people of the same race, there is division. You see, there are communities of Hisp- of Mexicans, or Cubans, or Puerto Ricans or even from here
I didn't speak much Spanish because I grew up in an,
None
American world, speaking English.
Yes.
I was very embarrassed to speak Spanish, because the people that came from other countries would make me feel as if I wasn't
I felt bad when i spoke with them.
It is true there was a lot more prejudice about that in the past.
Yes.
That is something that I'm instilling in my daughter, she should never be afraid to speak Spanish.  Spanish is a very beautiful language.
Yes.
It is very important that one is bilingual here in the United States
Yes.
And, she's learning, her kindergarten is in Spanish, although is mixed with English, because I want her to learn to read and write Spanish well,
None
Living in the United States, she is speaking both languages very well, and
Words, she reads them well in Spanish and in English. I don't want her to forget I know she will need it
And is how the parents impose, or adapt them. Like you say, Yolanda, sometimes the same pressures that they put on them, one is already afraid of speaking Spanish.
I'm very fluent in English but I'm never afraid to speak Spanish.
Yes. now I'm learning, and now more, since I'm old, yes, I don't get, a little embarrassed, because I don't speak it very I speak it, I speak Tex-Mex.
You speak it very nice, you shouldn't worry about how you speak it.
Thank you
We all have an accent, all of us
Yes
So, don't worry about that.
I am learning to pronounce the words properly and to use the right words. Because here in the United States some words that are used in other countries, may sound different
Right
Yes, and I am leraning more and more
And you tell me! I was married to a woman from Oaxaca and the language, the words there, compared to Puerto Rico, there are lot of different words, and others who have different meanings, and phrases too
None
I learned a lot with my wi, my ex-wife now
None
But I learned a lot of the dialect
Yes
They speak in Oaxaca.
None
We the Puerto Rican, decompose words a lot
None
Because, I learned to talk more properly here.
None
I realized how we shorten the words. Instead of saying
Yes
For, we say, for there
Yes.
I'm upset as I'm going there and they are killing the language.
Yes. I have some friends that come from Costa Rica, and you you. And, more formal Spanish.
Yes, yes
And I admire it because it sounds so nice.
Yes, it is very nice.
Yes.
Spanish is a beautiful language. How we treat it sometime damages it but the written language is beautiful
Yes, very beautiful. I also cannot write too well. because I don't know the accents well and all the grammar.
Grammatically, I can't write too
Yes.
I can read it, and that's important.
Sure.
Yes.
That's good. I imagine your kids speak English.
Yes, but now they are trying to, to speak Spanish. They already see that is very important.
Yes. Very important.
They understand, if one speaks slowly.
Yes.
But, they can't speak very well. But they wish, now they have the desire, before when they were younger, they didn't have the desire, because they said that they didn't need to speak.
Spanish.
Notice that there are many people speaking Spanish here in the United States.
Yes.
Here is Colorado, the stores advertise many things in Spanish.
Yes.
The commercials, even on the normal channels, like NBC or ABC
None
CBS is having more commercials mixed with Spanish.
Yes. It's because they're seeing the power of the Hispanic people here in the United States. We're here.
Sure, big market.
There is money there and people will try to win their products
Sure, I imagine...
Yes. Sorry.
I imagine that there are many Latinos there especial-
This is Maria Ines from Philadelphia.
Yes, hello, my name is Blanca from Finex
How are you? Where are you from originally?
Colombia, yes
Columbia. I'm from Argentina.
Yes
Can you tell?
I can tell
Do you know what they say, if you can tell, you can tell
Yes, I can tell easily, there are accents that are unmistakable, no?
Maybe, yes, yes, no, at least IÂ´m not from Buenos Aires
Yeah
What do you think about today's subject?
Well, inequality
Yes
This is a country where you see more inequality.
Yes. No.
Yes, you can notice that here immediately, definitely
It very noticeable in Finex?
Yes, here itÂ´s very common, who would think that being an immigrants state, totally near the border, but you can notice it and notice it a lot
Look, it's closer to the border with Mexico.
Yeah, I'm up from the border, it's a border state with Mexico
And it's filled with Mexicans and
Mostly Mexicans.
There are problems like that with the americans, with people
Not at this point, but closer to the border because I don't precisely live next to the border.
Sure
Between any people that's of a different color to them, or different physical appearance, or different features
If they don't like it
They at least tell you, and on top of that, they tell you that, you go somewhere and i speak really bad English
Right
I go and then they say they don't speak mexican, so i tell them i don't speak Mexican language, the language is Spanish
I start fighting
Sure
With my bad english, and i start fighting, i leave
But it is fine. It is good you fight with them. I think it is perfect.
Yeah, i go around fighting, it makes me so angry if i don't let them know that Mexico is not a language, it's a country
Sure
They are lazy and bold
Yeah, what a mess, it hasn't happened to me here, but the thin is that this is a very big city.
Is that
I mean it has happened to me that they don't understand me but not that they tell me anything but also I think that it is because they are very used to it
None
There are people from everywhere here what you do see a terrible difference here I don't know if over there also it with the African Americans
None
There's anger
Is that I think that
There's a terrible conflict that the African Americans are
I tell you that is everywhere
Look at that
Everywhere you go and there's an African American community they are are very resentful people that all they have lived in the course of
The existence of their past.
Yes
They are very forewarned people
Yes very aggressive right? Do you see that over there?
They are people yes
When they see that you are white, they treat you badly.  It's even worse if you don't speak English well.  They hate you even more.  It's terrible.
Yes
I didn't have any problems with the white people but with the black people yes and nothing I have absolutely nothing against the race obviously they are
None
But, specially, not the Americans, which are divine, but the African Americans are tremendous, it has happened to me many times that they get me wrong in a business or that
I don't know, that they deal with you without looking at you
It's very resentful people
Yes
It's very resentful people, but i think that's because of what they have lived in their history
Yes
Instead of wanting to stand out in a good way, it's the people... where you go, they make scandals or yell, it's very messy, dirty people
Yeah, you see?, they yell, it's terrible because, them and you walk in a different direction, that's it, it's not being racist
I don't like people yelling if I see them gathered in one place, I go somewhere else
Even more, yes
I obviously don't have problems with people of color, not at all, i love them, i think they're so much better than white people at sports
But to hang with that group of African Americans, they're teribble. Here they are.
Yes, that's everywhere, but in Philadelphia, there are more
Yes, in Philadelphia, there are lots of them here too because they are poor, that poor black people
None
What's the cause
Well, that's everywhere, I'm telling you, that like, they underestimate themselves, so, later on they don't try to move on with things
Positive things, but others, and of course I know a lot of black people that live in other places, and it's normal, I think.
Yes, for example, my boss's husband it black. He' African, he came from the Ivory Coast
And he's phenomenal, he's a very educated person, he's very nice, very smart, but he came from Africa
None
I believe this is a social problem, not a racial one, the one that they have here
Yes, it's mostly social and hard feelings so, there are people that think that since they had to go through all that, they are owed something
Sure
So, they don't have to struggle to get out, to advance, they feel like everything should be handed to them.
M people, immigrants that come here one hand in their back and the other one in front of them, they come to see if there's something they can do
Yes
And they work hard and they do well, they are not poor and you would think they are Americans.
None
They work so hard but there poor
If you go to Miami you can tell the difference because the blacks caused a lot of racial problems a long time ago
None
You do see lots of poverty and dust and mess
You see
You say, they want to feel socially rejected, they don't wan to live like that but they don't do anything to get out of that
Sure
Here in this country you can have everything
If you want, in this country, you can have good
Sure
Or bad things economically but if you want, you can progress. I don't mean that you can become a millionaire but you can do well.
Oh you can't study, you can look
Yes
Look for opportunities for many things, I'm unemployed at this moment and I'm going to the unemployment office
Yes
And they're going to sponsor my study.
Look
So I can get hired then it' a bunch of thing
I knew a girl, she was Argentinian, I didn't really know is a friend of my friend. And my friend would tell me that this girl got pregnant here
An Argentinian girl and the state paid her studies for being a single mother and so I can imagine the things there must be for the Americans
None
More for them that seem like a minority group that should have a thousand things to their favor.
Exactly
However, nothing.
Because I think I keep insisting they want to continue like that
Yes that I mean one understands poor people what they went through wasn't nice and and nothing but that was a long time ago already now they could say
We are already in another time right?
Sure it already happened I mean the white people that are now are not the people that had slaves and they are not slaves either I mean that's it we are human beings we are all the same
I don't know
These days I was filling out some applications and I found very odd that the girl told me directly is not that the paper said it because
In the majority of applications it says ethnic group.
Sure, yes
There, she tells me, which race are you, I'm part of the human race but I thought her question was pretty silly, I got so mad
Sure, yes
She looked at me and asked me where, and I was like, no, I'm a human being,oh, what race, I'm part of the human race, what ethnicity, what origin?
I'm Hispanic. I felt like, what is wrong with this bitch? Those are really stupid questions.
Yes, they do ask you that a lot here. that had never happened to me before, to be asked what ethnicity do I have
And which race
In the beginning, I didn't know what to answer because you can choose Latin, Hispanic or white.
Yes
What do I know, I didn't know what to chose and now I always chose Hispanic, I've realized that I belong to that race.
That race, let me tell you, they come up with such silly things!
Yes
I don't understand it
Why are they using it for? I think that sometimes, companies have to have a certain percentage of employees of every type, right?
None
It's established in law
That's a particular way of approaching you when they ask which race are you.
It never happened to me
It did to me, and I laughed so hard, I said, thank you, I'm part of the human race.
Sure, I'm
That sounds like the little animal here
No
That is what it sounded like to me. I have never lived in Massachusetts
Look near here
I lived five years in Massachusetts and my husband was laid off from the company where he worked and then we came over here because we were tired of suffering over there
Yes and there where the weather is nice
Yes wonderful this climate here is wonderful is very bad in June, July and August is an unbearable heat
But here too
There's no humidity,it's a wonderful climate and I love it.
What's the temperature there now
Right now is around sixty more or less, seventy
How awesome
It's nice and without humidity, there's never humidity here
Sure
Only when it rains and here it hardly rains
Here the summer is terrible, the summer is heat, heat, but a lot of heat and humidity and in winter you die of cold
And is very humid, that's how it is in Massachusetts there, the summer is humid
Sure
The snow covers you up in the winter.
Sure
It's extreme and it's winter for six months. You see three months of fall, where the cold is crazy.
Yes
You have three months of winter that extend almost to the end of spring.  Then you only have a short summer and so
Go out and enjoy.
Sure, we got here a little while ago.
Good evening
Good evening
This is Carlos speaking from Houston, Texas
Hi, how are you? This is Gabriela speaking.
Where are you calling from?
I am from Vancouver, Canada.
Ok
You from where?
What do you think about today's topic about Houston, Texas.
Ah, very good, What nationality are you?
A, Puerto Rican
I'm a Mexican national.
OK, What do you think about today's topic?
Very interesting
Do you think that there are many inequalities now?
Well I feel that it's the whole society where they have to live together, different cultures, it's a bit difficult. At any rate in a country where culture,
It's homogeneous and where there's not much diversity in any way of inequality it's apparent, I think that it's something that it exists in humanity since, for ever.
I think the same.
What do you think?
In everything, in any situation, there is going to be some kind of inequality. Either about race, gender, and religion
None
Always, I think it is a part of our human nature, I mean, so much diversity
That's right, I agree
There is so much diversity in the world that there will always be room for inequalities to happen. There will always be the fight for power.
None
It is human nature, there is always a fight for the power
Yes
This kind of inequality
That's right, and the best way to, to know it, to know the future is analyzing history, along human history there
Has always been inequality. It is the powerful, the less powerful, and the one on the bottom.  It is all part of
Human nature, well I think that we are competitive, and since there is competition everybody wants his best
Do you think that inequality is alright?
Alright?
I think that the fact that there is inequality doesn't mean
None
One personn is going to be better than the other. I think that
Yes.
The fact of one person belonging to a minority
None
He is Spanish or because he is Afro-american, and i think that many, many minotities
Yes
They think that the fact of being a minority means they don't deserve, they don't fight enough to be able to stand out and have equality
Yes
In comparison with a Caucasian person or have a better social position
Yes, I agree with you, it's like, maybe
None
None
I think we all have right
Sure
I think, but what In my opinion, in many occasions, minorities, don't try, don't fight
None
But, what they might be
That's true.
In what's
I agree with you
Minorities do not try to fight in Texas.
I see many Hispanics that live here.
None
And they have lived all their life in the United States and even then they don't speak English
Yes, that's true
And, these kinds of things are a bit annoying, I think that since
None
It's not so difficult
No it depends on the age you can, on the age it was. You can learn the language, and if you don't learn the language you're out overconfident see because
How will you express yourself, how will you communicate.
Yes
From there you're disadvantaged.
Exactly how
In some form comes a key or something you can do for the issue of the topic of inequality.  This
I think that the fact that there's always been inequality and there will always be inequality, this doesn't mean that
Forms part of something that you have to accept as established and whatever. Even like you say, there will be people who maybe aren't interested
To rise above it because they feel that, that they can't, or maybe that a community or minority or race, or whatever, is inferior.
I think that in any way diversity is necessary. It's established by the same naturalness for evolution, but it's also the free will to decide what side you want to be on.
But it also corresponds to those in the minority. if a person says
None
I don't think that, a person of the Hispanic race should have this position, let's say it's a company
None
That's completely Hispanic
None
Sentence 3 is only utterances
None
There's also discrimination from minority against minority
None
Or likewise that the discrimination of saying, we don't want Hispanics, or we don't want a woman in this position.
None
Is, it would be, is hard to be able to fight it in in, against in that regard, I mean, to prove that a company to say it like that, has
None
Reasons for discrimination either for the sex, sexual orientation, religion.
Yes
They are cases that are extremely hard to prove
Yes is true, but
In the eyes of justice
I think that, in this case, the persistence, in other words not giving up. look for opportunities in some other place,
Look that the persistence has made the difference. We the women, for example, right now. You mentioned the fact that there's discrimination because in some
Companies they think, that a woman doesn't have the same ability, little by little, women have been gaining ground in that aspect and proving that, with
None
Hello
Hello, good evening
Good evening.
My name's Maira. What's your name?
Nicolas
Okay, where are you calling from?
From Pennsylvania.
Okay. I'm from Philadelphia too.
Are you? What's up, how are you?
Fine, here.
Good
To
What's up?
Nothing, What was the title about, equality?
Do you studying at the University of Pennsylvania?
Yes
Where are you from?
From Mexico.
Are you Maira from Mexico?
Yes
I'm Blanchet my queen.
You're a Blanchet?
Yes
What are are you doing?
Nothing. they gave me this when I got here, it was worth it. It's great right?
Yes, it is super good. I sent mail. You never saw it? I thought that none of the Mexicans were home. Only Arturo.
No
Yes is perfect. Is that since you never told me your name, you always told me to call you Blanchet.
Yes
To know boy.
How are you, good.
Fine here. What did you do on the weekend?
This
Giving the break
The break I went to Mexico. I was there a couple of weeks. Super enjoyable, and you?
How nice! I was also there, and in Charcatecas, and Guadalajara.
You spent it super great my queen
Well yes, it wasn't bad at all.
How Cool, what envy.
I saw the family
Aye yes, really important honestly. yes, that's what I wanted to return to. did you go to the exam that they had on the last day of class?
So until the twenty first of December?
None
Yes it was really hard But that God I had the opportunity to return and I had a really good time there. Honestly
On the twenty second. It's been a year that I wanted to do it, but no, I'm leaving. I hope it goes well
It didn't happen, I have to do it this week.
Did you have to be there for vacations?
You need to be studying everything
That's really cool
I'm doing the things to get a job.
This is true.
Totally
This really true, girl.
It's like this.
And how's the inequality?
The truth is that I'm not paying much attention to it. What did they say? That
They said that, something about inequality in the United States, about race, and if you think that it's something that can be solved or not.
None
It's like Mexico, it's something impossible. The people will never do it.
No, I think that here in the United States you feel it, no, particularly.
It feels great
Everybody can't stop thinking about these things. If you decide something, if these are black, if these are, and so on. I am surprised
If you arrive to a city, ans, the population is divides between the colored and the non colored, an so on
Yes
It is very marked, honestly
Above all
What about the gringos?
The United States is made of, its population is made of immigrants, so I am surprised that still they discriminate ones and the others. I mean there is nobody American
That's right
They keep talking about the foreigners. I don't understand. I think that here in Philadelphia, you can notice it much more than in other places.
And
Than in other cities
The black community here in Philadelphia is huge. You enter the University
None
And that is no longer seen. I mean, it's like another world
Yes
None
Have you also noticed it here? Because inside the University it is the same. All the works, of low range, they are always
They are for them
And when you find something related to administration, no matter how low it is, here in the University, I think I would do anything
None
When you deal with one who's a bit higher than the others
None
It's always white.  The stupider you see, it's always white
This is true
There's a lot of that stuff here, like they do it until the university. it's not, like, it seems that it's the way of working here. I don't really understand what happens.
It's a fee, honestly
But this bothers me a lot. When I came for the first time three years ago,
None
I saw, and I couldn't believe it. Like, I never thought that I would feel it so much.
So marked, yes. If you go there in Mexico,
Besides
And identify with people who are foreign. And more in the city, but here they say that people really strongly reject you
Obviously there's rejection, and there always will be. It's something that I say that will never be solved
None
Also as marked as it is here, this you don't see. You don't see it much.
It's more like they shouldn't be related to money
Yes, everything has to follow with wool.
Because the darker you are, if you have money you don't have a problem. Everyone treats you well.
Yes, this is very true.
I don't know.
It's rough.
Oh, how are you doing in your classes? the university, life here
I'm doing fine, I have a lot of engineering subjects
You do?
I don't have a lot of time to do anything else. I could take a writing seminar this semester
Cool, right, it's like a hobby
Okay
But everything else is. I'm taking a mechanical engineering course and physics and chemistry and math, the usual stuff
None
I'm doing fine. I'm holding on, I believe that this semester, I hope I do better because I didn't do that well in the last semester
It's your first semester.
It's the same.  I haven't done good in any semesters to be honest.
Yes
I always get a low grade in one subject and that lowers my GPA, it doesn't matter if it was, let me tell you, I wouldn't mind if it was outside
None
It lowers my GPC, but I mean, I've now resigned myself to think, at least I can do other things to
Well yes
To justify it, I didn't do
Yes, and it's a tough university, honestly, it is. I mean, it's not one in which you go and say, I don't know
Study your degree in commu, I don't know, in communication science in sweeper. I mean, don't. No my queen, here it is very tough. The issue
More because of the competition, crap.
None
Is cheap.
I'm shocked And imagine that here there's no much competition, I mean in engineering is not so hard than others.
Like in Wharton.
I don't know what rubbish they do one to another
That's true. So if you go to ~MIT there it is
There is people
They want you dead, don't they. I say, that I honestly say I couldn't live in an environment like that. But I have had great times here. And more now that we are, we are involved in rushing
Yes
About brotherhoods
Which one you are in which rushing?
I just came back from dinner, and I'm waiting for it to get dark again to go out.
OK
Yes, fuck. I don't know. I like the idea a lot. Because there are a lot that can be part of the brotherhood and do not change until
When you want. So live a year, or six months, and you can be there until your senior year if you want
None
Then I like that. Because I don't want to live there the next semester.
Okay. The houses are very ugly. I don't like them. But if you can avoid living there, is ok, right?
That is true and there is one we went to recently called the castle.
None
The one that is there, the One college hall it is great.
That is great, that is very good.  Even the parties they have are cool.
Yes There is like if I donÂ´t know. I liked that one very much
Cool.
What about you?  How are you doing?
I'm fine. Quiet. A lot of engineering ended. I would like to know when I will take some others I like, another classes, I think I am not going to do it. And right now I'm only doing campus recruiting
Well that of, lets see what happens, I don't have idea, the truth
Yes
Is that, is very competitive. You feel that is like everything is because of, people from Wharton really work much more
Than us to find jobs.
It is that way.
Yes, so, I am still with all, I have all for companies presentations, I cannot go, because I have classes.
That is.
I have classes all the day, it is not nice. I donÂ´t know, lets see. what happens, maybe something happens. And if not, IÂ´ll stay here
Yes, that is great. What I wanted to do was get a dual degree, but I need a super GPA and it is
Something like an impossible thing the damn one GPA is very difficult
What surprise me that there are people who do it
If there is a good, it is the worst, they ask you for a three point five, and as soon as you get the three point five
There are three hundred who have three point eight.
Yes
These three hundred came in first
Here not the grade
Ugly
What do you want to do it in?
I don't know if I will do it with the astronomy and physics department
Wow.
Or in finance. But I really like the astronomy option, wow. It seems really cool. But it's also really hard to get in. They have a lot of requirements.
You do this Until then you don't have a lot of subjects, no. I think that at best it will be easier. I think that it doesn't even have six, to
No, I would take two, no more than two or three subjects in astronomy and then I would specialize in physics. But it would be with this department.
They give me the option to, to take these three subjects
None
Asronomy is really small here. There isn't a major or a minor in astronomy.
Hmmmmm Wow.
Yes, it would be mixed with physics there.
That's really interesting and you end up learning a lot of things.
Yes, like I don't want to wait like this with my degree because maybe in the end I'll finish doing mechanics, and I'll change to something else
None
I don't know what will happen.  I feel really insecure about what I want.  I need to spend more time and see what I like the most and what I don't because I don't know.
I need to put my feet on the ground for a moment.
Okay. You don't have to know yet.
Yes, there's still time.  That's what worries me.
Okay, you have years and years to see what you do.
Yes, besides all that I'm taking now, are like very general subjects
None
As far as my major that facilitates the movement.
Okay
Then, about that, I don't have much of a problem. But yes, there we are. Will there be a Mex gathering at Penn soon?
This week we are seeing if Thursday or Friday
In other words, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow?
Yes
In other words tomorrow. Just send me a mail.
Is that they called me, they already called me here is good, very good, Luly and I sure, if they call me we'll do it Thursday, and I say, okay, if you want send a mail.
Yes, they said they haven't sent it yet but, if they haven't send it they will send it during the weekend.
Yes, super laid back.
Maybe Sunday, the other day we decide and then we'll send it. And for Thursday let's see how it goes.
To see what we do there.  Let's see if we go eat at that restaurant that's on second street that they say is super good.
Yes, there's several. We can do one of those. There's several restaurants that are very good.
Yes, listen, something like that, because today.
Yes
I can't stand the food here, it's so bad
Listen Sebastian told me they were going to do community living
Yes, we'll do it next year.
So..
The next semester here in Harrison
Very good, very good, how many are you?
We would be about ten.
Wow
Yes, since we live here, we'd rather stay. So we better try before they take us out and end up living in Kings Court
Which I don't think would be a good idea
Hello, I'm Manuel.
Honey
How are you?
Fine, here in Florida.
Me too.
None
Let's talk about the topic. Right?
The equality in the United States.
Yes.
There is no equality in being a female in the United States.
That there isn't?
There isn't
Okay.
I particularly see at my job daily.
None
The attitude towards the Latin, I don't find it has changed too much.
Okay
I find that it's the same, if not worse.
Okay.
There's too much stereotype as far as what nationality you are, in Latin.
Very good.
Them, I see it a lot with, how can I explain, with the Dominicans.
None
This, the Mexicans.
Yes.
I see a lot because where I work, yes, there are Latinos.
There are lots of Latinos
Yes, unfortunately, the problem is that the company we represent needs their services because much of their clientele is in Spanish.
It's cheaper to employ a bilingual person.
None
An American person that doesn't know Spanish couldn't take the calls.
Of course.
I see the treatment and I see the reaction of my colleagues who are American.
Toward the Lations.
Exactly and the comments.
None
You hear comments all the time, that how many Latino people are they going to keep hiring.
None
They are the minority, but they don't grasp the fact that one person is getting paid to do the work of two.
None
Do you understand? i see that too between Hispanics
Sure.
We here have lots of Venezuelans, Mexicans, two or three Colombians, and a pair of Puerto Ricans.
None
There's racialism between them.
None
It makes you say like, wow, still? Those divisions are supposed to have disappeared.
None
Just because of that, being Hispanics, I don't think we've progressed much.
Do you also believe that there is more inequality because of a people's origin?
For their sex
And for their sex, isn't it?
In the company I work for, if you're a woman you won't go far.
That's right, isn't it?
They
It's true, we have companies here that have been sued because of that, right?
Yes, they don't take those things into consideration.
For example, how, no? If they are sued, why don't they oppose the work discrimination against women.
That's kind of true, in a certain way. I also understand their point of view, do you understand? Women, in general, they are responsible for their children.
The opposite sex, they might have children but they don't have the
Is not here.
Generally, it is the priority of being an employed father versus an employed mother.
None
You know that from the point of view from the company, I can understand it up to a certain extent. What I'll never understand is that, You understand me?
It's penalized for having them at the priority where they have to have it, the company has to see it from the point of view of production.
Yes
A mother, the probability of being absent more than a father is higher.
It should be. No.
There are very few fathers who are single raising their kids.
Sure.
Versus the mothers that are single, that have their kids, that they have to care for, that on top of that, have to work the hours. And, even if they are not single, it could be that they are married.
But at the time a kid gets sick, or that anything happens,
None
Generally is the mother who has to go running, go get him at wherever he's being taken care of,
Sure, there it mixes a gender inequality with a work inequality. Right?
More or less, is a combination.
None
Those are the things they take into consideration at the time of hiring you, supposedly they shouldn't ask you the question during an interview, but they do ask it.
Sure.
What are you going to do? Are you going to sue them because you told them you have kids?
They ask you when they shouldn't ask
By law, in the United States they shouldn't.
But, it's done. Right?
I have personally gone to interviews where they clearly asked if I am single or married and who would take of my kids if they get sick.
Sure, and they shouldn't do it, so, Right?
It's a federal law but what are you going to do
They can't
Let's see. What are you going to go to and say, in this interview
None
They asked me this question, I answered honestly, and all of a sudden, the position is filled
None
How do you prove it?
There, you're right.
It would be your word against the person who interviewed you, judge, and I, never asked that question.
None
You know that, I have seen it
That the question is asked, I do know it's asked. Right? when it's said they shouldn't.
I tell you that it's a law. It's prohibited in an interview, to ask that question, that's the same as asking if you are a homosexual or straight. Do you understand me?
Sure
One thing should not have anything to do with the other. But they do, and, I personally have gone through that.
Of course
I donÂ´t believe equality is present in the USA.
There are many inequalities in many parts of the U.S.
Legality and equity are right?
None
They always penalize and criminalize the immigrant figure right?
I'm sorry I cannot hear you very well.
I think it's a negative stereotype of the immigrant, right?
Yes. how can i explain this you know I have family from the Dominican Republic.
None
I am Puerto Rican and thank God I don't have to go through the process of obtaining a visa.
None
I have family that have been through that process.
None
I have relatives who have gone through all that and then you know you have to go through a lot and also have no rights
Yes
I have seen the abuse you know that if they did those things to me I could claim my rights
None
Only because I am a citizen, you know you have to go through that process, they are trying to become citizents
Of course
People, in general, adopt a very negative attitude. They have the point of view that they are coming here to take their jobs, that
And they just can't realize, can't know the truth, They are not taking them any job, because any American can apply for that same job
He'll be given it
Exactly, right?
But, they don't want to go to a farm to harvest oranges, for
Sure, that's true, I think it's the point of view of somebody who has little education. If he is really convinced that an immigrant will take his chances
If you knew, this opinion is, is very, very common
None
Even from people that I, let me tell you. I hear that in my job all the time and I stare at them, because they are so ignorant.
They won't be that, intelligent, then, right?
They are educated people who are doing the comments. Do you understand? They are not ignorants who haven't gone to school or who know nothing about life
They are people who chorus the common voice
None
The adopt an attitude without knowing, because they haven't been through the situation nor know anyone who has been through that experience
None
It's sad, because I don't know, and specially it's sad for the Mexican
None
Who are, as far as I have seen, the most marginalized
Here in Florida
In Florida
None
You say that you are Mexican, and everyone assumes that you are picking fruits somewhere
Yes
Especially where I live, you have all the farms
None
They are women and they are good people.
None
It's a shame, because I know many people that are prepared. And many times, because of the language limitation, they can't find jobs in other things.
Really?
I'm talking about having studied in their country, and they have a title
That's the problem, it's based on the legal rights they can have
None
And since those are close, they have to
If you are not bilingual and do not understand English perfectly, you are very limited.
Also
Nor, not for, the assumption.
None
I have a supervisor that told me that I shouldn't be talking in Spanish.
None
I looked at her, and I told her, l regretting the case, that's why they hired me
None
Unfortunately, you can't be offended because of that, this is my native language, that's the one I speak and sometimes, it is easier for Latin people to communicate in their own language than to try to translate it into English, specially if one of its colleagues, is
Barely, like they say, starting to learn the language.
None
She said, I know a way, in which you could understand it up to a certain point, but only to a certain point.
Exactly.
Because, you can't force that person to speak the way they find it easier
Sure.
You know, instead of becoming shy, I know they are speaking, lots of things are involved and you are like
That's stupid, but they cause some problems within the workplace.
It causes lot of abuses. They make some comments that aren't well intended.
Yes, No, if you go to a supervisor and tell him, look this supervisor told me this and that, you are always the one to blame.
None
If they were speaking French or German or some other language, I don't think the reaction would be the same.
That's right, exactly.
Do you understand? I believe that we also have other coworkers that speak in Italian and I find it funny.
Yes.
But, you can't speak in Spanish because they get mad.
Sure, they don't like you
What's the difference?
Spanish, nor in, probably, nor in Chinese.
Excuse me.
They wouldn't like your speaking in Spanish or Chinese
No, that's the funny thing; there are two people that speak a
If it was a European language, yes Right?
One that speaks, Portuguese, and one that speaks Italian. If they reverse to their language, there's no comment. Whereas the Spanish, then they are, their faces mounted, and the attitudes.
None
And, in my understanding, I understand that is a form of racism
If you are American and have lived here all your life, you know that there's racism in your country. Right?
You stay
There is in many place, right?
My son has experienced it, and he's a kid.
None
I mean, he came from school, and he told me he had classmates that he couldn't talk to because the classmates didn't talk to him because he was brown.
None
And I had to tell him, well, my love, is that you are not supposed to be white.
None
How can you be white since your parents and grandparents are not white?
None
You have nowhere from where to come out white, it's not meant for you to be white, that's of kids.
There's no need.
This is what they hear at home.
Yes.
You put it in all the kids that
Hello my name is Miriam
Hello
Yes good evening my name is Miriam
Hello. My name is Mauricio. How are you?
Thanks
Have you already participated?
Pardon
Have you already participated?
Yes, I've already participated
How nice! The topic is equality?
Yes equality how is the equality in the United States
Okay
There's a lot of inequality, right?
Yes I think there's inequality and I think that it's not only in the United States, there's inequality in the whole world
Yes, but you like you feel it more in the United States in what way
Depends there's although they talk a lot about equality, of opportunity and all the truth is that is no is not equal I mean there's no equality
None
I've seen it for example for the Hispanic right?
None
I don't see that there's equality and also there's an equality that I say that when they talk about equality for example with the homosexuals, you understand me?
There's no equality with the homosexuals
No, I think that there is
How is that
As far for them.
Okay
Within the freedom within the freedom but is bad right? but as far as equality as far as Hispanics I think that there's really no equality there's no equality and there
Okay
There's  a certain type of inequality.
Who would be the ones who make the equality
In
Who the employers, the government, how do it
The people, I think that the people
The white people or the colored people
The people in general yes the American
Okay
The American and I think that to a certain extent you're right you're right to a certain extent
Why
They've come to invade their land, invade their house, and they have brought a certain amount of culture which affects the country
None
I think that to a certain extent they have the right to feel like that
But remember that North America is a continent of immigrants
Yes and
Because they themselves immigrated from another place.
Yes, but and the
The American came from Europe
Yes, but
They displaced the race the natives that may have been may have been whatever old
No, but
Partner
But at the end they are already here, this is their land so it doesn't matter where they come from. This land is theirs and this is their home.
But regarding equality, as human beings, we are all equals and we are all eual before God. But the reality is that in the world there is not equality.
If there were equality there were not wars if there were equality there were not problems between countries
Yeah
That is what I think it could be that now everybody has the freedom to have more or to have least, that we cannot go farther because each one
Has is freedom right? I think there is not equality, that it is a problem of humanity, not just a problem in the United States
In all the country as a Hispanic
Yes that is true because since the ancient times from the beginning of history man always tried to dominate man, the weaker.
Yes of course, and it will always be like that
It will always be like that because the
There is freedom, but there will always be inequalities.
There's always going to be inequality, some will have more than others
I see
Always
Apparently, you think the problem has no solution.
It does but it's complicated because, how can you, how can you do something to have the same things as your neighbor does, do you understand, you have someone beside you and how do you do it so that you have the same or what can he do to have the same things as you do?
I mean, no government is going to pass a law or make you believe that
You can have a government that can equal men in terms of food.
None
Are you talking about physical stuff or also about the
No, but when a government tries to create consumism
I see, but it didn't
It hasn't worked, no, it hasn't worked, the result has been the same
Don't you think that the Bible says that one must think of God because God is always promising us paradise
Yes
Do you think one should wait for
If we are going to talk about the Bible, God always says that we are going to have poor people among, there's always going to be poor people, I mean, when he said that, it's because they are going
While the boyfriend is away, while the boyfriend is away he doesn't see Jesus
While
When you have a boyfriend you should enjoy it. There will always be poor people
Yes, always, there's always going to be inequality, one person is going to be fat and the other one is going to be thin, inequality, how can we equal a black person and a white one
So, equality, in the end that you will always have more money than the other, sure, how we make this equal, we will ahve to see
Equality in terms of what I think that here in this country
No but I think that the question refers more to being unequal in the sense that I think that it refers more to discrimination and if there's discrimina-
How you suffer the fact that it's unequal
Well look, this is a problem for all of humanity
How can it be solved
And yes, if we go there, then the Hispanic person also discriminates against he American.
Yeah
Yes or no?
I've never been in the United States.
Yes, they discriminate because they speak badly, they complain about them
But there's a second language in the United States, which is Spanish in some states, right
None
Where do you live exactly?
I'm in Charlotte
Where? and where is this?
In Charlotte, in North Carolina
There are many Hispanics there.
There's almost more Hispanics than Americans, and where are you?
I live in Toronto, Canada
Being in Canada's okay
Yeah but in Canada they say there's a lot of discrimination, or you know when, when it was a very pretty government, a socialist government
Yes
Here about ten years ago but it's been changing a lot now they say a lot, a lot of people tell me it's like there is this
Sure.
Discrimination, there's a lot that they're already noticing
Yes
Even though they try to hide it there are a lot white people that are getting together, they are separating they look, with a little bit of disdain for other people
Yes sure
They are killing poverty
Still they feel invaded but if we went to Latin America and it's the same they would still complain about Americans you understand, this is a problem that's not just in the United States
That's it eh what country are you from?
I'm from Peru
I'm Colombian
Or Colombian here
In any case, everywhere there's going to be this problem because if you look, Latino Americans complain about Americans more today
We complain but they haven't taken a whole lot
A notice of good that's the the
They have looted us too much, they have exploited us
Some news now is saying that Hugo Chavez wants to plant an idea that he's making an alliance with the presidents in Latin America.  Everything is counter
Hugo Chavez, is that the one from Venezuela?
He is Venezuelan, yes
He's making an alliance with whom
He with the presidents of
Of South America
Latin America, of South America
For what, alliance for what?
He always goes against the Yankee imperialism as he calls it
I see, I see because then Chavez is of a socialist tendency, right?
Yes of course
He wanted to get him out a couple a times and hasn't been able to.
No
To Hugo Chavez they even tried to give him a failed coup, a failed coup d'etat
Yes, it's exactly that because of inequality
But
And for example we go there and the inequalities because he has given let's say like that a hard time to the rich people
It looks like it
He's in favor of the poor people according to what one reads in the news
But there will always be people who you can please
Of that
Because many people in Venezuela were middle class is the most fucked
The middle class, says that they complaint about Hugo Chavez because they say that they were fine and now with his measures there is not work and there is inflation and so many things
He affected with his measures he has affected not only the rich but the middle class too and many of them have come here and they complaint about the
Yes, of course. It is that way. I think it is not only a problem in the United States because, if you are not in the United States, imagine
No but The United States is a world power
It is a problem.
Everybody talks about it, and always even want you, or not always aware of what is happening there
Yes exactly but it is an excellent country and it worries about freedom but I I am Hispanic and I also see that sometimes they have the reason about discrimination
When there is that jealousy I think that, it could be normal
None
It can be normal can be normal because we are invading the land of another
I didnÂ´t know it was like that I thought it was
Hello.
Hello, hello, hello.
Hello, hello, hello.
Yes. How are you? Who's speaking?
Maria Ave, if you are good, but now there is no plan. You have to take care of yourself.
What are you doing?
In Philadelphia.
Hello.  How are you?
And who are you?
I'm Frederico.
From where?
I'm from Philadelphia. Certainly.
You were born in Philadelphia.
Yes. What do you think of inequality?
Why do you speak Spanish?
What do you think of inequality, jerk?
None
None
There's no inequality, we are all the same.
None
I think that in this country there is no inequality
What do you think about people who say no?
That person is wrong.
You see, it's easier
Do you think that for being white, for instance, or other things, you can be more than the others?
Absolutely. It's not that way
What do you think?
Yes, I think that, it's all part of a wrong concept, from the foundations
What is the foundation?
The foundation is that
Yes?
The foundation is always another. No, because the foundation is to believe that not knowing what you are.
If you knew what you are, you would realize that the differences with the others are so small that they are meaningless. But you have to know what you are
You know what I mean?
Sure
The, our concept, occidental, catholic, jewish, chritian, whatever you call it, tells you that you are, unique, and you, you area product of God, the son of God, and some other silly things.
That only increases egoism.  The fact of feeling unique, the only one,
You are something.  In fact we are no more than another living thing that breathes, walks, eats and shits, in this life.
Very little difference with the others
It's being done
And that includes other animals, but what I do know, there are people that still believe that they are born from a chicken and some think that
Well and that is part of their religion, right?
Yes, sure, exactly, yes, I mean, it's ignorant.
Exactly.
I believe that they should educate people
It was around the time of the Sixteenth Century
To teach the other people like we teach ourselves.
Yes, a religion.
There's no other solution. That's the basis of inequality.
Yes.
In the United States, inequality is not between races origins, color.
On education, if you are poor, you will die poor. If I'm a great basketball player, then you are saved.
Sure.
If you are rich, you are going to be rich your whole life, you go to rich people schools, you have wealthy friends, you earn a lot, and you'll die
Poor and that's inequality, there's no other way. The wealthy and the poor, they make them feel that
It's good to be wealthy.
Sure.
The rich people are happy, and the poor people are dreaming about being rich. There's people from so many cultures.
There are other reasons to live for and they tell you that it doesn't matter if you are not rich, or if you are not wealthy, the fact is that people
They give up their material possessions and live an apparently happy life, Without material stuff.
Yes, and many people also think that what you have and what you don't have
Of course.
To, right?
Oh, well.
Oh?
For example, the difference is in the knowing, it's in, the, the, in the, in the real knowledge.
Yes
But, how each head is made up
Also
We don't know what to think, inequality.
No, I want
What is inequality?
Talk about inequality, in fact, the word inequality.
No, well, inequality between people.
No,  they came right?
I don't know, why is someone born in a family with certain resources
It's part of
They can go to the university and you can do a doctorate and you can come to the United States and you can do whatever you want
And some other, oh, you live in, they are stuck. Oh, the parents, the mother is seventeen years old and they don't know who the father is.
They are addicts and he faces violence everyday and they end up in jail, they become drug addicts, and they end up being shot dead.
These are cult-basic
This the difference.
I don't know. Like, what did you tell me?
None
The last
Like you asked, that for you, like, where is the difference?
You have this cultural question.
In their majority.
They want to educate people.
The poor people can't be inserted with the rich because they're already poor.
Sure, but the problem, is that there's a sub-message, a subliminal message that says that, like, the idea is that people
Poor people believe that the only way to be happy is to be rich, having a car, a house or
None
None
This cultural, thisn't
No, it's good, for this.
It is ugly.
I see it more in this country where there's a consumerist culture, it's so inserted in our city, where everything is to consume,everything is to spend,
To have
Yes, more or less in the end, in big.
What?
Maybe the women.
Sure, the biggest, the most
Yes, that's why the last,
Yest, that's it.
Yes, I already know.
What do I know? I don't know, How are the inequalities in your country?
Is in Argentina
Are there inequalities?
Yes. There are inequalities, there are inequalities. But, no, they are not so, for me they are not as marked as they can be.
They are not so marked.
No,
And there's no racism?
Yes, of course. But.
There's no xenophobia against the Paraguayans, the Bolivians, the Peruvians?
Yes. No. Sometimes
In the, I think there's a lot.
Really?
Yes, I think that in Argentina, there's a lot.
This, you need it?
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Beautiful. I don't know You are seeing it, but you don't see a limit
And, yes.
With that
Yes, I am of origin.  If you have some native blood and you screw up, the first thing you are, you are black shit
Is well.
I don't know. You were driving a car and got distracted.  The one who was driving next to you screamed black shit.
They don't scream prick or jerk, or nothing.
That also
Then me as a blonde was shit, wasn't it?
Then it's good.
Yes, but there we are.
Okay, I'm not saying that it's not. But there comes that habit that the blacks are resentful because they don't have what the rich ones have. They are poor.
No, that of resentment is
That's true. You can notice that, and see it.
That,
Yes because they tell you of shit I've heard many times
The
Rich shit I've also heard many times from other people.  When you go to Miramar and the ones from Miramar were fighting with the coastal ones, and it was the shit.
And it does hurt the feelings, that is
That's where resentment arises.
I don't know, I mean, obviously, it's racism and it is racism because they feel undervalued.
It's their reaction, yes.
None
It's like a reaction to all of that, I mean, that wouldn't happen if there wasn't a reason for it, I mean, action and reaction.
Yes, the action when you push something, the energy that it has on you is the reaction. If you don't push it, you don't have the reaction. It's the same in this case.
Yes.
It is a reaction you are having. It is the social reaction to your discrimination, he feels discriminated against
What does he do? He joins others and they come after you.
What about that!
That's it, and well,
That's fine but what do I know?
Don't you agree?
Many times, you feel discriminated.
How?
Lots of times they don't discriminate. Or, what do I know? It's like they discriminate themselves, they make mistakes, at all.
But there's a social reason.
Obviously. Sure.
There's a social issue, the boy takes a look in the mirror and he sees that he's black, right? and then he turns on the television and all he sees is white people!
Do they feel bad?
But.
Blonds, no, how are they all not white?
It's all funny
No. Come on.
It's
And the publicity is calm, the publicity in all the, milk, the mineral water, whatever it is.
It always has blond people, white people, a model, I mean, a guy from the earth.
The
No, sure, it's not a, it's not an average Argentinian, that's what I'm saying. It's an Argentinian that is part of
That's fine.
Of a superior class, about ten percent o the, if not more, in terms of
Good afternoon, John, from New York.
Miriam, from Florida
Hey Miriam, how are you?
Fine, and you?
How's everything down there?
Hot
That's great because I'm going there in less than two weeks.
Yea
Yea
What do you think of social security in the United States?
It hasn't been bad and has helped a lot because my grandparents came from Cuba.
They were able to use it. My mom's now retired
None
She's used it. And no, she hasn't been bad, but it needs a few changes. They need some fixes for the medicines
Medicare
Yea yea, me- medicare the, medicines are really expensive, and, and so there are times when your insurance doesn't cover your medicine. And so- or they don't cover it all, and they're really expensive.
But I only have
Yea but they say they say that this, that for example, in a few more years that money won't even be there, and all the money they've taken from us
Yea
This, it's not going to be there anymore.
No, i don't think so, i don't think that, i honestly don't think that's
We're not having it anymore
Even though they've said it, and they've... but i think that, they're gonna do things, uh, with the, the new people that are going into the
In the system, the work system, to support the system, right?, and i think that, god permit
Yes
We should be more responsible for our destiny, right?
None
Partially, we should defend ourselves, right?, although there is a lot of people that, unfortunately, for lack of education or whatever
None
They can't, and we have to look out for them
None
Right?
Yes
When my grandparents came from Cuba they didn't know english so they couldn't work
They worked a little, but they can't do...so these people can't defend themselves, the system has to capture them and help them
The system has many
But
Problems, I have a friend
None
She's a single mom with two kids
Right.
Underage and the government doesn't help because supposedly she makes so much money.
None
She makes about five hundred dollars a week,
None
But you have to take into account the car insurance, she is paying her car.
Right
She is paying a mortgage of a house, herself
Right
Without government aid,
Right
The father of the children when he wants, he, he, he gives her money, and when he canÂ´t doesnÂ´t give money to her, because he is like that, he is not very responsible
Well, right
I have a friend too who is in, in disability
None
He is thirty three years old, and they give him food stamps So, he has more than enough money, and the government gives to him, gives him, give him aid
Right
How could the government give help to a person who does not have dependents and does not have so many responsibilities like this person. This person.
None
A hundred, two hundred dollars that the government gives to her would be of great help.
Yes
The government thinks she is basing it on her income.
None
No, they don't take her expenses into consideration or the doctors, or daycare and all of that.
Right
The government should have to, I mean, it's unfair that they can help an individual that doesn't really needs the help
Well, talking about your friend
None
I'm telling you that it's different in every state because here in New York the law says that
None
It's pretty aggressive with the fathers that refuse to make payments, they get them and they suspend their licenses immediately
And the funny thing is that she's from New York.
None
She just moved to Florida
None
And she has, she has child, what's the name
Child support
Child support, yes, child support through New York because he's still in New York.
Oh, well.
And every time that he gets a job
None
Child support gets him. When the unemployment runs out,
Right
He starts working out of the books, in other words, under the table.
Right. Well those things she obviously has to prove them, number one,
None
Number two, I agree with you that the system is not perfect and has a lot of problems and is hard
Certify because I consider that
None
The person whom she was married to is a swine Right, and there are like that, but there aren't many,
Yes, that's what it sounds like
No, because for more example look, I've been divorced four years, and I got married again, I have a daughter with my wife, and I've never missed a payment, to my son
I've always fought a lot to be with him, because this is not the problem. On the contrary, that my ex-wife would like for me to never see him
I had to play very hard in court
None
And to have him. And all the money I give her, she uses it to pay the house, to screw
To pay other things, instead of paying, use it for him, that's what it has to be for right.
The reason that you give it.
And she has lived comfortably while working a part time job
None
So far, and now he realizes she has the rope up to his neck
None
And she also lives in a house, you know, houses here in New York are so expensive
Yes
And she has used the money that I give her for the boy, she used it to pay the house, to pay for a car, a car
What can I do? I can't do anything about that, but I've done my part, I know I have.
I'm very responsible and I'm going to continue being responsible because he is my son, what can I do? But some people just don't care and they have no shame
None
And they spend their lives fighting instead of being responsible and look for a job to get rid of that and pay what they have to pay, but no, they have no shame.
None
Yes the law is tough for only her, and she can spend her time in court, but who has the energy to do that.
It seems to me that the more help she gets
That
From the system, I mean, the more they try to help those people, the more damage they causes
Sometimes it is, I agree.
Some win, they try to a certain point and they loose
Yes, I've seen that, yes, I agree with you about that. I think that there have been lots of good things done and lots of improvements
In the system because I've seen the changes and I know that they are now really hard with fathers that don't want to pay
They have to provide medical insurance for the children but like I said some have no shame and they escape the system.
None
The ply the system game, so, what can you do? you can do what you can do, and the rest is left is left to God
To take care of someone like this, because if he is not responsible for his sons, then he escapes with the law little game
Well, then he'll have to pay on the other side
None
Considering the system here compared to other countries I would like the system here to specialize more in health
To be better. That people can go to the hospital without having to worry how much they will have to pay
He goes there and they heal him, that's all. And that
No, and, I've had for instance my boyfriend, he got seriously ill once
None
And he had to be operated in emergency
Right
Finally, I got informed and told them that we didn't have the money, because the operation would cost about thirty thousand dollars
Right
I told them, I explained to them my economical situation, and they very nicely made me fill out a form
None
I waited two months
None
I was told that they would pay the whole cost
Right
That was, like a grant of, of, that the country had some money saved for people like us
Right right
I never thought they would pay the whole. Look, if only they payed fifty percent,
None
I see, you can manage paying in stallments
Right
In that, in medical things, I don't spend, I have no problems right now, I can't complain
Yes
Yes, I
And there is also, like you mentioned in the case of your friend, many case of people who fall between the cracks
Yes
Who have too much, who earn a little more than the limits they request and and if you earn less
It's a mess, so those are adjustments they have to do
How do they make the, how do they calculate the amounts, what calculations they do
They use studies of how much an apartment costs, the average cost of electricity, gas
And they will give you, more or less, what they think you need, obviously you won't live like a rich man
No
For instance, my grandparents lived out of section eight
None
Had an apartment until they died. they were given enough money to pay the apartment, electricity, gas
They still had some pesos left, right?
None
They had like one or two hundred dollars left per month with which they could buy things, or buy, or give themselves a little treat or
Yes
They had enough, in my opinion, I thought that the system had coordinated it in a way in which, they didn't live with luxury but they didn't live
They had enough to eat. If they wanted to eat seafood, one month, which is more expensive, they were able to do it
Because. No.
None
Those things that they need, they need with
Igor
Maria, how are you?
How are you?
The welfare system of the States, the social system of the United States
None
How much do you know about the social system of the United States?
What I know is that through the social assistance system with the programs that they have they help all the people
Basically with the differences that they can't cover the social insurance . Helps with the part of the medicine, it also helps with the part of for example.
The part of the taxes that it's contributed, that's what I understand right
Yes, I don't know, I don't deal with that topic too much, I have heard many controversies.
None
As far as to when the state has to be responsible for certain situations and up to when it doesn't
None
What calls my attention is the wealth this country has
In how, the assistance doesn't reach all the people that need it in the way that, that I think they should receive it
Exactly yes, well I think that one of the problems is that it hasn't been given.  I think that on the Government's part
United States is a country with a lot of land and all types of things is true.
That there are many families with many needs because there a global economic crisis and here there's an economic crisis also, there are several states where there's a lack of jobs, right
None
Lower income families that haven't been able to acquire their house among other things, much less even pay their medicines, need these assistance programs
They even have kids and these programs cannot cover the great demand that we have
Far, I don't understand this social security system I'm sure it will go broke in some years, in a few years, they can't
States have more problems every time they lower the budget
Sure, it's a dilemma for me, how to generate a social assistance system that is not just, that doesn't just put out the fire but, I mean, that it puts out the medicine or
This food, but that it does generate a series of resources so that people can become self-sufficient. I think that's a bit idealistic to think
That needs are going to end one day but I believe it would be better to have a social system that has a series of strategic teachings, no
Yes, it's important to me for example, about the food, I had the chance to know more about the coupon delivery or bonuses there
The food stamps for the school children that I don't think they will generate a conscience on them
What type of foods are healthy and how to have a healthy lifestyle, do you understand?
Yes, of course, I agree. The solution must be a global one because we really don't need to always have this, as you say
Not just exist, they are going to grow and then what's going to happen? If there's no, if there's no education included
If there is not a complete integration of all the elements nothing will happen and, as you said, it will be only a temporal remedy.
They gave them food, and that's it. There are other things that are part of it, and that's the problem. I think they should handle this in a global way.
Not as they're doing it now give them a palliative.
None
Putting out the fire instead of planning and preventing, working with the community and doing more to solve a problem because the country has so much money.
That's what I'm worried about. I see that it has a high tax rate
Exactly
And they collect
Exactly
Lots of taxes. I don't understand. In Germany they have a social system in which no one  gets discriminated against because of their status and everybody has access to it, to
Germany, France and Europe, they all have access to medicine and certain basic things that are harder to get here.
I believe that to me, one of the biggest lies in this social system is that, no, I understand the society, in, in every, all the members that are part of it
And I think that they put aside the people that don't have a legal status in the country.
And they are part of society, they consume
None
They help society.
That's right
But they are not part of this system and that creates several parallel problems, no
That's right
Aid and solidarity through religious groups or non governmental organizations but not from the State, the State doesn't, it doesn't take them into account to provide a service to them when they
Yes I pay taxes, lots of them!
That's right
They pay taxes, but they don't get the benefits so it seems like the system is fooling them
That's right
I can't see how, yes, lets say the game, there's lots of money at stake, in a way, is a mask through which we are protecting ourselves
The reality is that in the long run, if this goes on, if I give the kids money to eat hamburgers, don't tell me
With this they are getting the meat proteins that they need because that's not real meat
That's right
It's a double moral
That's an structural problem I believe, of the system. It's a balance. As we were talking, we've included, in the case of a worker, no
None
The system has a problem in its structure because instead of working to get a balance in which both sides can work and contribute together
Sometimes it doesn't achieve that no, and they don't contribute a hundred percent or they do but only a fifty percent of what they should
We are talking about a big number of people contributing to this country's economy because
Have you seen the group of people that want to contribute to the country, but bureaucracy won't let them?
None
The same amount of information it sees that its everywhere but it's not accessible, do you understand, or it is accessible but not understandable.
For them for example, I'm talking about the ones that don't have a status. They want to contribute because they are part of the economy
Since they don't they don't get loans and they don't get help and this is what you can do to achieve that
None
We are going to work so that we contribute and don't hurt the system
None
But I think that as long as there's no control,  there are many of them that are making the system break
It's terrible because even if they want to contribute they can't. They are part of the economy so we should solve that but they don't.
That's the problem of social services so, the other part of the people that are in the system, they do pay and I mean, they do contribute
As a whole, I see that I see it as a big cake in which most of the system is broke because they can't finish fixing the problem so that the people
Everybody starts contributing notwithstanding the status that they have as they are part of the economy system and that's the problem.
In the long run, I've always wondered if the social system or the social services system is compatible with a liberal or capitalist economy as this one.
None
Because I think it is all related to productivity.
That's it
No, I have heard a lot of complaints, or claims of people who lives, who prefers. let's say since this stereotype is often generated, they prefer not to work because they prefer to live on the social system
Rather than seeing it as a problem of the person, I think it is rather a thermometer of a serious social problem here. W are talking about
Serious
People, often from the afro American community, who were for a long time, whose right equity was not granted until quite recently in this country
None
It's too easy to find an answer of this kind and attribute it to a particular individual or a race
Exactly
What strategies or mechanisms were stated for this not to happen? I can't see it. I am living in the Washington DC area.
I don't see that any change is generated from the school, no
Exactly, the same case you mentioned about the hamburger. I think it is a problem of the structure existing. It's like if the necessary controls were missing, because there are the campaigns
There is the campaign. There is the planning. There is something in the machinery. There must be a nutritional system.
If we don't have the budget, we only have budget to give them a meat hamburger or give them whatever, but we can't give them a really good nutritional program, for instance
Let's study or let's see how to ask for something from the school district.
To solve this problem, then we go back to the assistance problem you mentioned, those who always want to live on the government, the government is my dad, I would agree with you
The think that the government should be daddy government, and they don't want to work, but let's go back to the case of the control, whether a person should be given the aids,
And be checked, controlled, how? Well, how for instance the gas companies do, they have programs of help for people who can't pay gas, you know?
None
They accept a flexible payment, etcetera, what do they do? they give this support for a limited time peirod
How do they control it? They make you sign the papers again.
Honey
Hi, I'm Manuel
Nice to meet you, Honey
What's up?
The healthcare system in the United States should mimic who?
Yes, that's the subject, the thing about whether it should resemble the European one or help should be restricted?
Help should be restricted.
Restricted, suppressed or controlled
Restricted, I'm sorry, but if they restrict it ore, no one will be able to qualify
What did you say?
Speed restrictions are going.
None
It was known the system was there to help the people that
None
The way it is in the United States right now, people that really need it don't qualify
Surely, the truth is that i don't know much about the subject
Unfortunately for me, I do
None
Because
Because I'm not american, so
In the United States, benefits were much easier to qualify for.
None
Not they need a number of things, for example you can't go and say that you live in a place, your neighbor has to write letters saying that yes, that you live there
That yes, that you don't have a job, that you have to go where a neighbor.
None
To tell your private life, to humiliate yourself
Yeah
After you get a little bit of help and I'm a single mother
None
I was pregnant and already had two sons. I received a thirty-five dollar coupon for my son who was not yet born and a forty dollar coupon for the one who came with me.
Some additional twenty dollars for me so for three people, like one hundred and fifty food dollars in the United States
Of Foodstamps
Yes
They didn't give for each one.
No, for each one they gave, but a portion
None
For the one who wasn't born they say thirty dollars a month
None
This was the food that they supposed that I as pregnant spent thirty five dollars a month for the one who wasn't both, and the one who was here, forty five dollars
Good !
Do you expect me to survive on fifty dollars?
None
How can that be, if I spend one hundred and fifty dollars per week?
It is possible that they spend it so fast because it's not a lot of money.
Food here is expensive.
None
Food here is not cheap.  You ahve to pay taxes over what you are already paying
Yes
Do you understand? If the price is seven dollars,  it's seven dollars plus tax
Plus the seven, not sure, it is that way
I don't know how it is in Europe but here it's ridiculous, it's the same thing with the health insurance.
It has nothing to do with how it is here in the United States.
I don't know which are the things that they use for, you know.
The medical attention is better, no
It's ridiculous.
Sure, medical attention you can go to any place
You go to a doctor
You don't have to pay for it
Not here
And they accept the health insurance provided by the State
No here the state's insurance basically nobody wants to accept it because it takes years
None
For the state you know, to pay the doctors, so the doctors don't want to take the state's insurance.
Here the doctors are also very bad, very unnatural
Yes, well what happens is that the government
But they never see anyone
Exactly. They prefer to stop earning rather than take care of you
Because here every time that I've gone to a medical center, the nurse wants to take care of me.  The technician wants to take care of me.  I tell them I'm paying with my insurance so that a doctor takes care of me.
No
I don't want a technician to take care of me
Here they want to send you a nurse
Not a technician
Exactly, here is the same. Here they send you, and you know already the doctors don't take care of you. Who ends up taking care of you is the nurse
Sure that's bad, not sure because a medical consultation
Who took a course a little more advanced
Medical, right of medical of doctor that has to see, not a consultation of
No, here you have to specify that you want
None
To see a doctor, not to put you to see a nurse and you stay with whatever comes here. I didn't come to see a nurse, I came to see the doctor.
Sure
Everything is a specialty your general doctor or the head to foot one can't do anything
Yes
That one is just there in case you get a cold
None
If you have anything else, you have to go to the specialist then the specialist doesn't want to get the state insurance
Yes
To see the specialist is so much then you submit it so they reimburse you, if I had if I had money to pay the doctor
I wouldn't have to request the state's insurance
Sure
That then for them to reimburse me is a mess and each year they cut more funds
Yes, probably.
I feel sad about the old people
None
Majority of the people they take out of your check. I'm working and they take from me for the medicare.
For the income tax
None
That supposedly when you get to be old you have already prepaid all that
Sure and they don't give you,  no
No and when you get to be old they want and they cut half of the funds.
No
You know that it doesn't make sense because is something that is free
None
That's something that you have already prepaid
No they dont pay it
But they are not there when you go
None
When you go and are going to use it, either you don't qualify or require so much to qualify that you know one gives up at the end and better
Unless I'm dying, I don't go
None
You know that
Yes well the, the attention is not good at all, there's not much help, no
No, ithey have made it so hard because many people have abused the system, I also understand that
They want to discourage you, one has to demand so they can give you
Many people have abused the system, but they can't pay the innocent for the sins of the guilty.  They don't see it like that.  Here the eldery, the medicine are prohibitive.
None
A pill comes out to one hundred eighty dollars
Yes, they are expensive.
That a person that, you know needs these medicines to live, like a poor man who's retired, that has no income, that the income is six hundred dollars a month
None
Say that a pill will cost him one hundred thirty dollars
It doesn't die no
For that it will die
Sure
That is where they've taken all the money from the check
None
It's covering it
There aren't many generic medicines here
It doesn't even matter if they are generic, I'm telling you that it's a ridiculous thing.
None
For the old people who are the ones that really need this plan it covers the medical insurance but not the medicine
Look then the same as nothing
Then what are they in, because if you go to the doctor you come out with a prescription
Sure if you don't have health insurance, if you don't have the medicine you don't get cured
It doesn't do this man any good to go exactly you went so they would tell you what's wrong with you, what it is you need to get cured but you don't have the money to do it
What good is it for, not for.
You know that I don't understand the logic of the people that are in charge of the funds but they have funds for all the other things
Yes, I think it has to do with the business of the laboratories, they don't want to make cheap medicine.
That's one, my problem is that the United States has funds for what they want
None
One has funds to go to a war but doesn't have funds to cover the medicines of the elderly
Yes, how much money have they spent and will continue to spend?
What are the priorities?
None
In reality I don't care what they are doing in the country over there
Sure, it's not this country's problem. No, unfortunately they have a politic of harming its own people or don't care about the poor.
Unless they are in mine you know but they don't take care of the ones they have to take care in the land here
Sure
You know is something that one stays with the mouth on the floor. You are going to tell me that there's ninety billion to send to rebuild Iraq that we went and bombed them to start.
None
You are going to tell me that there are no funds in the state to cover the medicine of so many people that need it.
None
It doesn't have logical sense.
You are right
That the priority is obviously what the government wants
Sure that if
They can't argue that there are no funds when they have a war
None
Stop the war and put the funds where you have to put them
Yes, because they say it's done harm to this country to go there, that it has spent a lot.
No this war has finished with a
Yes, it has gone up a lot.
The gas is prohibitive, the fuel and energy went up
I've seen that since I have been here, it has decreased to two twenty or two thirty
We are now paying about the same, two eighty-nine per gallon
Two years ago the price was one dollar
A dollar and fifteen cents
It doesn't make any sense.
And there haven't been hurricanes and it's still up again, no hurricanes so, why is the price increasing again
They've increased the prices and are going to war to get cheap gas
Three times more expensive of what I've seen it in my life
To profit
The only ones that are making money are the oil companies.
None
They are going to say that I used to know that when there were hurricanes, they struck some towers but there are no hurricanes in January
No, that's so true
And the gas prices are increasing, so, I don't understand. We have good things but
There's so much injustice
There are some things that you just look at them and they make no sense, for example the medical plans that are so prohibitive.
Sure, considering the fact that
A family insurance
Yeah, you think that the country is so rich, because they really have resources, there shouldn't be so many needs
One
Because they have a way to cover them and take care of them but
The one who's living outside sees it that way, the one who's here
None
To cover me and my family
None
The insurance is almost 500 dollars a month
Sure
From where? If my salary
None
I don't earn that in a week
You see
How am i supposed to pay for a monthly payment in a medical insurance that's more than what i earn in a week?
With all the exorbitant expenses that you have here
None
The rent is prohibitive, the gas is prohibitive, forget about a car
Yes, sure, everybody
I take care of them so that you can go to work
Yes, that's true
I know I said it once, for what I spend, I should stay at home, it's cheaper because my income is not equal, what I have to pay as alimony, thank God that I have one in college
Yes, yes.
When there were two to care for, the girl was charging me one hundred seventy five a week
Yeah sure
In a month that's almost seven hundred dollars
Yes and it's that to pick them up it'll cost you like eight, eight hundred
Half of what I earn in a week goes towards caring for the girl.
That's true
I have to spend on gas so I can get to work and then health insurance. The majority of companies do offer health insurance
You see
It's awful what mine is offering but they take eight hundred out of my check. What is the part they covering, one hundred dollars?
You know what I don't understand? I would want to give to the hospitals here, but they are prohibitively expensive.
Yes it's very expensive here, health insurance, and they don't cover hardly anything
And the emergency room
I also have insurance that costs me about every five, six months it costs like one thousand two hundred but it hardly covers anything
Here
For just one person
Emergency room; it's if you even step foot in the emergency room
None
I went because I had gastritis
None
Emergency room
Luca
Hello
Yes
Hello, how are you?  My name is Mauricio.
How is it going? My name is Luca, how are you?
How are you?
Where are you calling from?
I'm in Charlotte
Where is it?
North Carolina United States
How's the climate?
Awesome
Yes
Tropical.
Really good, what is not cold?
No, it's not cold
None
Yes. It's cold. We're supposed to be in winter
Yes
Today is good but hot.
I'm in Boston
Boston, that's sweet.  Cool.
Yes, it's a little bit colder here
I can imagine that it is good.
Yes, and how
The subject, the subject's good, right?
Yes, how long have you been living in the United States?
I've been here for a year
Oh, and, where are you from?
I'm Columbian
Right, and did you live in Colombia earlier or were you in another country?
I was in Colombia
Right, and, are you clear on the matter of social services and all that?
Exactly, i have experience because I'm in a process with immigration here
Yes that's correct.
It turns out I'm legally here, i have a work permit and all but, i got it, and my wife hasn't gotten it, you know how it is here, we both have to work
Yes, but, the, what, do you have the green card?
No, I'm in the process of seeking political asylum. I
Wow
So, it turns out i have my wife and three children
And, are you legal?
And, yes, all of us are under,  the petition that we have, we are in a process
Yes
And I already have a work permit, my wife is waiting for it to arrive, it should've arrived with mine
Yes
But, it hasn't arrived. I think it's an excellent country, but I think they should get better organized, as far as the service.
Yes
I've had the need to take my kids to the doctor
Yes
The only way to take them to the doctor is paying and I don't have the money
None
Or that it's something urgent, for example
Yes
That he's seven years old and the teeth are coming out but the milk teeth, the first ones, are not falling, so they are coming out in back of the others
None
And, is
Sure
To me I find it worrisome because, in the future we are going to have to go to a very costly treatment here
Sure, because the dentists are equally expensive, orthodo
Yes, sure
Orthodontics, Imagine, it must be more expensive
Yes, exactly, and the girl is worried about her little teeth.
Poor baby
It hurts, but it is not an emergency
Yes
I haven't been able to take her because, we don't have, we don't have a doctor.
Don't you have insurance?
No, I don't have healthcare insurance
She does have a social security number right?
Only myself
That
I'm the one that has the job permit so I'm the only one that has.
Can't they give your daughters a social security number?
No, not until we get the authorization that we have requested
None
It has delayed everything, we are within the legal immigration parameters, we haven't done anything but way for the law, but they should have in this case
Sure
Take that into consideration because I have three daughters and my case is
Yes, can't you contact a human rights organization? for example,
We've done, which one
None
We've done anything
And it's international
The only thing Social Services told us was
You have to wait
They don't have the social urgency
Yes
Not even social, they told me a, while there's no urgency, we can't apply
None
And we can't apply for help because
Because you don't cover you the needs.
We're not within the status
Sure
Do you know what i mean?, but, but I'm not illegal
Yes
It's absurd to me, right?, i mean, I'm in a situation i find absurd
Are you working?
I'm working but not my wife because she doesn't have a permit
Yes
We have three children
None
If she would work, getting something part time or something like that
The oldest is five or do you have others older?
No, they are eight.  No, how's that?  Ten, eight and six
And the other girls, the, do the older ones go to school?
So we all go, they all go to school
Is the school private or free?
No, that's free and
None
And no, they give them breakfast and lunch thank God
None
Because what I earn is barely enough to feed us
Sure, yes
I know there's people that get a lot of benefits, for example, Cubans
Yes
That's something special for them.
Can't you apply for a special scholarship?, because they also have political asylum
Yes
None.
I don't have political asylum yet.
I understand
They haven't said no
Right
They haven't said yes, but I'm in the process
None
So it's just that while I wait to see what's happening
Sure, right?
My girl has
Yes, yes, yes, I understand.
Teeth on the back and on the front
None
And I don't know what'll happen while I wait
Yes, and how long ago did your wife apply to get her permit?
In, no, the thing is that, the permit, she we applyed for the same documents, all of them
Yes
She had to, the, what we expected was to get them all at the same time, because we have done all our paperwork at the same time
Sure
Let's just call it a package
Yes
All my stuff came, and i said, thank god it was mine
None
Cause I needed to work
Sure
We have been waiting for the asylum resolution for a year and we need other things as well.
Yes
We have, immigration documents, we have authorization to be here, I have a work permit
Yes. Sure.
We are doing the legal way through a legal process.
Sure, but it's so slow, this subject
And I say, well, they should think about, our, situation, while we wait
None
Above all, the medical stuff, the children
Is it expensive? yes
Thank God we haven't had an emergency because I know that in an emergency we would still get help, right?
Sure
This non-urgent, but delicate issue is about the girl.
Yes, sure
When she, it hurts
Poor baby
When she drinks something it hurts her
And are you giving it some sort of analgesic?
Yeah, when it hurts a lot we give it, we give it Tylenol or something
Yes
So, I think that, regarding the service, they should look after the people that's also in a process
Right
I say that because of me
This is right
Not because I'm making it up, i have lived it, i'm living it
Yes
About the rest, i think that, when they give this help, i think it's an excellent help
None
Give medical services to the people, it's really good
Yes
I don't have any complaints except for my
The health
My experience, i understand I'm also on hold
Yes
I'm here now and i haven't done anything against the, against the law
Yes, and, is North Carolina, is the state expensive?, i mean the rent
No, it's good, it's good
None
It's not so expensive
None
It's not so expensive
And are the clothes for the boys expensive?
More or less, i get it second hand
Yes
On these army warehouses or so i get
Yes
It's cheap
None
So, as far as my experience, well, that's been it
Sure
But I know people that get very good help
None
Excellent help
Yeah, i really don't, i have no experience with social security because i never needed it, i mean, we came here in March
Yes
We're
Yes
Temporarily here, not the way we were.
Yeah, and, where are you from?
We are from Argentina
That's good, and, how long?
And,
Are you going to be here?
We're going to be here for three years more or less
Oh yea
We have to, my husband is, he's doing a, like a research
Yes
I'm trying to re-validate my title
Yeah, that's good
Yeah, so i can work a little as, as, I'm a veterinarian
Yea. That's good.
Yeah, it's hard, re-validatrion is very expensive and I don't think there are any kind of social services there to help
Yeah,  sure.
It's very expensive
We have applied, but they have always told us the same, right?, we're not under the status
Yes
We have this situation and now I have to look somewhere else to do something, and I have to look for a plan, even if it's fragmented, that
None
Whether it's by quotas, because the girl doesn't, she's got some problem with her little teeth
Sure, no, sure
Now, it's also nothing worth lying for to say she's delicate.
That it's urgent
Not even on urgency, because they won't see her and i won't tell my
Sure, no
No
No, if he/she wants to stay here for long
We haven't had any bitter moments.
Yes
Regarding social services
None
I think it's good
None
I think everything this country has is really good
Do your kids speak English well?
And well organized, but, me?
Your children
My children do, yeah, they're speaking, yes
Yes, they speak English to you?
Not me. They do, sometimes
Yes
Sometimes to trick their dad, to show off, they are happy here
Your wife how is she?
They are happy.  My wife is also happy because we are alive from Colombia
None
We left because of threats.
Wow
Any hard situation that we go through we always thank god we are alive and together
Yes
We haven't stopped eating, we haven't stopped having a roof
Yes
Sure, it's not easy for one to let go of what you had and used to do in Columbia. But, a life is worth more.
Sure,no of course
And the family is together
Sure
I think that soon everything will be resolved.
And where are you from, from Medellin?
No, I was in a city south of Colombia called Neibas
None
To the south of Bogota
Things are very bad with all of that guerrilla?
With the guerrilla it is a quite guerrilla area, red zone
None
Hello, how are you. I am Elena. Where are you calling from?
Hello yes I am Eliana Whom am I talking with? from Boston
From Boston look how nice, I have never been I am calling, I am talking from Vancouver
Good lets say with cold too
More than cold it rains it is near the west coast and what we have is rain
Look
Is there
None
None
We are having awesome days, nothing of snow
None
Today we had six degrees like never.
Very good and where are you from? Argentina
Yes and You?
I where do you think I am from with this accent
What?
Where do you think I am with this accent
Keep talking
Say ashtray
Spain
Sure
It's the first time I've spoke with a European, always with Latinos
It shouldn't have taken too much, ideally they shouldn't be aware of this program
Sure I came speaking with all Latinos and I say that how many where it will sure I didn't see anyone from Guatemala, not even from Puerto Rico, nothing of anybody like we say
You've been living for many years now in the United States?
No, just a year
Only a year, that's very short and how's it going, how do you like it?
Right now this moment in my life I enjoy
Yes
But to live here for the rest of my life, no
Sure yeah look today theme is is is, the positives of social welfare, I don't know how you you, I've lived in the United States and I have seen a little bit bit you how how do you think that
How long have you been living here
I've lived here now I've been living in Canada almost like for three years I lived in the United States for four years on the West coast in California
None
But we go a lot. I go almost every time that I can, right? to San Francisco because I like it a lot
Sure that's good but I see it like this
None
Look it's only been a little bit that I've been
None
And my country is terrible but on one hand I see it better
Sure
I feel that a lot of money is being spent in things that shouldn't be, and they are leaving all the other things behind.
None
Education, health and the whole social system in here
None
Right? Why spend so much money in wars and there are a lot of illiterate persons and more poverty here
Yes , I remember that when I used to live there. I've seen that they don't have a system, I mean, I don't know, I've never lived anywhere else.
In the United States, but in California, San Francisco is a city that has a help system
If you don't have the resources they help you, it's something that I really don't like a lot coming from Argentina
You have doctors for example, isn't it, the doctor
Oh well the health system is pretty bad in here
Sure, oh.
No? hello
Yes, I'm sorry you were speaking and I didn't want to interrupt you
No, the health system here is not that much better as the one in Argentina or in Buenos Aires, the city where I live
Yes, I'm
It's so expensive, they charge huge amounts. No, I feel better cared for in Argentina
Yes, I have, one of my friends, I mean, I've lived here in Vancouver, right? I've been here for three years
They said that in Canada it is different than in the United States but, you still have to pay for the doctor, they don't just give it to you, if you are not working
You don't have access to it.
None
I don't know, I thought that it was so different in that sense and is not at all, I mean here you have to pay it, what happens is that instead of costing you
None
Two hundred or three hundred dollars well here.  Perhaps it cost you one hundred dollars, right?
Sure.
Is not so different is very similar to the United States and of course is not similar is not similar at all to Europe that you
Their work pays for your unemployment and also for your doctor, right?
Yes, I was teaching
None
In Buenos Aires and had a social work for teaching let's say super.
None
Very state, when I was little through my parents I went to a private one but later when I started with my job what they gave me was the state one
Sure, yes
At the end of the day it was really good because I could go to the school hospital that are the teachers of the kids that study medicine
None
They would take care of me who was that was getting paid a low salary
Yes
And then anyone can go the public hospital because it's for the people
Yes
One sometimes chooses if you have a little bit of money and a private one in Argentina, because everything is faster.
None
But if you don't have money, you wait
None
A month or two months and you get turns
Sure, you are placed in a waiting list
It's like that even with the best neurologist, in the end
Yes, and so you work in the United States? Are you a teacher
I'd love to but my English is not that good yet.
None
Right now I'm doing a post doctorate.
A doctorate in what?
In genetics
What did you study then?
How?
What did you study in Argentina?
I'm a biochemist and then
None
I'm a researcher, I started to do some research and my thesis is in genetics and I came here to study a post doctorate.
That's great, I mean, that's good but sure, how long are you staying here?
I think that I'll stay here for three years. I've been here for one.
Well
What happens is that I would like to return to my country, but I'm specializing here more and that specialty hardly exists there.
Sure and you know I mean do you have you know people, you have friends in?
But
In Boston I mean it has been easy, since is the city
And the truth that well the climate is horrible
Yes
At four in the afternoon it gets dark, is very cold, and that I wait.  One can manage with subways everywhere.  You don't need to have a car.
Yes
Here at one or two in the morning is not like Spain, Argentina that one can go out at night until six in the morning
None
But one can manage alone without the need of a car because it's like a city of schools here, there's like  seventy universities, there's Harvard
None
None
Is a city of like young students
They have told me that is very beautiful right?
Yes is very beautiful, they say it looks like Europe.
Yes, it looks like Europe
When they say that, it looks like Europe.
You know have American friends or
Americans
So you can't hear the voice, are you on the phone, the voice is muted.
Yes I don't have a good signal in this house
Yes now I hear you
The truth is that I do not have many American friends but foreign people who need a family make their own family.
Of course
And what do you do?
I came here because my husband is from here and we got married.
Particularly is not that I do not like it, I do not like Vancouver for the same so I donÂ´t like it because it is very sad, it rains a lot
Here what you say, at four, half past four it gets dark and rains, we have had twenty one so twenty one days raining steadly
Is not that terrible
Yes and very boring so it is a beautiful place for people who like open spaces, the mountains, blah, blah, blah, blah.
I like it, but I do not like the culture.  I like to have access to a series of
Cultural facilities that there are not here right?
Here it is, full in that sense, seminars and lectures everywhere, in each neighborhood and
Yes, they don't like it there. They like nature, bicyles but there's very little culture, so there are some places where you can
It is in Montreal but there is also cold then not particularly it is not a place I like and besides that the level of work is
Here in the United States that is different, right? You can find a job here. You are asked for a group of requirements that you must have what they call Canadian experience
If you do not have experience you cannot find a job and there are many people here with careers engineers, doctors and they cannot exercise and are people
That come from their countries and I have friends from Argentina and  one, I think he studied Biology
Yes
He has been here for fourteen years and all he achieved was working as a, computer re-placer, moving boxes
I can't believe it, I didn't know
Yes, it's just that he was quite old when he came, he was almost forty-nine or fifty, right? I think
Sure
But no, I may be wrong, he might have come with forty-some
Yes
He couldn't speak in English, but in fourteen years all he had been able to achieve was that you have some bad times here
In the first years, it's not like in the United States where if you are good enough. Here
Sure
There is a big protection, specially from the professional associations, engineers association, lawyers association, medical association
None
Who don't let people, they just tell them your title is not good so you have to study your career again
Who would study back his medical career in a country you don't know
No
You say a lot of people are living here but they work in pizzerias and they may be computer programmers, so it's hard
It's not like in the United States bu speaking Spanish is worthless
None
Thew, ehh, the Hispanic population is very small, there are much more asians, specially in the eats coast
None
Yeah, there are just too much.
Hello?
Hello, what's up?  My name is Karina.
Hello, what's up? My name is Leticia.
How are you?
Where are you calling from?
I'm calling from Washington, D.C.
None
Are
I'm from Philadelphia.
Where
We are close.
Well, not so far away, sure. About two hours away, isn't it? No, oh
Yes, two and a half hours, pretty close.
Oh, really well.
Where are you from?
I think you have an accent similar to Argentina's, I mean, that's why I feel like when I call home.
Me too. No, it sounded similar to me too that's why
Look, are you
I wonder
Well, I'm glad that I got to talk to a fellow countrywoman. we have to speak about the social security system, right? But, here in the United States the truth is that I don't really know.
How it works, neither the European one.
Sure.
None
How long have you been here?
Yes, for a long time, I mean, this is my fifth year
That's a lot.
The only relationship that I have with the social security system is related with social work.
Sure.
I have one play that is cheap, I believe that all my complains have to do with that.
What do you have?
I don't know, it's something called permanent Kaiser
None
Have you been here a long time?
No, just eight months.
Oh no. You have just,
Yes, I mean, what do I know, I don't even know how to use the social services yet
I'm still in a cultural shock because it takes some time to get used to this, right?
Social work, it is expensive
You don't have a social work, I mean, I don't know.
Yes, I have, I do but no.
Don't you use it?
I haven't yet.
I haven't used it a lot, I'm a student at the University, no?
Yes.
We don't have the much money, but it is mandatory to have social security
Sure
We took the cheapest one, almost everyone does and the problem that I see with that is that's a different system than the one that we have in Argentina, they have a general doctor.
Sure
And you can go with him and you have a medical card
No.
For example, if you need an ophthalmologist or a gynecologist.
No, as is.
It's centralized so, you first have to go to this doctor, this person that in general, it takes a lot of time for you to be referred to a specialist.
Sure.
I don't know why, I mean, so, it's more bureaucratic. And, the truth is that it's pretty expensive.
Of course, yes if you want to.
None
You can pick your doctor, you have to pay more, There are social services that are like that
Yes that's why I'm telling you, I mean, it depends on how much are you willing to pay each month, but most of them are centralized.
Sure.
None
Yes. Yes.
Like for little things, any rubbish, you want to go, I don't know a dermatologist.
Yes
For those things that are not emergencies, they put up more barriers. But when there's something like a surgery, it sure saves you. Because,
And, yes
If you would have to pay, would be very expensive.
No, yes. How things are, it is already itself, the social security is very expensive
None
If one is not covered someone like an employer, we will pay everything. It's more expensive that we
Sure, here at the university. Are you a student?
No, I work at the university, but I'm not a student.
They don't pay part of your social security, why?
Yes
In my case it's like that.  They pay a part and we have to put the
Yes
The rest, and it depends which one you want, it is more expensive or cheaper. Right?
Of course, but the I mean, I also I have to pay am amount, bu the amount I have to pay, is minimum compared to the cost of the social security
Sure, me too. I don't even want to think about
It's very expensive. So, it can be more than three hundred dollars per month, a cheap one.
Wow. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Honestly, I didn't find out too much. But, yes, is an issue. Right? I don't know how other people do it. Because since I move in the students' circuit
But I think there's a bunch of people that don't have social work.
Yes.
Near where I live, for example, there's a Latin American youth center, or something like that,
Yes.
That, they have a place called the town's clinic, that functions kind of like a hospital.
Sure.
That help especially the Latin immigrants that they know don't have
Yes, there's no social work, truthfully, is, is all an issue in this country. For me, is a system that I don't like at all.
I don't know if there are public hospitals. I don't think so
I think there are. Here, at least in Philadelphia, they told me that there is an area where there's a public hospital. But,
Ah, good?
Also, the appointments are for any year
Sure, there aren't that many
I don't know, I wouldn't like to be without social work.
Sure.
What do you study?
I understand. I study literature, on top of that, there's not much scope, but yes. I'm happy. I mean,
Sure,
I'm finishing, this is my last year. I'm wrigting the thesis. Then, I don't know what I'm going to do. Do you plan on staying a long time?
The truth is that I came with my husband with a three year visa, I don't know
Sure.
If we can stretch it more, but I also don't know if I'll want to. I mean,
Yes.
Is all a combination.
One starts getting accustomed. I also started the master's, which was for two years, then I stayed to do the doctorate,
Yes.
One starts speaking on the way.
Are you from Buenos Aires?
I'm from Buenos Aires, a part of San Martin

How crazy.
How strange. right?
Do you know how many Argentinians are there in Washington?
I'm friends with a couple, Dolores and Mariano, who are from San Isidro, but they've been here a bunch of years.
No. The others have been leaving already. Because some were from Cordoba, and I don't know?
Sure,
That people go and come, See? That is also a, why one starts to also want to stay because you know people
Yes
And you feel a little content, but, the people also move. Then,
Yes. Yes. Yes. A bunch.
You don't know what to do.
Yes.
Did you meet any Argentinians?
Since I've been here, I must have met fifty.
How nice.
A bunch.  I'm not saying that I always see them all, not at all.  I met many, and I don't see them often.  But, some. Yes.
You see, that's good
I suppose that there must be more of them in Washington. I don't know.
Well, there's a group that gets together and have barbecues, what do I know? I'm going, I'll get it by email but I'm talking about the ones that are close to me, the ones that go to school with me.
Sure.
We are just a bunch, literature.
Sure
Popular career, so I don't know.
Yes.
I don't know, and the problem for the, for this Spanish thing, I have just started getting these calls, I don't, no
I have no experience I mean, I just, this is my second call, kind of, so, I have no idea.
I think I'm halfway through them, the calls.
I see. I don't know how they do it with the facts or the statistics.
I believe that, I think that I'll get an email with, updating me on how we are doing
That's nice.
Giving me a more information because I haven't been told much so far
Yes, I can't compare the subjects or anything, for example, this one about health, I mean, the social security does it mean the social works or also the pensions and all of that?
I don't know, maybe, it's a
An excuse.
It's of help, but you don't really need to speak about the subject.
That's good because I wouldn't have known what to say
Yes, from what I understand,  they tell you because, there, you don't know what to talk about,
Sure.
They throw you a topic, but no I think that
No
They study the language, no
From us they will
No, the opinions
They will realize that we got emotional for finding a person of the same culture
Yes, and also from San Martin, I can't believe it.

Ah, I'm thirty one.
We must have crossed. I don't know what is it called? the library.

Probably
It would go more to but
Sure, look at you.
Yes, but how crazy.
And how? Impossible. No. See how we ended up in the same place? Yes.
Yes, truth.
Is a lot
Have you seen much of the United States since being here?
Look, at first, I mean, it was quite bad, in the sense that I came here alone, in other words
None
Is harder, I think. Then, I had a very hard time adapting
To study
To do the master's. Then, nothing, I wanted to return at all cost, I was a little bit bad.
Yes.
But, later, I started getting used to it, and as soon as I got a little stabilized, I tried to travel. See? more than anything, looking for conferences,
None
That would help me to do something of mine, and at the same time in some city that I would like. Then,
Sure.
I went to New Orleans before that
Ah, how nice.
There was Katrina. It is a very beautiful city; I don't know how it is now, because this was terrible. Speaking of the help  of
Yes, yes, yes, is quite bad, I think.  Yes, I don't know if I'll go there now, maybe after a while.
No, you have to wait a while. But, it's very beautiful and is very different to other cities of the United States.
Yes.
Later I was in Pittsburgh, because I found out to be closer to Philadelphia. Right?
Yes, I know Pittsburgh is near here. I have family that lives there.
Look at that, I wanted to do the doctorate in the university. I was going to transfer, but then I changed my mind and I stayed in the same one.
You like Washington?
I went to know the city. I like Washington a lot, yes. Because I got to know it little by little, I became fond of it. See?
Yes.
You already have the neighborhoods you like, or the cafes or wherever you always go.
Sure.
The people that I met here, right?
Yes, logical.
Later, What other one do I know? I don't have many. Let's see. To which other one did I go? I went to Boston, now that I remember, which is also very beautiful. Because I went to do a seminar there during one summer.
Yes.
I liked it a lot. It's quite expensive, that's the only thing.
Yes
New York, which I try to visit every now and then, may also have those Chinese buses that are so cheap.
I go on them it is ten dollars from here and twenty dollars both ways
Sure, so perfect, much cheaper than that.
It's very good
Yes, You must go often, right? Because, since it is such a big city, I
Sure
The first time it overwhelmed me, but then I started feeling comfortable with it.
Yes, it overwhelms you
After being there a couple times. I didn't travel a lot.  I went to visit  my sister who is living in El Paso, in the border with Ciudad Juarez.

When they listen to that, they won't understand anything.
What does it matter?
The language this people speak.
What a coincidence that we found each other on the phone.
Poor Cuco.
Poor Cuco, I wonder who he's talking to.
Yes nothing, he probably talked to someone. What happens is that Carla was going to talk to Cuco, and, I called and said, no, well let's talk
I was going to call you, to tell you that after, if you wanted to talk with Carla.
None
What can you do? I'm on Marcelo's phone, so this is one more number.
That's good.
None
Are you having a good time?
Yes,
Well, I'm glad.
What was I going to tell you?
What?
No, and nothing else. I have nothing else to say. My, my life is kind of boring.
Very boring?
I sent the things.
Yes
None
Any gossip, nothing?
Hello, greetings from John of New York. How are you Marina from Philadelphia?
Hello, this Marina from Philadelphia, it's all good, what about you?
That's great, I'm fine. Where are you from?
I'm from Argentina, yes. Where are you from?
It seemed to me that had an Argentinian accent right from the start. I'm from Cuba.
Yes, I can tell.
How long have you been here? Oh really? Wow, do you miss it? No, I've been here for over forty years. It'll be forty years this year.
I'm learnign to identify the different accents now that I'm here in the United States since a year ago.  And you? wow
And, what's the name and do you miss Argentina?
Yes, I miss it a lot, no, Mar del Plata, it's
Where is that? The capital? I was in Mar del Plata in the Alean avenue which is pretty popular isn't it?
Yes, really?  Sure!  Especially during the summer, it's quite popular, yes.
Yes, I was there in the summer, about fifteen years ago, what do you think about the subject. Couples that break up
We must have made a mistake, I believe that it's something personal or a decision of each couple, some find it easier to break up with someone
Mmhm, yes, mmhm, yes
I don't know, I struggled with that a lot, even when I really wanted to break up with someone, I had a lot of problems doing it, I really didn't like to make someone suffer or whatever, I do think it's a difficult situation.
Yes, it depends, I think that if they make a huge mistake, then it should be easier or if she finds him in bed with another woman, it should be easy.
Sure, that's easy
When it's not like that, when it's because the love is gone or, it seems to me it's a bit difficult
Sure, you are right.
Also, if they have been living together for many years it is also difficult
Yes, and if there are children it must be even more difficult
Sons, forget it, that's completely different, but when you live together for many years,  you get used to the defects of the other and often, there is a saying that is better,
What is known is bad, that is good to know
Imagine you say alright I know the defects of this one. What if I find anohter one and he is worse? You say, alright I'll keep with the first one because I know the defects and can handle them.
Sure, and convenience too, right? You have the home mounted, your routine, you go along, I don't know
Yes. That happens. That happened to me; I was married to an Argentinean
It's not nice, but it happens, I know it
Yes, I have a son thirteen years old who is now with me, this weekend, but it has been a bloody battle because
She didn't want to let him, she wants to punish me because things didn't turn out fine and we were married for nine years
None
I saw that love was already over but I tried, I told her what she wanted to hear, but she, she already had me, because we were married she thought she had me
For ever
Yes, unfortunately it has been very hard and difficult, because she has used the child to try to punish me
That's disgusting, no, to me that is, I guess when you are inside the situation you don't realize and you do it, I don't know, it must be, we shouldn't judge people
Yes, no, right
You have act right, because the poor child has no fault, he loves his mom and loves his dad, and that you two can't work as a couple doesn't mean that
Yes, I have tried, I've had to fight hard to achieve the time I have him with me, every Tuesday and every Friday
None
Every two weeks, on weekend yes the next one no, I have him almost all of the time, it is a miracle that he is, he is upright
She puts a lot of garbage in his head and thank God he has come out straight and knows
Sure
He is on the right path, but on the inside he has a lot of wounds because of all that he has been through.
Yes and has it been a lot of years that you separated
Yes it has already been eight years, but believe me, up till December I was still in court because every time
None
Every time that she feels like it she takes me to court for things that she invents. She suffers unfortunately, from bipolar. I don't know if you have
Yes, I don'n know what it is.
None
Changes in the mood, like that
Yes she changes, yes she gets depressed then she gets very excited she was, was under medication already for like fifteen years she's been under medication
None
That also I think that contributed to that because at the beginning one realizes and but already with the years it seems that disease develops more
And well ah yes, that has been one of the parts that has affected us a lot
As a couple, sure.
To all of us and I've tried but every time I try to be nice or try to have a dialogue with her
Yes, that's so bad
She waits for the moment to hit me, no and then that has been very hard and it hasn't been hard because we are already divorced and all but it has been hard because she has not wanted
To move forward and I pray to God to give her a good man so that she's calm and doesn't bother me anymore
Sure
When I got married, I have a two and a half year old daughter and we are so happy, the kid and my current wife
The boy is, she's with him since he was six years old and she treats him like he was his own.
That's nice
She says I am not his mother, but I love him as if I were his mom'.  They get along fine.
That's so sweet, isn't it?
Yes, I honestly have had to really make an effort and he has too, he's good to my daughter, when she was born he and my wife
Would spend the whole night by her side because I had to rest since I work and they would stay up all night and on the next day I'd find the three of them sleeping in the same bed and with the baby between them and
None
Thank God, I've worked so hard.  I've made so many sacrifices and
It's hard.
And efforts because it's been hard. What made you go to Philadelphia?
I came here to work, I actually study biology in Argentina.
Yes
I had the opportunity to get a job for two or three years in here so we came here
That's nice, yes, Philadelphia is obviously not like New York, have you been to New York?
Not yet, I'm about an hour away from it and I've been here for a year and I still haven't been there.
Yes, you should go visit and you'd see how much energy that city has.  You should visit the Argentinian neighborhoods
Yes, there are lots of Argentinians and Uruguayans.
There are lots of Argentinians there, yes, oh that's nice.
Yes, the neighborhood has changed a lot.
How is the neighborhood called? Jackson Heights.
Yes Jackson Heights and the wave of Colombians was in the seventies. After that their way of living got better, in the eighties came the Argentinians, Uruguayans, Ecuadorians.
Took the place many of the Colombians went to the outside where there were better houses the neighborhood is not bad it is very good
Are they apartments
But if you improve your way of- economy and then you want something better
Of course
And then there are now all Mexicans in that area, but they're still Argentinian restaurants that have steaks, yes.
How delicious here there are not, here there is not any Argentinian restaurant
Yes it is a miracle because I understand that there is even a Cuban restaurant there, yes, yes
There is a very nice Cuban restaurant, I have not gone but the outside is beautiful. Not Argentinian, there is not Mexican
There are many there are many Mexicans here in Philadelphia I know, someone told me also that
Yes, there were many Cubans too. I know a Cuban guy that worked in the cafe I always go to eat. My husband also worked with a Cuban man.
Yes I work in television so I was working with Univision, Univision has a station there in Philadelphia
Yes
I do many business we are launching a channel right now in Direct TV from Uruguay
See
Latin Television, here in August weÂ´ll launch a channel named MejiCanal that is from Mexico
None
We are planning to launch a Portuguese channel also from Brazil
Look how good, there are not so many Brazilians right
DonÂ´t think that there are a lot, there are a lot because in Miami, in New York
Yes
In New Jersey, the Portuguese have their own town
Look
It is an area and in New York, too. But smaller
None
They are not little groups here and there, but  in New Jersey there are many and in Miami I know there are many too
Look that I have never meet a Brazilian the truth is that you know many Brazilians, they are very funny they are characters
Yes
They are very funny we are very near them like to travel a lot in Argentina we travel a lot to Brazil too, they are people very
Yes, Brazil, I like it a lot. I was there, yes. I liked it a lot too. So Bueno Aires and Mar de Plata only
You were there and what else did you knew in Argentina Mar de Plata and what happens in Mar de Plata beaches compared to Cuba beaches is nothing
Well, I like the atmosphere. What do you call those cabins that are there?
No pictures
The truth is I like it a lot. Have you been in Cuba? The beaches of Cuba are spectacular from what I remember
Because I left it very young, yes a beautiful place and I have not wanted to come back because it is so sad not because it is sad that
It is said that it is beautiful yes yes
Hello, good afternoon.
Hello, Mara
Hello, Mauricio is speaking. How are you?
Good. You?
Very good, thanks.
Good
There was, there was, after the indication.
None
There was a question I didn't understand, that if breaking is what?
If breakin is hard
Okay.
Yes
I understand the topic regarding the breakup of couples
Sure, yes with the age, if when you are older, is easier than when you are young, or the opposite.
Okay
For some reason, sometimes it is easier to break up with your partner.
Yes, as far as the breakup.
This,
That, if one gets married, has to
Yes.
For the whole life
None
Even if there are exceptions.
None
I say about the exceptions, why? Because, nowadays, ouples get married easily, and they divorce even easier.
Totally, I agree, yes.
Then I think it doesn't make sense to get married, promise each other
None
Love for the whole life. In wealth and in poverty, in sickness, in health, in all. What the notary, judge or priest says,
None
Or the pries, or the pastor, whatever,
Yes.
To later easily say no. I mean it's not a game, because there are lives ahead.
None
Starting with the life of each one.
Yes.
Second if there are kids, there is even worse.
If there are kids, yes, for me it is quite complex, the issue.
Sure, yes, and even without having kids, is, is, is hard because there are broken hearts, wounded feelings. I think that, that is a commitment, right? is a commitment
None
I don't agree with it breaking. Now, what does one get with 3\
None
Tomorrow we will need another one
None
That other person will also have problems, because there's no perfect person.
No, that of course yes.
Exactly. is changing the good thing that one had , or the bad, another person will also have that good or bad.
I tell you depends what is the bad thing a person has. if you tell me, excuse me
Yes.
That suppose your husband or your wife has been unfaithful, for example,
Yes, of course.
Or if has has a problem that is violent
Yes, of homosexuality.
Or that he's violent
Yes.
Or of drugs, or of alcoholism
I agree, yes.
It all depends especially if you have kids.
None
Was with someone, I don't know, who's an alcoholic, or that, or that is violent.
It's a problem.
Do I want to give my children a home like that, have them grow up with a father like that? No,
Yes, and with a bad example. That's why I,
Exactly, exactly
I don't agree with that, with some exceptions, for example, the ones that you just mentioned
Sure, yes.
Certainly, because
Yes.
If there's violence. A woman can't, they shouldn't stand to live like that.
Sure, exactly.
A drunk man, or a criminal
Sure.
Or an immoral person, or a cheater.
Absolutely.
No, we are not subject to
Sure.
To live having to carry the other person because the other person is not
Exactly, yes.
We can forgive them.
Well,
There's the option of forgiveness, as long as the other person corrects its path
As long as, being
I'm sorry?
Yes
As long as the other person corrects it's proceedings, right?
Yes
It could have, made a mistake, right?, but, yeah, in case of adultery
Yes, I understand.
Asks forgiveness, and corrects its, its, its proceedings, i think it's worth taking that opportunity
Yes, what do I know?  There's also people that don't, for example.  I don't know if I could forgive that.
Sure, that's why, but it's only a choice.
I don't know if i could forgive
You take it or leave it, the person
No, yeah, No, totally, i concur, i concur, yes, yes
Yes
I don't think I can forgive that sort of
Yeah, it must be hard
It's very serious to me
Yes, it must be hard. But there is people who do
Yes, I respect [them].
For love itself, right?
Yes
For love itself. but, no, I don't agree and I don't share the the idea of a light break up.
Yes
Maybe as far as the old and the young people, I think the older people are more stable.
Yes, totally.
That have been around in life, the experience. True?
Yes.
While the young people no.
Yes, there's more
The young people easily break relationships and they don't care about anything.
Yes
Though, there must be some mature young people. Right?
Yes, is because of the inexperience, the impulsiveness. I believe you must have patience in love.
Yes.
You have to have patience with the other, because we all have flaws.
Exactly, we are not perfect.
Exactly. if one wants to be with someone, you have to cede.
You and I agree that is not easy to break up, it shouldn't be taken lightly, right?
Mm. No, no, no. For me it all depends, but it's not easy at all for to go through breaking up.
Oh no.
I believe it's easy to break up with someone, for example, if you don't love them.
Yes
If someone doesn't love the other person, if they don't care, they break up.
Yes, I agree.
Yes, if you are in love. It's a complex subject
Yes, sure but so, that's where love comes in because, if you are in love, that triggers a lot of things that
None
Takes you to act in a correct way
None
Although we can still fail, right? But,
You do your best
Occasionally, exactly, that's right.
Breaking up, I think that it shouldn't be taken as lightly
Lightly
It's not like,
Yes, it's,
It's not like changing one's clothes.
Yes, I'm sorry. No, exactly. Not at all.
It's not easy
At all. yes, likewise, I mean, one things is to break up a marriage and another thing is to break, for example, I don't know, a courtship
The courtship, of course.
Let's say a short time, right?
Yes, those are two different areas
I think that
The, in the courtship, the people are simply getting to know each other and preparing
Is
For a step ahead.
Exactly. You still haven't committed one hundred percent with the other.
We are getting to know each other.
Exactly.
We  are getting to know each other.
None
And, is a process. I think that  there is the option to break up
None
Without becoming enemies. Do you understand me?
Yes, absolutely. I agree, yes.
Yes, without there being a need for
Yes, because one, sure. Is that one, precisely, because one has a courtship, before getting married, to have the chance of deeply knowing the other person.
To say, yes
None
I am going to really choose this person to share my life with, and then I get married. Figure
Yes
I want to form a family. This person doesn't get along with me.
None
And well, you leave, let's say
Exactly, and, in a good mood, just not
That's it
We are just not made for each other
Exactly, I didn't work out
It is also an opportunity where the relationship turns closer.
None
For instance, I don't like this, I feel like  the other person tries to correct and, and you can go on
So, it is a process of knowledge
Absolutely, yes
Where you can, you can break the engagement
None
Right? who are somehow getting ready for marriage. if they realize during that stage
Right
That aren't, they just break up. But i imagine they must keep being friends
Yes, likewise, i mean, in the way that, because you get attached to people
Yes, sure
If love a person, then it's hard to break up, because you miss the other one, but if you know it's gonna work then maybe you should breakup?
And, it is going to hurt. Yes, it is better to put
What for, why would you go on gor?
Colorado [red], like they say in my country, getting red [blushing]
None
A few days, and not your whole life thereafter
What, what?
It's better to be embarrassed for one day, one moment, than your whole life after that
Yes, totally.  And besides, if tomorrow
Yes
You'll be forming a family, what picture of marriage do you want to give to your children?, the picture of a really happy marriage
Yes
That you want to be with each other. So, you're not gonna marry someone that
That's everyone's wish, because, i think no one is going to get married thinking tomorrow
Sure, yes.
I'll get divorced, i think that's a mistake that many people make
None
Precisely, because, can't they see it, they have no consciousnesses about this being a real commitment.
Yes, exactly
They easily say I'm getting married and if it doesn't work, I can get a divorce.
None
That's where the problem comes from.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
That's where the problems start.
There's people, I believe that some people get married thinking that maybe, not thinking, yes, I'm going to get divorced eventually but with
If it doesn't work out
Sure, yes.
I can get a divorce because, there's people, you know, the ones that sign prenuptial agreements?
Yes.
It happens here in the United States
Oh, yes.
They divide their assets before getting married?
None
In the event that they get a divorce
Yes. That's right.
They live with, did you see? They get married but,
There it is, they are taking precautions.
Yes, they already have a foot in the divorce.
Exactly. The first step, already, backwards.
Sure, exactly. I mean, I respect it, each one. see? do in their life what they want
Logically, obviously, yes
Of course. But, is strange, see?
We are here. simply, a very personal concept, and very personal.
Yes, But, is strange, I don't know?
Every person has the freedom to think what they want.
Yes, totally.
Yes, there are people that lack that, so to speak, the ability to commit.
Exactly, yes, yes, yes, yes. Totally, yes.
None.

I didn't understand either because I was busy eating and talking.
It was something of part-
It seems like it said that the system of
The couples are breaking up.
The couple breaking up, I don't know anything about that
When it ends, you know when the relationship ends
What do we think, that if they remain friends or not?
Yes but and there are some relationships that are easier to end than others.
Yes, there are relationships that are easier than others, I imagine. Especially if there are kids, they have to talk to each other, be civil, not count
Girlfriends you've had, either of the two.
Yes, many people stay in the marriage when there's kids despite being very unhappy
No
With the marriage
I did it, and got quite hurt, because staying like that was a bad example for my kids and, now they tell me, that seeing, that they weren't blind, that they saw that
That I did need a partner and that for them I didn't want to. Then they fear that they're going to get
A bad man, that they don't know how to choose because they couldn't
A stepfather yes
Okay no, they didn't have the chance to see, have a father in their, in their home.
Yes I mean How long?

It wasn't me, it wasn't me. I found out about this one by chance.
No
It was very boring at work and I looked for websites

But if you know of something else I want you to tell me.
In Chicago there are several and put you to try new foods such as when it left the KFC

Also told us about the different stores
Okay, it may be national or local level.
You're always on the internet marketing studies.
Okay
For example, when you work in the afternoon, you get paid 150 to 170 for food.
Always test for example, when the ice cream came out again
Okay
I asked if it was too sweet or if it was the correct portion
Yes
And
What do I have to get
Okay, but, especially because when they have those requirements they want one to have a certain age.  A certain income that you have kids.
You have to qualify.
None
Yes I also if they ever send you to Texas call me quickly, we'll meet to eat or something.
How nice, yes

I'm already fighting with my brother because he doesn't want to come.
Listen and your mom is with you.

Nineteen?  He is still very young.
Yes, there he's giving me more trouble. He doesn't want to go to university, he doesn't want to do anything.
So
There he's playing at home, playing video games at home
It's annoying right.
Yes but what can I do, I cannot throw him on the street
I'm sorry
No, but my mom
With my daughters from, tell me
I lost my mom on the year nine eleven
Nine eleven
She was watching TV in Puerto Rico and she had a heart attack that day.
No
She died, yes, so imagine that.
Poor, yes, I'm really sorry
I need her, but I do have a brother who lives in Puerto Rico.
Wow
Yes I'm here alone
And you go to Puerto Rico often?
I go there, I try to go I used to go a while back every year but since my mom died
None
It took me five years to go, but I went last year.
I've only gone once to San Juan but it is so beautiful.
Yes and I found it, I found it more hot that anything I said, I saw my brother and I told him has it always been so, so hot here he tells me yes, and I say, I don't remember being so hot
Wow
Yes, but
Is like that because in the summer
The summer yes, is in June
Now already now we are in the office in a hotel and we are realizing that we have to do a little work. But yes, let me repeat the number, two eighty one

I can't because I'm driving now
It's okay then.
Yes, when we talk next time I'll try to be home and then
Yes that is fine, here are the hours that they will call every day, can you confirm that?
Yes there are people, not me, I've stopped because I've been very busy these weeks so I stopped I said that only Fridays and Saturdays.
None
You are receiving calls every day.
Every day I ask them, but they hardly call me.
Yes, the first times they would call me, they would call me, but they couldn't find anyone to pair me up with so I said that this is a waste of time
Many times, I would wait twenty minutes
None
This topic like I tell you I can't tell you much
Yes what I think is that in the couple each one thinks separately, each one decides according to the situation of each one
None
Then there are men that it is easy for them because they are with different women it is easy for them to end a relationship and there is another one waiting.
Yeah
When you are married, the women wait for the children
That is true
Yes unless that, unless there is, that you are in a relationship that the husband is beating her or something. and then yes, the the thing gets serious.
But
I have seen many couples that get more friendly, they are best friends and because of that they get married
Yes, yes the best partners are those who begin as friends
None
You have met him for a long time and you get married.
Yeah, that is like that
There are people that get married too fast without knowing each other. Later they begin to know features of the other person and say, Hey, who did I marry, because I don't know you.
Then, the again when you reach our age
None
And you know someone, you don't want to lose your time.
It is true
Dating for years
When Dad died
But listen, and do you think that you will marry again?
I think
Hi, my name is Miriam
Hi Miriam, how are you?
Fine, and you?
Fine, too.
That's good
Where are you from?
I am from Lima, Peru, but I am speaking from Toronto.
Right
Where are you speaking from?
From Washington
Wash, I think we have spoken once
Yes, we have, yes
None
I think it was immigration
I don't remember, immigration? How have you been? What do you think about today's subject?
Couple's breakup
Right
I think that it depends, right?, if it's hard or not, it depends on how much in love you are, that's it
And do you see the couple they don't get along
Yes, it could still be that, it doesn't work and you're still in love, it's hard to make that decision
Yes, and it won't let you, yeah. It's, it's hard, right?
Yes
Has it been hard for you in your past relationships, in your experience?
I have had both experiences. It's been hard and it hasn't been too hard
It's
You?
I've had four experiences. I've never broken up with anyone, more like they've broken up with me, because with the relationship, I've been
A coward, and always like I grow used to it, I think it is
You wait for the other person to take the initiative
None
To break up
No, I feel bad, I feel bad about breaking up, I feel bad, I mean, I grow used to the other person
None
And then, when I analyze the situation later, the past relationship was not working.
Sure
Because we didn't understand each other.  There was a lot of indifference, but I didn't take the initiative, the other person saw that and took it.
Right?
Sure
I've never left anyone. I mean, yes, I think you should take up arms, and when the relationship is not working
Didn't work, you have to say, this is it
Yes, I have the case of a friend that, she has, she had, she already finished not too long ago, she had years, years, probably ten years, with the person, perhaps
Eight years living with a partner
None
Once, she ended it with him. What happens, that apart from not getting along they have very different objectives.
None
For example, she wanted to get married and have kids, and not him, he didn't want to get married, he didn't want to have kids.
None
She knew, for many years, what her partner's stance was.
She thought he would change.
She thought that at any minute, things were going to change
That's the problem.
Was going to become more mature, and was going to want to have a family. But, before that time, nothing ever happened.
It never happened, and the woman becomes older, and later, she's not even going to be able to find
Exactly, yes.
And the man doesn't make a decision, is true.
I think that sometimes one makes the decision when it is too late.
Yes, is true.
I would've made it much sooner.
Is that, you know? I saw once, the syndrome, in a book I read the syndrome of Beauty and the Beast.
None
In which says that the women, since little shouldn't be taught Beauty and the Beast, yes, nor any, of those fairy tales. Right?
None
It says that all those fairy tales, they teach them, and already since little, for example, Beauty and the Beast. Beauty expected for the monster to change
Change, and the monster, how they portrayed him, he was bitter
Yes.
He was bitter. he rejected her and all of her beauty and love. He says that he will change, and finally, she gives him a magical kiss, I think, and he changes.
Then it says that the woman is born and grows up with that ideal. When one knows that the human being is already a monster, the monster will become more monstrous as he grows older
Exactly, yes.
Is very hard to change him. Would that, be the syndrome that many of us have?
Yes, I think that it's true, I think that women think that they can change the man
That cost us. With my love he will change in time.
Exactly, I will make him change, I will make him stop drinking.
Okay, is a mistake, it cost, such a big responsibility, one has to change one's self, instead of trying to change the other
Yes, or find another person
Find another, is better.
Yes.
There comes the question, Do you think, that it's easier to break up when you are younger or when your are more?
I think that only for the fact of the age, that, I think that, the women think they have more possibilities when they are younger.
Or more.
Easier. And, in fact, I think that there are more available men. Because, since they are young, I don't know, they haven't been married, no
None
In general, let's say. There's more
None
Availability
Also, when one is younger, one thinks differently. See?
Yes.
Right? Is younger. Is more adventurous, more adventurous, I don't know, more possibilities.
Yes, you don't think things so much, so to speak.
Sure.
Yes, I think that. And, when one is mature, on one hand, also, knows what they want, And, on that part also is a little easier.
For example, if one meets someone and spends some times with that person one realizes that no. I think, either way, because one knows more what one wants,
As a woman. Right? But, on the other hand, is the thing of the age, and all that, there are women that think that they won't find another partner,
Right? And they stay there, in a relationship
They stay with the monster
I, What can I tell you? Already, the monster, the monster is made but. I tell you also, because my children's father, each, each year that goes by, he becomes more of a monster, doesn't change.
Finally, we have left each other several times
Sure.
We have left each other several times. We've gotten back together. But, just last week, I made the decision and told him, You know what? This is over.
Perhaps, he takes it as a joke. Because, we have broken up so many times
Sure.
That, I don't know. But, I want him to change because not I'm changing, I mean, in my maturity, I'm becoming Christian, I go to church
How old are you?
I'm forty.
None
You?
Thirty five.
You seem young. You remember what I told you? You sound like a young girl. Then, I'm becoming very Christian. Oh, I met him when I was thirty-four, see?
Sure.
My monster doesn't change. And I, we had a son, and he, nothing, he alone, like he wanted only not even the boy's responsibility, is only mine.
Sure.
He just comes and that's it, and later, bye. And, me suffering there with the boy. I cut him loose twice, because of that. I told him, no, if you don't want to get married and have the responsibility of the family
I don't want to be never living together.
Okay.
He would leave and come back, and I would accept him, and again, and we've been like that. But, right now, I've told him that no, I don't want to.
Do you think that breaking up is harder when you have a kid?
Is very hard.  Is worse.  Is not even about age anymore, because,
You think of the kids.
I've seen, already honestly when you are already a mother, unless the man really smokes, drinks, and not even I've seen
They receive the fathers.
Only for the kids.
Yes, yes. It is really difficult. You think of your son a lot
You know what? I think there is a, there is a difference, because you, even if you want to, you can't change the fact that, that he is the father of your son
Even if you I mean it is fact, that's all. And although you end the relationship, I think you must continue the other relationship
From a father-son point of view. Because the son does have a father, and he will always
None
Be his father.
None
I think that, when you have sons, you are right. Breaking off is much more difficult because there will always be a a relationship between the son and his father
There will always be.
The Father is always there even if you don't want to see Him.
He will always be there
Present
Those meetings, the couple doesn't actually break off.
Right.
You know what I mean? Sometimes you live a love-hate situation Optional Comments:
Sure
You are together, then you split up, and, and it's an ugly situation for the children to see. That's ugly
Yes
Really ugly, really
You, let's say, it's a little, I think
But,
They don't know what it's about.
Is a vicious cycle.
They confuse a little.
It's a vicious cycle.  The children are born very confused.  They don't know.
Yes.
What do I tell you? We have been separated for many years. I mean, I with him, we have been more out of the relationship than inside the relationship
And, when you were out, he saw the kids,
What?
When you are not in the relationship, does he still see the kids?
No, because that's what many men have.
Yes.
Many men are like that, vengeful and hateful. That when they don't have anything with the woman, sometimes they don't see the
Sure.
My kid's dad, is that type of man.
Is he Peruvian, also?
No. He's Dominican.
Okay
Unfortunately. But, he, yes, of other fathers that the relationship breaks up and, and they continue as friends and see their kids. See? Not this one, this one, if the relationship breaks up, gets away from everything
Yes.
And doesn't even want to look at the boy.  Doesn't that hurt?
Yes
Sometimes, yeah, he tells me, i want to see the boy, but it starts to
You have to talk about it. If you're talking about it clearly.
None
It would get better, right?
I have never seen a man so tough, so hateful as him, my child's dad, do you have a boyfriend now?
I have a husband
Oh, are you married?
I have two kids
Oh, that's nice, that's nice, well, I'm glad, I
Yes
You're outside of a relationship, and still, my situation is very sad
None
I go to church a lot, and that has helped me a lot.
Do you have two or one?
One, one
Yeah
A little man. And yeah, i go to church a lot and look for support. And people is really good, and it's very nice to me. It's a different environment
I have gathered more strength, and i put an end to him
Sure,
And, I want him to change, he seems like, there, he sometimes wants to.
Whoever changes first, we talk.
Who changes first?
Then you talk, let him change first, and then talk with him
None
If you want to, is true. But, you need a group.
Yes,
You can go to church. A group of, that sounds bad.
Hello?
Hi
Hi, good afternoon, my name is Mayra
Wood my name is Leticia
Where are you talking from?
From Philadelphia
Oh really? Me too.
Yes?
Yes
Oh, look at that
Right
Where are you from? I'm from Argentina.
Where are you from?, I'm from Mexico
None
None
And, what are you doing here?
Here, I'm studying, I'm on my third year now
Where are you studying?
In the University
Of Pennsylvania?
From Pennsylvania. yes.
None
Yes, I've already been three years.
None
That the thing comes out
Okay.
What do you do here?
I'm here because I'm also in the university, but working, because my husband came to do a post doctorate
Okay
I also started working in the university so but I haven't been here long, it's been eight months
Really?
Yes.
Alright, how nice.
No is
Okay, and what are you working in?
I'm working in a laboratory that does research
Okay.
In the University of Pennsylvania.
Alright.
So what do you think of today's topic?
I don't know.  I have a lot of opinions regarding things about religion.
Yes.
I have strong opinions because I do feel that to live in many things, I mean that it creates a lot of conflict between other religions and between people and
There's a very long history, right? of religious wars
Yes. yes.
And it bothers me a little that they are always excluding people, I know a religion has to exclude some, and that other have another religion or other things to do.
Yes, that the people
I don't know.
They differentiate themselves by the religion they practice right?
Yes, exactly.
Yes.
Or that one can simply not accept the other, I mean, is not necessarily that they accept it but rather that they can't leave them alone
Maybe it they would leave them alone, it's good.
Yes, as is.
More peaceful the thing.
Yes that they can coexist, last that they respect each other, right?
Yes, exactly, at least that they have tolerance.
Yes.
There's a religion that I like a lot, it's the Buddhist.
Really?
And that's not against anything
Look at that
Yeah, it doesn't, it has nothing to do with that, so, i like it because you tell it hey, but what, and catholics do, that's ok, i mean, that's how things are
They have a philosophy of life, well, look, just be, like it ended up.
Sure
They have no interest in fighting with others
Yes, i understand, uh, that's the religion that's practiced in Japana, i mean, in China, right?
That's right, yes, over those places
Yes, it's interesting there's another way of looking at, i mean, seeing thins, because the truth is that besides, there are lots of extremists in religion and
Yes
They take things too seriously
Too much sometimes
Yes
I don't like that. For example, here in the university, i think that you haven't felt that, because you're in the lab, but in general, there's a huge difference among the Jewish in college, that deal with jewish
Yes
I can't even talk to christians, so many are very extremist and orthodox. I prefer to not hang out with them.
Really?
Yes
The christians, but no catholics?
Well, Christians from here.
Yes, the protestants would be.
Kind of alright,I don't even know from where, I mean from some that, but they are, you see them and by there
That the religion was like that one hundred years ago, I didn't know it still happened.
Really?
Yes, the people continued to behave so closed up
None
I have a friend who lives in a little town where many couples either get married right after high school or during high school
Yes.
They already don't go to the university, and he says that nobody has a boyfriend before getting married. Nobody kisses another person, even if they are boyfriend and girlfriend
Yes.
Until their wedding day, yes, is like that because
No.
I thought that was a century ago, I don't know
How incredible, I didn't know that kept happening on that level.
It's still happening, at least here in the United States, I've met many people that are like that and I'm really surprised, I never thought
I mean you can't interact with those people, practically.
I can't talk with them, we can't talk about anything, because they don't do anything and I don't want to offend them or anything.
And in turn, the Jews also exlude themselves. hey don't interact.
{}
Sure.
How nice, they're excluded in any way
Yes, apart there, there's many judges.
A lot.
Yes, yes, yes, it is incredible what happened, right?
None
No, the truth is I didn't know what the level of the university people was and all that, I didn't know how it was, I thought that
That everyone respected each other, that nothing happened, that everyone has their own religious but got along with everyone
Its like how the whole world does this but the problem is that they aren't related those who are really strong believers in a religion
Have problems relating to us
Sure.
From other religions.
Sure.
So, but
And with the rest of the people from India, people from Asia
There I think the thing is more cultural, like, there aren't problems, I haven't had problems with them about beliefs
Yes.
Nothing more than since it's cultural, they have their role and they get together with each other, and go to their parties and everyone for himself
Sure.
Yes.
You get along more with, with Catholic people, in some way, or, or with
Tell me. I think, yeah, I relate better to international people, I try to go out with international people.
Right.
Of course the majority of them are Catholic, but none of them are super, super, super Catholic, that is, they're very relaxed people anyway
Right,
Almost all of their friends are international, so we're a little more used to the same tolerance and what we are saying
What yeah, the truth is that I didn't think that that meant so much, I thought that, that that existed, well, religious differences because, in fact in this country there are a heap of religions but
Mmmhmm
I didn't think they segregated themselves that way
No, it's really interesting, it surprised me a lot too when I saw it, I couldn't believe yeah, it was like that, like wow, I never imagined
Yeah and in some way you should believe more, right?
Yes, they just can't or, I have a friend who tried to go out with a girl who was Jewish and he was Catholic and they couldn't because she didn't want anyone to see her giving him her hand
Because then in her community they wouldn't accept her
None
So yeah, it's pretty complicated.  The thing where you can't shake hands with your girlfriend.
Yes, and more than we
I don't know
There, we come from countries where there isn't so much religion, or the other religions are very much the minority, right?
Yeah, we don't have those problems, I don't think.
There is, it's like there's an impressive mix.
But I don't know. I'm thinking about an example of when religions unite a people. I think it does have
Inside a religion
Yes.
That is something that unites people, right? I think
Yes. it unites within the, the same ones of the religion. And with Muslims, for example that, do you also have Muslims colleagues and that?
I know a few, not many, honestly.
That's interesting what you are saying because i always notice that the Jews help each other
None
And that if there's someone whom to favor, they will favor, the other Jew.
Yes, it works like that.
That definitely
Yes, that's a fact.
That is already like that, but I didn't think they expressed it like that so openly.
Is funny, maybe they don't do it on purpose but no, is more cultural, with that of having to go every Saturday all of them
Yes.
Well, they get along really
Sure
There are many events that are just for Jews
Yes.
I don't know and maybe well they are the ones relative to the religious days they have.
Yes.
I have felt it a lot like that. I have a couple of Jewish friends that I take to once in a while, but good friends, none.
None, sure.
I'm sure that there are other people that do.
I understand.
It's only that I have not met them.
What part of Mexico are you from?
In the city
From DF
From Mexico.
None
Listen, and in which laboratory do you work?
It's a laboratory that works in the part of the of lipyd matabolism
Come on.
This like that good this, and related to cardiac illneses and all that I don't know, do you study something related to science and with medicine or something?
Yes, I study chemical engineering.
Look at that.
Yes.
That's good
Where is your laboratory?
It's in the BRB
Where is that?
In the building that says Penn on top, you can see it from afar
Oh, I know which one it is.
That building
None
It's so high
Yes, it's amazing, I love it. How much research is done here?
Yes, a lot.
The university is amazing
Yes, it is amazing the amount of research done in here, you can't believe it.
No.
There are so many resources.
Yes, that's it, that's one of the reasons why I came here, yes, this is where the money is, right?
Yes
To do stuff, it's so much harder in other places.
Yes, what do you have? Are you on a student visa?
Yes.
None
Yes.
Sure.
But, well, i work here, inside the university too
Oh, you also work?
None
Oh, well,
Of, work study, i mean, for undergrad's
Yes
There are always work studies, you can find several jobs
Oh, that's interesting
None
Ok, i mean, you can, help, help support yourself while you study
Yes, that's precisely what it's for
Sure, and yes, sure
Yes, they check you, the package you have, and most of us get some kind of scholarship
Yes
They don't give you as much and you have to work to get that much
Sure
For example, the university makes me pay a minimum amount, anyway.
None
Plus my own expenses, there's still enough for my expenses
Right
None
Yes, not he truth is that pretty good, because if not it's impossible.
Yes, yes, because, like, for example, if I were working in Mexico, they wouldn't take out the money to pay my expenses, I think.
No.
None
No, here education is really expensive, and
Hello
Hi
Good [afternoon|evening], yeah, good [afternoon|evening]
Hi, this Martin
My name is William, how are you?
Fine, very well this week
From Miami
From Miami
The city that never, the city that never sleeps
I'm in Baltimore
Baltimore
Maryland, yes
No way, there's going to be a hell of a cold there
No it's been good so far, now the temperature has started dropping, it was too warm for January
Look.
We had fifty six degrees
In Miami, when the temperature is over sixty-five degrees , itâ€™s like a snow stor was up there.
Sure
I have a leather jacket on in Miami; that's unusual
Right
That's something rare here in Miami because you can't wear leather jackets like if you were in New York.
Sure, the weather.
And the weather is around seventy five degrees
Sure but not
That's why I'm asking you, it should be so cold up there
We've had moderate weather but so far this year had to be
Twenty five, thirty
Oh shit you are crazy!
Yes, it's now around fifty degrees, it's just going down.
Now yes, since the sun has gone down, it seems like it's going to get worse
Yes
Come here, where are you from?
Argentina and you?
I knew it that you were from Argentina. I'm from Cuba brother
Yes, I can
From the poorest part of the Caribbean
No, but it's a beautiful country, I haven't been there
I didn't listen to the girl because I was watching a movie so I don't know what do we have to talk about.
Religion. If religion unites or divides people and to give examples, for example if Christians and Muslims would be close to each other if it wasn't for religion
For example if homosexuality is discriminated because of religion
That's so boring kid, lets talk about
We can talk about that or we can talk about something else, you can tell me what you are doing there in Miami
Yes we can talk about something else because I really, I don't care if you are Catholic, I don't mean you, but the people
Yes
If they are Catholics, Christians, Muslims, as long as they don't do anything to me, I don't care what type of bird you are, I don't care.
Yes, neither do I, neither do I, I'm a believer
Yes, no
Anybody can believe in whatever they want
Yes, no, all the problems that this world has at this hour if this or that
Yes
Look, lets talk about something else, you know that here in Miami
Yes
Here in Miami it's all good, picture that, most of the people here are Catholics or Christians and once in a while, you can find a
As I said, a Muslim or an Hindu, those are crazy, the ones that have dots in the forehead
Yes
And they start to talk to you about the Bible. I can't stand any of that. Tell me, are there many Hispanics in Baltimore?
How?
Are there many Hispanics in Baltimore?
A lot of what?
Hispanics, Latin people.
I can't hear you Hispanics I don't know just, just yesterday we moved we are, are living in Philadelphia and now we moved to Baltimore in Philadelphia there's a bunch of entire neighborhoods that they are all Hispanics
Here in Baltimore, I know there's a neighborhood that's quite full of Mexicans
Yes
Is a small neighborhood, is not, is not like Miami or New York where
You have, you have
There's a bunch
Have you been in Miami?
Just passing through
You've never stopped there in Miami?
But
You know that in Miami they have some tremendous Argentinian restaurants with, with some delicious meat
Yes
I don't remember what they are called because
Yes.
I haven't gone there in a while, but I have been to two little cities called Hialeah and Kendall.
Some delicious restaurants really.
Yes before I take a trip to Argentina by there I'll pay a trip to Miami and I'm going to eat there
How are the Cuban girls there? The Cuban girls listen. I don't know if you've been with a Cuban girl, but the day you get with a Cuban girl
You will forget that the world exists because these girls throw themselves on you as if you were something so delicious, I at this moment I'm in Orlando, but I'm going to Miami tonight, I live in Miami.
Yes
Here in Orlando there are not many Hispanics
Yes
Almost ninety percent of the Puerto Rican population, there is not people of other nationalities
None
With the damned Puerto Ricans
No, itÂ´s just
It is incredible
I think most are Puerto Rican in Philadelphia too.
You do not see
There is a dominican, a Cuban
Okay, there are not many of us.
The majority
ItÂ´s only us.
Yes, In fact I only know one Cuban that works near my job.
In fact everyone I know are from Argentina
Of course
I know most of those who are almost all Puerto Ricans
I believe that among Puerto Ricans and Mexicans make the Hispanic population in the country
Yes
I came to Orlando two or three times only.
Yes
I've never stayed more than a week and I spent like a month here on vacation
Yes
And, I say maybe I move up there, let me see how things are, a very nice city. There are a lot of people, the people are very nice but,
Damn when you don't find people from your country
Yes, is
Come one feels a little, excluded, you understand me because one likes to have the
None
Though you are Hispanic and I'm Hispanic, we have the same blood you could say
Yes,
But is always nice. Is good finding a person who understand your jokes,
Yes because
To talk to you clearly
Yes, besides, even things like the food there are different some customs, is good someone like from the same country
Sure
Yes
In, is very interesting to know the customs of other people, but I always in Miami wake up in the morning that I'm going to work, and I always stop in a little store, any store I stop
There are two or three different people, but at least there's a Cuban, who can talk, drinking a coffee.
Yes
This one saying that if my wife was unfaithful. You understand me?
Yes
It's the, no, I take her and I push her against the wall and I'm like no, but fuck, you can find the Puerto Ricans upstairs and I have nothing against the Puerto Ricans but fuck they are all criminals.
At least here in Miami, the Puerto Ricans are nice people but the ones upstairs are all a bunch of criminals.
Yes
They have gold teeth and their pants are showing their asses, come on bro, are you showing me your ass? You are wearing the pants in your knees! What's up with you? Are you crazy or what?
Yes, I see
Yes, they are dressed as if they were black people with golden teeth and with your ass showing, look, I got up the other day and I told him, bro can't you pull your pants up or what, or wear a skirt then or something.
If you want, I can buy you a belt because every time that I see him in the morning, his pants are half way his ass.
Come on, what's your problem! Do you want them to stick it on you or are you selling yourself for twenty five cents? What's your problem.
Sure
But oh no, they are nice people, fuck you don't have their
Yes.
You are from Puerto Rico you are Hispanics, you can have your own personality, why do you have to act like the rest, no, I get crazy, I can't live like that man!
Yes but Puerto Rico is a very particular case because they have so much American influence.
Yes, that's true
They have a mix of traditions
You know, you are so right about that.
No
They think they are gringos, and they've forgotten about the fact that they are not gringos at all.
Yes
They are Puerto Ricans.
Yes they exaggerate some things there
Let's say that I generalize too much, but well what I've seen here, is like that they believe that they are gringos and they speak to you as if they were gringos
No is that you are right
I see them I tell them listen talk to me in Spanish because I know Spanish and you also know Spanish.don't come to me with the English that you are are gringo that you are a dumb ass okay, be still
Yes
I the only gringo that has blue eyes and was born in Baltimore, in California
In your little country don't come pretending to be a gringo, no is that they don't even want to talk to you in Spanish brother
Yes that's happened to me.
You understand me? You talk with them, and you tell them a word in Spanish, and you have a conversation with him and he keeps talking English, brother, talk to me in Spanish that I understand you.
Yes
What's wrong with you? Did you forget where you came from?
Sure
Don't mingle here, these gringos will break your head.
Yes but And how long, how long ago did you arrive from Cuba?
I came from Cuba when I was five or six years old.
Very little
No, I came here when I was a little boy that couldn't even read yet.
Sure
No. I, yes, because although. And, you, how long ago did you arrive from Buenos Aires?
Yes we came almost four and a half years ago, five years more or less
How did the country seem to you?
I got accustomed after awhile. At first I was shocked because it was so different
It's very different that's true.
Yeah, big cities they seem like Buenos Aires a little but, like a city but no, the people are very different it's a lot more
Truth that people are kind of dry, they don't
It's drier, it's colder, yeah
There's no, there's no warming like the Hispanic kind that comes your way.  How do they say?
Yeah
Your neighbor greets you in the morninf and you sit down over a coffee, and asks how it's going, how's your life? Here, everybody just leaves to go to work and they forget about the rest of the world.
Sure, of course you can drink some mate with a friend
Yea
That doesn't exist
I think that it's a very developed country but the, the people they're like brainwashed that they're like zombies, You know what I mean? I
A little and that is the other impression. They are always going to do the same thing and they don't ever stop to consider the rst
Yes very cold, let me ask you something, because I, I enrolled in a program it's, this, it's was like the second call that I got and I didn't ask them
The other girl, because she was Chilean and I didn't ask her. What's the point? of why you all talk to other people in Spanish, what is the
Getting to the bottom of all this
Hello
Hello
Hello, what are you doing, Veronica
Yes Carina.
How are you
What are you doing?  How are you, Carina?
See that we go the topic of religion.
We got the topic of religion, I tell you that I had a friend who was a priest.
No, I can't believe you
Yes he was a priest, and it turns out that later he got married but ended up a faggot.
I mean that, but I thought that the homosexuals within the religions  have a better time. I thought that all the ones that were in, in the monasteries like, kind of like
Had those tendencies.
You know that what he says is that in some way, he discovered his homosexuality
Inside the monastery.
In a monastery, precisely.
And you think that unites people, instead of
Sure, I think thatn the long run, the religion is like a screen towards the outside, of laws and of
I  think that the religion is very open.
Can connect and this of the spiritual ties, wait that another phone is ringing, what a thing right.
None
This to getting a spiritual connection that also takes you to look for a physical relationship, because the whole religious topic is really
Really abstract.
It's really abstract. It's like platonic love, and really transcendental. So sure, I imagine that you must want to communicate in another way with people, no.
Sure, so the thing that makes more material. So no, it calls my attention
That they sometimes use some objects, really cult to the religion like almost as toys, like sexual toys or for these kinds of ends.
Uye, we have to ask your friend, because the truth is it makes me really curious but, I don't have informants inside the
The experience that they have through these, things to ask them, no.
Sure, look. What called my attention was this, I tell you that what they think at times
They can repress the homosexuality, this, entering a religious group, or in some religious order, I think that in this case, the same thing happened to this boy
And I think that in the end he repressed his homosexuality, entering in another institution
Until he left.
That is about marriage
Repressed his homosexuality getting into marriage.
That's another
And when did you he discover that he was homosexual?
I think that he discovered it when he was in the monastery.
In marriage how did he fake it?
Sore, what happened well after, since he had created his, his sexuality,
It didn't work very
He got into a religious crisis, because he said that he didn't see God anymore, and so,
I couldn't see his face.
After that, he decided to leave, quit, leave the monastery, he met a girl and he was younger than him, a lot younger than him
And he got married, the touch.
It's like, how?
He married and then I don't know.
Sure, he got hooked, he was married, and all of that. After that, he realized that that's not him. Do you understand?
I believe he should see this
And
Try the religious diversity too, he should try with a Muslim or a Buddhist or a Catholic or a Jew
But always from the opposite sex?
They could change and mix, no, we are talking about if religions unite or dived people, I mean,  we have a pretty good catalog
I had a friend that was trying zodiac signs, a Gemini, a
Sure
Cancer, Libra
None
I don't know how did it go or if she got the twelve zodiac signs, but I don't
Sure.
It was a pretty interesting experience, I'm sorry, I interrupted you
Sure, no, I can't think of, there are so many forms of, you have zodiac signs and then you can have
Constellations and then other horoscopes that always have. You have constant resources to keep on trying.
Sure
Or looking for alternatives right.
The homosexuality is something kind of fascinating, right.
I think that the interesting thing is the transgression.
Sure
I ask myself sometimes, if religion can't be a transgression,
None
You don't talk about that. Until it comes out in the newspapers, no, the
Sure
The terrible news, of what they do. But generally everything is covered there right.
Now in other religions do you know if homosexuality is allowed or do they discriminate against the homosexuality?
I have no idea, that's why I was imagining how it would be a a religion that would have as one of its selection criteria, the homosexuality.
I mean that, for, that- hello
Hello? I tell the
To belong to that religion, you have to be homosexual
Sure
As a value no like a
Sure
Is there any of that? We are already being delirious right.
No, no I don't think so, no, but I think that like sometimes, I find it contradictory, right, because there's a very discriminatory facade, I mean this whole issue of homosexuality
They let any kind of ideology, that goes against the values of my own religion, and if
Punctually the Catholicism, the evangelical values. Like for example, for me it doesn't have a lot of this,  much feeling and seems like they're
Absurd, like other things, the thinking of Catholicism and the liberalism, you know.
None
Or a neo-liberal doctrine, and what do I know, in Argentina, for example, this, education, no, in the religion to be a good person, and recently
Sustain a neo-liberal doctrine and screw with people to me seems more absurd than a homosexual inclination.
And it's much worse. Well, if you go to the priests, I don't think that this is prohibited or anything for the style. I don't remember if I saw this in a movie, or where it came from
This, it's a passage of the bible where they read that there were perturbing things. I don't remember very the world that they translated and said that, that these kinds of relationships are prohibited for this.
Since it appeared written in a part of the,
Sure
I don't remember if it's new or old evangelical.
Sure but these prohibitions. I also understand them as a way or a necessity of understanding of human beings to procreate
To sustain the system.
Sure
That has more of an economic connotation if you want.
None
That,
More than moral
But a large or big part of the economy ends up constructing the moral finishes. Building a part of the economy because
If you don't have a family that procreates and you have kids today, and society grows, then how will you sustain the system?
Sure and the marriage is also about that right. Is kind of
None
An economic pact. Let's live in just one house so that we both don't spend, let's
When I think deep down you end up spending more.
Really
I think so because you share expenses but you also do other things.
Sure
And if then you procreate there you screwed it up, because you spend ten times more.
Sure, the finances transform into something much more communal.
Sure, and I think that's why the topic of homosexuality is so difficult, and I don't know if it will get to be institutionalized.
And until it's institutionalized it won't be accepted, right. But
No. They are more conventional than I don't know what.
Sure, because there you have all the tradition that weighs more than any other thing.
Sure.
Yes.
And how is it going with your friend, since he discovered he was homosexual. Is he happy or?
Sure, I think that now he feels, he feels better. as it happens my friend shares the house with us. And sometimes look that it worries me because since I have a boyfriend.
Is like I'm scared that he gets the club,
You're scared that he falls in love with you? God, how complicated.
Yes, yes. But well, he can keep himself, he says he can separate things. But well, they are like, or that respect
That also, like one always stays like that with the idea and I believe that also is cultural that one stays with the idea and the doubt.
Regarding what, the homosexuality or
That no, like you always have that suspicion there, and what happens see if I go to Argentina one week, and I leave them alone.
No. It's like a challenge. Yes, I would be doubtful also.
I don't know if it's a cultural issue, no, that deep down the repressive thing emerges from me, understand
Would you leave a girl friend in the same situation?
I think so.
You wouldn't be scared to leave if a girl friend stayed in your house, however with him yes?
I think that there yes. I don't know.
There you would leave without any fear because your girl friend is loyal to you, or what's the deal?
Yes, I don't know, I don't know because in, concerning homosexuality there's also much of an issue of how, behavior like it, it's labeled
The homosexual is like someone more, more frivolous in the relationships, of more unstable partners
They like to try everything.
Sure, you understand, like they don't have a moral limit
None
It already transgressed everything, they don't care to transgress even the loyalty of the friendship, you understand.
Sure
So then I think that, that, and that.
You distrust, of that
Sure, look, and, I don't know, like I'm realizing now that I'm talking to you, see.
And what are you going to do on your next vacation?
I am going to match it with his vacation. I prefer to let my boyfriend alone.
You don't want to travel with your boyfriend.
See it No no no no. No no no.
That is a solution too right.
No, because it is when we travel,
It is to keep a
We are free, do you understand me? We consider an open relationship, it is like we give freedom to each other, to do good things that could interest us, and later
Could enrich the couple, do you understand?
Of course, I think that have a homosexual one can enrich the couple because you can ask a lot of question that others could not answer.
Of course, totally
I'll be back in like twelve minutes.
Hello?
Hello
Hello.
Good night, how are you?
I'm fine, how are you?
My name is Marco and I'm in Philadelphia.
I'm Roman, I'm from Argentina and I live here in Miami.
In Miami? I grew up in Paraguay.
Paraguay, have you been here for long?
I mean I grew up in Paraguay but I came to the United States about ten years ago.
Good, kind of, I came here seven years ago, I lived in Tennessee five years and a year and a half ago I came to Miami.
Okay.
I've been more
Religion, lets see. What is religion?
Which religion do you follow?
Oh, I really do not practice any.
Atheist, so.
Excuse me?
You are an atheist.
Not necessarily, Atheist is to not believe in anything, in any case, I would be more agnostic that basically means more, I believe in the possibility that
There's a superior being but I definitely, don't believe in the Catholic version, in any way it's certain in no way.
It's a little, yes I've seen, there are several different, I've seen several different
Culture, religions.
I've been to religious services on Sundays including the Unitarian services.
Yes.
It seemed really interesting to me at the beginning but, I went to the, during the summer, and during the summer they didn't do the
In the cathedral, in the bigger church
Yes.
They did it in a smaller place and it was more.
Where? This is in Paraguay or in Philadelphia?
No, here in Philadelphia.
Look at that.
It was a place that was more closed, smaller, with a small group of people who seemed fantastic to me. except at the end of the summer
We went to, they returned to the bigger church
Yes.
It had the feeling, the same as the Catholic, basically, obviously of being from Paraguay all Catholics, always, the first communion, everyone
After a time you see that the Catholic try to convince you every Sunday that we're all going to hell.
Each religion, no, yes, each religion
Everything, yes.
None
Yeah
I studied, and even more I studied at a high school in Tennessee Tennessee is a a very religious state and they were all baptist, baptists, or all kinds of catholic
Yeah
The truth is that each one that talk to you would want to convert you to their paths
Yeah, exactly
They wanted you
That you realize that it's they are the Christians that are trying to convert the whole world
None
Normally, there are other religions that you don't find yourself in the street with Buddhists who are trying to convince you
Of a, of a, or a Jew or anybody else that is trying to, only Christians
Yes, exactly
Yes, they are in every bus station they are handing out  pamphlets saying, you have to save your soul
You find your salvation in the church, please donate your money to 1-800
None
On, so on
Exactly,
It's
That's what bothers me about all the religions that
Yeah
My family is Jewish but I in reality, I participate in all the holidays but I'm not much, much of a follower
I really, what I remember in Paraguay, that the people are in
But
Theory, in quotation marks are big believers but, one thing is that you never see them behaving in a way it would be if they were really believers
They are going out, are sleeping with the wife of another, are drinking, are all, all my friends and the people that I knew
Were Christians there and of course, all are have sexual relations before marriage that basically means going to hell according
Exactly
According to the Catholic religion
Yes.
All those things, and now to top it off I had heard, I was reading a few months ago that the Vatican is
Is talking against the use of the condom
Exactly
Even getting to the point bold enough to say that the condom is not a way to
To prevent AIDS
Yes.
Maybe they are trying to go back to the times.
Old
Past to say
Ancient.
Ancient in no, the sex is bad, the you should never have relations with anyone except with your wife that doesn't happen, that doesn't happen since one hundred years ago.
The truth is that I don't know, it's a subject but I'm telling you, each person that is a follower try to take you take their
Opinion, to their path
Yes.
And I don't know if this happened to you
My path is best
But
Sure, my path is the best one and you don't know what you are talking about
Exactly.
Obviously you are not reading between the lines of your Bible, I don't know, I don't know, it seems to me that the worse, it seems very
I mean, they are two-faced,  they speak about the people,  that do things that they shouldn't be doing but you know that they are also doing that exact same things!
Exactly.
In, it's very, they are two-faced, very, yes, in the end the laws, you listen to all of it, you listen to what they have to say
Oh, you basically go to hell.
Pretty much
Oh, why complicate things? Let get straight to the point. We are going to hell. We are going to hell.
Yes.
Okay, I already understood
Yes.
We sing. In my opinions, it's just stupid.
Yes.
It seems important.
It was necessary, and it divided the world into several sections.
No and if you remember how it happened
We are
All the religions started with just one and then each prophet began to express his own opinions
Exactly
And they started to differ from the others
My God is bigger than yours, my God is bigger than your God.
Sure, but in reality
That was
We all forgot there's only one God.
It's really interesting, to me, it makes me, I remember that it's easy, the Christian and the Jewish God, for example
Is Jehovah, it's the same, the only difference is that Christians believe that Jehovah had a son that became human and he was God himself.
Exactly,
Theoretically, I like the same things. I met someone from the Bahai region.
Where's that religion from?
No, I don't remember, I don't remember where Bahani's are from, it's somewhere outside Chicago, I believe it's here in the United States
Yes.
They believe in the nine biggest religions of the world. The nine biggest religions have the same God.
Yes.
That because we are depending on the places that geographically and on the h, that's why they have such distinct appearances but if you look at the rules it's rather, ra, basically it's the same.
Don't kill; don't sleep with another man's wife; don't steal; don't lie. They are basic rules.
No, all the basic rules are followed by the majority of the world's religions
Yes, they are basically the same thing, the, what's different is that, that, how they interpret the edicts that simply depend on the
The geographic region that changes the appearance, the kinds of
Look at you
None
I didn't know that.
That is very interesting, it's a very interesting idea, that at least, the thing is, I don't I believe I believe a lot in the power of the
I believe a lot in the power of the human mind in creating a good story.
Yes,
To create a story, that's
And well.
A while ago it was a lot easier to convince people that if they didn't do what I, the king, said
My
Yes.
My boss is the superior king, go is coming and is going to burn your house and is going to send to the
Hell to all the family that's in the, in that way it was useful, religion. It's very useful in order to keep the rules
Yes.
To the people, to the simple ones, to the poor,
Yes, poor people as they'd say
Yes, it's
In reality it's more like a, the destiny that we all have.
I believe we create our own future
Yes.
I believe that we, each one of us, depending on the way that we live our lives, that's what comes up, what turns out from, the result of
Obviously.
Yes, and that's seems obvious to me. How is it that it's so obvious for, but at the same time, it is possible
That with this, with this Fisher thing, that they connect you with someone that so strongly believes in religion
Hi, my name is Eliana
Hi, what's up?, my name is Federico
Hi Federico, how are you?
Fine
Where are you from?
From Argentina
Oh, I thought so, how are you, is everything fine?
Fine, Where are you from?
Argentina
Where are you?
In Boston
In Boston, look at that
You?
In Philadelphia
Oh, do you know Mariana and Lety?
Who?
Mariana and L-
Yes, Mariano and Leticia
Mariano, Mariana, and Leti gate my friends.
Yeah, i know them, but they told me that, i started calling because of Martin, do you know him?
Martin and Soledad. You talked to them.
No, I talked to Soledad
You talked to Soledad right?
Look, and you?
It's been a long time since I saw Mariano and Letti
A long time since what?
Since I saw Mariano and Letti
I got Letti this week.
Hello
I thought it had cut off
No, Letti makes the best pasties
She cooks great
In the world. No, besides she makes the paties
I was saying the same thing.
Spectacular
Here I buy the pastry from La SalteÃ±a
Yes, here it is also sold in some places, but you have to go a supermarket quite far away
But hers are spectacular. It's more than the party, whatever it is.
Seriously, so
She fries the pastry, it is spectacular
I have to ask Letti for the recipe. They are divine. They came home. I was with an Argentinian friend of mine, doing an internship in the laboratory.
None
The twentieth of February which is a holiday, we are going over there.
Really good. You will love Philadelphia
Really?
No
Beca-
I don't know, maybe yes.
But
No, is good, I don't know.
Letti and Mariano told me that is more is a line to Boston, but you have it cleaner
And yes, Boston is much nicer and cleaner. The people are more pleasant.
Really, so much?
Nothing happens. Is not serious.
Obviously, no, sure.
You'll have a good time.
And also to know it
No, it is not Boston.
Know another place also. What are you doing there?
I'm a biologist
In the same laboratory?
N the laboratory below Mariano I did my PhD
Yes
I already know Mariano, because up there there's a bunch of Argentinians. In reality, there aren't a bunch of Argentinians. No, because there some Spanish guys live.
Mexicans, and, Paula friend also in common, works in, in that, in that center. And nothing, that they all know each other, we all know each other there from Argentina.
Sure
The only bad thing Mariano has is that he's a supporter of Velez
None
That's a very serious problem that he has.
Wait a second, let's see there if, no, because I'm here with a friend
Yes
That was chatting with her husband in Buenos Aires. Poor her, my computer turned off. So ihave to put it to
Man, and how long did your friend come for?
She came for two months
My sister also came for two months to do an internship
Also biochemistry or biology?
She's studying biology, she's in the process of
Sure, wait.
None
Wait five minutes.
Yes
No, I tell her, to wait five minutes to turn on the computer.
None
Well look, and you are married, because I also talked with another girl, who was married with a biologist, and I don't know if it's your wife.
No
From Mar del Plata. No.
From Mar del Plata, with Ines.
Guadalupe, something like that.
No, Ines is from Mar del Plata.  But Ines, is the biologist.  She's not married with a biologist.
Yes, it's true, on Mar del Plata, she was a biologist.
Sure
Soledad, is the one that's not a biologist, and she's married with a biologist.
Exactly. I, now I'm doing the Post Doc in the laboratory where Martin works, Soledad's boyfriend.
And what is it about?
Embryonic develoopment in mice.
Yes
More or less.
Look at that, that's good
What do you do?
I do pharmacogenetics.
No, I did my thesis in the pharmacology department here in Penn
Yes
No, and now I moved to the embryonic development.
What do you like more?
No, in development, that's why I moved.
Really?
Yes, there I pulled about the pawn of my thesis I had done one
No
A little work with zebra fish, but I worked with some proteins, and some receptors of
Yes
And then I did some experiments on zebra fish and, and I moved to the embryonic development.
Not me--my approach is more clinical than anything. No.
Okay.
Population studies, some control cases, and measure some Nipps variation, in the genes
And where do you do your work?
In TAP, TAP University.
Yes.
There, in a building dedicated to nutrition
None
More than anything, my thing is pharmacology. Since pharmacology is where the drug that decreases the cholesterol is more than work in the laboratory
Of, cardiovascular illnesses
It's all right.
So, we've met for sure
Do you know any more Argentinians in Boston?
Yes, a lot of them, for a moment. He's a boy from Philadelphia. He's Letty's and Mariano's friend. Oh, yes - lots of them live with a friend
Yes
We met in school and, we have a lot of biologist friends
Who, for example, biologists?
Estani, Miguel.
Estani? Oh, yes. I know Estani.
He's my best friend, yes
Really?
Yes
None
Why
I don't know if Estani will remember me.
I don't know, lets see, and Miguel too
I didn't, I met him at some meetings, I'm friends with one of Estani's friend.
Who, Barbara?
Gabriela
Who? Here in Boston?
No, here in Philadelphia.
Stani is leaving on February first, he's going to live in Buenos Aires.
He's going back?
Yes, he's going back.
That's fine.
Yes
And have you met Sebastian?
Sebastian?
Sebastian
No.
No? Sebastian
Sebastian, no. I don't know any Sebastian
No? And well.
Maybe I do, but well, I'm so bad at
There are many of them
None
Argentinians
Yes, I Paula, biology, Laura biology, how old are you?
Twenty-nine
She's thirty four, thirty six, Stani is
Sure, they are of different generations
If you are twenty one, biologist, do you know Nicholas?
Yes
Nico is here.
Yes, look at that.
I worked with here with the monkeys
Luciana, but where is Luciana?
No, she's in Buenos Aires but she's working in the lab that I used to do my doctorate in digital genetic prints, in the pharmacy and biochemistry school.
Luciana does population studies with monkeys, primates.
She wanted to start doing paternity tests to those monkeys.
Yes
She came to my lab to, lets say, my,
Where in Boston was she?
No, no, my lab in Buenos Aires where I did my doctorate.
I see, yes, I was a good friend to Luciana. When we were studying
None
Yes, in fact, she was my best friend's girlfriend.
I see, which one, I know everything about Lu.
Yes, really, Nacho's.
No, I don't remember that one, I'm Marley, so bad. She's now married to Maxi
No, is she married?
Yes, she got married last year, I was at her wedding.
Oh wow
Yes, it was  huge.
No, well, I didn't know, no, no because I haven't seen here in a while.
You see.
I came here six years ago
Sure, you left as soon as you graduated.
So, yes
Are you staying here? What do you think?
I don't know, I'll see what happens
That's fine.
Where? I don't know.
I really
I have no idea
I want to go back.
Where? To Buenos Aires? And do what?
To bueno- yes. I have no idea, but
We are all in the same
I came to a conclusion.
Yes, what's your conclusion?
This new year. I'm going to, we have a, hold on, stop
Yes
It's incredible how with the Argentinians, the conversations I have here at Pennsylvania are much deeper.
Why?
I don't know, for something we Argentinians have, we can talk about deeper things, you know.
What do I know.
Well. It doesn't matter. This is another thing. But, anyway, the new year. I stopped and decided that my life, I wasn't going to be ruled by work, you know.
That where there's work I'm going to live.  I'm going to live where I want and then look for a job from there.  If I don't have to work in biochemistry or science anymore, I won't.
I don't want to live in a, for example, Boston gives me all the opportunities, but it's really cold, it gets dark at four in the afternoon
I have to live with a roommate because I don't have enough dough.  I can't have steak, and all these things.  Why do I have to live in this way?
But how long have you been in Boston?
A year
A year and you already complain so much?
No, it's not that I complain, it's that I don't end up liking the rest of my life, this style of life
Well, in Buenos Aires it's good, it's not cold like crazy to the end of the month.
They don't pay you, no one
The subsidies too, and they are three thousand dollars, for years, to investigate, that more, they work you in the street,
No but this is why I say, but you
You get kidnapped, express
Sure, oh yes, that's
You are there, and I follow you
No,  but oh well
They catch you and they put the money in a corral.
No, there are thousands but
The devalue three hundred percent.
Okay, no that's the
No, so
That's understandable, it's like you decide what to do, I rather feel a little bit of a danger that to the weather, my friends, my family, my people
And the warmth, all of that, but did you see? I'm saying this today but I might not
We miss a lot of things
In the end, if you'd still be there you'd be complaining and here you have covered all your needs, do I make myself clear?
HOW?
No, I didn't. That you now miss things that you left back in Argentina.
Yes
Those are small details that you miss
Yes
I don't know, the people in Buenos Aires, they spend their lives complaining that they don't have enough money to reach the end of the month, that money is not ebnough, that
They can't go out to, what do I know! They can't the last week of the month, they cant' buy anything, they can't
Go out to eat,  I think that the economic topic, bothers.
Yes Sure
I've been here already six years
Hello, my name is Mirian.
Hello, Mirian How are you doing?. My name is Karina.
Hello, Karina. About the topic, Do you think that we women are abused?
Well, in my personal experience fortunately not, I have not gone through that experience, but I think it is a problem of
Contemporary society right? And, how good,like many times there is a taboo or an education in relation with certain things that we donÂ´t talk about
It is a little bit complicated, to find a solution right?
But there is a lot of information, about the women should not be abused, police force now protects a lot women, before it costed a lot
It costed a lot for the police for example the domestic violence it costed a lot for the police to intervene there were trials and lost of money and all that.
To take into account women rights right?
Of course.
Do you think that even so, women are abused? Even with all that information, with all that
Yes, I think so Because the, the
Yes, right?
The training and education in relation with the laws that, that now act in a more direct and efficient way. No, what they do is to protect women
Women but I don't think they avoid it to happen. No, so is like the defense law give to women, a security, that if she makes the report
She is going to be heard, but I donÂ´t think that will prevent domestic violence So it looks to me that women are less afraid, they go to make the report, time ago it did not worked that way
The legal system, or the police turned a blind eye. The woman felt like, if she made the report it was worthless
It was worthless, of course and gave the man more power
Of course
They were afraid.
You thing that anyway this is somehow related to the social starta
I think it is. The pure American hits his wife, it's often seen, he hits her. The Latin hits his wife.
None
Third world people hit their wives also, but now we are going to see in the ... I think it more often seen in the
Third world countries. They take women as second class or something like this
Sure because you think that in culture there is a big gap
A bog what?
A big gap, I mean there is big lack of education in the Latin countries, there is a lack of
None
Of conscience of that problem, maybe because the Latins are more chauvinist, it could be so,
Yes, and not only because they are chauvinist, the culture is like that, women is intended to be in a second term
Because in those countries women are, submissive to men and have nothing to say
Right, it's like she is educated to bear it
Poverty as
Not just, a marriage that may not be due to love or whatever, but everything that comes along with that man, right?
None
I think it's hard to revert situation because it's a cultural matter.
Promote new laws being created, about it, but you have to sensitize women, right?
Yes
I don't know, like educative programs or something like this, that
I once read a psychologist that said: The woman in any part of the world
None
Have the Beauty and the Beast complex
Beauty and Of what?
In the
The beauty and the beast complex
The beauty and the beast okay, because she says that with our love we with that story and all the fairy tales
Yes
Believe
That we can change
That, change my love she will give, I'm going to give the beast a kiss and the beast will reason as
Such a beautiful prince. Like we expect but doesn't know that, in the real life the beasts that we have become more beasts when they are already old, Right?
Sure, one
Also with so much abuse that the woman has put up with, sometimes she looses her spirit and all that then she says that: they shouldn't teach those fairy tales to the woman when she's little
Fairy tales, of The beauty and the beast
Yeah
No, I stayed thinking about what you were saying of... is true, the woman woman perhaps has this illusion that even though the things are bad and
She can change him right
Up to, up to what limit accept Right? Something that is bad.
The matter is that it is not about up to what limit you accept, what happens is when the woman
They are not doing it anymore, women feel they have no value and she knows that she has rights but she doesn't know that just for being a human being she is worth
None
Her self esteem is low.
Sure
She doesn't know when if she's going to say no, sometimes, women I don't know, in our mother's years, they had to withstand this until their deaths.
None
How many of them left their husband, just a bunch of them got divorced
Sure.
Women are more rebellious now but they still accept those things, the abuse, maybe men can't abuse them
Physically but they emotionally abuse them
Sure, that's why, there should be some limits
It's tough
No? sometimes it's not that much physical violence, yes
I see
A bunch of other things that the husband does, what do I know!
I see.
Cheating or lowering her self-esteem, no?
Yeah
She should set a limit, that's why you were also saying, no
None
You think that with her love it is enough to make a change in attitude or you think that it's something fleeting or momentary
It goes on building the relationship. That cannot be. I also believe that another of the problems in relation to the issue of Family Violence is that
That also, it's like a social marker, right? At times you are a bit ashamed to make that sort of complaint.
I think that perhaps if the woman thinks that this is wrong, I think that this was before
None
Not now, it's that the woman is more aware and will say, If you abuse me, and that's as far as it goes.
Of course.
You didn't see this information before. The police have the right to protect every citizen, including
The woman in Female Violence of course
Of course it's more the obligation, no, to defend
The obligation is
Yes
We have the right to be protected.
Of course
Every citizen, children everyone, right? So now there is a lot of information. I see lots and lots of information, I see community centers, I see pamphlets around, so then
I don't know if it's fear, perhaps one of the questions would be, should the Government make some law?
None
But I think that the law should be regarding little ones. The law should be educating, teaching men that this is not good, and teaching women that
Of course
When a man, when
It shouldn't let you
Grow up and if you are abused by a man or attacked by him and he says things to you that are not valid then, it should end. It's not love.
Sure
It's not love, you need to leave and don't let yourself be treated that way.
I don't know how the legal system works around here, no, the truth is that I have no idea, I don't know if there's a law or something that protects women against
That's it, yes, I guess. If a woman goes and reports this
There should be
The police should follow, they should investigate or something
Yes, the police have been in trouble for that.  There have been movies about it.
For not answering to this reports.
They thought that's just domestic violence and they wouldn't do anything, but there have been women that have been murdered by their husbands when the women tried to leave them.
They murdered them. And the police was not there. Why didn't they arrest that man if he had already been reported
They had reports about that man.
All of that so, as I was saying, they took the case, and the policemen are forced to protect the citizens, including the
All the members of the society, including the ones within families.
Sure, yes.
There it goes, in which State do you live?
I live in Washington DC. I work in Maryland.
Is it far?
From where?
Is where you go far from where you live?
No, it is close. I can take a train and it is twenty minutes from my house.
Very
I'm pretty close. And you, and where are you from?
What do they say?  I live in Toronto, Canada.
None
Yes, like I told you there's a lot of training, but I worked with a girl and she was really young.
They were hits from her husband
And she didn't want to recognize.
She didn't want to, she was scared, she was scared
And in the end when she trusted,
No because I don't know where the issue stayed
No
Even if she went out, but I told her: Do it, do it, do it. But, I also gave her pamphlets and all that, but after, there was one time here
Here in Canada it's often the case, around when a girlfriend leaves a couple breaks up. The woman left him from India.
Yes, and he?
So the woman went back to her house and the father received her and so the society, the man took it as a big offense.
In the Indian society, yes it's that.
Sure. Other cultures have other consciences, No?
None
Ideas that are a little more advanced and beyond his daughter. Want that it's his your daughter
Sure
He had her in his house, so the man said tha the felt really humiliated.  He went and bought a revolver.
Went to the house.  No one expected him to do it.  And, bam!  He killed at point blank!
The father, the girlfriend
After the father of the girlfriend died, the other sister died. I don't know how many were there.
How horrible! This was in Toronto?
It was a carnage. This was in Quebec, I think.
None
It was a horrible carnage. When I advised the girl, I told her: better not to put myself
No, sure. You made the association
It won't be that the husband. Yeah. It won't be that the husband says, she was telling me, and so I'm going to make carnage
Same. I have the impression that in Canada it's a little more community, that there are more laws than here in the United States.
Yes here still, for the moment everything more or less the police respond. They've seen really few cases
Yes it's like everything works pretty well, right?
There are some small cases they've seen. There are cases they've seen of corrupt police.
Not as much as in the United States, because I think that the United States has a lot, right?
Yes, I think so.
But a few cases have came out that really strongly resonated
Have you been in Toronto for long?
Ten years now
Ten years, do you know how long I've been
Yeah
I'm going there in February because i want to work there
That's good
I'm going to Wester Ontario University
Right
Which i think is two hundred kilometers away, right?, from Toronto
Ontario, maybe, yeah, inside Toronto, in Ontario
Inside too
Right, it should be outside of Toronto
In Ontario
Yeah, i don't think it's too far, and where will you reside?, right there at the university?
I'm visiting now, and I have to pass the interview, I don't know if the job will work out, but I'm very hopef-
Right
Regarding Canada, I have been there several times.
Right
Good evening, my name is Maria
Hi, my name is Maria too
Oh yes
Where are you from?
Nice to meet you in Pennsylvania.
Me too
No
From Philaelphia
Philadelphia, and, where are you original from?
From Argentina
Argentina, i am Puerto Rican
From Puerto Rico, look at that, are you also in Philadelphia?
No.  I am here in Allentown.
It's near from here, right?
About an hour away
An hour
None
It's nice, right? Smaller.
Yes, it's nice
None
Well this, she said the topic is crime against woman.
Against women what do you think? I don't know what the laws are here in the United States actually
In my own experience
Look
I was married for awhile, with someone who was very abusive, I tried to call in the law, so that, I could help myself
Yeah
The law covered me but it didn't cover my children, or because the judge according to him thought that this that he never would try and hurt his children
Sure
Or rather, it's not covering us sufficiently, because the easiest way to become a mother is to have a child right.
Yes, and yes.
The laws do not offer enough protection for women.
Sure, but What is the law ? It covers or rather does it protect you, but it puts, the children
Well, let's go
He can continue being with the children, you say
Yes, nobody if they don't control, if not it has been.
Of control
Violence against the child?  In his opinion, no.  He would never hurt a child.
None
I understand but
Yes. But it's not like that, no, a person that's violent
It's not like that.
Sure. Sure, how terrible.
Always
Look. No, I didn't know anything. No, I'm not familiar with the laws here. I've been here for a little while
Compared to years before, yes it's
I didn't know
Gotten better, but there's still room to improve.
Sure.
Always yes, but So, how long have you been here?
I've been here for a year.
None
For a year, yes. But, I'm also here temporarily, that, I'm going to return to Argentina. I came for
None
For work. It's a two or three year job and
Well
After I'll go back, yes
None
For how long?
Always, since I was little.
Since you were born  since you were sma
Yes, I was in Puerto Rico, I studied there for two years but we have now returned.
I see.
Yes but I don't know because she doesn't have any options in the law here. She doesn't know them.
I don't know them, sure
How is it back there in Argentina?
In Argentina, I haven't met anyone that has that same problem. I think you can report it, and you have some protection but
I don't think you get too much, you listen to stories
None
Of violence and also of
Yes
You might, if it doesn't really hit you that hard, you get used to it, in fact, many people like the cold, they like the
Yes, because the consequences are always for the worse
Sure, they have to take a decision to leave
None
Because
Yes
I think that if you report it, then you can't go back to live at your house with that person
None
It's much more, but I think that it's pretty common, it's pretty common.
None
No, but the laws, actually the laws are like that, no, I don't know how they are
Doesn't know.
If they're very strict or not. I think that yes they should be able to accuse, and that yes they can protect you, to put an order, so that that won't get near, I don't know the name. Those orders
Yes they don't talk about protection, it's like the ones there are here.
For protection.
Yes
Sure.
But like I told them, the order of protection cover women
Just the woman and not the children
Not the children.
I have no idea how it is over there, either.
None
I think that we should be a lot more progressive
Yes, I would guess so because that
How is it in Puerto Rico? Do you have an idea?
It's more or less the same.
More or less the same
Yes it's more or less the same. It seems to me that the laws protect the man much more than the same wife
Yes, and it's that it's hard no, I guess, also to legislate it. Because how you do it, what do I know. It should be, where you put the limit, no, I don't know it should be
Those domestic things are very difficult to regulate.
They are difficult
It must be terrible, I don't know, so, it's not easy, they are playing with, what do I know, people's feelings, I don't know, it's weird.
None
It's weird, what do I know.
Well
I'm leaving and which part of Puerto Rico were you from, from San Juan?
Oh no, I'm from Fajaldo.
None
Yes, San Juan is the capital of Puerto Rico.
Sures, yes. I
Yes, it's a small island. It's one hour away from San Juan
None
Yes,
Sure, yes, it's tiny. Its surface is
Yes, pretty
Do you visit sometimes?
Oh well, the last time I was there was year.
That's nice.
I so like to visit. I have family there, so I do visit often.
Look, one of my friends is from Puerto Rico and she visits every year, she's been her for a lot of years, like seventeen years.
Everytime he returns, he wants to go live in Puerto Rico, because he says it is so nice and the people have so much vibe.
Yes, beautiful.
Is another history that here no
Yes, but now one goes, and it seems as if you were here because everybody speaks English.
None
Almost the same.
Sure
You don't notice the difference much.
That's true and how is that issue, because now the situation exactly of Puerto Rico, how is it, Is is a state?
That there's always been that deception that they have there, there are people, the old people of Puerto Rico that think that it shouldn't be made a state
None
The younger ones say that yes.
Sure
Let's say that they see it as a state now
They are comfortable like that.
Okay. Yes
They have certain privileges, but they continue being quite independent.
None
Yes, is weird. What happens is little by little the American culture is getting in.
None
Go, like you say, that everything
The culture has changed and affected us
None
Already is not the same as the one before. Before there was more culture, though that always happens when one gets out off
Sure
There goes another country
None
Whatever, but now Puerto Rico itself is not the same anymore. The culture has changed a lot.
Sure, the young people must be totally different to what they used to be Sure
Before I remember that my mom or my grandmother would talk to me, and one would lower the head. Now the five year old babies that look one in the eyes, and tells you, what?
Sure
Yes
Good things come in, but also the others come in
It has changed a lot.
What are you going to do. And the English like that, everybody speaks English.
Yes, in the school, in the street.
In the street. Look, how strange that, right. But they keep speaking both languages right. Spanish also.
Yes
None
That is just more, is quite modernized
None
It's modern.
That there are words like that
Yes.
New and that, but how is it?
What?
Modernized?
Modern, yeah
None
Modern
How funny, look at that. It must be a very interesting transformation. You seeing that you go once a year right, or each whatever.
Well yes, it had been a while that I hadn't gone, and I went last year
None
Before that, there were three years that I hadn't gone. And each time I go to the island, I see some incredible changes.
Sure
I stay
To come here is also much easier now right? Is like they have, much more rights to work, and to
They have papers. If you get out of Puerto Rico
Well yes, because we are citizens, we are born citizens.
Sure
None
Sure, yes, because you see a lot of people from Puerto Rico around.
Yes, it's very different.
Around here
Because you all have, you need pass papers and passports. Even though I have, I have passports for my children.
Sure
But because I've always liked having one; but that hasn't been necessary like other Hhispanic countries because they need
Sure we need a passport and visa
Papers
Or rather, in order to get a visa, you have to go there, in Argentina, Buenos Aires, to see the consul, they sign it for you
None
They check into your past, it's a whole process, it's not easy, they will give it you, but you have to do a
Yes, I imagine that
A week of trials.
I would think that if Puerto Rico becomes independent, we would arrive at a point where we would have to do the same--to get a visa. I don't know how it would work.
Sure
But in the meantime, nope.
How many years, was it like this, with the visa?
What?
Way back, before all of this, being part of the United Sates, was it like this having to get a visa, like everything
No, it's always good, to my knowledge, it has always been like that
None
I don't know, yeah, no. They've never been completely independent, they have their flag, this flag has a...
Sure
A star right? Like the United States one
None
But their, the two
Look
Yeah
I didn't know that, i thought that they had been for some time
What?
They had just become independent, but I thought they were before.
No, no, not to my knowledge
None
I don't know that much to bring history, but never
They never were
Or from my grand mothers, i never heard anything different
None
It was because the United States went into Puerto Rico
Sure
Yes,
Look at that, right?
Yes, it's interesting.
It's very interesting
I'd be more about finding myself, my past
Sure, but it shouldn't be
Because, what?
So hard to find a littl about yourself, right?
No, it's just going on the Internet and looking
Sure
Yes
Are you with your family here in the United States?
Well, my mom, my dad and my brothers, my husband, they're all here
None
My aunts, my grandparents passed away. They were all in Puerto Rico
Sure
Lets say the rest of the family
Sure
It's all there
The closest are here and the rest there
Yes
They are all there in Allentown?
Almost no, almost all of us are here, but we are all scattered in New York
None
In different parts of Florida.
They are warmer
Yes every once in a while I tell my brother to send me a little heat.
And now the cold started. I don't know how it is there, but here is really cold.
Let's see if it comes. Yes here is cold. Yes.
Yes, yesterday it snowed a little, and it already started.
See, we still haven't gotten the snow.
No, here, like some wind with a little bit of snow. I don't know if it will pile up but yes, last night it snowed.
Is cold
Yes the truth is that the ones that are in Florida
None
Are to be envied.
I can imagine
In Puerto Rico also.
Yes, in Puerto Rico is hot too.
The whole year is hot, right, there?
Yeah, it's tropical
That's nice, that's nice
Yes, it's tropical.  We're great there, the frog that only exists there in Puerto Rico.
Look at that
Yeah, it's called Cosqui
Coqui
It is a very little frog.
What color?
I imagine it's green or brown.
None
Because sometimes they show it as brown, sometimes they show it as grey
Look at that, they go around the houses? Everywhere?
But it's very little. You can hear it outside, when it's raining and at night
That's nice
You can hear it singing all night
Luca.
Hello?
Yes.
Hello, Jorge from Los Angeles.  Sorry, whom am I speaking with?
I think we already With Luca spoke once.
You, Luca
Tamara is my name.
Yes, how are you Tamara?
Fine, what happens is that I have a nickname.
A pleasure talking with you. Well, the topic is all yours - the violence against women.
Yes, exactly, but I don't know how the laws from here in the United States are. You, you, have been here longer.
Okay.
If you ever came across with some kind of trial of those
No, but, I've never come across one of those trials but the laws are very  tough in general
Yes.
When you talk of all types of discrimination or whatever, especially against women.  Isn't it true?
Yes, I can imagine.
What are the laws? I forget the questions that they make, if the laws are tough enough and that's it basically, isn't it true?
Yes, I also don't know how it is, since here the trials are by juries.
Yes, okay, yes.
I know what you see in movies
Is very similar
Of course, so
Is very similar
And what you see in the movies is not so beautiful but
No, no, no, no
And it is also the whole issue of sexual harassment and it is very
That one, is it the subject of the day sexual harassment against women?
Yes, the subject of the day is the law: if it defends properly or not the women, but the truth is that, no
None
But what I do know is that when you go to work, let's say. All the training courses and those things that you make
The first day of work, they include a lot the issue of, the sexual harassment
Of course, yes, very serious.
The, sexual harassment and harassment and all that, so I imagine that all the men have it below the surface.
Exactly, yes, it does not looks that there is more emphasis here than in Argentina, that is what I see, right? what I remember
Yes in Argentina the issue is that there is not, there is not much justice in general, whatever, that is the whole issue, I donÂ´t know if you
Were in Argentina or saw the news what happened was the Maria Soledad case, do you remember it? Right.
I donÂ´t remember that case.
Fine, The Maria Soledad case is a case, a very known case because it was involved the governorÂ´s son or the intendantÂ´s of
Catamarca that, so the girl was taken, they got her into a black party and, they drugged her and everything, and then she was raped by many
They killed her
Yeah
They left her, and all that obviously happened not, not unnoticed but they did silence marches, there all the topic of the silence march which didn't exist before started
A nun was helping her parents try to do justice, but it was the son of a governor.
The Saadi family was involved
Your friends?
I don't know if you heard the yes.
What did you say the family was called?
Saadi.
Yes
Well.
Okay, is, yes, okay, finish and then I'll, I'll ask you a question
No, and all that then it was a known case but, but the laws are not for, for the women, they are for the one who has money in Argentina, but is a topic in general
Well, unfortunately, yeah, yes. In what year did it happen, do you remember?
In ninety three, I think.
Ninety three
Yes, and that was a girl from a family not at all powerful, but it was sort of middle class
In the Catamarca society
From the Catamarca society.
Then
No? A girl, was finishing a private school tell her I'll call her later
What happened was that the son of the governor in the party said he abused her.
Yes, and it was a big party.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. But, basically all the, all was, was basically directed to mainly accuse the son of the governor.
Yes, because he was the one that was there.
The girl said she died at the end, right?
Yes, the girl died.
The girl died because of the Argentinian law.
Yes.
No. At the end of the case, was the governor's son accused or not?
The one that was locked up was the one that, let's say, her ex-boyfriend, who was like the surrendered
Okay, yes.
Some of the governor's nephews, but no the son.
Sure, sure, sure.
Not all the people that participated nor the cops they caught, because the girl was in a hospital, because she had decomposed
Sure, I mean. She got to
And
To testify before dying?
No she didn't get to testify but the, the place where they took her they knew how to cover up the tracks where they took the girl to a hospital to
Since they couldn't revive her, the doctors or nurses that treated her said, throw her in that area.
None
Since there are many people put in this
Yes, exactly
They did not all fall
How incredible, good
So it's good,
So, this is very regrettable.
But well, yes.
It's terribly regrettable, unfortunately, sometimes injustice happens to whoever or also against whoever with, with people who are more powerful in the United States too
Yes.
The United States is not an exception. A few years ago, I think it was two or three years ago the trial
Decided and declared guilt if I remember right the details, it was a member of the Kennedy family
When I was a teenager,
Yes.
The, it's a cousin of John and and and, of John Kennedy, from the family
None
When he was young, a lot of years ago he had abused a young girl too, his age, when they were both
Teenagers
None
This issue was suspenseful for many years.
None
You know that the Kennedy family is a very powerful family in the United States.
Yes.
Then it was a few years ago this topic resolved itself,  and they were found guilty in the end.
Really?
In that case, yes.
He was imprisones?
It seems to me that they sent him, to the, to the jail, it seems to me that he is in jail, etcetera.
None
That was quite a few years ago.
None
It was many years to obtain justice, and basically it was, it was a case of, of, of sexual violence.
None
All because he was young, because he was a minor, they argued that he was a minor.
Yes
And, that, because he was basically a minor in the United States, it's probably the same in Argentina, they have other types of rights, and besides the
Yes, yes
Being a Kennedy he had a lot of money, and he had the best
Yes
Defense that he could have had and it's very unfortunate.
Yes, sure.
The reality of the sexual abuse against the women and the injustice exists nowadays.
Yes.
And has always existed. The reality is, when the person sometimes has more money, the law has more money.
Has more power.
Means more power, then the law I don't know, is bought, is bought, is bought
Agrees with him. Yes, sure.
And there have been many cases like that
Yes.
Apparently those things are changing nowadays.
Yes.
Nowadays each time the law is being much more and more and more hard against
The violence.
Against all types of people and especially those against sexual violence
Yes.
Against the women in the United States.
None
Luckily that's changing a lot.
It's good. No, and another thing that I saw. I don't know if it has to do with the day's topic, but is since
I work in a hospital and I always ask the girls that have kids what they did for, because there's not a lot of vacation here
None
And, no. The subject of pregnancy license isn't there
The what subject?
The one about license for pregnancy, for giving birth, for maternity,
Exactly, OK
No, they have to go back to work after one month
They can go for three months  to nurse or something like that, but no, it's without payment
That's, it's really, it's pretty crappy, a very complicated subject, yeah, it's true, because, because a woman
They have to give her the right to be with her.
Of course
Son for at least three months to immunize him.
Of course.
With breast milk
Exactly
But no, i don't know if that's a subject of the day, but yes
Well, no, but it has something to do with the discrimination part and all that, I'm not very familiar with laws in that way
Yes
I know that. I don't know how long does the law grant. I don't, I'm not sure.
Yes
I know there is sometimes, right? Of course
Yes, but for what I heard
It can be taken before or after, but I don't know how long it is
SURE, I'VE HEARD THAT, NO WAY, THE WOMAN WON'T GET PAID IF SHE TAKES THREE MONTHS
I don't know how it is in Argentina either, but I lived in Israel and when a woman had to give birth, I stayed the three months with her.
Son, the first three months she got paid
Hello!

We're in the same home

I'm, yeah, you got there and here i am in Penn, I'm doing a
Uh huh
A sort of internship
Hi
The baby is crazy
Yes, she's laughing.
Let's talk about the matter at hand
We'll proceed to the subject, it attains us
Is that violence against women?
Violence against us women
And it's, i think it's completely justified, all these
Everywhere
And that
No, no, no, that seems to be pure maleness
They came out, but if they came out of a spank is because they deserve it, if not, we'd hit them.
No, i don't think so, i don't agree
Sometimes they make you mad, you want to slap them
Oh, no, because you don't
It's just a take your place slap to help you find your place.
No, because you don't
None
You don't
Yeah, it could be. Why not?
We have to kill you too
The thing is, no, you don't have enough strength, you say, right?, you're the weak gender, that's the problem
Listen
You'd do that too.
What?
Hit the man, if you were stronger
But men are evidently stronger than women
Sure,  that's the thing, right?, don't you think?
I do everything a man can. Let's see, sure.
Hello!
Hi
Yes, i got bored
It's just the baby comes on
Yes, yes, you bore me, baby
Tell me, hi
You bore me, I'm talking to you
There's a lot of people in this house. That's why the conversation is complicated.
And, could you go somewhere else?
Do you really cook?
The laws were good
No, I was saying that men are stronger than women. That's why women can't hit them, but we don't lack the will.
What can you say about violence?
What can I say about what?
Male, what can you say about male violence
Towards women?
Yes
None
I don't know, the laws are good, the laws of the United States too
I don't understand the question
Baby, what's wrong with us today?, what's wrong with us Argentinian?
I'm hearing you. I don't hear anything.
We are crazy.
You are crazy.
Crazy,
But what do you say of the violence?
Nothing that  what it said is, we discuss the laws,   I know that that in United States also the laws that protect the women.
I don't know the laws of the United States, I don't know them.
No, then give me your opinion about the ones in Argentina. You don't know them either.
I don't know them.
The Argentinian ones also.
The truth I also don't know them, but also I don't agree with the violence.
No, but of
Of the laws or not laws.
Sure, no. We don't agree?
I don't agree
We don't agree.
Do you agree? or no?
No, me either. I was proposing that for
To whom? a man that hits me.
Sure. No, for some law, yes.
A hitter?  I'd take him to a psychiatrist.
A hitter, a psychiatrist
Yes, he evidently has a mental problem, because hey, to hit her
To jail, right?
To hit someone weaker.
No, to jail, right?
Yes, but a mental problem. People who beat and kill have problems.
They've got problems, right?
... murder, they have psychological problems
Behavioral problems
The problem here is that they're leaving and you have to say hi
I think what we should do is
What
Let's say
What
The system should make it easier for a woman to report an act of violence like that, there must be places where a woman can call and have
There are in fact places
Assistance, right?, emotional
There are places
None
There are places.
Really?
But it's not very spread out
Sure, and it seems like it, no?
None
It will have to spread more,
Sure, this yes
No, battered women.
Sure
And
Sure, Wait until they're coming and I have to say hello. I'm also going to download some downloads
Yes, it could be this
It could be this, it could be this
It's really important. There will be a lot of battered women? That you're saying hi to someone? For me it's important a little bit since I don't know the battered women,
It's a difficult topic. It's a complicated topic.
Totally.
No,
Emma caught a cough.
She caught two
Yes, it doesn't matter. Tell me, have you ever hit a woman?
Tell me about your life.
Have you ever hit a woman?
None
Have you ever hit a woman?
A couple of slaps, but
Yes.
Yes
And you, And what you think that's right? I mean.
Have they ever slapped you?
For
Slow. One thing is a little hit, another thing is a beating. That, one second
I don't think any of the things go.
None
Now yes
Okay, sorry
There was a lot of interruption here.
I was saying hi to some people
Sure.
So, what else I hear you?
Today I had nothing. I went walking. Here in Philadelphia a beautiful day. Very cold, but a beautiful day
Nice day, right? Nice day God gave us
It is a nice day. A spectacular day.
Nice day God gave us
I live with my brother right now.
None.

And they gave you a ninety-seven.
We went to hell
Oh, ninety five, around there
In front of the, I'll go back there.
That has a remedy,
You get love handles right in the side.
That's cute, a bit fat at the side
No, it's ok.
Those things happen
You get a belly, love handles
No, no, my belly is not that big because I exercise a lot.
You are doing a lot of excersise.
Sure, now that I'm here, you know, I was living in Argentina and there I can be healthy but since I'm in this country, the food is
Yeah, lots of fast food.
I don't really like the food
Junk food.
Sure, oily, very greasy, lots of fats.
You eat wrong
When I'm in my mom's house, I eat right. But when you eat outside, it's like that.
She cooks fine,
It's complicated
SURE, WHAT DO YOU EAT?
In my brother's
Yes
I eat noodles, meat, escalope, lentils.
And do you cook?
I cook really well.
That's nice.
Oh, my brother is a better cook than I, and he likes it
What do you cook? Do you know how to make cheesecake? I like cheesecake.
I cooked a tejero
Was it good?
Yes but the last time I cooked it was raw and stodgy
Shit, so, it came out wrong
It was by chance, I wasn't familiar with the oven
OH SURE, HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE?
But, well I'm on December thirty.
When
December thirty. And you?
Yes, more or less, for the same date
Look at that,
More or less, and you return
I leave here the fifteenth of March.
You only have fifteen...back in the city
Yes. I spend it, for that date I'm going to be there.
You had mom?
No.
A little Right?
No
Go
I mean, no. Neither one thing, nor the other.
None
Nor do I miss her, nor do I stop missing her much.
None
It's a normal feeling.
And is she alone? live, how many sisters do you have?
In general or here in the United States?
What,
In general, or here in the United States?
No,
In general
Yes
We're not five brothers
Sure
The oldest one is
You're the youngest.  You're the little one.
I'm the little one.
The most, also the prettiest
The aliens [...] Yes.
The prettiest
I already told you
And, what else?
I have a sister that's thirty, a brother that's twenty eight, another sister that's twenty six, it's her birthday today
None
A sister of twenty.
It's her birthday
Two and one of twenty one, i
You have some
I, Chiquilinda (pretty-small).  What a nice nickname, they
The cutie girl, because of being the youngest and cutest.
Look what a beautiful nickname you gave me
Right? How? What others nicknames could you
Good evening, I'm Joe.
Hello, how are you? Good evening, my name is Soledad.
Soledad, where is Soledad from?
From Baltimore.
Baltimore, I was born in Puerto Rico, but I live here in Colorado.
In Colorado,. I've never been there.
Are you from Argentina?
Yes, Argentina
Yes, I've had the chance to talk with several people from Argentina in this type of program.
Yes you are the Puerto Rican with whom I'm talking. I've talked with quite a few Colombians in reality, up to know.
Yes, yes
Yes. Yes.
And how are things there in Baltimore?
Fine, in reality I moved here not too long ago. at the beginning of the year. So like I'm starting to get used to the city, I'm not
Familiar still so to speak.
None
But, I like it for now.
Are you a student at the university?
I'm going to the university, that I still haven't started. I'm about to start in a few days. I'm with my husband, that he works here and well. I go to the university.
How nice.
Yes, we are, for now we are happy.
It is curious, because people from Argentina whom I had talked to, the ladies all of them, are at the university, have something to do with an university career America
Have their husbands too studying there
None
Yes, some are from Massachusetts, from Pennsylvania then now you are from Baltimore
We were living in Philadelphia. we lived there for Four and a half years.
Is there a?
It was time
An Argentinian population there? In that part of the United States?
Yes, we know some Argentinians around there, in Philadelphia, yes.
How good. the subject of today, is delicate,yes and I think that in, the law in the United States, protects a lot women, but there are some places
That, or some States that donÂ´t protect them as much as others.
None
Maybe they donÂ´t respect them. But here in Colorado women are very protected.
They are abused and nothing like that, but when those laws come for example, there are restrictions, like not being near them and that, but
Sometimes they have to base on things, little details, like the man has not done this or that.  They don't put pressure on criminals.
NONE
Sometimes things end in a tragedy.
Yes, it could be. I am not, I am not familiar with the laws related with violence in general. I know they are stable in all the States, but
It looks to me that many times, the, the major problem too, when there are cases of violence is the woman making the report, not, the
In the beginning, most of the women don't want to accept that somehow it is happening, or that they somehow believe the other person.
Will change, or won't do it again, not even once. Whatever excuse the other
Is using to manipulate them, right? Because usually, women are psychologically manipulated by another person somehow.
None
I think that they come from, that maybe one goes to where there have been violence, and maybe they consider it normal
None
Yes, and of course it is never normal but what I mean is that sometimes serious things happen.
It is that they have not been well educated about the matter
None
Ant the other is because of feelings to their wives, because I have seen cases in the TV about
The very tolerant wife doesn't want to break up the family because she is afraid of her husband. Unfortunately, those things end up in tragedy
Sure. Yes, you are right. Yes. About the laws. I am not very aware, but
About whether the woman dares to report or not, I think that after all, they usually have the chance here in this country
Of claiming for respect, and get someone to defend them
Well, one of the countries where the rights of women are more protected.
Is
I know, for some friend's experience and from my ex-wife who is from Mexico, that in many parts of Mexico
None
Women are usually abused and even now not given their rights.
Is it true, I heard in Mexico the women
Or
It is not easy to ask for divorce.
Society is very religious.
It is easier for him right.
Yes, it is very religious society there. It is like Mexico Catholic, and to get divorce there it is very difficult for a woman
But yes, there is divorce of course. What happens is that it is more. It is a mixture of that family, the church, the culture, all that stuff.
If not, the truth is that I donÂ´t understand, because it is not that I am religious, or that the church could defend in the sense that
Even with the divorce it is easier for a man that for a woman. So that is, I don't know, it looks to me so weird, no.
That yes, but here not. Here and it is, when there is a question of divorce
None
The other parts because they donÂ´t agree to be together, well it ends, and if there is a part that does not agree, and the other one wants, anyway
It ends. Here what they do is to send them to a class first, before taking that final step,
None
To see if they change their
Yes.
Of,in some states that is a must right?. Here in Colorado that is a must. if one of the two parts disagree, does not want the divorce well
They take them to counseling. They take the counseling as an obligation, to see if it is possible to do something. If not, well then it ends
The divorce proceeded
I have never heard about a problem of that style, how interesting.
Yes. I does help sometimes. but unfortunately anything can cause a divorce in this modern age. A
Fight, but not a physical fight, but an argument,
Yes
Can end up in a relationship. It is very easy nowadays giving up to anything. I am already tired, I don't want to keep
Married, so they divorce.
None
That, is too easy nowadays divorcing
Sure, I know what you mean
When you marry, the relationship is very deep.
Yes
It must be based on love and principles
Yes
Things must be based on understanding, respect, loving each other, and when these things don't work fine, then
Come all the other problems
Sure
But in a marriage, in any marriage, there will always be a problem. you have to get over it. I guess that you, with your husband, you can't agree with him all the time. Maybe now you have a
...harmonious relationship. Maybe in the past you had some fights, but you learned to work together?
Yes I think every couple has their own Code book, right? For instance we, I don't know, we never
Yes
No matter how angry we are, we never insult each other.
Right
So, since the first day we were boyfriends, that was eight years ago, so, we tried not to insult, so, I think that never was, never made such an insult, never.
Respect is very important. If you don't show respect for the other person, it's difficult.
Let's say Love without respect. No, no. I don't know. It is not love. No.
Exactly
If, also other things were watching at, at the university, I remember that in a class were seeing that violence was not only
Only the physical, but also the emotional.
Yes.
There is for example, the issue of insults.
Very destructive
None
There are many women who abuse men. There are even many women who physically abuse men.
It is fine.
For example, the typical teenager movie, whatever, that the girl saw the boy doing something she did not liked, and suddenly hit him, to me that is violence, physical.
Of course
It is that, and yes, if you see that the woman hits the man, it's like it's not so bad.
What happens if the man hits the woman.
Exactly, I see it the same way.
I don't see any difference. Even if you see with different eyes, the action is the same
I think the same. In this case, both should respect themselves, and if one of them break the rule, the two of them, are as guilty as the other
It does not have to see sex. If the person is male or female, the one who did it, in the modern society and also in the past.
Yes, the man does something thats more condemnable.
None
Yes, what the woman did. But, it's true. The, I've been in relationships where the woman has been, really insulting
And this demoralizes you a lot, and, it's destructive. Very destructive.
Yes, yes. It's very d- Never, I don't know, I think. I try to, I hope I never do it. I don't want to be in a situation either
Very limited, with my husband always. I don't know how to explain it. I never knew, I don't think I've done it. For example, to be with the other person.
I don't know. There are situations sometimes you can with a little limit.
Yes
That if an insult escapes. No, I'm not saying it's justified, I'm saying that it can happen and well, nothing happens.
The topic is that here, especially the young people, in this country, I see a lot, and in Argentina too, and from there we go and try to very
Very disrespectfully. So how it loses the value. I don't know, it mixes
It's a, something that contaminates
The things.
The relation between marriages and courtships is what's included in the business.
Inge
William Hello
Christian?
My name is William
William, how are you?
Fine and you? What is you name?
It looks like we are talking again.
How was?
You are from Miami, right?
Did I talked to you before?
Yes, I think so.
Are you Chilean?
Yes
Thanks to God I remembered Unfortunately
Inge
Inge, How are you doing?
Very well and you?
Fine, I am cooking, a bread-crumbed steak, tutun, rice, black beans.
Look how you punish yourself
Sure baby the more greasy the better, more energy.
The say so
Alright. What are we talking about today? because I was cooking my steak and I don't even know what the girl said
The woman said the subject was, where would you like to live? Do you like the outskirts, or the city? Where would you rather?
Where do you live now? Is it city or country? Basically that. I live in the outskirts, near Washington. In a small town, but not too big.
I have never been to Washington, but I've heard it is very uptight
None
It is very uptight up there?
I live close to Washington but not near.
Yes, and I never
I live about one hour from there
Have you never met President Bush around there?
No,
Hasn't he knocked on your door asking for the vote or something?
Not at all
Shit, what a bad guy!
Yes
With all the Hispanic votes he got
But
Was the name of your relative, Camila?
Camila?
No, I was wrong, It is that I have spoken to two or three girls
Really, have you talked to someone else from chile?
Yes I talked to three Chilean, that never happened before
I think I have met only offer a Chilean in my life, and by phone I have known three
Where do you live?
You want to talk about that I live in Miami
Do you live in the city?
Yes, the truth.
Do you like the city?
I love the city
Why?
Because there are many things, there is always something happening, there is people from everywhere, but well what can I say
Yes
I truly love the city because the beach clubs. There are beautiful women around the world in Miami. I went to New York and I went to Los Angeles.
I've been to Tennessee and many places in the United States. But everyone is in Miami, where I have never seen such beautiful women.
Women are very sexy. The only girl I met from Chile, a very pretty girl, of German descent
Okay
But she was very pretty
None
You should visit Miami some day
Yes I've gone a couple of times
You don't like it?
Three times I like the beach of course, very pretty, but I don't like the cities I prefer to live in the outskirts.
Three times. You like to live in the small towns
Yes I like to live in a small city, not too many people, not too much noise, full patio, full garden. I like that, I'm not a city person, I don't like it, I lived all my life in the city.
None
When I was little, the traffic and the people, no.
From what they tell me Santiago de Chile is quite a big city
It's very big and very nice, not that ugly, but honestly, I prefer the tranquillity with nature types of things.
Listen
I like to have my garden with flowers and such.
Then you like, spending a lot of time landscaping putting your little flowers and making them grow
Yes, exactly.
What a thing, that's a very nice thing in women, is a very feminine thing.
With my husband we are into peace and not night life
No
No, we were when we met, but now
I will ask you.
We do other things
Inge, I ask you something, How old are you?
I'm thirty five,
Twenty but you are young girl, you can still go out every now and then.
Yes, true. Neither of us likes to drink. We don't drink much. We are not too fond of it.
No, but you don't have to go out to drink to have fun. A couple can go out to dance from ten at night until five in the morning
Yes, but you know we have two small kids. then
But one, is what I tell you, every now and then when you can get a babysitter or whatever you want to call it. And you go out, because I think a fundamental thing in a couple.
Would be every now and not also do it like we used to do it when we were twenty years old, no but every now and then go out, and dance, and have a good time
Yes
Go out a lot.
Yes we have a good time
How long have you been married?
Five years, no, six years.
Six years.
None
How is married life treating you?
Very good
Very good, Where is your husband from?
Yes he's American.
But you made out good girl, just so you know.
I was lucky, because he's a very good person,
You know, we the Latins with the Americans, I think they can with us
Why?
I think they are a they have a more passive mentality
None
The Hispanic have more liveliness, more blood, we can beat them if we want
None
But no, if you are happy, it doesn't matter if you are American, Peruvian, Chinese. Nothing matters
I think it depends on the personality of the person. Because, I have never had a couple who was not, like, stranger, but I never had a Chilean or Latin couple
Never
No
No, I never
And
I had a lot of friends, yes, but as a couple it didn't work out
And so
Lets's say I never had
In other words, you always liked the Americans
No, I always liked the foreigners, They weren't chauvinist,which is important to me.
Now, tell me something, what is chauvinist to you? because every woman, or most of them have a different concept of the meaning of chauvinism
What is chauvinist to you?
It's not just one thing, I think it is a way of thinking, a way of seeing life. It is not one single thing
Explain it to me me so I can understand it.
For example, in my country men think that, having much experience and many women, and going out with many at the same time, they are a very macho man and they talk a lot this way.
Much dirty language, many things
And the foreigners.
What happened is that I studied engineering, so I was in an environment of men,
Okay
Then, after a time, you know them, they are friends. You know how they think, and how not everybody is alike.
But most of them are a little bit sexist
Then, I would not stay
Less flexible
Yes, okay. I would not be wrong by saying to you that American people and foreigners are much more flexible in treating a woman.
My experience is that it could be that not
You know
I would say that American and European women are in general, much more emancipated than Chileans.
Well see, I am going to tell you a thing, my wife, is American,
None
She is an American from Minnesota, now I am going to tell you a thing, I am going to give you an example,maybe. Two, I am going to give you an extreme example, see it.
When I was with Cubans or Nicaraguans, or with any Latin Woman, I told her I am going to go out on Friday. I'll come back at two or three. I am going to go out with my friends. We are going to go around and dance.
You are crazy, what do you think, do you understand me, that crazy thing, they broke a stick on your head.
None
My woman is American and I always tell her that I will come back in a few hours.
Well.
OK, I will wait for you until 3 o'clock. You know what I mean.
Yes
The problem for Latinos is the way we are raised as children, that it is not good for men to have a lot of women.
The men can have many women, as long as none of them has dreams of being wives, A man could have all the women in the world as long as they know it.
And you?
Is only a concept because I believe in my country. I cannot talk much about other Latinos because I do not know them.
None
In my country the men are individualists
What are women like?
They are the owners of the cows, in that sense
How are the women over there in your country?
Women are always trying to please man, dress nice,there is nothing wrong with that because everything is a game between women and men.
Okay
But the man is usually the King and the woman tries to please him.
Yes. My country Cuba is the same, but there is more equality
Yes
You see how things are in your country.
I believe that. I have been to many places in South America, the United States, and Europe
In the Latin countries women live as in the 50
Yes
You understand something like a trophy.
Exactly
When women leave their country and come here go all the freedom that women have here
What do you think about us when we watch TV shows such as the following:
Hello?
Hello?
Who am I talking to?
My name is Vilma
Where are you from Vilma
I'm from Bolivia and you?
Bolivia, I'm from Puerto Rico, but I live here in Texas, where do you live?
I live in Maryland
Way up there
Yes, on the other side
How did you end up there, man!
Yes, a lot of years ago. And you?
I've been here for over twenty years now.
Okay I've been here for about fifteen years
Yes, well, almost the same
Yes. Do you live in the cit or far away from it?
I do. I live about twenty minutes away from the city.
None.
I'm a bit close but not that much, and you?
Yeah, me neither, I live far away from the city. Where I live there's no public transportation.
Oh, how is your work?
I have to drive all the time.
OK how much time do you take to go to work?
Yes, it is about 20 miles and when there is no traffic I take about 30 minutes.
You like to live out side of the city right?
Yeah, well at first, when I got home from Bolivia, I would have loved to live in Washington because I used to live in the city.
Cars, people and everything but living in the city could be dangerous
Yes
I used to drive in Bolivia and then I came here.
The roads are the same. The truth is that I didn't want to drive.
I had to wait for my husband to take me to places, such as the market and things like that.
Yes
Once I started to drive, I began to work outside of the house. Now, I love it, because it is very simple and calm.
The neighborhood, it is truth that when we arrived there were not many Latinos , until now there are very few Latinos that live here.
Really?
None
What about you house is it closed or very far away?
THERE IS A LOT OF HOUSES IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD BUT THERE IS NOT PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION NEAR THE HOUSE.
Well it is an old town, which is why they don't allow public transportation.
Yes
To, like five minutes away from my house, you can take the bus that leaves at like six in the morning and that takes you to the metro.
Yeah
There's only one at six, and the other one is at night, at six. And that is all
Do you have children, Vilma?
I have three
How old are they?
My children, the older is already twenty-five, and the other, small one, is twenty.,
I wasn't going to ask you to move to the city. That is what keeps me outside the city, having my children. My kids right now are
None
Now my girl's thirteen, and the boy he's already nineteen, but when they were smaller,
None
Influenced me a lot to live outside the city.
Sure that's the truth. When we came here at the beginning, we came to Virginia, the first year that we were here.
None
The truth is that we were a little scared,
None
Well, to move us here, far enough away from the city, more than anything it was for my daughters, because they were just so small, and I didn't want them to have to grow up in that kind of environment, that
You know, that sometimes they go out and you lose your influence.
No, sure, sure. Exactly. But and everything, not that they're already older.
But
If the opportunity presents itself of moving closer to the city would you move?
Don't think so. But you know what. From what you say, it seems to you that it was far, but is not, because Washington
The capital, driving is thirty minutes from my house.
None
Yes, i could find a job in Washington.
But not move to live there. No
Yes, when I moved to this house, the things were very remote, but now is like the city is catching up to me.
Exactly.
So
You're right, because here the same thing is happening. When we had just moved, there was a lot of space, I even think there were mere farms here.
But now if you see, everything is construction, It has totally become populated, that
Yes, yes.
Imagine that perhaps from now to a few years, they will decide to put, public transportation
Yes, yes. They most probably will. They are progressing so much
Sure
The street before mine is where the transportation comes up to.
So you don't drive there in Texas?
I don't go on the bus anywhere.  I've always driven.  Although it is the next street, it's quite out of the way.
It is not like that in the neighborhood
None
It's like ten minutes.
OKAY
In, between street,
I see
It far away to go by foot.
Okay
For example, my son, he's looking for a job but he can't go there until I buy him a car.
None
I'd have to drop him off pretty early in the bus so that he could go somewhere.
Are you old enough to drive?
Yes, he does drive but he does not have a car
None
Yes, he had one, I bought him one but he had an accident and he totaled the cars son, no, I haven't bought him another one. I told him
Yes
I thought he wasn't ready for another car.
Sure. You live in the city's outskirts because of the danger?
They were born here but since I got here I'd always tell myself, oh
Stay out of the city.
None
Because of the schools I'm used to it, but it is quite far away. It takes me around
Thirty, forty minutes to get to work.
Driving, yes.
In the morning, driving. Yes, it's twenty-seven miles away, but with the traffic
That's the problem.
Yes, it makes it
That's why I leave super early. I leave my house at six thirty. Then I avoid all that traffic, and that
Yes I leave late because I take my daughter to school at eight and then I go to work at nine.
So you live, you work in the city?
Yes
In the center
I work near the downtown area of Houston
Oh okay. I can imagine that the traffic there must be terrible.
Terrible. I've had to learn all the little streets that go by the back
None
To be able to get to my house, when I leave here. because in the morning there's not much work arriving because I already, leave quite
Late.
Yeah.
When I leave at five, five-thirty from here to get home, I have to look for other little streets that take me
If not ,it takes you two hours.
And sometimes those streets because everybody starts to learn about those streets and then continue.
Yeah
Going out to other places
The only,disadvantage is that when it snows, you can delay any quantity, it can come up to the house.
Yes, here.
Above all if it's a heavy snow.
We don't have snow here, but we have a lot of water when it rains. It floods
Floods?
We have a lot of floods. Yes, and they don't let us go out because of the floods. It will be two in the afternoon and I don't get back to my house until seven at night.
Wow
Where I wanted to be, the water was really high, so I couldn't. In the end I had to.
You're talking about the recent ones that they had this, this past year?
Yes. And this month we haven't had it like this, but last year we had a lot like this. And I gave myself up in the last one, stopped in
A gas station, and I stayed there until the water went down.
Wow. And tell me something, and once your
Yes, but
Your kids get out of high school, will you move or do you want to keep living there?
I just bought this house six months ago.
Yeah
So,  I'll stay here until I die. Because I hate to move.
Yes, truthfully, I feel the same, I don't like it at all
And the thing with this house is that the elementary school is
None
It's behind the house.
None
I'm thinking about the future, when my children get married and have children, they can bring their children to go to
School there, they can come to my house.
Yeah
I've thought about all that
You're really thinking about the future.
Imagine that, my daughter's thirteen, and my son doesn't even have a girlfriend.
My oldest is twenty five
She's still
She bought her house last year and she moved out
Yes?, that's good
That was sad.
That's good, and what do you work in?
I'm sorry?
What do you work in?
I work for one of the counties here, of the school
None
Yes
You work directly with schools or
We work directly with families. We sign up all families that come from all over the world that speak a second language
People born in another country signs up on the county i live in, or the one i work for
Oh, so you're practically with the government.
Yes, for the government. Do you work for the government, too?
No, I'm with a private company that rents tanks
Ok
The tanks that carry beer or
NONE
Or
Yeah
Chemicals, or different places, so, it's a private company, European
That's wonderful
Yes, and how did you find out about these studies?
One of the counselors at my work let me know and i signed up. I find it interesting, because you meet people from different countries
Yes
That are in different states
Yes, i have been talking to a lady from Chicago
Oh yes?  Can you get to talk to the same person again?
Yes sometimes the person that they put you with.  they pair you up with a person, but I've gotten the same one twice.
How nice.
You know
No, the truth that I, this is the second time, because the other times that they've called me just happened I was doing something important, and I can't talk
Then
Yes
The previous time I spoke with, that I don't even remember his name, a guy from Paraguay I think, I don't remember. Sorry, what's your name?
Yes, Lurdes.
Lurdes.
Lurdes, yes, from Houston, Texas
Okay.
None
Hello?
Good afternoon
Yes, good afternoon. My name is Gloria and I'm from California
Hi how are you? My name is Mauricio. I'm in Charlotte City in North Carolina.
Nice to meet you
How are you?, fine?
Fine, thank you
The subject is cool
None
About the city
Right
I like to live in a quiet city more than a smaller city
None
I'm out of the gym now and that doesn't have a lot of noise.
Right
I would like a smaller city. I think that the one I'm in is a pretty small city. The part I know is quiet.
Although I've seen other cities like that, around Charlotte, that are of a more like, more country-like style, right?
None
None
None
I was even living in Miami, but we decided to come here searching for peace also.  Searching for peace.
None
I think that the best for me and my family is a small and peaceful city.
None
I don't know for you.
They used to live in the country and more isolated from the city.
Yes.
Because of the studies and all that, as I grew up I had to decide already, so to speak, to be in the city where there are more opportunities, right?
Where are you from?
I'm from Guatemala
Is that Mexico?
No, Guatemala, in Central America.
Guatemala
None
Guatemala.
Aha, and for the studies, I had to go to the capital city.
Yes.
Where everything is very different.
Yes.
Up the kind of people and everything is different, right?
Yes.
They go on adapting themselves to the environment and to social frictions. The house of my dreams doesn't have any.
Illusions because I know that maybe it will be fulfilled sooner or later, but I don't like wealth, let's say it that way.
Yeah
No, I like emotionally, sentimentally, and economically, not like a millionaire, but enough to pay for the necessities, right? And, yeah my dream house of course I would like it
Yeah, of course.
That way in a remote place like in the country
Yeah.
I don't know, I imagine it like a paradise.
That's cool.
None
My house and my dream, in a little quiet tranquil place like a field
At the same time close to the city where
Mm-hmm.
You suppose is the source of employment, right?
Yeah, it's like that.
That's my dream.
Mm-hmm.
I had it in Colombia, but because of the problems there with public order and threats of guerrilla warfare, we had to leave for the US with our family.
None
Because we lived in a city, or in a town that was near a city as we called it over there, about thirty minutes from it and it was like that
I've seen, here in North Carolina, very beautiful sectors.
What happens is that everything is very expensive.
None
BUT THAT WOULD BE MY DREAM, TO BE ABLE TO FIND A HOUSE, NEAR THE CITY,BUT AT THE SAME TIME, AWAY FROM THE CITY
None
Away from the noise but near, where there's vegetation where there are trees, where one sees green, nature
None
And that would be my dream
None
I think God will make it a reality. It is my hope.
Yes, that's worth dreaming
None
None
The big city - I don't like it, or I would like it as a vacation for a while.  For example, a city like Miami.
Going on vacation and returning.
Is more hectic, I say, here is more complicated I say. The running around of every day.
Yes. That's how it is.
None
That's how it is.  He runs. He runs every day.
None
What we want a peaceful city a house in the country
None
Where there's not a lot of noise and that we can that we can also work. That is near work. And where we can raise our kids
None
God give us the place where we live.
Yes.
Where we want to be
None
Well we want to be
It would be very nice.
And I'm now in a gym because the city leads one
To not exercise or even walk, because everything is in the car.
None
Everything has changed for us since we arrived here in the United States but there are many places where one can
Go and exercise, is a matter of organizing your time.
None
Be organized in your things because also walking is good.
Yes, is like that.
It's very useful, and sometimes you don't look at that but it's a matter of getting in order
None
Managing your time.
None
Do you have the chance to exercise there?
Oh, yes,
Are you in California?
Yes, that's how I go. I have forty-five minutes to go there and forty-five minutes or an hour on the way back.
None
I go to school
Yes
I'm studying
Yes, yes, oh, yeah
Because all the comfort here. Everything's near, so you stop exercising your muscles
Yes, and how long have you been in the United States?
I have what, i haven't been here for long, like eight years
I've only been here for a year.
None
Yes
But you do have to get used, right?
Yes, it depends on what one wants, because it depends on if there is opportunity to exercise a job.
But one can get organized, one can look, let's say, the way of finding the ideal place little by little, right?
None
Little by little I, for example, up to now we are coming to exercise with the kids, to do sports because in life it's necessary
Is necessary
It's true
The same the dream we have of a house is usually something peaceful, rural.
None
But that at the same time is near the city.
What happens is that yes, no, just not so far from the city for the same that sometimes there are emergencies and all that
And for work also
Here in the place where I'm at, there's not much demand of work. There's not much work and if I found one, that it pays too little.
No? yes
It cost a lot
No, yes.
They pay too little and I was telling my husband to immigrate to another place
Yes.
There's not a lot of work. Bring some applications in several place, one calls immediately, and, they have one like that
Yes, sure.
None
The question they asked is if you would like to go to a place like that.
I think I'm in a place more or less like that.
None
Everything, where there's vegetation, where there's nature
I would like a place like that.
And there are many little towns or cities nearby.
None
Where they are thirty minutes, twenty minutes away is, is the possibility, right?
None
We are happy here, we're good
That is the, the important, thing is being happy in the place, right? where
Yes, we are happy thanks
None
We are happy and we are
None
Are thinking in settling down also, right?
Yes, that's it.
None
Yes, I would like to change course because it is not good here.
Okay, yes.
The truth is that the outlook is not too good.
Yes
Things are getting more complicated that they don't want to give licenses.
None
Everything is getting complicated, each day the doors for people are closing more, then there are less jobs
Yes, sure.
There are less jobs.
Yes, sure.
None
We, thank God, have the blessing of having the papers.
None
We have a work permit and like that well
None
It has been easier, so to speak although it's been hard, but, but all in all it's been easy. It has, it has been easy.
That's how we are  on that part.on that part we are fine. That's what I tell my husband, why stagnate in one place
One has the opportunity to progress That's the most important thing
Yes.
For one, to have something which to rely on, a good social and all that.
Sure yes
Since he has already been eight years with that company, he doesn't want to leave anymore.
That's good too.
None
To have stability in your job and all of that
He's not earning that much money, he just works.
You know them, no, you shouldn't experiment with, how?
He earns too little and he works so, we are never going to be able to get a
I see
We are never going to reach our goals, right?
None
None
Yes is the lady not working anymore?
No. I don't want my girl to. She's just eleven months old.
She's a baby
So he doesn't want me to because of the girl.
She's more important.
Yes, the girl can say if she is being well treated or not. You know, some people here treat children very badly.
People that are caring for them.
No, she's our priority
He says no
Hi, my name is Miriam
Hi, what's up?, my name is Luca
Hi, Luca, how are you?
What's up?
I never find you at nine
How are you? How is the weekend?
It's been quiet
Yes, you had a holiday there too
No, not a holiday
It's a holiday here, Martin Luther King's
No, there's no holiday here
How's the weekend?, how was it?
Quiet, church on Sunday, swimming on Saturday.
Yeah, where?
It's a community center i take them to
They have what, a closed pool, right?
Yes, a closed pool and the water is a bit cold, but you have to move, otherwise, you'd freeze
Don't you get sick, you get a cold after that don't you?
Yeah, there was a terrible cold, but thank God I have a car, so we get into that old car
It's OK
But you have to take the bus, imagine the, on Saturday it was very, very cold, a horrible wind
Did it rain there?
No it didn't rain, but there have been other days when it has
None
We can't complain, on saturday... it's cold today too. But no, we can't complain because i don't know, winter's usually cold, like today, like saturday, but
Yes
However, it's warm. It even went up to eight for a day.
Wow
And it's supposed to raise tomorrow.
Yesterday it was freezing cold. Terrible
Yes, it's very cold here nowadays, but it will get warm again, right?
I hope so, but yesterday they lent us a car and the door handles got frozen
None
You couldn't open it
What did you do?
We had to. We were waiting like that.
Right
There was a sort of icing on the glass.
Right
We weren't used to it because we didn't have a car until now, so we don't have a stick to take the ice off either
Right.
I don't know what it's called, my husband went there and he brought one of
Right.
The bath dryer we use to dry the floor
I do enjoy my rum when its snowy outside.
Yes
That little brush you're talking about
Yes
That one takes a lot
Yes
It's smaller
The snow was a frozen layer of ice
Eight
I don't know, it probably would have been better to get it out with hot water.
Later, but it's true
And how?
But i see now that in some stores  I'm sorry to interrupt
Yes
I've seen some commercials in stores now that I was watching TV
Yes
The defroster seems to be instantaneous
None
That you have to buy it or put it
But, it's like a liquid.
It's like a liquid.
That, you put on the windshield.
Yeah, but you put it inside
None
The hood and you plug it to the tube
None
And it says it's very easy, that you plug it I don't know where
Yeah
They tell you it's just a matter of knowing where to put it, and it says it gets defrosted right away.
Wow
I haven't dared yet
Sure
Yeah, and when the door doesn't open, you need to have alcohol at hand
None
They also sell that at stores, it's cheap
Yes
Sometimes they get to settling down, I saw a boy in the Church who couldn't even open the door and a gentleman loaned him a quarter right there
I didn't know that
I told the gentleman that it's that, and he told me, its like a liquor that warms your gut really quick
But they threw it out into the street
He look it
None
Prum, they threw him. They tried to enter the handle, so that he would move
And your son doesn't like anything?
The only thing he likes is having a good time.
None
He loves it.
And nothing good?
He learns when he's with me when I'm at his side, he gets into everything because I support him
Yes
I tell him sometimes, I don't want to tell you, yes you can like that, you already know, getting the kids all excited
Yeah
It's very important,
Are many children in the pool?
No, there weren't many around for us; two families more but that's it.
None
But when it's summer, you have not even a space in which to  move.
Sure
Already in winter is nice because not that many people go
In summer, are there outdoor pools?
Also there's plenty of outdoor pools,
How nice.
In summer we go here to one nearby. And speaking of pools and all and that the time gets cold and all.
Then you live in the city or outside of the city.
Is a city, that i mean,that has the name of a city I mean city no. is not, as big as a city, let's say there's city of Boston which is big.
None
Also is not as big as the cities of South America.
None
This would be like a suburb.
None
But it's called city and it's not like country. We don't need a car.
None
There two blocks from us is a big supermarket. four blocks away there's another, five blocks away in the center, with restaurants. Then there is not country.
And I don't know. How is it where you live?
Also like that
Yes
It's the city, Peru, i lived outside the city
Houses very far apart from each other.
No, the houses were together because they were like organizations
None
But anyways, you had to go to Lima to find the most important things, to downtown
Yes
Yes, but that was in my time. I've gone there too, in 2002, and it's more advanced. You can find everything.
Sure
Having your money
Sure
Work, you don't even have to move from there
Yeah. Would you like a place less central in Canada?
No, I'm very much the city type.
Yes
I don't know how to live in places, far away like that, i don't like that
Yes
I don't trust loneliness
Sure
I like things closer.
Yes
For example, you see the pools. I don't know if places like that will have them
Yes the truth is I think that you are very dependent of the autos
And of the electricity
Yes
I'm very dependeny, I like the light, and the heat, the microwave, all those electric things that work without effort
Yes no sure
You Luca?
And me, well in Buenos Aires I lived in a city, and I never had the chance to live like that in the country, but since I always liked the animals I thought that I would like to live in the country.
None
When we lived in Israel, we lived in a city that is more rural.
None
City or no city is the same.
Yes
Let's say, there are people that live close to farms, but they live not to far from cities, then if you need something,
None
There's always a supermarket nearby
None
I always thought that I would like to live in a city
No
I don't know how I would get along, I think that perhaps to raise the family, it must be nice.
Okay
But it also depends of the places because in Argentina is like, The countrysides don't have very good education around. The schools are like rural schools and are not as good like,
Don't worry in emergencies.
, yes, it could be, perhaps since I never lived in the country, it's like a hope that one has.
Okay.
And
And why don't you try?
Because here in Boston, the country is very expensive, no.
None
In the United States is very expensive and in Argentina you live, if you have your family in the city. I think that they city is better.
The majority go to the city because imagine
So that they help you, yes.
So that your expenses are less
Yes, being a veterinarian, it would be more useful living in the country perhaps closer to the cows and the horses and the sheep
None
I don't know if other people have much work in the country.
I think that being a veterinarian in the United States would make you good money because in the United States, they charge a lot for even a consultation.
Yes
The veterinarians are really expensive.
Yes, that's true, but also there are many that are very pressured with the issue of
Okay
Of the trials.
Okay
The horses are very expensive.
None
If it is true that one performans a treatment that does not go well, one may have committed malpractice.
Affects the horse. There are some that are susceptible and one doesn't know.
None
Then there's the trial, and trials are so expensive that
None
All the veterinarians have insurance,
Their body of veterinarians
Yes, you have to, but one gets out of college and has an attorney and has to be insured. Same with animals
Small animals
None
If there is a bad treatment or the dog has an allergic reaction the owners may take you to court, and you will be paying them for life.
That is not malpractice, that it has no reason to be malpractice.
None
I know three people that were veterinarians of horses in Argentina.
None
After coming to the United States they have worked about ten years at a horse veterinary clinic, which they say is very stressful due to the pressure that the owners place on them.
Oh, the owners.
Then they left that on the side and started to do small animals.
None
They say that it makes a lot of money until I see the money, I have to give all the and that.
I don't know anything about that, and I've never heard anything. The only thing I know is that people complain that they are expensive.
Having a little dog or animal is very expensive in Canada, or in these countries.
None
Not like our countries. They are sometimes left there. Poor ones. They just give them a shot, I think
Yes here a lot of shots are mandatory every year.
Okay
You don't have any animals.
Today, no, almost almost I was in the store, I remember ready to
Yes
Buy some birds because my son wanted.
Yes
I said that to tech him responsibility. My mom told me to start with a plant. He let the paint dry out
None
Hello.
Hello, how are you? My name is Karina.
Hello, how are you? My name is Leticia.
What
Are you from Washington?
How are you? Yes.
I spoke with you the other day.
Really? I can't believe it.
Argentina.
Yes, Are you the girl from San Martin?
Yes.
And could it be they connect us on purpose?
How funny.
I can't believe it, it is the first time that this same thing happened. It hasn't been that long that I've been using the system, right?
That you talk twice with the same person.
Yes. Has it ever happened to you?
Yes, it happened to me, but not that many times. I think it happened just once.
Girl, that we should I don't know, play the lottery or something. But well no.
How funny.
Terrible. Well, we have to talk about where we live and that possible and if you want later we can keep on talking about San Martin.
None
What does it have to do with that?
You who live in the center?
I have a story appropriate to this question of where to live. When you change
None
The country, first you don't know where you are going, you meet the truth when you arrive, and then
Yes
I came to Maryland university and thought it was inside a city. I never imagined that the outskirts here were so different
Different to the outskirts in South America
Yes
I imagined that I would walk the streets, or get off the metro and I would be in the University
Here in Maryland
None
How is it on, what city are you in?
In Philadelphia
In Philadelphia, I wonder if it will be the same, but the outskirts area is for people who have a house, car, garden
Yes
And obviously there is no sidewalk to walk
No, yes
It's all roads and highways, even to take the bus you have to cross through dangerous places because it is like stopping in the middle of the road
Yes. yes. yes. yes.
At the beginning I lived there in College Park near the University of Maryland.  During the first year, I felt that
I wasn't living in the United States that I imagined.
How far is the University from the center of Washington?
If you take the subway to the university, in twenty minutes you are in the center.
Sure.
In twenty minutes you are in the area so to speak of the bars and the cafes. If you want to go to Downtown which is where it is
Yes
For example, the White House
Yes.
You take a little longer, but not more than half an hour.
Sure.
How long would it take me from San Martin to the center?
Sure, as which
Then I.
Yes, but here in Philadelphia the suburbs are different. The suburbs are prepared for the people that have cars.
The same happens to you.  You want to do things on you own or even use the public transportation which is another issue
Yes, that there isn't much besides
No. The truth that no
What did you do? Did you then move?
Sure so, well, I stayed there the first year because
Yes, I didn't know yes
You really don't know anything and right away I didn't know where to look for a yearly contract, I was near the school that year.
I came to Washington around five times.
Sure.
To visit the museums but it was just so hard
And yes.
The subway station, for example, I lived in an apartment that was about five minutes away from the subway station and I could even walk there
It was about eight blocks away , you had to walk through.
Yes
None
None
A freeway, it was impossible, really dangerous, it was
Yes.
All very lonely and
Yes.
Dangerous, so I was angry! The station was right there, but if you wanted to go downtown,
You couldn't walk there.
Yes, if you didn't have a car you weren't able to do, you understand? So I moved to D.C.
Sure.
I prefer to take a subway since it takes twenty minutes to the station
None
Have a shuttle, too.
Yes.
That takes you by the different buildings in campus
Yes.
Then there's one that goes from College Park station to the university. If you want to walk is fifteen minutes walking if not, well take that shuttle
Very good.
Then
Sure, and now that you are in the center of D.C
Sure, and now I moved. To the area of Columbia Heights, no it is not the center because the rent is very expensive in that city. I don't know.
Yes, here too
Is terribly expensive.
Yes, here is also expensive.
That's also an issue because each neighborhood according
Yes
Here they call that centrification, and they are renovating neighborhoods that were of old houses
Yes.
That many families lived in the same house and they were destroying all, it is being renovated, increasing the rent
None
Companies that buy houses cheaply, fix them, raise the rent, then the Afro-Americans and Latinos have to move out of the neighborhood.
Of course
This is what is happening in that zone. If you can, I ended up moving as well for that reason, how they were raising the rents, right?
Of course, let's say you aren't right downtown but you are in, let's say, D.C.
Of course, no, what happens is that I lived there before, to go walking from the bars to my house, if I
Stayed out till two in the morning when they closed the bars I could go walking to my house or take a taxi that wasn't very expensive
Of course.
I moved to where a metro station was before , because then I can return to my house.
None
It's more residential where I live.
Of course.
There aren't many cafes, bars, or that kind of thing. But all those who come to the university,  I recommend that they try and move as well because in reality
The rent, if you look in a neighborhood like mine, is the same as what you would pay to, for a rental near the university because they take advantage of being near the university
None
The difference isn't great
None
The only advantage for students is that nothing is closer to the university, it depends what you want to do with your life, right?
No, I understand you. yes, here there are cheaper ones but you also have to have a car in the center, in the center of the city.
Uh-huh.
But if you were to live in the suburbs, you would have to have a car. I do because
And what is the advantage of living in the suburbs? Here in D. C. rich people prefer to live in the suburbs.
If you rent in the center for the same amount in the suburb you can rent a house with a gym.
Of course
With a little park, I don't know.
None
For the other part, I understand that people who have children say that schools are better, but
It is said that schools in downtown D.C. are bad
Of course.
Because of that the suburbs have their rent with respect to good schools around the area.
It would be more expensive to have a car in the city.
None
Don't pay in the suburb. If I had to pay for parking, it is very expensive and if you don't pay, you have to park very far.
Yes, the problem of parking here is terrible too, yes. And how is that?
Many times from where you live.
Do you use public transport?
Yes. Inside Philadelphia the center of the city is good. I like the center of Washington
The paths are a very normal part of a city
Yes, yes
And you have a lot of
Those are not the suburbs?
Yes, yes, yes, there is also a trolley and the trains go to the suburbs but overall it seems like a city in teh United States that normally does not have much public transportation, here there's a lot
How nice
It's not same as here in Argentina obviously
YES, THE DIFFERENCE IS, HOW PATRIOTIC, BUT I'M NOT THAT WAY, WHAT I SEE HERE IS THAT ONLY THE YOUNG PEOPLE USE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION HERE
Yes
Sick people and me or people like us
Yes
However, in other countries, you see a mix of things in public transportation.
Of course
Subway and a there's a kid and a guy that asks
Yes
But the people mix in that area
Yes, as such.
On the other hand, not much in the subway, but I would say in the shared transport more than anything else
Yes, no. You also notice the difference here, yes
I don't know why.
It's like big difference with what they went through at least in Argentina
Of course. And you think
But
Do you consider if you want to go to the city? Or that is, in regard to where you would like to live?
I don't know
You have never lived in a the suburb in Philadelphia?
No, I don't know. The decision is like complicated. I mean yes, I like to live in the city, but I would also like to have a house. I mean
Sure, in the house, fine.
It's both things. It would be good to have a house and not live in a small apartment.
Sure Well I here rent a house with two roommates because we don't have enough like to rent a house for just me in D.C. no.
Sure.
None
None
The apartment is a lot.
Yes, that's why. It's like that contrast. On one hand it's good. Plus I don't know I travel a lot
Sure.
In the daytime but I don't know
But there
On top here in Philadelphia is between the center of the city and the suburbs. There's a border
Head
That surrounds Philadelphia is horrible.
Is like you are in an impassable belt.
Is terrible, ugly, belt
None
Dangerous, either you live in the center or live in the suburbs, you have to
BUT IS NOT SUCH A GOOD STATEMENT.
I don't know. You cannot live a little closer to the center because you already get into that area
Sure.
No, then
Like there are no places like those that are not in the center
None
But they are neighborhoods.
Is much smaller I mean.
Sure.
It's not of having
No. Yes.
Those neighborhoods.
Sure, but here you do have dangerous areas. They say that here the statistics
Yes.
There are really very dangerous neighborhoods in D.C.  They tell you, don't rent by there.
None
Supposedly where I live is good because of recycling. There are some students of mine for example that are living here.
I don't know because the people from the suburb think that the capital
Yes.
Know, but the neighborhood would be like the collect
Right?
I don't know, it's all very...
Yes, they're afraid of a lot of things, but also the suburbs
They're not so safe either.  There's no
Yes
Yes, t's a matter of paranoia
The, the nice neighborhood there is Georgetown,
I haven't been in that neighborhood. It collects for
Right
For us, right?
Because it's beautiful
It's beautiful, it's one of the oldest there, there's where the Jesuit's university is, Georgetown University
None
And the most expensive stores and cafes are there, for older people, teenagers don't go there, there aren't any disco's there, so
Yeah, sure
Teenagers, right? The nice neighborhood called
None
It's a gay neighborhood, but the elegant gay trend, it's more artsy
Yes
There's a bunch of

Yes, super good I tell you now I'm living here in the city, in Center City yes, I like it, I like to live in
I live in the city. Really deep in the city.
Did you live in the city there in Argentina
Yes my life yes, but what happens is that the city where I lived in Argentina is a small city
Okay
It is not as big as here, like Philadelphia then Eh, it was more kind, kind of a city, but kind of a village also I mean
Okay
Which is a city, but also it was like a forest outside a village.  It wasn't such a big city like here.  Philadelphia.
Yes,
We had the ocean. It makes it all a little warmer. Everything was smaller. Not like here where all is cement.
Okay
Many people, but at the time you are here is good no, is not the house of my dreams where I'm at, the apartment of my dreams but
Where in Texas are you living?
Well, I'm in Houston, Texas.
None
I live in an apartment. I really, well, I like Texas a lot, basically I mean being from Puerto Rico, well, is like
I run from the cold, for me whatever is cold, I don't like too much
Sure
I can go. I have traveled to many different states but most that I have been to have been
I don't know how and well that well, I liked a lot but even so
Is it nice there?
Yes is too cold like that like saying Pennsylvania or Canada, or something like that no not at all
No,
I have to live in the city.  I like both but mainly the city
In Puerto Rico I lived in San Juan
None
Which i sthe capital? All is very urban.
Sure
I need to have buildings near me. I need a lot of stores by the apartment. I like to go to the bars.
That's good sure
And also more for the social life. I like to go out.
For the social life
I like sports, going to concerts,
Sure
That's why
A real city dweller
That's why I wouldn't like to live in, like to say in a rural area
In the country, in the middle of a mountain alone
Exactly, not but I like, yes, I love to go Camping things like that so yes, for me when they say the house of your dreams well
What I would like to have? My house
None
On the city, but i would also like to have a cabin,  where i can go camping or spending a weekend on the mountains, see the snow
Right
But that, that's
For vacations only
Exactly, right?, like
Just for a few days
Not to live
My dream home. I would like to have money and buy a condo in front of the sea. That would be
OK
A condo in front of the sea.
I remember
I would be the happiest man in the world there, I wouldn't, i don't ask more, just a condo in front of the sea and that's it
I remember watching on tv, hey were doing a report about a surgeon's home. And, well, he had a beautiful house, but the thing that caught my attention the most
He has a pool. You basically open the door and the pool is just in front of the door.
Beautiful
The pool is basically at the top of the window. You can open the window and the pool is
Right in front of the window
Right
I don't know, it's like a tall pool. I don't know if you understand me. You basically open the door .
Yes
And, and goes directly to the pool,
Beautiful
So it was extremely beautiful and How they built the pool was the same level with the house
How awesome
I don't know if you are understanding me, but it was.
Yes
I saw that and I like that
I think so.
I would love to have something like that in my house
None
But, basically, I know that is a
None
My winning the lottery is not going to happen.
You're far right.
A little
Well, no, no, no. You have to insist, have to keep dreaming anyways is
Yes, exactly
I also keep dreaming with my floor in front of the ocean and up to the last minute I will be, determined is that,
For me, being from Puerto Rico, the beach is not a big deal. I always lived five minutes away from the beach, so that
As beautiful as it is, for me is like wow
None
Well I rather have a house here in the mountains, where I could camp in the mountains and things like that.
I see.
None
Me too. In Argentina I used to live by the sea and I miss it a lot.  You see.
Yes
I'd love to, yes, have you gone camping a lot here in the United States, no,
Here in Houston you really can't do it, there are no mountains; so I go camp in Handsville, Texas.
It's about an hour away from Houston, to the North of Houston.
None
When I was in Tennessee, there was a bar with a lake, where you can row.  I really like that.
I used to go camping often, we would go to the river
That's so good
We used to go do all kinds of stuff.
That's nice
To me, yes. To live like that, I have to be in the city. I need to be able to have contact with music, theater, all of it
Beautiful. Sure. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes, you need to.
Yes, once in a while, I like to be in the woods, but I wouldn't really like to live there
I really like the city and I also believe I could live in the mountains, by a lake, in the middle of the woods. I could live a quiet life.
I'm a loner, yes, even now that I live in the city and when I used to live in Argentina.
No, I don't go out much
It all depends on the person. I think
Sure
I was born and grew up in the city. I'm used to having access to all these things.
Going there and going to the country and not having access to anything, this is why I don't really like the attention
It's a suffering, sure.
I think that the person is born and grows up in the country
When he can go to the city and get used to having many, many people and the buildings
And the traffic
The traffic
Sure, yes. It's in the personality of everyone. There are people who live in the country, but love the city.
Yes
And well, they want to live there, I, no, I feel good in the city, I'm comfortable, I'm not suffering, but, the house of my dreams wouldn't be here, if I had a lot of money, I won the lottery
I would buy a good house in the mountains or by a lake, or in front of the sea.
Really? I think that this is extremely difficult to decide on. How to, say, a house of your dreams,
I would love to have a really big house, many rooms and more
Where you can see the whole city from there
Nice,
I think,  suppose
Sure, depending on the money, but no, with how time goes
Obviously.
Has it been so long that you don't go to Puerto Rico?
SINC OCTOBER
How's over there? Was it nice?
Yes I was only there five days because it was basically all family
Sure
I'm going to stay here and I really like Puerto Rico.
Will be like visiting family

And California; if I had to choose a place of the United States, I would go to California without a doubt, I wouldn't think twice.
Well, I'm a bit scared of it because of the earthquakes that happen there and that
Well, that's true, you can't have everything
Yes
Yeah, it's true. I lived there for four years and I had like three earthquakes that I noticed. Like whoa, this is moving a lot!
Well, Florida has tropical storms that occur there and earthquakes

Yes.
Very expensive.

None
Regarding everyone else, I say they can pick Spanish any time. And now that they are, they can speak English pretty well.
Yes
They speak it like any american, now I'm trying to get them to learn Spanish
They don't want to?
None
That's good, do you talk to them in English or in spanish?
Yes. My mom always talks to them in Spanish and they understand her. They're getting it now
They will, because it's so important to be bilingual or trilingual
None
Later all that in the United States here is not so important.
Yes.
Here one that speaks good more because really the majority of the people that live in Canada are more immigrants all.
Yes. There but they talk
It depends where you are, but it has not helped me
No. Look.
At all.
I thought yes.
No. I get here saying, oh I don't have a problem. I speak French, speak English and no nothing very bad.
None
No, because is the west coast, in the coast a lot of Asians
None
The market is very concentrated in Asia.
I see already.
No, French is not so important and of course Spanish has nothing to do with the United States. Here, there must be by the
Ratio of Spanish it must be one percent. The ratio of Chinese thirty five the city where I live is like that they call it how do they call it
Hong Cocer is full of people that came from Hong Kong.
None
There are many, and what that has caused is that they've increased the prices of everything.
I see.
Because they were coming with a lot of money from Hong Kong because in Hong Kong they don't pay taxes.
None
Then they bought the houses and the prices increased a lot here.
Wow
The salaries don't increase.
The price on everything is increasing because the economy is very bad now.
None
Yes, the prices are, of the gas cost
Yes.
Gas costs $2.35 a gallon.
Yes. Wow

The way of living for
Hi
Hello? Good evening
Who's this?
Nancy
Hi Nancy, this is Maria Ines
Maria Ines, how are you?
Fine, where are you from?
I'm from Colombia.
From Colombia, I'm from Argentina
How are you?
Fine, everything's fine, where are you calling from?
New York
Close, I'm in Philadelphia
What do you think about today's subject?
About today's subject you caught us talking about, a few friend are reuinited here, and we live in the city and say, It's so nice that you live a little bit on the outside.
To feel a little bit of the smell of the grass and all that stuff
Nature, everything
Yes, yes, yes, that sometimes you feel like you live in a little box of shoes
Yes, because there's no building and that's it. You go out and you see the same everyday.
Do you also live in an apartment?
In an apartment. Then one becomes too immersed. You need the trees
None
You need the trees
Yes, right? Even if it's having a little garden or something.
None
Having a garden in Colombia is very common
Yes, that's very common.
Is more common than here.
Yes, because you have your house, and garden and the garden in back, and all that.
Sure, yes, in Argentina is the same even if is, if you have an apartment, the apartments have a balcony, or have a little terrace
Is more here?
You live in that apartment.
There in Argentina?
No, here in
Yes. we live in an apartment. And nothing, it has no garden, nothing, we are floor, then, we look at the trees through the window.
Where would the house of your dreams be?
Ah, let's see. How would it be? It wouldn't be too big,  I don't like the houses too big. But yes to have a very big garden to be able to have a lot of dogs
You like them.
I love them, yes. I like white houses a lot.
None
What else? I would like it to have a place to watch TV, and to listen to music, that is separate from the rest.
None
And, nothing else. I'm not very ambitious. How would yours be?
Well, I would like it to have two bedrooms, have them, separate .
Yes, yes.
For it to have a very nice garden.
None
Something that maybe I can put a swing set or something like that, to be able to go out with him there.
How nice.
Yes, it's a TV room, and of one being more peaceful, right? More relaxed.
Sure, yes.
I would like it, also not so big.
One here has everything together.
And not too big neither because then you have to clean a lot.
I thought the same thing, if it's too big, you have to maintain it, it has to come, with someone who helps you, the house of your dreams.
We need the people that live in the country and all that.
What
What do you think of that?
I think I would like to live in the country for a short time, but I think that long-term I would get bored a little.
I didn't come from a very big city anyways, but, it was a city, and living in the country, a little bit, I think it would be kinda boring.
I like to rest a little.
No, I would like a month or two in the country, but I don't know. I've never lived [there] so, i don't know
Right
I'd love to later, but I'd miss the people and the noise.
You miss all that
And would you live in the country?
No, maybe for a week only
It's nice to go horse-riding, take a walk
Yes, right? For short vacations
Sure, you have the theater,  i don't know, bars, restaurants
Oh, but cows, horses, that's different
After a while
Yes
Everything's very nice, but you have to be very [...], well, get used to it, since you're little, right?
But kids also get bored when you take them to places that
None
That are too quiet, right?
You have a son, right?
Yes, I have a son
How old is him?
Six months.
Oh well, he's so little.
I can still take him wherever I want.
He doesn't get bored yet, he doesn't care.
No, he does get bored.
Yes.
Yes because they get tired, if you have them sit they get tired of being laid down, if you change their routine.
You have to be sure.  You have to entertain them.  It's harder to entertain them because you can't make them watch television or anything because
No, they don't like anything, they watch it for five minutes and that's all, they are not excited anymore. But he does watch Dora The Explorer during the mornings and that's it.
Yes, does he like it? Does he recognize her?
Yes sure he likes the colors, he hears the voice and he turns around to watch it, I think
So little and he takes notice, that's so sweet.
Yes, yes, so thats it. To live in a building is hard.
I mean, I can imagine that there are buildings that have all the services right? But you live in an average building.
No, I don't have enough money to live in an apartment.
It's expensive if you go live in those buildings, the ones that have
None
It's an average building, it's not that fun even with the gym.
The rent is expensive.
Sure.
Our budget is not enough.
Is better not to. More in New York.
Yes.
There besides, I think that is much more expensive than here.
You've never lived here.
No, I'm very close, and I never went. We are an hour away. But, we have gone to much further places, and still not to New York.
We don't have money. Something always happens and we never go
Yes, now is quite cold. It started yesterday. They are the coldest days.
Yes, Mn. What's the temperature?
Yes. We are in twenty two, twenty eight.
None
Before, it was decreasing more. One prefers to stay home.
Yes, no. Better to stay peacefully, eating something,
Yes, even if the walls bore you. There, one starts to do something different and gets entertained.
What? I didn't hear you
That one starts to do something and in the meantime is being entertained,
Sure.
And how is the climate over there?
And here is cold, it must be thirty - I'm not too used to the Fahrenheit yet.
You're used to celsius
Yes, it's, let's say there's no, there's no snow, but the puddles on the street are frozen, i mean, it's cold, it's cold
None
I think it's not as cold as New York.
Yes
Here
And, is tenement expensive there?
You can't find a one room apartment for less than one thousand dollars
Right
And here for three hundred dollars, you can find one
It's cheaper, more accessible.
Yes, pretty much. Even in some neighborhoods, since I work at the university, I'm close to the university
Right
And well, it's convenient for me because of that, i go walking, everything, but, if you want to go further, you can get them cheaper, so
Yes
It is more accessible.
Yes it's a good idea
Have you been in New York for long?
Five years
Oh, did you came straight from Colombia or where you in ?
No, direct, so no, I've traveled that way but, a short, no no that no, I don't know much.
Did you come with your family
Here, yes.
Or alone? Yes.
I'm here with my husband and a baby.
None
All in Colombia.
Have you returned to Colombia? Have you been able to go visit?
No I haven't.
None
We are asking for asylum. So, you can't go back there
Have a baby, it's kind of complicated.
Yes, but we will see.
Maybe you'll be soon able to go visit.

If he marries a rich girl he could take all of you there.

There he's going to start driving you crazy, when he starts moving. Right?
There I'm going to roll around with him, but I have to take him out, because he gets bored locked up in the house.
With the cold, how is it? You have to bundle him up or no?
Yes, but he goes out and sees the people in the street, and is like his environment changes.

Yes, definitely is has.
I believe it's more like,
Good things for example, the people.
I believe they are isolated, they are completely,
Eat
Separated from the rest of the world.
Of course.
I believe that if they had contact with more countries and if they could see,
After that, it's better.
I don't believe so, Castro wouldn't be there now.  If they had realized how the rest of the world is living.
Sure.
The technological, social advances. There have been many cultures that have been. England has the

Poverty comes from a blockage from many years ago, and that the United States made it
Right?
A very [...] blockage
Do you think?
Very strong
But do you
Commercial
Matias, do you think that? The American people you think that? Don't be so naive.
And, it affects it's economy.
Do you think that Mexico doesn't have a half a foot there, and the same with Japan, I mean Holland? There are many countries that already have
Oh my
They have helping them a lot, the blockage is only
Yes, it affects the economic and commercial part of the country.
There are many other countries
?
Don't be, naive, I don't think that Cuba is where it is now.
Yes
Because the United States hasn't bought, raw materials, or
Yes
Or other, the only thing they produce at this time is tobacco.
Sure, yes.
There is no sugar, there is no rice, there's nothing, there's no basic. They import today even sugar.

Hello. How's it going? My name is Seledad.
My name is Christ, a pleasure. Where are you calling from?
I'm calling from Baltimore.

Houston
We are a little far.
You hear me better there?
Yes,
Good.
Yes you hear me?
Yes, I hear you.
Okay. Perfect.
What's your name?
Chris
Okay, Chris.
Yes, What do you think about the topic?
The topic was the place where we would like to live. I like
More the city, more than another thing, to live. More than the suburbs. I like the city more, the buildings, the people,
None
I like to be able to walk everywhere if I want, these kinds of things. Like, and you, what do you like more?
Yes, I like everything.  It depends on what you want, what your job is and what you think during your whole life.
Obviously, if you go to work as a sales agent, or something, No? Well, in a city. If you're going to be a farmer, well, in the country.
I like the city more
Did you live in the country before, at some moment of your life, or have you always lived in the city?
I've always lived in the city.
None
None
Sure.
When I was I was boy. And yes, liked it a lot. The animals, the horses, all that, the river, it's pretty. But well
Yes, I like it. But, I also think that after a few times I couldn't like. I couldn't live in the country all the time. It seems it would be hard for me to adapt.
I was born in the cities and, and I've always lived in the city. So, I suppose that it would be difficult for me.
Yes.
Where are you from originally?
Yes, I'm from Mexico.
Mexico DF or Mexico?
From Cuernavaca
Cuernavaca. I have never been to Mexico, I've heard it is very nice.
Yes, there are very nice places. where are you from
I am from Argentina, Buenos Aires.
From Argentina
Yes
I've had to talk to some people from Argentina. Two weeks ago I was talking to two, three people from Argentina. They say it is very beautiful also
Yes ,it is nice.  Argentina has so many places, if you like cities, Buenos Aires.
Yes
It is very interesting and nice to know. But we also have glaciers, waterfalls, mountains. The truth is that there
Are some landscapes, it is a very beautiful country. All Latin America, the southern part, Brazil is also precious, and Chile has nice places, the truth is that it is a
Nice place
Yes.
The other questions they asked was where would you move if you had to move.
Your dreams?
And get the house of your dreams
Yes
What would worry you
Yes
What do you think? Where would you? If you had the chance to go somewhere else
If I could go anywhere in the world, it would be Buenos Aries, where I was born and my family is.
To, me it looks like a good place to raise children, and
None
I like the environment. If I could choose, I would choose Buenos Aires. If it could not be Buenos Aires, I don't know. The truth is, I don't know if
If I could well and have all the comfort, I would like any city in the United States. I like the cities that have diversity, and don't
None
That have more people, not only Americans buy it there, but from all places. Because of that,
None
New York, for example, I love it. I donÂ´t know if I would live my whole life, but I love it. I would love to live there for a couple of years
Yes.
So, but I think that, if I had to choose today, today, I would come back to Buenos Aires.
Having all the comfort.
Yes, of course. And what would worry you? Any preoccupation?
I moved two weeks ago. I was living in Philadelphia.
None
I lived there four and a half years. And, now we moved to Baltimore.
We were worried, mostly. was to see because my husband was going to work here, but I was going to the university. Then, to choose the city
An opportunity to go to New York, but he was going to work alone. To live alone in New York looked to us a little bit risky.
None
Because it is very expensive. And being in a city like that, and not having the possibility of enjoying anything it was not the life style I wanted,
To go there.
Yes
The reasons why we chose this job was because of the cheap cost of living.
No, we were mostly worried, when we were searching for a place to live in. We wanted to be in the city but in a
In a safe area with no crime because  I don't know that much but I believe that Baltimore has a couple of dangerous areas.
Yes
So, that was, we were worried about that and safe places and to be in the city, near downtown, also
That it's easy to reach work from there, in my case, to be close to a train station or something like that.
So that I can go to the university  if I don't want to take the car. we had a lot to consider.
Our number one priority was safety, number two was to be located near the city.
To have a comfortable life.
Yes.
I believe that those three things were the ones that we had to take into consideration when we had to move
Yes. It's very important.
I don't know how it is in your case. Would you have to move, have you been living in Houston for long?
I've lived here for seven or eight years, but, I wouldn't want to stay here forever,  I'd like to go to Mexico,
Which one.
Or somewhere else, for example, Spain.
Yes.
None
They say that Spain is really nice.
I really haven't gone. But, they  say that is very nice
I would like to go ver there.
Yes, Europe. Do you know any part of Europe or no?
Pardon?
If you know Europe.
I would like to go there
None
The truth
You work there in Houston?
No, yes.
You are in a university.
Yes, I'm in the university, full time.
None
Yes, in Houston. I'm going to graduate already. I have a semester and a half left,
How nice
I'm thinking
What are you graduating?
Economics.
Economics.
It is nice here but the lifestyle is different.
American style is different but the style is more Latin.
I don't know. I do not feel so comfortable.
Yes. Right? Why, what bothers you the most?
That is what I ask myself. I have everything, but I don't know what is left.
Of course. Do you live alone, or are you with someone here, as your family?
Yes, with my parents and my brother. I have a brother who is nineteen.
None
Since eight years ago we have lived here.
Eight years and you still feel different.
Pardon me?
You have lived here since eight years ago and you still feel like, like you donÂ´t, you donÂ´t like, lets say.
I am used to everything. But, well, like I donÂ´t. I would like to know other places right? Other places.
Yes.
Other cultures, more than anything.
Yes, I perfectly understand. This country has a lot of goof things and on the other side, I don't know if you have gone through the same, it happens to me sometimes. It does not seem to me
It is like they always make you feel like a foreigner.
Yes.
I don't know if it happens in other countries that are not your own.
I can have a life, I even have friends and all that stuff, well, in Baltimore not yet because I recently moved, right?, but in Philadelphia, I had friends, so,
Latins, and I have friends from Europe too, and I had American friends. But, when you think home, you think back in Argentina. Right?
Yes.
Most of our friends are Argentinians or from Philadelphia.
Yes, other pair of Italians,  we get all together, is like,  all the foreign  I donÂ´t know
Some couple from Europe, Latin America and we all got together. We have a lot in common.
Yes.
I donÂ´t know what it is and neither how to describe it
Yes I understand. Yes, with friends, classmates, from different nationalities. But I don't know.

Yes
It turns out that there's a new theory, the theory of the flying spaghetti monster
Not really
Flyer, and spaghetti monster basically says that everything was created by the magical touch of the noodle/spaghetti monster.
No
That if they include intelligent design they also include this
What have I heard?  That sounds delirious. They wonâ€™t do it. I understand the purpose, but what they said is that if they include design
Intelligent the question, let's say that they include from the side of the Navajo beliefs that, you see, they have their mystical delirium too, I mean
None
I don't know what the Navajo Indians believe.
It's a mess there, obviously they don't want to do it either they're not interested
Yes
I like the one of the spaghetti monster.

That, when, who and what is it, a magazine editorial?
None
Is some editorial in some, in some magazine?
Yes, no, on the  internet, Paty they are calling on the internet
Look at that.
It is brilliant. The theory is very good and super logical.
Sure
You say no, because in reality all the proof that there is about evolution the spaghetti monster put them so that we don't get confused with his magical
He did it all openly, he didn't need the things all, all the illogical arguments he puts them all in a very logical way
Yes, sure.
And

Very well. Do you think that Philadelphia is the city of your dreams?
No, far from it.
Do you prefer to live in the country?
From Philadelphia are here in Baltimore, the dumbass

You don't look like the Bay type.
Everything's fine at the bay.

Not me
I have compared some graph tables and ended up winning.
Even so, would it still be as reliable as the others?

Yes
A table that compares between DVD rental
That's good
The on ly thing is that netflix and blockbuster has four thousand titles
Yes
They don't say the number
None
It doesn't say the number, but it says that they have, that they don't put the number, it doesn't, how could they not publish it
The price is a lot cheaper and if you get into the other place, you see the movies that they have and the new reviews that they have. They are always the new reviews of the other
Sure. but over there they only the newest, they don't have international movies
Pay attention
You have to see it
Not sugar, but I'm sure that it'll come out, I can't explain it right now
Did you get Net Flix?
Yes, because I have fifteen days for free
Yes
And i almost change to the other, i have a free month in that one
Sure, what was I going to say?
Playstation and I rent
We rent the same game and we play online
A little bit of that, that could be
What was i going to tell you?
Everything is possible. When you score a goal against Cuba, I also celebrate
Toly is a half-breed
Yes, it said something about teaming up with Jan. Janis and I also played against Toly, and we bested them.
But Toly goes backwards
No, Toly goes backwards, but the girl makes an effort
She makes an effort, she does, but
She makes an effort, she makes an effort, but well, she still doesn't stop going backwards no matter how hard she tries

Okay, Why so pretty?
Fromwherno is a very pretty name. Veronica, a name like yours is place on top of the chimney, with one of those exotic paintings.
Then is exotic, but the exotic can also be pretty.
Damn, if it's a Picasso painting, it's beautiful.
William, why do you have that name?
Yes
Why do you have that name and a Spanish accent?
What? Spanish accent.
None
I'm Cuban, I'm Spanish.
I didn't recognize the accent. With the damn, I thought you were Spanish from the Iberian peninsula.
No, I had to say that I was from Spain.
You gave me a false damn. Sure, that's why, I thought, I told you Spanish accent, I'm from Argentina and we say Spanish accent means from Spain.
In general every time we refer to the Spanish.
Well
If we are not referring to things from Spain, we use the Castilian language.
Is that look you are very right, but my grandmother and my grandfather in Cuba, they were born in Spain and since very young they went to live in Cuba.
I would say that when they were 10 or 15, they went to live in Cuba and there they had my parents. And from there, I came out.
And from there you left to Spain.
I prefer Cuba over Spain, even if I have been there two or three times now.
Where are you here?
I'm in Miami.
Okay, I'm in
I'm visiting Miami, regularly I have my apartment in Miami.
Okay, I'm in Washington.
Where do you live?
I'm in Washington, Maryland, next to Washington D
Are there a lot of Hispanics in Washington, DC?
There are a lot of Hispanics in my area
Yes
It was an interesting topic of the housing, here in the Washington area.
None
Accurately in the area of Maryland There's a very big community of Central Americans, but a little bit more, not of the islands, of the continent, of Salvador and of Guatemala.
And
There's a very big community.
I wouldn't thought many Puerto Ricans are in Washington and Pennsylvania, places there in the North.
There are many Puerto Ricans and many Mexicans.
Mexicans yes, I think that there are Mexicans all over. So, I don't know where I would say that more in the west you have.
Much stronger communities, more formed.  Here you have a lot of Mexicans
None
But the majority, a great percentage of the El Salvadorian immigration, are settling in this area. In the state of Maryland, and above all in the state of Virginia.
This is really good, because in any case the Hispanic where we want to be
Which is in the south,
And any little word that we get wrong here or there, we're all Hispanic and speak the same language. and we all understand each other in the end, right?
We understand each other in the end, sometimes we don't understand each other, or sometimes we make a mistake, your cono was tricks for me, because Cubans don't use cono, believe me.
Girl, without this word we don't exist.
A look at that.
We put cono on everything, cono mommy, cono my girl, cono, what's up?
You know I didn't know this, look at that
Yes, so, it's a really integral word in our language, let's say the street Cuban.
Sure, of course.
But I came here. One, if I was going to move up there to the north, I wouldn't have any problem either.
Tell me
In buying some good black beans, white rice, some tostones, good bananas, you know, a steak empanada. I can go to a store and buy this, I don't have to live like an American, let's say.
William I'll tell you the store and you go and you buy everything.
Hopefully I'll visit there one day because I remember when I was
Look, this is,
Tell me.
There are difficulties for Hispanic immigrants, especially for those that are undocumented.
I can see that.
I believe that you can make a living here, with the food, music, shows, and going out.
You can really keep in touch with your culture.
That's really important because I want to tell you something. I was raised here in Miami, but
None
In Miami are are lots of Hispanics
Lots of people that come from our countries forget where they came from
Yes
I've never forgotten how to say, fuck, or about eating my beans with fried steak, or how to treat a woman like she was the last one on Earth.
Ha ha, that's so,
They are confused here, they think they are gringos. They forget where they came from.
One of the things I find really interesting is that in our countries, we are not used to this consumerism system, so you go shopping,
And I mean, I'm sure that when your parents were in Cuba, they'd only buy the things they needed.
Sure
And if something was broken, they'd fix it.
None
But I've been here for four years, and it's really interesting to me to see that I'm thirty five years old, I've lived most of my life in Argentina
But it attracts a lot my attention. Like here, this is one of the ways. I wonder if he has a cultural or identity question,
Since the consume levels within the Hispanic community are so high
Very high
Just like the American, the whole system here, the debts and credit cards, all those things.
It is a system that works against Hispanics.
Who don't have the luck of having born here
None
Who gave us a lead, who left us something for us to start with
Right
We have the bad luck coming to a country to improve, because I consider myself Cuban American. Because I can't say that I don't consider myself a little American
The consume of everything for instance
If your vacuum breaks down, why will you go buy a new one when you can fix the cable or the fuse? That will cost you twenty or thirty pesos.
Right
It is true what you say because you see a commercial on the TV that says 'I bought a new vacuum and bla, bla, bla'
Right, and the same with cars and every thing
It is the American culture, that even if you don't want to, you just get used to it. But I talk to a lot of people, and when we talk about this subject, I say, don't forget where you come from brother, we are Cuban
And if something breaks down, my brother, fix it. Why will you take one hundred dollars and waste one hundred dollars to buy a new one, if you fix it it will work just as fine as before
Sure
The country's the same: amazing with a diverse culture
None
I don't know how it works there in the north but I suppose that it's not too different down here
Well I think that those type of things are the same in all places.  you don't have a lot of Puerto Rican community
There's a lot of Puerto Rican community in New Jersey.
In New York and New Jersey.
In New York, I have seen. But not that many Cuban people here.
No, we always stay in the south, we basically
Look
We stay in Miami, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach.
You guys need to be closer to the Caribbean.
Yes since we are not allowed to visit the place where we were born,
None
It's like a reflection but we don't have the same laws
Pardon the word, when we have to be screwed.
None
You came five years ago?
Yes, four years.
Four, five years.
Yes
What is the difference in your opinion between this country and your country?
What I can tell you is that there is a difference between what I saw, of this country, the United States, from outside, from Argentina.
You know that was what I was asking you, which I did not specify very well.
A thing is what I saw from this country since Argentina and another thing is what I see in this country being here
So they are two totally different realities Of course United States as an economical power on all. So, it is an appearance, like an ideal paradise.
Of course
Do you understand me, and as the idea of well to come to America
None
So, reality is very different.
Very different, right.
The reality is very different and, and it depends, yes I think that Hispanics here suffer, we suffer, many realities I came here to study
I am in a very privileged space, but its not like the situation of other people who come here.
No, it is not what you thought it was in your country, right.
No
Nothing. I tell that to many, many brothers. I say brothers I am talking about my Cuban people that they,
No, no, no.
I visit Cuba once a year.
None
Every time I go they tell me, no I want to go there, and I tell them, I know that you want to go there and there is a thing that only you have heard about and you have seen pictures.
Wait a second, when you arrive there, money is not going to fall from the sky.
You are not going to be in your house having a coffee with your next-door neighbors, or something like that. Things are not like that there, there you are going to have to get up early and break your back every day.
People like us have to study and prepare more than others
I believe that people come here, they really want to work and do well
They have no other options and they can't progress in their countries and that's the reality, I don't deny it, but the problem, in my opinion, is more serious and
They come here to join what I call
That's, and yes
I laugh, but I think you are right: I had never heard that expression before.
It's not
Honey in Florida.
Manuel is also un Florida.
What was the topic?
The housing. yes renting versus renting, yes Pros and cons.
Actually, I'm almost in both situations because is with option to buy.
Really.
But that's it's a house
None
Your apartment. You know that is the big difference.
Why? do you rent a house?
Exactly. Okay I'm renting a house but with an option to buy in a year.
I keep renting or I move to another place.
Okay.
The advantage that I see of one renting is that at least you have someone who comes and fixes everything if something breaks.
Sure.
You are the owner of the house
None
You are the one who has to do that, you understand me? If the air conditioner breaks, there's no maintenance.
None
You have to find the money one way or another or else you stay without an a/c.
Sure.
Is lower when you live in your own house
None
The water is more expensive
Yes
The city goes for him since they have so many people who leave or don't pay the bills.
So the city takes all that into consideration.
To make the charges.
Exactly. They charge the people that are there.
None
I work with a company that handles the water bill of the apartments
None
And is one of the things they take into account.
None
You know that you have a house that is bigger than an apartment.
None
The way they see it is that if you buy a house you will probably be there a few years.
Sure. You have more possibilities of staying longer.
Exactly And that the price of your property goes up. They know that you are not in a place.
None
That another
Sure. I think some also to buy to later sell them, right?
Also, you are paying for what's yours.
Here, tt takes to long for people to pay their house, right?
Exactly.
Twenty five years.
The only disadvantage it has is that when you buy a house
Sure.
You already don't have the same advantage if you are renting in a place and I want to go to Miami or I want to go to such place, is like as soon like look I'm leaving.
You just leave, well right,
Exactly. In a house or in something that's yours, be it a condo or whatever, you know you have to sell it
None
Not as simple as if you were renting, I left.
That's how it is right.
You know that's the only disadvantage, I exactly would recommend a person to buy better than rent
Would you prefer to buy?
Buy it than renting it.
None
Because when you are renting, you are like you say, paying to another jerk.
Yes, well, no, because if you have a little bit of money to send a down payment and rent it to buy it, later you can sell it
Because of this option
None
Leasing option
None
They give you time to do what you pay rent with
None
You know, you go paying upfront what a regular rent will be, but that percentage, when your is over, I did it for a year.
None
A percentage of my rent is going to be saved for closure
Look at that
You know, i don't have five, six thousand dollars to buy something
None
You know I'm gonna have to do something, but that's not a big amount
It's not so much
And on top of that, you mind your business because you know that in the end you're paying rent, but it's going to be yours
Because here In the United States you have the big advantage that a lot of people buy with re-financing, I mean that you.
None
Without being full owners,you aren't right?
None
Because you're still paying, many times you have only paid twenty percent of the total cost.
None
They can sell it, right?
Exactly.
It is afigure that doesn't work too much in other countries of Latin America because the property is different right?
No, because, first, I don't even think that the refinancing exists.
No. There's none.
I haven't heard of those options nor those facilities. If you don't have the money to have it built,
None
None
Sure, many purchases are on contradict, and also there are some financing with the banks
But you have to plea that they didn't leave with your money that
NONE
Don't belong to the government,
None
You know that is not the same.
None
When you are for yours.
If you know that you are going to stay and all those things.
Yes, that's the advantage that I see. I don't see any sense in renting.
Finally you have
Yes it can be avoided
None
But is also like you say that not everyone has that amount
None
Or credit, because here in the United States the problem is not even the money.
None
You can have all the money in the world but if you don't have this fabulous credit,
They don't give it to you right?
They don't give it to you.
It's true.
For example
I don't get, what?
I don't like my check to go in bills.
Sure
And I've seen myself in the situation that when I go to do something what jumps out at me is that I don't have enough credit history.
Sure if you haven't bought a lot on credit you don't have credit.
To hastily be picking up a microwave in Kmart and i stayed at the man. And how do you say something like that if I already have a microwave in my house?
Yes, I think the credits are built in any part of the world. That is true.
You have to.
Is always better why do you want to ask you have to pay whatever you can with credit.
And that is what I don't like because I've never liked that. If I don't have, better not to buy it.
None
I've come across the case that
Sure.
Look what a strange thing.
Sure, they recommend what the man says. It's not precisely a good example. Doing the daily shopping with the card and paying at the end of the month.
I even turned in all my credit cards and everything, because I saw myself in a situation where I was paying for what they put on the card.
That if something happens to you, or you stay without a job, supposedly the insurance
Yes, it covers you.
It covers you or it stops until a certain time
A year, I think, yes.
When i went to activate it because i had a car accident they told me no.
That no?
That no. I told him, how can it be possible that you are telling me no?
None
For a year and a half already
No, you've paid it.
I've paid it.
Sure. That are like yes.
Then, that no. I had to have notified them thirty days when
After the accident.
After the accident.
None
But, you wanted me to answer in thirty days if I was in the hospital?
None
That's the least I'm preoccupied with.
Sure.
I have to call a credit card to tell them they have me hospitalized. Three broken ribs, a leg by here
Sure.
That's already impossible. No, then when I did that I got the card paid it and cancelled it.
Sure.
I use my debit card.
None
That it's the same thing but I'm only using the money that's in the bank.
Sure. Whatever there is in the account right?
And that has affected me you know for the purchase of the house. I have to wait a year
Yes, that's why they give you that lease
Exactly. Because I have to increase the number of my
None
My credit
None
I have a bit of a history
None
Where they send you, what a mess.
None
They should be living check to check.
That's right.
When they are not supposed to live like that, understand?  They are trying that people shouldn't get that much, to have a better quality life.
Sure.
I was shocked.
None
Only in America.
Yes, No
But as long as, it's I
But
There are some thing I miss.
None
If you are leasing an apartment, there are people that do that.
Sure
At the same time you have to wait for them to come out.
Yes well sometimes they also don't do it.
No, so I moved,
Yes you have to be in a place that is more or less expensive so that they give you everything fast and you are good
Goodness we already are paying almost an arm and a leg but for everything it was a
Careful with the other You see.
A drop
None
We lasted three, four months with water coming out of both
None
By the corners of the house.
Yes.
Because the apartment had a leak.
None
You know who it is, it's also not that easy.
Yes, not like that. No you have to close it very fast.
I that I. For me is better, for you to buy it.
Is always better, right?
You are already on your own, you are paying for yourself.
None
You understand me. When you already have enough time you can get a loan against your house.
Isn't it?
You know it's not like that, it's not the same as when you are leasing. You don't own anything.
None
You know that it'll take a toll in the short term.
That's right.
But, that has been my own experience and I particularly wouldn't recommend it to anyone, if they can
None
If they have other options, there are some programs that help you buy your first house.
Yes it's well there are some.
Exactly.
None
For people that are buying their first home, I think it's called the FHA loan.
NONE
They help you.
Look at that.
And they give you a certain percentage if not all the money.
None
With the income tax and that, the mortgage company has gone mad because they know that everybody has two thousand, Pesos.
None
They are going to be sent to the government.
None
And they all lower credit
Sure
That's the best time to go out and find,
Yes
But that's been my experience, i don't know yours
Since I'm not going to stay here to live, I just rent here. If I were able to buy and then sell
I would have done that too, because I'd be making some money too
Yes, that's true. And here in Florida, the prices of properties
None.
Properties in this area are going up
Yes, exactly. That's what I've seen through comments from other friends, right?
Because unfortunately, this is the country, the state where everybody wants to come
None
It still hasn't
Yes, that's true.
They just come to lead twenty miles per hour
That's ultimately better
They don't
If you finish paying it, it's yours, right? If not, you can
Right?, if you have, you know, any emergency
Negotiate, earn some money for yourself
Exactly. And in any emergency, you're forbidden to get a student loan. Do you know what I mean?
You have a mortgage, you're right
You're going to find your mortgage and how much you have in equity, you have money now
Yes
You know it's not the same when you're renting
When you rent you lose a lot of money too. You lose a lot of money a year.
I barely heard that last one
You lose a lot of money renting, you lose a lot of money annually.
None
Matías
Hi! My name is Martin
Martín
Yes
Martin, how are you?
Fine, you?
Everything's fine, everything's cool
You're Argentinian
You're Argentinian too?
Yes, I'm Argentinian
From Buenos aires
Yes, you.
Me too. I'm for Caballito Flores, you?
I'm actually from outside the capital
I have a friend that lives near Ramos
Yes
Right there
Yes, a little further after Ramos
Everything's fine, what? After, right?
Yes
A bit further, everything's quiet
Everything's fine.
What are you doing?
I'm in Philadelphia now
Me too
Look at that
Yes
I recently moved to Baltimore
Yes
Yes
And, what are you doing in Baltimore?
I work in, I'm starting to work at the Neuro Sciences department
Of Neuro-. look at that, that's good
Yes
Where are you, are you a Biologist?
Yes
Me too
Look at that.
You studied at the Uva
Yes, I'm at the U
In Buenos Aires?
Yes
Oh, it's ok, exactly
Yes
It's OK, but you graduated long ago
I spent some time there. I'm about to get a doctorate.
I'm a student.
None
I haven't graduated yet
None
I have a few more years left to go.
Oh, well
For that
Well
I'm in third
Good look with that
Thank you very much, I came here to study, I'm doing an internship, I'm not working
Look at that, that's good.
Here in Penn
That's good
What?
I said that's good
The truth is, I managed to get laurito here, through a contact.
I'm at Penn University now but
Here in Penn too
Temporarily
Maybe you'll even see me on the hall
Maybe
While you're working?
That could also be
It could be, right?
Yes, do you rent or?
I
Are you an owner?
I've been here for two weeks, and i'm leaving in two months from now
My girlfriend's brother's house
Look at that
None
Look at that.
I don't even rent, I'm just a guest here
Sure, is loaned,
You?
I've rented a while, since
Here it is common, right?
And yes what happens is that buying is very expensive now.
So expensive.
Yes, is very expensive especially in the cities, now is getting too expensive.
Every day is more expensive.
Yes,
Okay,
Philadelphia particularly is very expensive now. Comparing it to how it was five years ago.
And Baltimore?
And Baltimore is starting to increase now. But also, they are increasing the prices of everything
It's getting Top
No, but
But little by little
But yes, as the city grows, the prices are increasing
Is Baltimore nice?
Is small, Philadelphia is nicer, but
It is small.
Yes, there they go, the crash is right there
And, and are you renting there in Baltimore too?
Yes
You were renting here and there too
Yes
What's cheaper, here or there?
It's a little bit cheaper
A little bit cheaper
Yes, it's a little bit cheaper
But it's almost the same
I don't know, maybe ten or five percent cheaper.
An apartment or a house?
It's an apartment, yes.
Apartment
Yes, houses are very expensive
Yeah, right?
Yes
Also, better than the one here? Than the one in Philadelphia, the apartment is nicer?
The same money you can rent something a little bit bigger, with more services
Does the hotel give you a lot of services?
It's
I'm sorry, the department?
It has more things than here.
Sure, so the subject was housing, right?
That's why I was talking about that.
He precisely said something about a witch [a burbuja, bubble] What did he say?
What the witch means is
I didn't hear
We throw the witch [a burbuja, bubble], that properties are overrated. The price is higher than what it's really worth
So they call it the witch bubble because at some point it will get punctured and the prices are gonna go down again
That's why
Yes, I mean, the witch [bubble], they say that in New York and Los Angeles it's about to get punctured
The witch [bubble] started growing fifteen years ago.
It began ten to fifteen tears ago.
However, here in Philadelphia, on the other hand, five years ago it started like that, so they say that prices might go rising for a while until
The witch [bubble] breaks. I don't know if it's a witch [bubble] or not, but the prices went up a lot during the last times, that's true
And they keep rising in New York, in Los Angeles
Yeah, they keep rising for now, right? Right
Or are they holding up?
They keep rising, so i don't know if it's gonna get punctured at some point
Sure, each time is harder
What?
Each time is harder to rent, to live in an important city let's say big
Everything is super expensive. The Bubble anyways refers to buying, but obviously if it's more more expensive to buy the prices of the rents also increase, yes.
The rent of house is also speak to person
Sure,
It increases also, but it's okay. Have you been here in the United States many years?
It's been four and a half years
Four years
Yes a lot
And is it good living here, or no, more or
Yes, one gets used to it
But there are many differences from Argentina.
Yes, obviously there are differences. I mean to start your friends are not here, your family is not here. Things of that sort,
Sure
Some things are hard to find.
Hard things of what?
But of finding food, or things that you are
Sure
Used to eating over there, that here don't exist or well and the treatment of the people is different all those things right,
People from here? Or from other countries, are there many people from the other side who came here, who met?
In the University area, do you know many people from outside
Many Latinos
Everything is easier, easier to meet than in other areas. Meeting Latinos or Europeans.
There are many, no? Those who work in the sciences are very few, no? Americans who are natives from here
And it's forty percent more or less, and the rest is all from outside
Forty or more foreigners than that.
Yes, I think that there are more foreigners than
Than natives.
Than natives, yes,
And did you make many friends? Your friendships, how are they going?
Fine, I have friends from everywhere, in reality, like friends from Latin America, from Argentina, from Chile
Friends from Argentina who you met
From Brazil
Are they in Argentina?
I met the majority here or in Argentina. Simple acquaintances. And, I made friends here, simply by, well, I didn't know they well. I knew them more from sight or from the faculty
Yes
Or from
Yes, they're studying the same job.
Sure
Scientific
Sure
None
When we were of American people also Simpl
You became friends with American people.
They worked in front
Sure
Or also Europeans
Sure,
Well.
And are there things to do?
No, here in Philadelphia
Yes,
Yes, I think so is peaceful.
Is it fun?
Is peaceful
Peaceful Right?
Yes, is peaceful.
There isn't
But Baltimore is more peaceful.
Baltimore
Even more quiet
Baltimore is very quiet, right?
Yes
Very quiet
Very quiet, we're just getting used to it there, but I'm under the impression that
And, but it's
It's a lot smaller
A little town compared to Philadelphia
Yes
And there's not much of anything in philadelphia, there is no party like in buenos aires, the crazy partying
You need to go to the Old City side.
I don't know Old City
It's near the wide river
What street is the river?
Front
You have to go there first, let's say
Sure
That's nice, i have to go there some day
It's nice, right? It's filled with bars and restaurants
Nicer than the center.
You have the rivers, what happens is that the bars are not on the river. That's a design problem of this city
None
They are near the river, but not on the river.
They are like a block away and the riverside path is like to walk, like a boulevard to walk but there's nothing else.
Is picturesque so to speak.
Is picturesque, Like there's nothing, they could've made some little bars, something nice to drink a coffee there, but no
Is just a path with
None
Like the one here in the river that takes you to the musuem?
How the boats go by.
Of art
Is a little wider, is like the boulevard in Mar de Plata.
Is nicer than that one right?
Yes, it is a little better.
Because that path kind of sucks, there isn't a lot
No
That path goes to the museum and there is the park
Yes, No, but it's good. If you go to the museum, there, it gets nicer.
When you get to the museum.
Passing the museum.
Yes, where the ducks are.
Yes, the tracks are full of ducks but
Yes, I was there once, I went there the other day
Yes. Oh, if you go to the east side you will reach a place in which there's another river.
You have to walk a lot.
And it's nicer.
You have to continue, where the nautical houses are
If you take your bike
Forty minutes,
By bike, yes
By bike.
Yes,
Oh, they give you
A LOT BUT, IT'S OKAY, IT'S FUN AND IF YOU CAN, YOU SHOULD DO IT.
And, what's there?
There's another river but isn't this one similar to the South of Argentina
Yes,
I mean
Kind off
Much more precarious but it's good, right? becuase there's like a forest andd the river crosses the middle of the forest
Sure,yes
And the people, yes, people fly-fishing; it's good, it's nice, it's very different, because it's also in the middle of the city and it's like
It's in the middle of the city
Yes
Because it looks like a forest, in fact there's no cellphone signal
But it's in the middle. It's in the suburbs, right? In the middle
No, it's still in the middle of the city
This city is till there, you can go on
Yes, it's very crazy.
Look at that.
Yes, that's a nice place
That's odd, the only place that I met was up until the museum and afterwords the center, the streets where to do shopping
Oh, you saw everything over there.
Sure
Old City, right?, and all that you told me too
Right? you have to go
Sure, all shopping for now
Sure
GAP is cheaper, GAP is very cheap, I'm buying some things in
You're in on the American consumer wave
I still have more left
Sure
I want to buy an iPod
Yes, those are good
They're cheap
I have one
They like to buy a pair and send them to Argentina.
I don't know how much they're selling, do they sell well in Argentina? Or are they expensive to?
The iPod or any MP3 player?
I mean the iPod's.

Really.
In the Bronx

It's fine here
People call me Chari. I can't understand you
Have you been cold there?
Yes, there's a lot of noise
I can barely hear you, Victor.  There's a lot of noise.
It's so expensive
Yes, well today's subject is housing. Are houses expensive where you are from?
No, it's all right.
Yes, how much does a house or an apartment cost there? How much does a house or an apartment cost there?
You can buy them from seven to eight hundred dollars.
How much? Oh, the rent
The rent
But if I wanted to buy one
I can't understand you honey, I don't understand what you are saying.
To buy one?
You wouldn't want to buy there.
Hello, what if I want to buy one there? How much?
How much? I don't know honey, I've never bought one
Okay
How much is a rent over there
Here in San Diego, housing is very expensive, but it is cheaper renting than buying. Here, to rent a room, is like nine hundred dollars a month.
My God
To buy like half a million at least.
Then you must have a good job
Ye,s a very good job. And here, the people buy houses, but, I don't know how they do it. They are not so good.
Can you believe that they are selling something out of a base.
YOU ONLY PAY THE INTEREST
None
But many, many people buy here. With five hundred thousand dollars, you can hardly buy anything.
Never
Nothing, in a good area
How much would it cost in a good area and then in a poorer one?
In a poor area a room and a bathroom, nothing for less that three hundred fifty thousand.
My God.
But I am talking of an area with crime, horrible,forget it.
Drugs and crime
Things of housing are very bad here. Yes, then you are in
Like for the renters
Yes
It was great for the clients, and for those who live in the area.
Yes for everything, but here I moved to San Diego in 2001. Since I moved, the housing prices have more than doubled.
But you can pay this, it's true. They never bought anything for you.
Yes, we're with the Navy and we're living from the Navy. I don't know if you can imagine.
A million dollars, so, how long will you wait to buy something for you? How long will you want for at least an apartment or an apart
How much would it be?
An apartment for you.
I have a family with three kids, we need at least three rooms. This will not be less than $700 and we'll not be able to pay.
Right
We won't be able to.
You've never been to Ponce.
So,
Ponce is really beautiful
None
Yeah but you go to Taplado to Taplado beach the coast, it's really pretty, many artists, they go and say beside the sea, the tabloid says
I haven't been to Puerto Rico since I was little.
And your family never went to any place that you know.
Yes yes yes, no no no, yes when I was little we went, but that was many years ago.
Can I tell you something personal?
Yes
I am gay
None
My life is that, when i was younger my mom never showed me the love i wanted her to showed me.
None
I am frustrated because of that my mom never, at thirteen at fourteen I was raped, two people raped me.
None
People who, I trusted, I felt in love with one of them and and that one raped me. Do you understand me?
Yes it has caused you a lot of problems obviously.
I am talking that at fourteen years old.
There is
Because of destiny, the people who raped me, One of them is at jail for being a raper, I never knew that Juanito,
Was a raper
None
I have been here for twelve years and as I am gay
I was afraid that someone could kill me from behind, Do you understand me?
Yes,of course
Then when I fell in love, I fell in love with him, he took advantage of it, as I never wanted to do something with him, only kissing.
He was eighteen and I was fourteen
Yes
Then with one, we were in some Patron Saint parties, and we left
None
What's wrong? Excuse me, are you okay?
None
Then we were in the Patron Saint parties and then he wanted to go out with me. He invited me somewhere.
None
Then how was I to know that it was a park? Suddenly Chachi's friend, may he rest in peace as well, appeared behind me
None
And they hit me with a rock on the head. They beat me, and I tell you the truth. Can I speak straight with you?
Yes
While one raped me, another one was giving me hickeys, would kiss me and I was running, nobody would hear me. I mean, me running, nobody heard me.
But when I ran, they collided into me, I fell to the floor.
No
That was horrible, now I'm forty
And how old are you now?
Forty four I take off four so no one believes me
WHAT A THING
But, if you see me, I look thirty eight, thirty six years old.
What luck, atleast
Thanks
And so, everything is going pretty well or
I'm homeless now, and a friend of mine is letting me live in her house
And a year ago, my husband, with whom i was with for nine years, left me for a woman
None
Yeah, he left me for a woman, even though, she was a woman that doesn't even have teeth, a woman of over fifty years old, a drug addict woman
So it didn't last even two months, and now he's in jail
Oh no
I was born on nineteen sixty one
That's horrible. Youu have lots of problems.
On October 17th of 1961
None
So, according to, according to me, my mom never supported me, my mom was
Well, yeah.
Was always away from me. If I went out, she never said God bless you, and that makes me feel bad.
Sure
I really think about that
Yes
I get sad because she has never been a mother to me and I'm telling you because I want to let it out
Do you talk to her anymore?
I talk to her sometimes but
That
My family is not united as I would like.
What a shame
As it would be united family, understand that, in Christmas, we hug each other; in the birthdays, would tell me happy birthday
None
No, my life is like that
You have someone there with you
Thank God
Yes is hard really, withiout the support of the family.
My sister's family doesn't want to talk, I told her to go visit me I was, I got out, yesterday I got out of a program of
I was a drug addict where a program
None
I called so she would see me for Christmas and my sister didn't see me.
Well.the
In what sense
Yes, maybe she doesn't understand no. Maybe she doesn't have any trust yet.
I've never done anything bad to her.
That may be, maybe she feels so bad and thinks she doesn't want to. She doesn't want to suffer anymore. You understand that maybe she doesn't want to suffer seeing you a certain way.
Because I know that brother is also like that, I suffer a lot. And sometimes it's hard seeing him.
Really
I'm sorry for you maybe I don't know if you have faith in God, but. that has helped me a lot.
No, I have a great faith in God, I'm very religious
So,
I was raised in the Pentecostal church
Yes
I know there's a big God.
There is.
I know that I believe in the holy spirit
Yes
I believe that some day God will give me a sentimental prize. But I've always believed in God, because he who doesn't believe in God, is not worth anything.
Yes because there's no way of living without having a
None
Yes, believing in God, you have to have trust and believe in God and do all the good that you can.
And
Hi
Hi, yes, who am i talking to?
It's Maria Ines from Philadelphia, who's this?
It's Jorge from Los Angeles. How are you Maria Ines?
Fine, very well, you?
Everything's good. We have to talk about housing here.
About housing, what are you?
Wefe
Are you an owner?
And you're Argentinian
Yeah, it shows, everybody....I can't hide it
I'm Argentinian too
You're also argentinian?, you're a master, i didn't notice that about you, have you been here for long or not?
Eighteen years.
None
And you, how long have you been here?
No, a year
Very well, from where, Buenos Aires?
A year, no, I'm from Mar del Plata
Mar Del Plata, I lived in the city
Really,
Unfortunately just for a year because it's one of the most beautiful cities in the world
None
Oh Mar del Plata is wonderful, well no, yes, I just lived there for a year and then we went back to live to Buenos Aires,
And where are you originally from?
I was born and raised in Buenos Aires
I see.
In the West Nuz, Valentin, yes
That's huge
So, are you now living in the United States from Mar del Plata, did you come
Yes,
Very well
No I moved to Mar del Planta until I came here, well someday I'll move back to Mar del Plata
Mar del Plata is a wonderful city
It really is,
It's so beautiful
None
I haven't been there for a long time so I can just imagine how beautiful it should be now.
It is beautiful,
Well so you are now in Philadelphia.
I'm in Philadelphia
Then you are renting, or what
Yes,
You have your own house
Im renting, the idea is
Very good.
Came to Philadelphia to make some money and return to Argentina to buy my own house
That's the idea.
That's the plan or part of a house at least.
Very good, so that's the idea, I think that you will be able to achieve it because basically, in the comparison how it is
Let's say the market here of the United States
None
The cost of living Argentina, yes, you will be able to achieve it
Is terrible, the cost of living in Argentina seems as if it was Switzerland, but they charge
Is the cost of housing going up a lot in Argentina?
Yes everything is super expensive, especially in Mar de Plata.
Because it's a tourist city
Sure
More del Plata
And now is in fashion again because there was a time nobody went.
How is that? Since there was a time where no one was there, no one went there
Yes, there was a time when, i don't know if you remember when it was , one peso was one dollar
Yes
In that time, people
None
People were to Punta del Este because it was very cheap.
Exactly
And they didn't go to Mar del Plata, so it dropped a lot there, but it's activated again. And the truth is it's all in, but we Mar Platences (those of us from Mar del Plata) are affected negativey
The way that properties go up.
Mar del Plata is an incredible city.
Where did you live in Mar del Plata?
I forgot the address
None
I lived there and I went to elementary
Look at that.
For one or two years. I enjoyed it a lot.
When you were little
Yes, you were little
None
I enjoyed it a lot,
Yeah, Mar del Plata
Incredible
It's really nice.
It's beautiful. I remember we always went with my family to the restaurant
Los Angeles
That probably isn't there anymore
Do you remember the name?
None
La Marmita, sounds very familiar
Sounds familiar, maybe it's still there.
It sounds familiar, I don't know
It doesn't matter, we're going to talk. And speaking about housing,how
Speaking of housing
How much would it cost in a good neighborhood. Generally all neighborhoods are good in Mar del Plata?
In a neighborhood, I'm telling you the price doesn't vary much from one neighborhood to another
No.
No, it's another thing that amazes me. I'm still looking at it on the internet, it's not like I've gone there and spoken but
None
But no, the price doesn't vary much
It doesn't vary
An apartment
You want to tell me yes, something not very luxurious, Let's say a bedroom only
With a bedroom like that normal
Yes,
And between twenty five thousand and thirty five dollars
Well but is completely yours
Yes,
You can buy with thirty five thousand dollars
Compared to the ones that come out here, it really is cheap
Here you buy a bathroom.
Yes, there with that money you fix the roof of a house see, here is incredible
Exactly, but with twenty five or thirty five thousand dollars in Mar del Plata you can buy a one bedroom apartment, in any part of the avenue colon,
And there is for twenty twenty few, I would tell you in the avenue colon for example
Oh, when you are talking of twenty five, thirty five, you are talking
Of nicer neighborhoods with an ocean view or with
None
Yes or the center
How much it can cost if you go to buy a one bedroom apartment
They're in Philadelphia. Where you are now.
I don't know.
An apartment in Philadelphia, it depends, because I was talking about, you know, now that I am doing this
Yes
To a lot of people in Philadelphia.
Oh, really?
I have talked to a Paraguayan and one or two Argentineans.
Really?
In Philadelphia, and they say that basically it depends on what area of Philadelphia you live in
Yes
Everything is expensive
Yes
But how much will it cost, an apartment in Philadelphia may cost you, depending on where you buy it, it may cost you
I don't know, I have a
More than a hundred and fifty thousand
Exactly, three hundred thousand dollars
Yes, I have a friend who bought a house here. It is a big house, it's nice and it is in a wonderful area but it costed her three hundred thousand dollars
Right, no way
Yes,no
Happy.
Yes, we are happy. I'm the one who is more homesick. I don't know,I like Philadelphia.it's nice, it has interesting things.
Sure, because most of your family is in Mar del Plata
Sure
In Argentina
Yes in Argentina more than anything, in Mar del Plata well are my parents, my siblings and the rest are
You miss it the first year here
None.
Besides, in Philadelphia the climate is so extreme, you said that it's been like a year that you are here
Yes, yes. It's cold and hot
Basically you have the extreme heat and cold.
Yes,
You have snow.
Yes,
And a lot of snow in the east coast.
Yes,
Here in the California area is not like that, is not like that
It's very nice.
In the California area, where I'm at, you don't see snow.
Sure
It could be that it's cold,but it's a cold that doesn't kill anyone do you understand?
Sure. Yes.
It has change temperature for a contrary.
Your winter is very mild?
No, is very mild
Like a Buenos Aires winter.
What the buenos aires winter has is the humidity and much more intense that the ones in california
None
Because the cold you have in Buenos Aires, that you have in Buenos Aires is a humid cold
Yes
That generally,  I think is, basically, well the one from Mar del Plata is a little different But in Buenos Aires you have that cold that gets in your bones
Yes, well Mar del Plata yes also, terrible
It's like that, but not here. At most, there is a jacket on top and nothing else, it's not much.
No, here you have to buy thermal socks, thermal shirts, hats and gloves.
Yes, Philadelphia, the snow and have
Everywhere cold No
Perhaps you have to go out to shovel the snow from the door of your
Yes, you have to
House and
Me because since it's an apartment the person who manages it does it.
Yes the building managers,
Sure, but if not the people that have a house have to go out, they sell the shovels in the supermarkets
Okay
They also sell some things to get the ice from car's windshields, that's very funny
How did you end up in Philadelphia. Do you have friends, known acquaintances, etc?
Igot a job here
That's why, i understand now
Sure
There's a positive reason
Sure, the University of Penn is big
University of Pennsylvania, exactly
None.
Well, very interesting, what else can I say?
And you have to tell me
So you work at the University of Pennsylvania, where this study is
None.
I'm sorry, what were you asking me?
Tell me, do you have a house of your own or do you rent?
No, I was thinking of talking about the subject. No, I don't have a house of my own, and I don't think I ever will in the United States.
It's not my style and I'm not interested.  If I had a million dollars or more,
I would buy a house, but I'm really not interested
Yes
I'm not interested, I rent, I don't know what we would say in Argentina, it's just an ambient.
Yes,
Here in Los Angeles, California, they're called Bachelor's. It's a room where you have the bathroom that's complete and a kitchen.
And everything complete, I don't know how to say this,
Something like
Exactly, something for style.
How nice
I don't know how, well in Argentina we would call it
Yes it's like one big room
It's just one room. It's big enough for me
And for just one person, you live alone?
With it's private bathroom and private kitchen complete and close to everything, and the price that I'm paying
I'm paying three hundred and eighty three dollars a month.
Ah, that's very cheap
It's basically what you're, what kind of place are you renting in Philadelphia?
WE WITH, IT'S A TWO ROOM APARTMENT, IT HAS A BEDROOM
Igor
Yes good evening. Yes, my name is Ever and I'm speaking from Pennsylvania
Me too I'm in Pennsylvania.
What part?
In Pittsburgh.
In Pittsburgh, I'm in Philadelphia, we are four hours away.
Yes driving, driving more or less yes
Yes
I don't know it, but tyhey've told me that there are a lot of people who are also cold.
Yes, I think that Pittsburgh is a lot colder but yes, here it s cold and it's a pretty big city.
Yes they've told me there are a lot of Latins, Hispanics there
And have you been in Pittsburgh a long time
Yes more or less, I've been almost five years here, And you?
No, now I'm on my second year here.
You don't have much.
But, previously, I lived in Maryland
You moved to Philadelphia
Yes we moved up here
That's good
A little cold here
Today's subject appears to be about renting or being an owner
Housing, I rent, sadly I haven't had the chance to be an owner yet, and how do you say it.
IT'S SOMETHING  I THINK DEFINITELY BRINGS YOU BENEFITS
Where are you from?
I'm from Guatemala
I'm from Venezuela
Venezuela, nice, nice. I've been renting for several years, one of the reasons why I haven't managed to buy a house is because I've been moving around a lot, I haven't found
A long-term place
Yes, a long term place, the buying process takes at least a year and then it's not worth having something
You'll stay in that place a couple years to be able to
Yes
Get something out of it
I agree.
But definitively, I think it's a great benefit, first because when you rent all the money goes away, but when you buy a house it's a kind of investment, and eventually
You get it back
Yes, that's true. The only thing I see, since they ask pros and cons, well, it's always better to be an owner rather than, as you say, throw the money to the garbage
Yes
The pros and cons. It has to do with maintenance, because at least you're the owner
But when you are the owner, you assume all the responsibility of the property. I think that's the only advantage of renting
It's that for example, maintenance, it's in charge of the renter but of the owner, yes. Keeping the property maintained and paying the expenses.
Is the only advantage that I see of renting, no This
Yes
I agree with you that it is better to be an owner.
Yes,
And I put this example, because when one lives in a building complex or something for example, the one who rents doesn't have to worry if something gets damaged
To remove the snow, or mow the lawn, nor pay for those things. The administration of the properties is in charge of all that.
In fact I seen that many elderly, retired people who are already alone, who don't have enough for their expenses and their things at the end, rent.
They have their property and they rent it that way because they can't even be mowing the lawn nor removing the snow anymore.
Yes
Then they decide to rent
In reality, is perhaps.
I have very little time left and would not like to spend it cleaning the snow and mowing the lawn.
Exactly
FIXIN THINGS IN THE HOUSE, FOR EXAMPLE IN MY FAMILY THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE HOMEOWNERS AND WELL USUALLY THE HOUSES ARE NOT BOUGHT NEW, IS MORE COMMON.
Exactly
Is more common buying them used and what do you call it, always perhaps that the water heater breaks and that is a big expense,
It takes quite a lot of time to fix it.  a pipe breaks because of the cold, especially in these states
It's expensive to repair it.
And it's costly and I'm not sure how the law here in Pennsylvania is, but in Maryland they implemented a law that when it snows.
If the person who is the owner of the house doesn't clean what is the sidewalk where the people walk.
Where you walk, yes, yes
They can sue them and they will probably win
Yes, here is the same.
Smae, that I didn't know, and how do you call it? I always thought that law is somewhat strange, because if I see that it's not too good to
The person is not an owner anymore, rather it belongs to the government.
Exactly
Something you have to be careful about because I know many friends that when it snows say, I have to clean before someone falls and tries to sue me.
Yes one can get in a lot of trouble with that, even here, when you don't mow the lawn, here they also fine you. when it's too high
Really
The lawn, they also fine you, they come and give you a ticket with a warning.
That it should be cut and shouldn't be so high, even for that
In places where there are a lot of trees for the autumn a lot of leaves fall and that's another job that you have to
Exactly, maintenance and all that.  You have to have time and all to do it.
You have to take
That's why I think when I see the retirees they decide to rent because of that.
I 've seen a lot of older people and I've always asked myself what the purpose of advanced age already to be renting
Because the prices are the same, no, if you buy a house as what an apartment is sometimes. But in reality, when you analyze the situation well, those must be the reasons that they simply avoid
So much extra work and they live peacefully and don't have to worry about repairs.
Yes That's without counting any problem that there is, like, you were mentioning, like some bad pipes, a damaged plumbing here is very expensive to pay,
If an animal gets into your house whatever. they have to be able to pay, bear those expenses
You claim and they have to answer.
Yes
That would be, lets say the advantages, and the disadvantages, I would say, it is not yours it is a money that you are investing in something, in a property that you will have in the future
To give security to your children. well, and how good, I think that always in someway, to rent, against be an owner, it is always good to be an owner in someway, because at the end you are investing money month to month.
Instead of not habing it.
Yes, it is very true . No, I am not aware of the market here, but in Maryland In the last.
Seven years, the housing raised a lot and has become impossible to find a favorable house, but for those who bought in in, appropriate dates have made much money, because people who have bought.
Who have bought houses seven years ago for one hundred and fifty thousand dollars the houses now cost three hundred and fifty, four hundred And those are not very big houses and it is not necessarily
It is a very special place, but it has rise a lot, and they sell, and maybe buy something more modest and get a big profit that can be used for
ChildrenÂ´s study, personal savings, or investments and yes, people who have their time because they are helped now.
Yes well here in Pittsburgh. well there are many opportunities, the reality is, I have seen here, that people even when you do not believe it are investing in that
There are many houses like you say that are old. and that are not so bad, some are regular. but there is an evident business here
That dedicate to invest in buying houses and then repair them no, yeah, I have seen many people that are dedicated to it, even when there is an auction.
Yes
They make a business out of times when there is a very low down payment, and I have friends who repair investors' houses.
None
They put the money and buy houses, they repaired them And the sell them again here at a good price, no
That aspect, of course, there are of many prices.
None
There are different priced houses. Yes, you can still find regular houses. Not at a good price here too.
And they are making money, well
Yes, no, I knew that a while ago. in Maryland, the houses were really pricey, they'd call the HUD, the HUD were the ones that the government was reselling because of foreclosures and because people hadn't been able to pay them.
None
They were selling them at a really good price. Maybe the value of a house was one hundred thousand and they were selling them in seventy thousand.
Exactly
They would even give them an extra loan to invest in repairing the house with a very interest rate, that's what you were talking about, that's what they used to do
The ones that worked on that, the contractors, they would buy a house and they would repair it and resell it and they would easily make fifty thousand dollars.
In about three or four months.
No, it's like, that's happening here too and it's okay, it's a good business because I know they are doing well
Yes
It's an investment to buy this type of properties.
Yes
My name is Victor
Hello, Carla
My pleasure
Hello how are you?
My name is Victor, I am gay
Yes
Talking about couples,

Of drugs?
Yes, he got a vice of drugs. I put him into a program. No, I didn't put him in action. Then, no
I haven't seen him again. He started to dance in the parties with the friends in the street I would let him go out, I would let him go out with women also.
I don't care if he was with women, he was bisexual.
Sure
I don't know but after nine, after nine years he left me for a woman and that hurt me a lot, and
He left with a woman one year.
Yes, after nine years he left me for a woman.
Now?
Now I'm alone. No, I don't want to be with any one, I don't want to have any one because I suffered a lot with that break up.

Yes
I'm happy for you.
For now yes
I hope it lasts for you and that you're happy
None
That it lasts and that you're happy.
You're telling it to me right.
None.
You don't have to
I don't have a partner.
You?
What did you say you don't have a partner?
No, you don't have a partner, but you tell me as if you couldn't have another one
None
You can have another one, why not.
I don't want to have any
No? I don't know, I'm not so sure.
No, Already those nine years that I was with that man were hard for me. No, no, like that in the sense that I sometimes would like
That I wouldn't want to see Um Sometimes I would like, and not like. And
Yes
I don't trust men. I have a boyfriend.
Yes
Who's twenty eight?  Not because it will last.
He left now.
No, let's look at the time, he left to get something. Because here he's good, why wouldn't he want to come visit me
Sure
Sure, he comes to visit me. I don't like to have a stable partner. Only a little adventure and then something until it last.
I'm living the moment. last three day or a month to live with him,
No, it's fine. If that's good for you. It's really good. What was I going to ask you?
A girl? What for? To be playing with my feelings?
None
I'm not a girl.
I don't understand you.
That I'm not a girl, a girl?
Yes, I am
I'm not a girl  that everyone can play with my feelings
No, of course not
This man played with me
No, I know you're not
I'm sorry
Not all of them are responsible for that
No, i don't blame everyone.
That's why i'm telling you, there could be millions of better men
It just stayed with among other subjects
None
I'm afraid to fall in love. I mean, the fear comes from falling in love
Yes, likewise. I understand you, but you also can't control it.
Not myself away fully for give person
I already know,  are you in your house?
Yes, I'm here, with all, watching a show
You're watching TV?
Yes, TV.
Okay.
No, now I finished cooking,
Really?
I finished cooking now. I ate there with the kids.
What did you cook?
White rice, and stewed chicken with potato.
How yummy.
Yeah
But what time is it?
Tell me the time
None
None
You are going to eat now?
And what a miracle a quick call today
None
What a miracle that they got the call quickly.
I don't understand.
What a miracle that they got the call fast, today
Yes they always talk a lot, because in reality I'm never here
It's different women who answer,  when I call
No, is an answering machine.
They are ust two women
None
How many answer the phone there, one or two?
When a woman answers the phone
How many people answer the phone there?
What do I know, it depends.
You are working
None
That's not you job?
None
That's your job.
Yes, it depends who was near the phone, should answer.
You work in your own house? The job is in your own house?
None
Yes.
I'm at work now
When repeating the couple thing, it was hard to break up to me. That couple broke up, something that didn't
I know, i can imagine but, what do i know, enjoy who you're with now
The truth is: I'm with a guy there
Is he there with you now?
Yeah, a twenty eight year old one
But is he there in your house now?
Yes
Oh, yeah? And didn't you live with a Chilean friend?
Yes, he lives with a Chilean friend of mine.
Is she there now?
But yes, she's there
None
But,he comes here to visit, he doesn't live in the house
That's fine
He's eating there. I can hear the dish.
Do you eat at this hour?
The Chilean woman is eating
At this hour?
Yes
She's having dinner?
None
None
Yes, she's eating now
Hello
Hello? Good afternoon. My name is John, I'm calling from Vancouver, British Columbia Canada. What's your name?
Miriam, from Florida.
From Florida, nice to meet you.
Yes, a little far
Yes, where in Florida are you talking from?
Orlando.
Yes, like Orlando.
Yes.
I lived a few months near Orlando because it's an hour
Yes
Is not so far
And what do you think of, of today's topic?
How to break up with your partner?
Yes.
Well it depends is for example, I don't know, in how old you are but it depends on, the age of the person
Of one is like seventeen, eighteen years old, well is all natural to have a relationship for six months, a year and to break up and keep on again with another person. And it should be like that
None
I say twenty eight
None
How old are you?
Twenty one.
Twenty one.
Well.
And
I thought a little bit different at fifteen and sixteen years old.
They have a lot of differences then they broke up with the boyfriend, they start to cry but after a month, they forget about everything and have another boyfriend
None
But this also depends on the situation I for example, my parents meet when they were sixteen years old continuing up to now they're together, they've been together for about twenty three years together
It depends on the relationship of the couple
It's true because you learn to love other people at different ages, there are men who don't mature until twenty-nine years
How their family's relationship was
But remember one thing, that was a different world right? It was another time
None
There wasn't a lot of opportunity like one has in the world of today. I say that's why
None
Yes, today the world is more liberal
Yes.
The kids are much more liberal now. They like the fashion world, they like to wear this, trying new things. But, it's still the same, at sixteen, fifteen years old. In my opinion yes, they didn't know what they were doing
Yes.
But i think that after nineteen, twenty years, they have some, not everyone, some of them already have the idea, of what is that they want
I've been with my boyfriend for three years and it would be hard for me if we separated.
Yes
But i also have friends that are twenty two, twenty three years old, that have never had boyfriends and that don't want to have boyfriends
Right
Because they don't like being in a relationship, I mean, they like to have friends, right?,so to speak
Right
Everyone is different, and not everyone that is twenty eight or less is immature, they don't know what they want, it's easy to end the relationship and everyone
After twenty years, its very hard for them, it's not easy to categorize people by age or gender.
Every person is a different world
Yes, but I can only talk about my experience, I am thirty four years old.
None
I got married at twenty one
Wow
I separated two years ago
None.
In my situation, it was a mistake to get married at twenty one. I got married because my girlfriend got pregnant. I have a daughter that's
Twelve years old
NONE
The twenties were very hard for both of us because neither of us had the experience required
None
We were not mature enough
None
To achieve what we wanted to achieve and that is something that I see more, that the
What is the big rush to find a couple? If in
None
I think it is the fear, you think if I loose this one, if I break off with this one, I won't find another one. I had that fear too
None
When I broke off with my wife
None
I thought I would never meet again someone I would like, and specially that she likes me too
But, that is not true.  There is always someone else, other chances come.
Yes
But when you are young, you only think of
Yes
The very moment, that's what I saw. It was a problem because if hadn't been for these
Experiences, that you need to have in life, you need to have this maturity
Yes, I understand that I wouldn't marry even now
None
I know him for three years already, but anything can happen in one month, in one year, you never know.
No it's also all life not bad.
She has three children by different men, so far it has not been able to overcome that she is very impulsive.
None
We must take time to do things.
There is no use to rush things to happen.
You must know whether they will be together for a long time.
When I turned 21 to 25 I will be a little more mature.
It's good to make a mature decision
Yes
For example, IÂ´ve known my partner for 3 years
You never know a person one hundred percent
Yes
It is better now because when you are married everything is more difficult.
For example, I don't want to have children now
Yes, right?
We are
No need to have children after marriage
Yes.
At least for four or five years.
Yes
Do you live with your boyfriend or not?
Yes
Yes. And how long have you been living together?
We've been living together for two years.
To years? and
None
Why were you in such a rush to live together
Yes, it was, it was a rushed situation
Yeah
I was moving to another state, and I met him in New York, I was moving to Michigan
Then I told him that we cannot be together anymore even though I love him because a long distance relationship isn't going to work out.
Yes
He said, no, he wants to follow me to Michigan, he wants to be with me, this and that, and well, he convinced me.
And until now, since then you've been together
I don't really know. I cannot recall. They say I will get to know him in 4 or 5 years.
You will, now that you're 21, until you're 30, you're going to change a lot
You change, every year
Your desires are going to change
None
You change a lot. Yes, if a couple gets together when they're 20, the desires, the
The desires of each person changes too much between the ages of twenty and thirty, and it becomes harder if one already has, for example
If it already has a commitment, right?
None
I say that one that not have kids during that time.
Yes, and I, totally
And  when is, yes and that is what, continues with that, because
None
None
Yes. One is very well informed.
Yes, and that is the thing that unfortunately within our community, sometimes excuses are made, right? They don't educate themselves, but
There's so much information in Spanish
None
The same as in English,there is so much information about the controk
None
In every language, don't you think?
I'm Mexican, and in Mexico they still don't have all that information in all the places. There are still places that the people live in their ranches that
Their electricity is
Yes, I am half well
A candle
What part of Mexico do you come from?
Hello?
Hello?
Yeah
What's your name?
What?
What's your name?
My name is William
William, we're both here again.
Let me be perfectly honest, i have spoken with four or five people, i don't know exactly who's this
Inge
Inge, just like yesterday
Yes, just like yesterday, how are you?
Here cooking again, because I always cook at this hour.
Are n't you married?
No, I'm not married and i don't have a girlfriend or anything
None
I like to be a twenty eight year old man.
You have to cook for yourself
No, and I love cooking.
What are you making?
I am preparing a coated steak, with croutons
None
Beans today, because I think yesterday I didn't cook the beans too well. But I think today they are fine
The last time you were also preparing a coated steak
Yes, I love coated steaks. That's my favorite
How do you do it?
I think I don't do it like most Cubans do it, who use one of those thin steaks. I buy a sirloin steak.
What do you call it? It's like a cookie that is squashed. I put it on top, coat it and leave it.
I put onions on it, I put little green peppers and I cook it for at least half an hour.
In the oven?
I place it
None
I cook it in the frying pan
OK
In the frying pan. I had a bottle of wine today, because today I have to celebrate that I made a sale
A twelve thousand dollars sell. So
What do you sell?
I think I ca
What do you sell?
I sell fabrics
And so much money?
Twelve thousand dollars with a commission. Yes, a lot of money.
None
I sold a fabric of I don't know if you know much about the European designers how can you say
In the United States they know Gucci
None
There in Europe those people are nothing. In Europe what is known is Roberto Cavalli, Valentino, Emanuel Ungaro, people a little bit higher right. I sold a fabric,
Many yards. I sold like one hundred twenty, one hundred thirty yards at basically a lot of money. I'm very happy today. So, I don't care. Talk with me about whatever you want
Well, the topic is if it's easy or hard breaking up with the partner
Let me
You've had several partners right, of different types, of different ages, or no?
Yes, I've had several. let me ask you because if I'm not mistaken, you are married with kids.
Yes
What do you think? If it's hard, a thing, not very easy breaking up with a partner. You start.
You know what William? I think we already talked about this same topic.
Then, let's talk about something else.
And I think I talked it with you also.
Then let's talk about something else.
Yes
What do you like to cook?
Because i'm vegetarian, I'm not a very good cook. I don't know how to cook meat so that's why I asked you.
Yes
My husband is a carnivore, so I think he suffers with me
Your husband is the American, I remember now.
Yes, he doesn't cook either.
So, what do you do? You get only McDonald's, you go to McDonald's, you go on the road, where do you go?
Teach me,i don't cook, but, it's i do chicken and turkey and, but not red meat, no, because it's too hard to cook to get it right
Chicken, and that sort of stuff.
CHICKEN, THAT SORT OF THING,
The American eats that chicken.
Fine, a little cold, nothing else. I got a cold, i don't know where
Yeah?, what are you taking?
Just Vitamin C
Vitamin C?
Yes
Orange juice
What juice?
Orange juice, that's what has most Vitamin C, i guess, right?
Yes, i have gotten sick a lot this year, you know
Hey girl, what a coincidence we have... like three times
This hasn't happened with anyone though it has happened so many times?
No. I've talked with many Chileans, I 've talked with two Argentinians, one Puerto Rican, and a Mexican.
None
The only one I've talked to two or three times you could say
And I think that this is the third time, that we talk.
You've been the only one I've talked with three times so I don't think that we should talk about the same thing
Maybe you have something different to tell me.
No, truthfully
I live the crazy life like Ricky Martin, I work alot so I can make money for the weekend.
We go to the big parties around here.
Ah. How nice. Yes, well you're still young.
Well, you can't say very young. I think that in two years, I'll be in my thirties.
None
So I don't consider myself to be very young, but well, yes, I'm not married, I don't have to answer to anyone
And do you think in some moment?
What will I do.
Do you think you'll stay single?
I don't think I'll be single for a long time. I fell in love with a girl from South America. She was Argentinian.
I fell in love with her, but things got complicated, she wanted to get married for the paper and it was more for me.
Was honest with me, but I had to get it myself, you know
None
I had to talk to her, and get it out of her, and she didn't want to tell me, that's why I didn't do it, but to a good girl
Cares more about the interest than about love, so, you know
None
There are problems. I have met many like her in my life and believe or not, I grew up in Miami.
Know Miami well, Miami is exactly like New York
None
You must have more street than life. So I didn't fall into her trap. But never mind, women and men, we must go on, and
What can I tell you? I don't want to be alone. I know that someday I will find a girl or a woman, or a lady, or whatever
I'll marry her but i can't take it too hard
None
It's not easy nowadays to find a mature woman
Yes, I think so
We are really bad, right?
Yes
Between men and women
I think that sometimes men look for women much younger than them. I knew a couple who
She was Russian
None
The husband was thirty years older than her. Yes, I think that
Wow
Thirty years. What have in common?
Wo
My parents have about a twenty year age difference
Hopefully they use a lot of viagra.
But, thirty years. Look that she is
Tell her, tell her that I am going to send her three bottles of Viagra.
Look that she is twenty and he is fifty.
Oh, my God. But well
Yes, I say fine, sometimes men look for younger women because they are more beautiful, or more
Is that
But they can, they can, like, mold them, they are more, a little manageable
Let's generalize for a second: when you have that much money, you can do what you want with most women.
And there are many woman lend themselves for that.
Yes
As there are many women that believe in love, in the feelings,
That is true
But  in this country, when somebody offers you so much, is difficult to say no.
None
At least, me, I try to avoid that. I I am a six feet tall man, I have green eyes, black hair eh, I am neither fat nor thin, you understand me, but
That isn't either throwing the money to women, because after all, what woman doesn't like going out to eat to some fancy restaurant?
And this and that, but not setting the trap, you know, of 'I have a lot of money' no, not at all
And she is interested in something necessary because you are, more or less, buying her
Sure
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Tell me. I thought you were talking to me, excuse me. Tell me
Do you live with someone?
I am visiting my cousin and my grandma who live here in Holland
None
Do you live in?
We were in Holland not long ago
You came to Holland?
We took the children to disneyland
I don't live far, I live about fifteen minutes from there
Yes
Well by now.  In the next two, I've been two holidays here.  I think in the next twenty or thirty days, I'll move to Miami.
I think that something is going on between Mickey Mouse and Pluto, anyway.
Mickey Mouse has always his hand in Pluto's pocket. I don't know, I am a little confused with that. But anyway
My life is nice in Miami, because there is so much beach, so many people, so many Chilean girls, Argentinean, Bolivian, people from everywhere. Every nice place
And what part of Miami do you live in?
In a city called Cando. It is not a very big city but it is a city. I won't say exclusive, but
Not downwards
But that is near Miami, downtown Miami, isn't it?
Well, downtown Miami can be considered in many ways, but I am about ten or fifteen minutes from there
OK, not that far, then
A very nice place, really nice, already. and how are your, I wonder if it is sons or daughters
A son and a daughter.
HOW ARE YOUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS?
The big one is five
Everything fine?
And the small one is, he just turned four
And your husband, what's his name?  I guess he has one of those gringo names, Kenny or Jenny
His name is Daniel
Wow, Daniel
Yes
And you, you call him in English, Daniel?
It depends, if I am talking to him in English, then I call him in English, and if I am talking to him in Spanish then I call him in Spanish
I have never heard you speaking in English, how do you pronounce the name?
Hello I'm Alfredo, I speak from New York
How are you? You're speaking with George also from New York
Hello, George. How are you? I think we spoke once on another occasion. How is everything going?
There putting up with the cold a little sick
Yes and I believe that the topic also we've already touched on it look how things are
Seriously
If i remember well you it was another person that you had married a couple times something like that right
Yes I think that it was the same topic
The
Well for me is easy
I mean is not so hard finding more topics
Yes is hard
They should hire to do the topics.
Yes, there aren't a lot of topics. I think that a lot of topics
This
There are lots of topics but well let's talk again of the same topic that matters.
Okay
Like that we change opinion
Okay, have you changed your mind perhaps while thinking about it?
No the same and really for me it's been relatively easy
Yes.
There are some traumas. when you switch houses everything else, the relationship hasn't been easy to me
No, it has not been dramatic
I believe that you are still in love with someone
Yes, that's important, m
I believe that it makes a difference. It's not about getting used to a new house, like any other change of lifestyle.
And the pain goes beyond that, it's an emotional pain and
Yes
It hurts a lot
Yes it does but I think that I mean, in my opinion, I know that it's not the same for everyone
Like suddenly, I don't know, I spoke about this and I think he was coincidentally from Canada, about this same subject
Yes
A couple of times ago and they'd say that they were in the process, it was the third time and she told me that it was easier but she couldn't put up with it
The best thing was to end it, yes? She said that to me, I mean the process is going to end soon but it's not that easy, we are not prepared to
None
And I don't know if some break ups someone goes like one day in the morning they decide they don't want to go on, it's just screwed
Any of your friend had a big shock because of a break up
Which one has been more dramatic, the one that you've seen in real life?
Yes, I know of a man, some of my friends but the one that was worse was that of a man, he was in the military
None
And he was very bad tempered, the military style, those in our country who think that everybody is at their service, right?
There was no feeling
He recognizes all he has lost.
None
I think it is dramatic in these cases, specially when one of the persons has been unhappy with the other
And finally takes the decision, right?
Sure
So, maybe the other one never expected that reaction, right?, he always thought he had the situation under control
So, he discovers he is actually affected, that's some case, do you know any?
Well, mm, I think it is very interesting, but you made me think of another thing
Yes
Wait. Let me see. Wait. It's gone now. Let me remember. It was about
What? what?
I just don't remember now, but when you were talking I thought I'll say this
Oh, I see
Now I don't remember what I wanted to say, something you made me think of
About breaking off, of some friend, the situation is that someone had the other dominated, but the other broke off, right?
Yes, now I remember, sometimes you think that you are the one who broke off,
When, when they want to break, some people to avoid doing it themselves
None
Start to behave, start a behavior that is intolerable for the other
None
I mean that will provoke, will provoke fight that will obviously end in that it ends
None
But sometimes, sometimes it starts like the opposite of what the other wouldn't think
Like this situation
I have seen that move many times.  If someone wants to break up, he will start not saying where he's going, or behave badly in other ways so that eventually
Yes
I mean that ends is another way of doing it
Yes the other person is the one who makes the decision and takes the blame, right
That is exactly what it is
Something like that right? yes that is also look that is perceived in some cases, or maybe they do it voluntarily, right
Yes
And maybe in some cases one doesn't decide and suddenly starts to fall because the other says no no let's go see you later
Yes, it's hard that I don't think that mate the ten percent of the
Of the couples I mean some are let's end with this issue that doesn't work anymore
What percent?
I don't think that more than ten percent, perhaps twenty percent. I think that the majority (don't) put up with it.
Each ten or twenty percent
And that are honest in saying no, it's over
NONE
I don't know if you agree with me. I don't think the percentage is very high. The majority of the people put up with hope
I think a lot economic situation for the kids or for excuses
None
I think this, no, I think
You think that marriages are really not what they seem in the end.
Yes I sincerely think this, I've seen a lot that people hold on
Yes but so that
And sincerely, I've seen it
Yes
So I think that it's difficult but I don't know, ten years what do I know, I don't know if I'm wrong, no, but I've seen many people, a lot of people
Who play you
Yes
There are like hmm, yes, living life, that's it
None
I don't know what your opinion is.
Well I think that speaking on this topic that they gave us
None
I think that we were also talking about this and our time ran out
Yes
It's a variable like too much. They say that it gets harder or easier with age
I think that we have to take time, the age you have
Yes
Two, the length of that relationship, because, for example, it could be very difficult
None
For a fifty year old person that's been with someone since twenties
Yes
A sixty year old person divorced twice and has a one year old relationship
Those are very different cases, but I think age does influence in the way that when you mature there are more things that have happened to you
You're also more emotionally scarred in life
None
I think break-ups are easier with age.
Is long, but the length of relationships is almost the same as age
Yes
That's when, that's when i think
Yes, i agree, lets say there's more experience, right?, hello?
An experience that
Hello? We have that with age there's more experience, right? I don't know. Suddenly I'm thinking about the woman.
Suddenly it's harder because of the age, I don't know if feeling lonely or in a completely different situation..
Yes
Unprotected but,
Lets say that is the change of life, we were talking about change of life, so the difference is that if someone has not changed his life style or his way
Yes. It is difficult.
For so much time and after that, it changed drastically, that shock is very strong
I think there are the two of them.
Yes
A part for some that lets say have experience and all could be more easy, for others that really rested on their laurels it is going to be very difficult, I donÂ´t know right
We have hit the mark.
Yes
If we have the same topic the next time we are going to be masters in beginning all the different parts that we could
Yes of course
Without notifying of this encounter
Yes
THE
Really I hope another topic for a change
I was just going to see how many studies are left for me, How many are left for you?
I have not seen it the last week I was something sick, something busy and I think it was really like four days and
Without talking
Yes. No, I have more. I think that.
Yes
Yes, i got
And I really haven't even had the time to look out how many
YOU HAVE SEEN SOMETHING CAME, IF YOU HAVEN'T STARTED THE CALLS, I NEVER START THE CALLS
Yes
But if you start five calls from five different phones, it seems
Oh yes
And they pay you fifty more dollars
Yes, there's a special bonus or something, besides i'm very busy
I was going out now

Sure, of course. That's also why they need you, to
To be able.
Or, is it all in english, what you speak there?
I speak only Spanish.
In spanish, right?
None
Look at that. That's good
They give me a computer and i explain it to them; but i have notice that more often than not, they don't want any of the opportunities that they're offered, whether it's because the papers aren't there
They're not citizens, they don't want to because they'd have to leave. They don't want to pay for all the benefits, but
The people. The employees.
They need it very much, the employees, yes
Yes
Because they offer them life insurance, insurance
None
Really cheap, twenty cents a week.
Oh, that's not cheap.
Yes, where do they want them?
None
I explained to them that there has been a lot of cases where they dies because of an accident, and their family could
They're left with nothing.
Yeah, nothing
Sure, some understand and get it
NONE
They listen to you
They will at least know the others
Sure
Because they push them a lot
And, yes, sure
None
Later thay can have problems apart
None
With those things. And from what, from what city, at what age did you come here
Yes.
At what age did you come to the United States?
What? No. Yes, here.
Has it been long?
Third generation.
Okay.
Yes, my grandparents.
Your grandparents had already come.
Yes, they had come young, and have lived in Texas since they were children.
You that was born here, let's say.
My parents are also from Texas
In texas, sure.  they went there first, and then went
Yeah
Look, look at that, look at that, look at that.
Yeah
Now that you tell me, I don't know. I'm not sure.
None
Are you? I'm from, from Buenos Aires
Yes?
I don't know if
That's nic-
If I already talked to you, maybe. I don't remember
Yeah
It could be. I'm here in Philadelphia.
You live in Philadelphia.
No, I don't live here. But, I arrived here about a month ago.
Yes? Group meeting, okay. okay, Okay
Yes
One moment
Yes, no problem
I don't have
You're working, they're talking to you
Yes
And it's good to get a little time off for this
One minute, yes
It's good talking here, they  pay well
Okay, pardon.  Yes.
Are you going to return to your house now? You work until much later.
No. No. No. I left work. I'm in the hotel and we are immediately, the rooms where my coworkers, my friends,
You are in the hotel the whole time, right?
They've called me, yes.
Since you travel so much, you are all in the hotel.
Yes, I like to travel with them. Because, the assignments that they send us where I'm alone, I don't like because it really is cold
Sure
That's what scares me a lot
SURE
But, this topic of the, the couples and the break up,
Ah, the topic
My opinion is yes
And you, what are you? Are you married?
Because, I'm, I was married  for twenty years. But, not really married. Yes we were legally married, but, he had a drinking vice
He liked women. And we were separated for a long time. For almost fifteen years.
For fifteen years separated.
Separated, yes.
How bad.
Yes he was
None
And I was stubborn. I was saying, he's going to get well. But he wouldn't get well, and I had two children
Sure, he's going to stop drinking, he's going to
So I said,
He's going to
I said he'll get better and he'd go and drink with his friends like he was a young man
Sure, and was he also cheating on you? Do you know.
Excuse me? Hello?
I was saying that if he had cheated on you
Oh yes,  he had a lot of women, yes. So,
What were you thinking,
I don't want to have a relationship with a man, i'll stay single forever and they used to say marry
Bother me I didn't want a man, oh, well I didn't want them near my daughters because I was so scared of them.
How many girls do you have?
Just two and they are now twenty five and twenty six years old, I'm forty four years old now.
Two daughters.
I married young, outside.
How?
None.
You are
Paying attention because they are giving us the instructions for tomorrow because they always change our time.
None
Tomorrow comes out that perhaps it wasn't the time we thought
And they are telling you, that now you have to go.
They want us to change the time, to see who would volunteer to go.
There's no drama, there's no problem.
Yes.
So, then, you passed,
None
You separated
But
Well, no, but not all men are.
Yes, I separated
Are the same.
No, it's true because dad was very nice with mom.
There are some worse ones.
That is true. And then, yes, after my kids grew up I said, Well, we are getting divorces. And I stayed,
That's it.
For seven years, I've been divorced.
Sure.
Then now, no
And now you are with no one. It's good.
I said, this time already passed.
And what do you think, that the separation is hard, that they threw in the topics?
I think that if the person gets used to having a new relationship, yes is easy one would get used to the person.
Yes that, if you are able, of those people that are always with someone you say? Something like that? That is,
Exactly.
None
None
Easy.
I think so. Already having experience, because I've known a lot of people that have relationships, they end fast, they break up.
But they are always with someone.
And, they are fast and yes. They are always with someone. some people don't like to be alone.
There are things that surely don't last long. Sometimes is that type of person, right?
Correct, then
Because is a person that is a couple of months, at most a year. Then,
What I do regret, is that
They go out with another one.
I regret that one of my daughters doesn't like Oh, really? we can go Friday Aha. Oh me too.
The flight is tomorrow and our day is ending already
You are already returning, returning to Indiana.
Different areas My colleagues come from Texas
I can imagine.
Yes, they have  we are sometimes thirty, forty. But,
Sure, are they all Spanish speaking or no? No, all of them.
Yes, all this group is,
They are all Spanish speaking.  The majority from Mexico, right?  With roots...
Yes, correct
Mexicans, I can imagine.
Well, one.
Okay. What are you telling me? That your daughter doesn't like what?
Well, yes, my daughter has a very bad idea of marriages because she saw me suffer so much with my marriage
Sure
She's scared to have a relationship with any guy and she likes many guys
Girlfriend relationship, or everything.
Relationship of girl- all complete.
Oh everything? Ah, everything.
Yes, completely. And, I feel guilty, because, the poor girl didn't see good opportunity. But, yes, her grandparents had a good relationship, they had a good marriage,
Sure. Yes.
And, the fact that they had a lot
Much
That's true. We have out things because we buy food, like that, we made a... because some of us
What happened?
Some of us, had a car assigned to us, right?
Yes, they give you a car when you go, in general
A car
That's good
A friend told me, i have a friend that's from Spain
Yes
And from work, andhe tells me, the cars are the ones you take when you go shopping?
The carts.
That's it, the carts, but it's a car, a what? A vehicle
A vehicle, sure
None
And sure, well, they call it different in every country
I feel like .
Even if they're all of Hispanic language, they always, they're always named
Yes
Different
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon. My name is Blanca.
How are you, Blanca?
Fine, thanks. Wait a moment, please.
Yes, of course.
Yes. Tell me. Hello?
I'm here, yes.
SORRY, WHERE ARE YOU CALLING FROM?
I live in Colorado.
I live in Phoenix.
In Phoenix?
None
And how are the temperatures over there today?
It's cool. It's cool.
The winters over there are not so bad, right?
No, they are not so bad.Not as horrible as over there in the east.
Where are you from originally?
From Colombia.
From Colombia
Yes
My favorite singer comes from, Shakira.
Shakira, but i'm not from Barraquilla
YOU'RE NOT FROM BARRANQUILLA, WHERE ARE YOU FROM, CALI?
I'm from MedellÃ­n
Medellin, imagine that.
Right, from Mede
Your land is beautiful, it's a shame there are so many problems there, right?
Yeah, like every country, i think.
Of course
The same problems happen currently in every country
It's everywhere including here
Exactly
What do you think about couples break-up?
There are times in life where it's easier to break a relationship than others
Yes, it's true
Yes, i think so
And have you experienced that in the past?
Yes
Yes
I think that when you're young, it's easier to break up
So,
When one has already gone through other relationships and there's more maturity, one faces with more maturity and more sense a break up.
Is
They are going to cause pain
Yes, I think it helps you overcome because I went through that experience a few years ago when it was my divorce
None
WHICH IS A GREAT BLESSING?
None
It was hard for me, and I think that it was hard for my daughter to see her parents separating and,
She has to be going from one place to the other all the time. But, she had adapted quite well because the parental relationship
It's quite good and that helps my daughter a lot.
Yes, when I was young, I had a boyfriend for a long time, and we broke up, and for me it was
Horrible. I wanted to die. And, after, I had a boyfriend, a long time also, I was the one who broke up the relationship, and for me, things became easier.
Yes. Is true
I think that before, it was kind of hard because I was young. But now, later it was easier because I already had experience, I was more mature, already,
I already knew what a relationship that didn't lead me to anything and that wasn't good for me. Then, it was either stay in a relationship that wasn't going to lead to anything
Or end it.
Exactly.
One already looks at things more objectively
Makes one be more careful, in my case, since I'm still single,
At the moment, right?
None
It would be much more discerning, careful
Right
On things like that, I wouldn't be impulsive, I wouldn't get carried away by beauty and stuff like that
Yes
But i would analyze other more mature aspects of a relationship
THAT'S TRUE
And, you have children, right?, a little boy next to you, yes
Yes, and, i have two
That's good, it's nice.
I have two little children,  i have a
Yes, how old are they?
I have a girl, one and a half years old, and a three year old boy.
That's nice and cute.
They're both little
Yes,  they get better as they grow up,  my little girl i have so much fun with her now compared to when she was little, although she has always been lovely
I do so many things with her and she asks so many questions. She's hungry for learning.
None
The experience is nice
Yes, that's true.
And is your husband from Colombia also?
No, my husband is from Guatemala.
Oh, from Guatemala, and the
My husband is from Guatemala, yes.
You met him here in the United States?
I met him in Massachusetts.
I've received many calls from that part of Massachusetts, and from Pennsylvania also.
Yes.
People that live there from the Fisher program. It seems like there's a lot of people in that area, especially Argentinians.
There are a lot of Argentinians in that area.
I have received many calls from Argentinian people.
Yes. And you talk to people of the opposite sex. Have you talked? Yes?
Yes.
Yes, until now, this is my second, I'm starting another.
Yes, yes
Well, up to now I've only gotten to talk with ladies, and the great majority, is funny, they are from Argentina.
Oh really?
Yes.
The work with this agency is good?
Working with them?
Yes
Yes, and did you start the program recently?
Yes, not long ago
I'm still waiting for them to pay me the first term. I ended it like two months ago.
Yes
The thin is that they extended the cals from twenty lives to thirty, but they made a mistake.  They started calling me home again.  Well, they added even more.
Yes
I have thirty five calls completed, and i still have four more to complete, that's what i think they haven't payed
None
I'm starting another now and this one I believe when they're four.
None.
Yeah, it seems like a long time, but there comes a time when it ends, you have twenty five, right?
I haven't been able to finish
Well, it's a know university, Penn State and yes, they will pay you
None
I also like the experience, that I can talk
The
With people from other countries too
Exactly, the cultural exchange? that's the best.
You don't have to be talking about it all the time.
The people who want to see it, like we interact. How do you say it, interaction.
These are the forms of expression and interactions of different regions.
Exactly.
None
Like that, they study all .
None
There are all these issues to talk about, but I notice that I can take any issue. For example, the issue of Colorado, where I love and live.
I already have twenty-six years here.
In Colorado.
IT'S A VERY BEAUTIFUL PLACE, I LOVE IT. BUT I SAY WHEN
Does it snow there?
It snows a lot but in the city it doesn't snow as much. The mountain that I've been to, the winter is up to now more than a hundred and twenty inches.
Oh, God.
Here in the city, a very small amount of snow has fallen. But, in December there was a cold spell that was below zero.
None
And that's terrible cold, but
No, tell me, I lived in Massachusetts for five years, and the cold
Because of the humidity and because of the cold, Colorado wins on that count.
It's humid and it's cold as fuck. Last winter left me like terrorized because we stayed inside, closed up, my husband
With my babies.
Yes.
We had just arrived from Colombia, because we were spending Christmas over there.
Yes.
And, there was a very strong snowfall, a storm. And we stayed locked up in the house, isolated, with the snow up to the top of the door, that we couldn't couldn't go out.
Don't tell me.  yes, we've had.
No, not anymore.
Ah, times like that here, that it snows and one can't go out anywhere, the planes can't take off from the airport. yes, it's bad. But, on the other hand, here we have one of the most beautiful summers that you can see.
They are very sunny, very clear blue sky
Yes
And at night, because of Colorado's elevation, which Denver is like a mile of elevation, well the stars look very beautiful, I love them.
Yes
And, my daughter likes it, I tell here, you are a Colorado native, because she was born here.
None
Her mother is from Oaxaca, so she has Puerto Rican and Mexican blood.
Yes.
Is the funniest thing, because she from one house to the other,
None
Change the accent. She starts to try to talk like
According to the place she's at.
My accent is pretty well .
Talks a lot Mexican. Kind of strange
Yes it's that, because you told that you were Puerto Rican, but I felt the accent was like Central American, almost Nicaraguan.
I don't know how it is these days but I've been here about twenty six years. I'd think that I wouldn't been speaking so much like a Puerto Rican.
There in Puerto Rico, i know that I talk like a Mexican when with my family and all that
Yes.
Because I have, but nothing, I think that I have a little bit of everything, because I have friends from everywhere. I Colombian, Mexican, Puerto Rican friends, from everywhere, Cubans
MORE THAN HALF OF THE TIME, I'M SPEAKING ENGLISH ALSO BECAUSE I WORK IN A PLACE WHER THEY ALL SPEAK ENGLIGH.
I don't talk about that
Why?
I SPEAK ENGLISH
That shouldn't bother you, that comes as you learn it. The most important thing, Blanca, is that you have the desire.
Well, I'm interested, and in fact I, babbling here
That's the most important, that I lost the fear, and even though you say disparates in the beginning, but, little by little the fear gets broken, and after that, you're learning even more
I spoke terrible English when I arrived here in the United States. Now, I'm pretty fluent in both the written and oral language.
I speak it very well. But, I don't think it was easy at first.
And how is Colorado for finding work?
It's good, but you know the laws here about immigrants, they are getting tougher everywhere. But, it's a place where there are a lot of immigrants working all around here.
Here the pay is awful.
Yes, here.
The salaries in Boston are competitive
Yes,here they pay more than in Arizona, definitely.
We moved here, but I keep repeating, I want to go back to Massachussets.
You can go to Massachussets, you can try Colorado is a nice place to live, there are good work opportunities for Latinos, do you have all your papers in order?
Yes, yes, yes. I'm a resident. My husband has been a citizen for eight thousand years.
Yes, that's good
Hi?
Hi Fede
How are you?
Hi
Who is this?
What, who's this?
What's your name?
How are you?
Fine
Fine
What's new?
I'm here dude
It's a coincidence to find you here.
What a coincidence
What a coincidence
Are you fine?
What's new? where are you right now?
I'm here at home now.
Very well.
Yes, i just finished having dinner.
What did you have for dinner?
Martin, he left a roast he made the other day with
That lamb?
Yeah
A gross lamb
Right, i just finished, I've been eating that everyday until today, so
It wasn't tasty?
It was good, it's porotos, that lasts a couple days in the fridge
Yes
Well
Whatever you want
A week it's fine.
But, what? you cook-, do you heat it again every time you take a little?
I take a little and heat it up.
Sure, yeah.  You heat it up, again, so it can last a lot.  Every time you boil it, it lasts a week longer.
NONE
Three or four days have passed.
But
And you're not sure, there's not much time, so you boil it again and that's it, but the problem is when some bacteria or something grows there
Yeah, i put it in the freezer.
Yes
And got a little bit every time he had lunch or dinner
No, it doesn't matter.
Besides he
A week doesn't do anything
How much did he cook and when?
Excuse me?
Yes, Martin cooked it on the weekend, so
Yes, it's OK
None
You want more and you want to store it for longer, you boil it again,
And then it's like it's new. If something grew, you killed it by boiling it
I killed it, okay. Okay.
You killed it
But I already ate it all, so
How's everything? The cat?
The cat is all right, she's ok, sleeping
THAT CAT IS REALLY MEAN
No, she's calm
Very mean
I downloaded all this stuff from the PC but I still don't have internet. I'm going crazy
Why isn't the internet on yet?
This looks like.
They're giving us internet at six in the afternoon
But to me, when I installed it here, they gave me a date and it was going well long before that
Yeah, i mean, i tried it yesterday, today, but, there's no thing to do. It'll be on around the twenty four but i really don't know
That's odd.
Being without internet sucks, i swear, even more when you have nothing else to do, I'm telling you
Yes
If you were studying, that would be something different, but
And, are there any internet cafe's there?
I don't know, i didn't find any
Some place where you can connect in?
There aren't any
Library in your faculty, have you gone to the faculty?
Yes, i went, the thing is that, well, i have to go all the way to there if i want to, it's ok, i mean
When do you start class? You don't have to leave now, do you?
No, I'm just starting on the thirty, it seems
That's late, isn't it?
Pretty late, why?
I'm cooking some pierogis.
Did you buy or make them?
I bought them
You bought them, yes, Martin would buy them at the beginning.  It's  been a long time that we don't buy them, but yes, at the beginning we would buy a lot of pierogis like that, just oil and onion nothing more.
Yes, olive oil which is healthier.
Like that Olive oil. How yummy
If you want I'll give you some to taste through the phone.
Well, if not today, I'll be there tomorrow.
I'LL SEND YOU A FAX OF RAVIOLI, MAN TOMORROW YOU'RE COMING?
The pierogi. Yes. Yes.
You're coming in the car or in the Chinese?
No, in th car.
You are driving
Yes
Very good, because
Yes, because the Chinese leaves you in the middle of nothing
None
And I don't know well from where to where it goes, but I'm not sure where it leaves from
None
Is not there, is that here inside the city the stop of the Chinese.
Yes. And the greyhound?
It's in the outskirts. The Greyhound is also closer, to see the football stadium, or the
Yes
Baseball, or any of those two is like behind that. And but, it comes out let's see, it comes out twenty to go and twenty to return, it's forty.
And with the car I don't know, with thirty I go and come. I think.
Is like that.
So I think I'm going in the car, for now,if I decide that no, tomorrow
I don't know, I say, why drive alone well it's a downer.
Yes. Is kind of a downer.
It still is not that much.
No.
Besides that Juancito for one year that was here in Philadelphia would go three times a week to Baltimore because he was going, going to the university there.
Really?
Yes, Juancito studied there he did the -M-B-A in, in the university of Baltimore, Where? In
University of Baltimore?
The University of Maryland, I think
Driving up to here.
Yes.
What desire.
Yes. He would travel three or four times per week.
Look at that
Very funny, in a peugeotite, Juan's peugeotite, you didn't met him
Why didn't he do the MBA?
None
Uh, closer to Philly?
He did a year there, and he got transferred after that, transferred to
Oh, sure, but i don't understand why he didn't do that from the beginning
Because he didin't know. And besides, Maryland was very good and
Sure
I don't know
It's ok
Well, the thing is that it was good too. But I don't know why he decided like that
Yes, sometimes when you don't know universities well
Yes, besides he signed up from Argentina, i don't know how he did that
You don't have a clue, you go where you think is best
Yes, but
Is everything OK with you?
Everything's fine
Work?
Are there any novelties around Baltimore?
No, walking a little bit, no, everything calm, the truth is I don't have, I don't have a lot, just these days, like I finished doing everything I need to do
Very good.
So, for now, since I'm half
With this, did something happen with the truck?
No because you know that the cars parked there, two blocks
Sorry?
IT KEEPS BEING PARKED IN THE SAME PLACE.
With the same crash?
Yes.
Look at that.
It doesn't have the ticket you see, the ticket that the police left it doesn't have more
Yes.
I imagine that someone has taken it, they didn't move it, I don't know. I went to look for the report.
And called those who needed to come, and all the options, and everything, but no, it came back the same money that if we had to return it
Nothing more happened.
That's good to eat
You have to eat, what are you doing now?
No, I called because it takes him fifteen minutes to come here.
That's good.
No, the little onion is already getting black. It's time to put the pierogis on the casserole.
In the pot
In the pot
Dude, and are you not going to see Juan this weekend?
No, I don't think so
And
No, the weather's crappy.
DID YOU TOLD HIM YES? I HAVEN'T ASKED HIM YET
Tell him you spoke to me and that we're going
Why are you mean to Martin?
Tell him, Oh, I'm sotty, i can't..., tell him, Oh, it's a shame I won't see him because they leave on Friday morning and
Tell him that, and I won't see him.
Why are you so mean?
I'm like that, don't complain
Oh, that's sweet, i want to
Really good, yesterday was
I miss the
Exceptionally good
None
I said let's not order at Japollo because sole is there
There was no agreement.
It's good at Japollo
Without Sole being there
Very well, very well, it's OK
I saod, well, i don't know, it's something that Sole eats, but no, it seems everyone liked Japollo's
It's very tasty
Yeah, but yesterday
I liked it very much
I went there and it was delicious
I think you didn't ask for that anymore
Delicious, the squid?
That's at the hot peppers.
Not the ones from hot pepper, no, not the ones from hot pepper because there were less people there
Yes, but
They're very good.
And. but they have those really spicy things
Very noble, at least it's equally noble.
It cleanses your whole
If you have any sin, it removes it
Is that true?, that if you eat something spicy, like if you have something
Frightened
I won't ask you, oh this thing that I'm asking is so stupid but I don't know
Yes.
If you eat something spicy or hot, does it clean your system from some types of bacteria?
No.
No, it has nothing to do with it.
No, what do i know
And why does people
Yes but, no.
None
I don't know, which question.
It's all right.
I have no idea.
How is Caro?
She's saying, Hi to you Caro
Send her one.
Yes. She says it's a shame that we can't see each other. How are we?
That's silly
Go skying
When are you leaving then? You still have to use your new skates?
Yes, what do I know, you see? I don't know, I don't know, we'll see how much
Do you own skydiving clothes?
Four minutes, I give orders from my phone. It's always a good thing.
Don't you have a timer in your kitchen?
We did, I gave her orders so that she would
None
It's very important for me to give the orders, otherwise nobody would do it.
Yes.
And that's a shame.
It gets out of control.
It's sad, as they say it.
So, you like to give orders.
No, I don't like to. I like to give orders but if I don't do it
How?
They would all do as they wish, it'd be a real mess
How is your sister?
You really have to control her because she
She's nice.
She misbehaves
She does?
She misbehaves, a lot. She does things that she shouldn't do.
What are you gonna do about it? Nice people sometimes behave badly
In the ass so it will behave
It likes it there
How much time do we have left? No. Just finish
You ask me all the questions.
What do you want me to talk about?
What do i know?
Well, I'm in the lab today. Sure that's finally finished. Yes, Grant
None
And just as she finished her grant, she submitted it, and came to the lab to mess with me
To ask results?
Yes, to interrupt, it's nothing to do
None
Everyday, but well
Well.
We have to freeze to death for some particular reason
Could you justify that you didn't do anything, or how was it?
Hello, good evening
Hello. Good Evening. My name is Veronica.
Hello, how are you? My name is Ever
How are you Ever
And where are you calling from, Veronica?
Well, the couples, where are you from
I am from Guatemala but I am calling from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
I am from Argentina, I am calling from Washington, DC.
So we are nearby
We're fairly close. what can you tell me about couple break-ups, have you had to break up a lot.
I believe that if one of the topics that they said was that if you changed your age, I definitely think that while
When the person is older I believe it is easier depending on the relationship, no?
It seems to you that is is easier, I understand that it is harder. Yes, I believe that the more you mature to be able to think about some things or to be able to
Become independent? What do i know thinking about longtime couples don't function and stay together, this is the story of a family if there are children and other things.
It affects you negatively to be able to make a decision to break a relationship
When you are talking about already having children, it's not just a couple. We are talking about a marriage.
That is much more distinct than what I thought the topic was. I imagined that it was perhaps a boyfriend / girlfriend thing, or something like that.
Than a prior relationship let's say less formal.
If in a marriage I believe that there are a lot more things to analyze and it is definitely more difficult to break it up, it's not a matter to just say it and
She left me and at some other point I will meet someone more appropriate for my lifestyle
For your project, what are you doing in Pennsylvania? The breaking of couples is not a topic for me, but I am going to make a question to you. Do you think is more common here
Couples in the United States than Guatemala.
Yes, it seems to me it is a lot alike because here you wait first, and people do not get married righ away.
The person is going to get married
I THINK THERE ARE MANY BREAKING IN COUPLES OF A LIFE, AVERAGE AGE OF BREAKING HERE
Is between twenty eight years old
Yes, in the university campus where I work, there are some American girls who are twenty four, twenty three years old.
They are worried about getting married or finding a partner to get married
Yes
Yes, I don't know because of the age.
It is like they are not interested in crossing the twenty-five years old with a definition. I even have a workmate that
She is fine in her relationship, but she is twenty-five, with almost three years as a girlfriend, and as the boy doesn't want to get married.
She is thinking of ending the relationship and find someone who wants a marriage
The truth is that it sounds very
No it catches my attention because if you tell me Argentina I can tell you that if
It happened.
But here I have an image well but it is that what happens to me not sometimes I have a more liberal image and I live more conservative behaviors
Yes for the truth is not the experience I have had in my case regularly I have seen more liberal people but how is it called definitively is going to be everything right?
But when it comes about your friend I think she has the reason because I think if she has been with a boy for three years and is twenty five years old and there are not plans to
A marriage.
Formalize then, and I think that in your case i would do  the same.
Are you in a couple?
Yes I'm married
You're married. Has it been many years?
It's been five years
It's been five years.  Do you have kids?
Yes I have one who's two years old
It's hard thinking of breaking up and there being kids in the middle
Yes, it is quite hard because not only do you think of yourself, but you also  think of them.
In the style of life they would have in the in how hard it would be for them because they are used since babies right? of being with the father and the mother and suddenly
They are not together. Besides that, they are separated as far as the economic lifestyle also becomes harder.
Sure
For the kid, right? Then I think that there are many factors that should be taken into account.
Yes that's true
Are you married?
That's true. Although, I see many of my students, undergraduates of the university, working on some family issue.
At least 80% have parents that are separated.
Yes
And then like in reality that really grabs my attention right seeing twenty four, twenty five year old with this of yes yes I want to get married
And the other face, a seventeen, eighteen year old that with one of the parents
Yes, it's correctly
When the kids are around ten years or more, and the parents get divorced
None
I think, when they are three or four years, the parents get divorced
When they are teenagers
Yes, when they are teenagers they struggle a lot because they can't move on, but when they are babies, they accept it.
Yes, it's like when they have a style and different family structure, so they don't miss the image of their old family.
They don't long for that old family.
Yes
I don't know, what do I know!
Sure, I hope, my advice would be to do it quickly, right?sure, my advice would be to do it quickly, right?
Sure, well I too have, for example, two of my mates, no, I'm thirty five years old and the parents got divorced when they were already adults
My friend in Puerto Rico is separating and believes it should have happened a long time ago
They value the efforts of their parents to have kept the family and home structure
The reason why they stayed together is because they are waiting for the kids to
To reach a certain age in which they will go to university or about to leave the family home and
They decide to divorce then when it won't really affect them
Sure
I don't know if you friend is in that case but
I think so, yes.  They are all adults and it'll still have some impact.
Lots of questions and abvove all, my friend married her partner and it changed her a lot.
Sure
She is married and doesn't have children yet, but she questions her own relationship and the way it affected her. I believe that it does affect the experience that you are having and what you were saying
That the hardest thing has to do with the role-models right, the parents at that time
Yes
I don't know
In which university do you work or study?
I'm in the University of Maryland.
I graduated there!
You graduated here?
In two thousand and three
In which department?
I was in biochemistry, and in
None
Cellular biology
One of my friends works there; I believe she enrolled in 2003 but I am not sure I remember.
So you are from this area
Yes, I was raised in Maryland. I came here when I was seven years old and I grew up in Maryland and
And where did you live?
It was close to the university, I used to live in Highs Bill.
I'm in graduate hills, this complex next to the university
Yes, I know where it is; it's the university garden
The other one is in University Boulevard.
I know which one it is
It's just at the exit of the university, but the other is closer
Yes.
More to the east side. What are you doing in Pennsylvania now?
I'm in third year of medical school.
Medicine is a masters, right!
Yes, it's a major, you have to do a masters and sometimes they get one, they finish, and they get to go to med school
That's different, i don't know how it is in Guatemala, because in Argentina it's three, straight with eighteen years, the medical career
It's seven straight years here, right? It's the same in Guatemala.
Is college public in Guatemala?
There are both public and private ones
Is the public school prestigious?
For medicine, I believe that the public has a better prestige than the private ones, but
The same happens in Argentina
But the problem with the public one is that when there are what they call huelgas, like strikes
Yes.
They lock down the university indefinitely.
