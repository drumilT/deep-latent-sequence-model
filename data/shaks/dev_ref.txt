Now , you lie there on the path .
She said if she were interested in someone , it would be someone who looked like me .
Besides , she treats me more respectfully than the other servants .
What's the obvious conclusion from that ?
Just think , I could be Count Malvolio !
Lady Strachy married her wardrobe manager .
I'd send seven of my servants to go get him .
While I waited , I'd frown impatiently , and perhaps wind my watch , or play with my , with some expensive piece of jewelry I happen to be wearing .
I can't let my lips say his name ; "No man must know."
No man must know." What comes after that ?
No man must know." What if this someone were you , Malvolio ?
But silence , like a knife , cuts open my heart With strokes that draw no blood .
rules my life." Hmm , let me see , let me see , let me see .
I may command the one I love." Well , she commands me .
Why , anyone can see what this means .
There's no ambiguity here .
If only I could somehow relate them to me !
You seem to be a good person , captain , and although people who look beautiful are often corrupt inside , I believe that you have a beautiful mind to go with your good looks and manners .
Please , and I'll pay you plenty for this , help me conceal my identity , and find me the right disguise so I can look the way I want .
I want to be this Duke's servant .
You'll introduce me to him as a eunuch .
You won't be wasting your time , because I really can sing and talk to him about many different kinds of music , so he'll be happy to have me in his service .
You can be a eunuch , but I'll be mute .
I swear on my life I won't tell your secret .
Thank you .
Show me the way .
M" , Malvolio .
M" , why , that's the first letter in my name .
But if I shake it up a little it'll work , because every one of those letters is in my name .
But wait , there's some prose after her poem .
If this letter falls into your hands , think carefully about what it says .
By my birth I rank above you , but don't be afraid of my greatness .
Some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon them .
Your fate awaits you .
Accept it in body and spirit .
To get used to the life you'll most likely be leading soon , get rid of your low-class trappings .
Go ahead .
Goodbye .
Signed , she who would be your servant , The Fortunate Unhappy." This is as clear as sunlight in an open field .
I'll do it .
I'll be vain and proud , I'll read up on politics , I'll insult Sir Toby , I'll get rid of my lower-class friends , and I'll be the perfect man for her .
I know I'm not fooling myself , or letting myself get carried away by my imagination , because every clue points to the fact that Lady Olivia loves me .
She did compliment me on my yellow stockings recently , and she said she liked how the crisscross laces looked on my legs .
Oh , I thank my lucky stars , I'm so happy .
For her I'll be strange and condescending , and I'll put on my yellow stockings and crisscross laces right away .
Thank God and my horoscope !
Here's a postscript ! .
You must have figured out who I am .
If you love me , let me know by smiling at me .
You're so attractive when you smile .
Please smile whenever you're near me , my dearest darling."
Dear God , thank you !
I'll do everything she wants me to do .
I wouldn't have missed this even for a pension of thousands of pounds , to be paid by the shah of Persia .
I could marry that Maria for thinking this up .
So could I .
And I wouldn't ask for any dowry except for her to play another trick like this one .
Neither would I .
Here she comes , the brilliant fool-catcher .
May I kiss your feet ?
And I too ?
Shall I be your slave ?
Me too .
You've made him so delusional he'll go crazy when he learns the truth .
Did it really work ?
Like medicine for a sick man .
If you want to watch , follow me .
I'd follow you to the gates of Hell , you sneaky little devil !
I'll come too .
God bless you , my friend , and your music too .
Do you make your living by playing that drum ?
No , sir , I live by the church .
Oh , you're a clergyman ?
You could just as easily say that a king sleeps near a beggar if the beggar lives near him , or that the church is supported by your drum because it "stands by" your drum .
You're right , sir .
What a wonderful time to be alive !
That's true .
That's why I wish my sister didn't have a name , sir .
Why , man ?
Well , her name's a word , and if you fooled around with it you might make her into a whore .
Why do you say that ?
Honestly , sir , I'd need to use words to explain why , and since words are so unreliable and false , I'd rather avoid using them in a serious discussion .
I bet you're a happy fellow who doesn't care about anything .
You're wrong , sir , I do care about something .
But I'll admit I don't care for you .
If that means I don't care about anything , you should disappear right now , since you're nothing .
Aren't you Lady Olivia's fool ?
No , sir .
I saw you at Count Orsino's recently .
I'm everywhere .
I think I saw you there , you wise man .
Wait , here's a coin for you .
Next time God sends out a shipment of hair , I hope he gives you a beard !
Oh , I know .
Yes , if you kept them together and invested them .
My lady Olivia's inside , sir .
I'll tell them where you come from , though I don't know who you are or what you want .
I'd say I was "out of my element , " but that phrase is overused , so I'll say I'm "out of my air."
This guy's wise enough to play the fool , and only clever people can do that .
And he doesn't let go of his target when a distraction appears .
Hello , sir .
Hello to you too , sir .
I'm headed for your niece , sir .
She's the reason I'm here .
Taste your legs , sir .
Please go inside .
I mean please go into the house , sir .
I will .
But now we don't have to !
Oh , beautiful and accomplished lady , may the heavens rain odors upon you !
My message is not for anyone else to hear , my lady .
It's only for your willing and receptive ear .
Close the garden door and leave me alone to hear his message .
Give me your hand , sir .
I give you my obedience and my humble service , madam .
What's your name ?
Cesario is my name , your servant's name , fair princess .
My servant !
The world's gone downhill since fake humility started passing for compliments .
As for him , I never think about him .
As for his thoughts , I wish he'd think about nothing at all rather than think about me all the time .
Madam , I've come here to try to make you like him .
Oh , please , I'm begging you , don't mention him again .
My dear lady , Please let me say something , I'm begging you .
After you cast your magic spell on me last time , I sent you a ring .
What else could you possibly think of me ?
What's wrong with my niece ?
For God's sake , Sir Toby , you've got to come home earlier at night .
My lady Olivia , your niece , disapproves of your late-night partying .
Well , she can get used to it .
Keep myself ?
They're good enough to drink in , and so are these boots .
If they aren't , they can go hang themselves by their own laces !
Who , Sir Andrew Aguecheek ?
Yes , that's the one .
He's as
Haven't you totally dismissed my honor and integrity in your anger ?
For someone as intelligent as you the situation must be clear enough .
So let me hear what you have to say .
I feel sorry for you .
That's a step in the direction of love .
No , not at all .
It's much better to be destroyed by a noble enemy than by a cruel and heartless one .
I wish you all the best .
You do Stay , Please , tell me what you think of me .
I think you're denying what you really are .
If that's true , I think the same thing about you .
I wish you were what I wanted you to be !
Would it be better if I were that , instead of what I am ?
I wish I were something better , because right now I'm a big fool .
So goodbye , my lady .
No , I won't stay a second longer .
Why are you leaving , my angry friend ?
Yes , you have to tell us why , Sir Andrew .
Well , because I saw your niece Olivia treat the count's messenger better than she's ever treated me .
I saw it in the orchard .
Did she see you there the whole time , old boy ?
Tell me that .
Yes , she saw me quite clearly .
Well , that proves she's in love with you .
Are you trying to make fun of me ?
No , I'll prove it with airtight evidence and logical argument .
And you can't deny evidence and argument , They've been around since Noah's ark .
She flirted with the messenger boy to exasperate you , fire up your passions , and make you angry and jealous .
You should have run up to her , unleashed a few excellent quips invented on the spot , and rendered the young man speechless .
That's what she was expecting , and you let her down .
I'll have to do something courageous then , because I hate intrigue .
I'd rather be a heretic than a schemer with fancy plots .
Well then , improve your situation with a show of courage .
Challenge the count's young servant to a fight .
Hurt him in eleven different places .
My niece Olivia will notice , and let me tell you , no matchmaker in the world can get you a woman faster than a reputation for courage .
It's really the only way , Sir Andrew .
Will either of you give him the message that I'm challenging him to a duel ?
Go ahead and write it down .
Be pointed and brief .
It doesn't need to be witty as long as it's eloquent and imaginative .
Go on .
This precious little guy is putty in your hands , Sir Toby .
His letter's going to be hilarious .
But you're not going to deliver it , are you ?
Never trust me again if I don't .
And by all means see if you can get the young man to answer it .
I don't think a team of oxen could get them close enough to fight .
Here comes my little bird .
Listen , if you want a good laugh , and I mean a side-splitting one , then follow me .
He's wearing yellow stockings .
With crisscrossed laces ?
Oh , he looks like a pathetic Sunday school teacher .
He smiles so much his face has more lines in it than a map of the East Indies .
You've never seen anything like it .
I can hardly keep myself from throwing things at him .
I know that my lady's going to end up hitting him .
And when she does , he'll imagine she's flirting with him .
Come on , take us to him .
I couldn't stay behind after you left .
My friend Antonio , all I can say is thank you .
Anyway , what should we do ?
Should we go see the sights in the town ?
You probably killed a lot of his men ?
The whole quarrel might have been resolved since then when we repaid what we stole from them , which most of our city did , for the sake of friendly trade relations .
I was the only one who refused to give back what I stole .
Then don't make yourself too conspicuous .
You're right .
Hang on a minute , here's some money for you .
Maybe you'll see some little trinket you want to buy .
I'll hold on to your money and leave you for an hour .
We'll meet at the Elephant .
I remember .
I've sent for him .
He says he'll come .
It's easier to buy young people than to beg or borrow them .
Oh , I'm talking too loud. , Where's Malvolio ?
He's very serious , which is right for someone in mourning like me .
Where is Malvolio ?
He's coming , madam ; but he's acting very strangely .
He must be possessed by the devil .
Why , what's the matter with him ?
Is he talking nonsense ?
No , he just smiles .
You should have a guard nearby if he comes in here , because he's clearly disturbed .
Ask him in here .
I'm as crazy as he is , if sad craziness and happy craziness are equivalent .
What's going on , Malvolio ?
Hello , sweet lady .
Why , he has an income of three thousand ducats a year .
He's a fool and a spendthrift .
You shouldn't talk about him like that !
Anyone who says that is a lying piece of garbage .
Who said that ?
The same people who say he gets drunk with you every night .
We only drink toasts to my niece .
I'll drink to her as long as there's a hole in my throat and booze in Illyria .
Anyone who refuses to drink to my niece until his brain spins around like a merry-go-round is scum .
Sir Toby Belch !
How are you , Sir Toby Belch ?
Sweet Sir Andrew !
You're smiling ?
I sent for you about a sad occasion .
Sad , my lady !
I could be sad if I wanted to be .
These crisscrossing laces do cut off the circulation in my legs a bit , but who cares ?
As the sonnet says , "If you please one special person , you please everyone who matters." Why , what's going on ?
What's the matter with you ?
My legs may be yellow , but I don't feel blue .
It was addressed to him , and orders must be obeyed .
I think we know whose fancy handwriting that was .
Don't you think you should go to bed , Malvolio ?
To bed !
How are you feeling , Malvolio ?
You're asking me !
Noble people don't answer to peasants !
Why are you acting so brazen toward my lady ?
Don't be afraid of greatness." That was well written .
What do you mean by that , Malvolio ?
Some are born great , "
What ?
Some achieve greatness , " What are you saying ?
And some have greatness thrust upon them." Heaven help you !
Remember who liked your yellow stockings , " Your yellow stockings ?
And wanted to see you with laces crisscrossed over your legs." Crisscrossed ?
Go ahead .
Madam , Count Orsino's young messenger has returned .
I'll go to him .
Maria , take care of this poor fellow here .
Where's my cousin Toby ?
Have some of my servants take care of Malvolio .
I'd give half my dowry to keep anything bad from happening to him .
Oh ho !
Look at me now !
This is just what the letter said .
Get rid of your low-class trapping , " she said .
I've got her now , but I've got God to thank for it !
And when she left just now , she said "Take care of this poor fellow here." Fellow ! " Not "Malvolio , " not anything referring to my low station in life , but "fellow." Everything's going perfectly .
Nothing can come between me and the fulfillment of all my hopes .
Well , God is responsible for that , not me , and he deserves thanks .
I don't care if all the devils in hell crammed together to possess him , I still want to speak to him .
Here he is , here he is .
How are you , sir ?
Go away .
Let me enjoy my privacy .
Go away .
Ah-ha !
Does she ?
Do you even know what you're talking about ?
Sure thing , we'll do it tomorrow morning .
My lady would never want to lose him .
What are you saying , mistress ?
Oh , Lord !
Gentleness is the only way to go , gently , gently .
The devil inside him is rough , but we can't treat it roughly .
Sir !
Yes , dear little chick , come along with me. , Shut up , man !
You're serious enough to know not to play games with Satan .
Damn that dirty black coalminer of a devil !
Get him to say his prayers , Sir Toby , get him to pray .
My prayers , you hussy ?
Go hang yourselves , all of you !
You're all lazy and shallow .
I'm not like you .
You'll know more about it later .
Is it possible ?
If this were a play , I'd complain it was unrealistic .
He's really taken this prank to heart .
No , follow him now , before he divulges the prank and ruins everything .
Wow , we're really going to drive him crazy .
The house will be so much quieter .
Come on , let's put him in a dark room and tie him up .
My niece already thinks he's insane .
Here's more insanity for us .
Is it that aggressive ?
Yes , it is , I think .
Just read it .
Give it to me .
That's a good thing to put in , it keeps you from getting in trouble with the law .
Nice and short and full of good sense , or should I say nonsense ?
Good .
You still haven't said anything incriminating .
Good .
Andrew Aguecheek"
If this letter doesn't make him fight , I don't know what will .
I'll give it to him .
You might have a great opportunity to give it to him right now .
He's conducting some business with my lady , and sooner or later he'll leave .
Go , Sir Andrew .
Look out for him in the corner of the orchard as if you were a sheriff's deputy .
Now go !
Don't worry about me not swearing enough .
The fact that he serves as a go-between for his lord and my niece Olivia confirms this .
So this letter , which is so incredibly stupid and ignorant , isn't going to scare him at all .
He'll just think an idiot wrote it .
But I'll deliver Sir Andrew's challenge by word of mouth , describing Sir Andrew as courageous in battle and convincing the young gentleman that Sir Andrew is furious , impetuous , and a skilled fighter ( he'll believe me because he's young ) .
This will make them both so afraid that they'll kill each other just by looking at each other .
Here comes the messenger with your niece .
Leave them alone until he sets off home , and then follow him .
Meanwhile , I'll think of some horrible way to phrase the challenge .
My lord acts just as crazy with love as you do .
Here , take this piece of jewelry .
There's a picture of me inside .
Don't refuse it .
It won't annoy you like me , because it doesn't have a voice .
And I beg you , please come here again tomorrow .
What could you possibly ask of me that I wouldn't give you , as long as it didn't damage my honor and self-respect ?
Nothing , except your true love for my lord .
How could I honorably give him what I've already given you ?
I'll give it back to you .
Just come again tomorrow .
Good-bye .
A devil like you could lead me to hell .
Hello , sir .
Hello to you .
You'd better think up a way to defend yourself .
I don't know what you've done to upset him , but someone has challenged you to a duel .
Draw your sword and get on your toes , because your assailant is quick , skillful , and deadly .
There must be some mistake , sir .
I'm sure nobody would have any reason to fight with me .
I can't remember anything I've ever done to offend anyone .
You're wrong about that , I assure you .
But who is this person , sir ?
He's a knight .
He's killed three people , and he's so furious right now that the only thing that will satisfy him is seeing you die .
Fight to the death" is his motto .
Hello , sir .
Chat her up , Sir Andrew .
What ?
My dear Miss Chat-her-up , I look forward to getting to know you better .
My name is Mary , sir .
I was telling you to go after her , woo her , confront her .
Is that really what you meant ?
If you let her go this easily , Sir Andrew , you don't deserve to ever use your sword again .
If you leave like this , my dear , I won't ever use my sword again .
Do you think you've got a couple of fools on your hands here ?
I'm not holding your hand , sir .
I'll go back inside and ask the lady for some kind of escort .
I'm not a fighter .
I've heard of men who pick fights with other people on purpose , just to see how brave they are .
This man is probably like that .
No , sir .
He's furious because you insulted him , and he has a right to satisfaction .
So go out there and give him what he wants .
You can't go back into the house unless you want to fight with me , and if you're willing to do that , you might as well just go and fight with him .
This is as rude as it is strange .
Please , do me this one favor : find out what I've done to offend this knight .
It must be something I did accidentally .
I will do so .
Mr. Fabian , stay with this gentleman until I come back .
Excuse me , sir , do you know anything about this ?
What kind of man is he ?
He really is the most skillful , bloodthirsty , and dangerous opponent you can find in Illyria .
Do you want to go see him ?
I'll try to calm him down for you if I can .
I'd be very grateful to you if you did .
Wow , he's a real devil .
I've never seen such a monster .
I had a round with him , and his sword thrust is so deadly that you can't even duck out of the way .
And when he strikes back at you , he'll hit you as sure as you're standing there .
They say he used to fence for the shah of Persia .
That's it !
I won't mess with him .
Yes , but now there's no way to calm him down .
Fabian can hardly control him over there .
Darn it , if I'd guessed he was so brave and such a good swordsman , I never would have challenged him .
I'll give him my gray horse Capilet if he forgets the whole thing .
I'll give it a try .
Stay right here and try to look good .
This may end without anyone getting killed .
He's just as terrified of Sir Andrew .
He's pale and hyperventilating , as if a bear were chasing him .
Come on , Sir Andrew , there's nothing you can do about it .
The gentleman insists on fighting a round with you , for the sake of his honor .
The rules of dueling say he has to .
But as a gentleman and a soldier he's promised me he won't hurt you .
Come on , get ready .
I hope to God he keeps his promise !
I swear to you , I don't want to be doing this .
Put your sword away .
If this young gentleman has offended you , I'll take the blame for it .
If you've offended him , I'll fight you .
You , sir ?
Who are you ?
In fact , I'd do even more to him than what you've heard him promise to do .
If you're someone who gets into fights , I'll fight with you .
Oh , Sir Toby , stop !
The police are here .
I certainly will , sir .
And as for what I promised to you , I'm as good as my word .
You can ride him easily , and he responds well when you pull the reins .
This is the man .
Do your job .
Antonio , you're under arrest on the orders of Count Orsino .
You must be mistaking me for someone else , sir .
No , sir , not at all .
I recognize your face perfectly , even without a sailor's cap on your head. , Take him away .
He knows I recognize him .
I have to obey .
Don't worry about me .
Come on , sir , let's go .
What money , sir ?
Take this .
It's half of all my money .
Are you really going to pretend you don't know me now ?
I hate an ungrateful man more than I hate lying , vanity , babbling , drunkenness , or any other vice that we feeble human beings are susceptible to. , Oh , my God !
Come on , sir , please .
Let's go .
Let's go !
But oh , what a deceiver he turned out to be !
Only really cruel people can be called deformed .
Virtue is beauty , but someone beautiful and wicked is like an empty box decorated by the devil .
The man's going crazy .
Take him away .
Take me .
I don't believe it .
Yet I wish I could .
Oh , please be true , please let it be that this man has mistaken me for you , my dear brother !
Come here , Sir Andrew .
You too , Fabian .
We've got some words of wisdom to mull over .
He called me Sebastian .
with the same accessories .
Oh , if it turns out to be true that he survived , then that storm was kind , and the ocean was full of love !
He's a very dishonest , puny boy , and more cowardly than a rabbit .
He abandoned his friend here in an emergency , and even pretended he didn't know him .
As for his cowardliness , ask Fabian .
He's a coward , a total coward .
By God , I'll go after him again and beat him up .
I swear I will , Come on , let's go see what happens .
I'll bet anything you like that nothing will happen , once again .
Leave me alone .
Good for you , holding out on me like this !
No , I don't know you , and my lady didn't send me to get you , and I'm not supposed to tell you to come speak with her , and your name is not Master Cesario , and this is not my nose , either .
Nothing is what it is .
Oh please , go somewhere else to blab your nonsense .
You don't know me .
Blab my nonsense ?
He must've heard that phrase describing some great man and now he's using it on a jester .
Blab my nonsense !
What an idiotic place this world is .
Now please stop being so strange and tell me what exactly I should blab to my lady .
Should I blab to her that you're coming ?
Please , fool , go away .
Here's money for you .
Well , well .
Wise men who give fools money might get a good reputation , if they keep up regular payments for fourteen years .
Stop right now or I'll throw your dagger over the roof .
No , leave him alone .
I'll get back at him another way .
I'll sue him for assault and battery , if there's any justice in Illyria .
It doesn't matter that I hit him first .
No , sir , I won't let you go .
Come on , put your sword away , my little soldier .
You're awfully eager to fight .
Come on .
I'll get free of you .
What are you going to do now ?
If you insist on trying my patience any further , then take out your sword right now .
What ?
Because then I'd have to shed an ounce or two of your impudent blood .
Stop , Sir Toby !
I order you to stop !
Madam !
Are you always going to be like this ?
Get out of my sight ! , Dear Cesario , please don't be offended. , Get out of here , you barbarian !
You have to come with me .
Please don't say no .
Damn that Toby !
He made my heart leap for you .
Why , sweetheart ?
Your hand is Well , I hope so .
I'm not such an idiot that I can't keep my hands dry .
But I don't get it , what's the joke ?
Just a bit of my dry humor , sir .
Are you always so funny ?
But oops , when I let go of your hand , I let go of the biggest joke of all .
Sir , you need a drink .
When has anyone ever put you down like that .
Never .
Sometimes I think I'm no smarter than average .
If this is a dream , let me keep on sleeping !
Come with me , please .
I wish you'd do what I ask !
Madam , I will .
Oh , say it , and mean it !
No , I'm telling you , put on this robe and beard .
Make him think you're Sir Topas the priest .
Be quick .
Meanwhile , I'll get Sir Toby .
Here come the conspirators .
God bless you , Mr .
Priest .
Go to him , Sir Topas .
The fool's a good actor .
A good fool .
Sir Topas , Sir Topas , good Sir Topas , please go find my lady Olivia , Get out , demon !
Why are you bothering this poor man !
Can't you talk about anything besides ladies ?
You should be ashamed of yourself , Satan , you liar !
I'm being gentle with you , because I'm one of those good-hearted people who are polite to the devil himself .
You call this house dark ?
Dark as hell , Sir Topas .
But it has bay windows that are as transparent as stone walls , and the upper windows facing south-north are as clear as coal .
But you're still complaining of darkness and a bad view ?
I'm not insane , Sir Topas .
I'm telling you , this house is dark .
You're wrong , you madman .
There's no darkness except ignorance , and you're more ignorant than the Egyptians during the plague of fog .
I tell you , this house is as dark as ignorance .
I'm no more insane than you are , and I'll prove it .
Ask me any commonsense question .
What was the philosopher Pythagoras's belief about wild birds ?
That our grandmother's soul could end up inhabiting a bird .
What do you think of his belief ?
I respect the soul very much , so I disagree with his belief .
Well then , goodbye .
Stay in the dark .
I'll only admit that you're sane when you agree with Pythagoras and hesitate to kill a bird because it might contain your grandmother's soul .
Goodbye .
Sir Topas , Sir Topas !
The brilliant Sir Topas !
I can do anything !
You could've done this without your beard and gown .
He couldn't see you .
Now talk to him in your own voice , and tell me how he is .
I wish this trick would be over .
I'm in so much trouble with my niece that it wouldn't be safe to let this prank go to its conclusion .
Come to my room later on .
Fool !
Fool !
Fool , I say !
Good fool , good jester , I'll make it worth your while if you get me a candle , and a pen , ink and paper .
You have my word as a gentleman that I'll always be grateful to you .
Master Malvolio ?
Yes , good fool .
As sane as me ?
Then you really are insane , if you're no saner than a fool .
Sir Topas !
Fool , fool , hey , fool !
Please , sir , be quiet .
What do you want to say , sir ?
Be a nice fool and help me find a candle and some paper .
I tell you , I'm as sane as any man in Illyria .
If only you were , sir .
I swear I am .
Get me some ink , paper , and a candle .
You'll get a bigger reward than you ever got delivering a letter before .
I'll help you .
But tell me honestly , are you sure you're not insane ?
Or are you just pretending ?
Believe me , I'm not .
I'm telling the truth .
I'll never believe a madman until I can see his brains .
But I'll get you a candle and paper and ink .
Fool , I'll repay you for this favor .
Please , hurry .
This is the air , that's the glorious sun .
Where's Antonio , then ?
I didn't find him at the Elephant .
But he'd been there before me , and they told me he'd gone out looking for me .
I could really use his advice right now .
There's something going on that's not what it seems .
But here she comes .
I'll follow the priest and go with you ; and after I've sworn to be faithful , I'll be faithful forever .
Then lead the way , father .
If you're my friend , you'll let me see his letter .
Dear Mr. Fabian , do me another favor first .
Anything .
Don't ask to see this letter .
My friends , are you all Lady Olivia's servants ?
Yes , sir , we're part of her entourage .
I know you .
How are you , my friend ?
I'm better off because of my enemies , and worse off because of my friends .
You're better off because of your friends .
No , sir , worse off .
How can that be ?
By the way , I'm going home tomorrow , Sir Toby .
What does You'd have a great hairstyle if you had .
Why , would that have fixed my hair ?
Oh , no question , it won't style itself .
But my hair looks good anyway , doesn't it ?
It looks great .
It hangs like an old worn-out mop .
Listen , I'm going home tomorrow , Sir Toby .
That duke who lives nearby is courting her .
I've heard her say that .
So cheer up , there's still hope for you , man .
Well , my friends praise me and make me look like an idiot , while my enemies tell me straightforwardly that I am an idiot .
My enemies help me understand myself better , which is an advantage , and my friends help me lie about myself , which is a disadvantage .
So if four negatives make two affirmatives , I'm worse off because of my friends and better off because of my foes .
That's excellent .
Don't say that , unless you want to be one of my friends .
That's a nice hand you dealt me .
But if it's not double-dealing , sir , I wish you'd deal me another .
Oh , you're a naughty one , encouraging double-dealing .
Well , I'll commit the sin of double-dealing , and deal you a second coin .
Here it is .
And maybe a third ?
The three-beat rhythm is a good for dancing , and the church bells chime , one , two , three .
You can't get any more money out of me right now .
If you tell your lady I'm here to speak with her , and bring her out with you when you come back , you might make me more generous .
Well then , sing a lullaby to your generosity : it'll nap until I come back .
But don't think I'm doing this because I'm greedy .
I'll be back soon to wake up your generosity .
Here comes the man who rescued me , sir .
I remember his face well .
Though the last time I saw him it was black from the smoke of war .
He was the captain of a flimsy boat that was practically worthless because it was so small .
Orsino , this is the same Antonio who took the
But then he said strange things to me .
I don't know what else it could be .
But you're a famous pirate !
Orsino , sir , please don't call me those names .
I was never a thief or a pirate , though I admit I was your enemy for good reasons .
I rescued that ungrateful boy next to you from drowning .
He was a wreck , almost past hope .
I saved his life and gave him my love , without reservation .
How is that possible ?
Ah , the countess is coming !
An angel is walking on earth .
What can I give you that you want , my lord , except the one thing you can't have ?
Cesario , you missed your appointment with me .
Madam ?
Dearest Olivia , What do you have to say for yourself , Cesario ? , My lord , please , My lord wants to speak .
It's my duty to be quiet .
Are you still so cruel ?
I am still so faithful , my lord .
What , faithful to being mean and nasty ?
I breathed from my soul the most faithful offerings to your ungrateful altars that any devoted person has ever offered , what more am I supposed to do ?
You can do whatever you want as long as it's socially appropriate .
Come with me , boy .
And I would die a thousand deaths cheerfully , if it made your life easier .
Where's Cesario going ?
That's the truth .
Who tricked you ?
Who treated you badly ?
Have you completely forgotten ?
Has it been so long ?
Call the priest .
Go where , my lord ? , Cesario , my husband , stay here .
Husband ?
Yes , husband .
Can he deny it ?
Are you her husband , boy ?
No , my lord , not me .
But don't be afraid , Cesario .
Be the person you know you are , and you'll be as powerful as this person you fear .
Oh , hello , father !
Father , could I please ask you to tell these people what happened between me and this young man ?
My lord , I swear to you , Oh , don't swear !
Keep a little bit of honesty , even if you're afraid .
For the love of God , call a doctor !
Sir Toby needs help right away .
What's the matter ?
He cut my head and gave Sir Toby a bloody head , too .
For the love of God , help us !
I'd give forty pounds to be safe at home right now .
Who did this , Sir Andrew ?
The count's messenger , Cesario .
We thought he was a coward , but he fights like a devil .
My Cesario ?
Anything I did to you , I did it because Sir Toby made me .
Why are you talking like this ?
I never hurt you .
If a bloody head counts as a hurt , then you hurt me .
Apparently you think there's nothing unusual about a bloody head .
Here comes Sir Toby , limping .
He'll tell you more of the story .
If he hadn't been drunk , he would've really roughed you up .
Hello , sir !
How are you ?
It doesn't matter how I am : he hurt me , and that's that .
Oh , he's drunk , Sir Toby , for a whole hour now .
His eyes started glazing over around eight in the morning .
Then he's no good .
I hate no-good drunks .
Take him away !
Who did this to him ?
I'll help you , Sir Toby .
Will you help me ? , What an ass and a fool , a gullible no-good idiot !
Get him to bed and make sure his wounds are treated .
But please forgive me , darling , for the sake of the vows we made to each other so recently .
One face , one voice , one way of dressing , but two people !
Antonio , oh my dear Antonio !
I've been so tortured since I lost track of you !
Are you Sebastian ?
Do you have any doubts , Antonio ?
How did you divide yourself in two ?
These two people are as identical as two halves of an apple .
Which one is Sebastian ?
How unbelievable !
Sebastian was my father's name , and my brother was named Sebastian too .
I am a spirit , yes , since I have a soul .
If you were a woman , I'd hug you now and cry , and say "Welcome back , drowned Viola ! " My father had a mole on his forehead .
Mine did too .
He died on Viola's thirteenth birthday .
All right , I'll stay another month .
Ah , I'm an odd kind of guy .
Sometimes all I want to do is see plays and go out dancing .
Are you good at those kinds of things ?
Why do you hide these things ?
Why do you keep these talents behind a curtain ?
Are they likely to get dusty ?
Why don't you go off to church dancing one way , and come home dancing another way ?
I wouldn't even pee without dancing a waltz .
What are you thinking ?
Is this the kind of world where we hide our accomplishments ?
Look how shapely your legs are .
That's true .
Why not ?
Weren't we both born under Taurus ?
Oh , I remember that very clearly !
It's true , he died on the day my sister turned thirteen .
Give me your hand and let me see you dressed in woman's clothing .
The captain who brought me to shore has my women's clothes .
For some reason he's in prison now on some legal technicality , on Malvolio's orders .
He'll release him .
I was so crazy myself that I forgot all about him .
Well , he keeps the devil away as well as a man can in his situation .
He's written you a letter .
I would've given it to you this morning , but a madman's letters aren't Gospel , so it doesn't matter much if I'm a bit late .
Open it and read it .
There's a lot to learn when a fool recites the words of a madman .
Why are you talking like that ?
Are you insane ?
No , madam , I'm just reading an insane letter .
If you want things done in the right way , you'll have to let me read a crazy letter in a crazy voice .
No , please , read it like a sane person .
I will , my lady , but a sane person reading this would make it sound crazy .
So listen up , princess .
I swear to God , madam , you've wronged me , and I'll tell the whole world .
You've shut me up in a dark room and given your drunken cousin authority over me , but I'm as sane as you are .
I don't care what you think of me .
I'm going to forget my duties to you a little bit and complain about the injuries you've caused me .
Signed , The poorly treated Malvolio." Did he write this ?
Yes , madam .
Set him free .
Fabian , bring him here .
I accept that offer happily , madam .
Is this the madman ?
Yes , my lord .
How are you , Malvolio ?
Madam , you've treated me badly , very badly .
I did , Malvolio ?
No .
Tell me why you did it .
I'm sorry , Malvolio , but this isn't my writing , though I admit it looks like mine .
It's definitely Maria's handwriting .
Now that I think about it , Maria was the one who first told me you were insane .
I promise .
Well , you know , "some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon them." Anyway , I was part of the trick , sir .
He really was tricked horribly .
Go after him and try to calm him down a little .
He still hasn't told us about the captain .
Cesario , come here .
Taurus !
That governs the torso and heart , doesn't it ?
No , the legs and thighs .
Let me see you dance .
He's only known you for three days , but he's already treating you like a close friend .
No , not at all .
Thanks for telling me .
Here comes the Duke now .
Has anyone seen Cesario ?
Be loud and obnoxious .
I don't think so , my lord .
My boy , it's true .
Anyone who says you're a man must not notice how young you are .
I know you're the right person for this job .
I'll do my best to make this lady love you .
Give me too much of it , so I'll get sick of it and stop loving .
Oh , it sounded like a sweet breeze blowing gently over a bank of violets , taking their scent with it .
It doesn't sound as sweet as it did before .
Love is so vivid and fantastical that nothing compares to it .
Do you want to go hunting , my lord ?
Hunting what , Curio ?
Lady Olivia will have you executed for not showing up .
So let her execute me .
How do you know ?
Well , he'll be dead , so he won't see anything .
That's a lame answer .
Where , good Miss Mary ?
From soldiers .
Well , we all have our special gifts .
But still , she's going to kill you for being gone so long .
You've made up your mind , then ?
Well , go along now .
You'd be the funniest person in Illyria, if Sir Toby ever stopped drinking .
Shut up , you troublemaker , no more of that .
Here comes my lady .
Get that fool out of here .
Didn't you hear her , guys ?
Get the lady out of here .
Oh , go away , you're a boring fool .
I don't want to have anything to do with you anymore .
Besides , you've gotten unreliable .
If he can not , let the tailor mend him .
Anything that's mended is only patched up .
A good person who does something wrong is only patched up with sin .
If this logic works , that's great .
If not , what can you do about it ?
I told them to take Oh , what a big mistake !
Please let me prove you're a fool .
Can you do that ?
Easily , madam .
I'll have to ask you some questions , madam .
Please answer , my good little student .
I'm listening to you only because I've got nothing better to do .
My dear madam , why are you in mourning ?
My dear fool , because my brother died .
I think his soul's in hell , my lady .
I know his soul's in heaven , fool .
Then you're a fool for being sad that your brother's soul is in heaven .
Take away this fool , gentlemen .
What do you think of this fool , Malvolio ?
Isn't he getting funnier ?
Yes , and he'll keep getting funnier till he dies .
Old age always makes people act funny , even wise people , but fools more than anybody .
I hope you go senile soon , sir , so you can become a more foolish fool !
Sir Toby would bet a fortune that I'm not smart , but he wouldn't bet two cents that you're not a fool .
What do you say to that , Malvolio ?
I'm surprised you enjoy the company of this stupid troublemaker .
The other day I saw him defeated in a
I swear , anyone smart who laughs at these courts jesters is nothing but a jester's apprentice .
Malvolio , your vanity is damaging your good taste .
You speak so highly of fools !
Madam , there's a young gentleman at the gate who really wants to speak to you .
Was he sent by Count Orsino ?
I don't know , madam .
He's a good-looking young man , and there are a lot of people with him .
Who's talking to him now ?
Sir Toby , madam , your relative .
He talks nothing but nonsense .
If he's got a message from the count , tell him I'm sick , or not home .
Who's that at the gate , uncle ?
A gentleman .
A gentleman ?
What gentleman ?
There's some gentleman out there. , Good Sir Toby !
Nonsense .
I defy brain-death !
I told you , someone's at the gate .
Yes , but who is he ?
Let him be the devil if he wants to , I don't care .
God will protect me .
Tell me what a drunk is like , fool .
He's a fool , a madman , and a drowned man .
The first drink makes him a fool , the second makes him crazy , and the third drowns him .
Go take care of him .
Madam , that young man out there says he's got to speak to you .
I told him you were sick .
He claimed he knew that , and that's why he's come to speak with you .
I told him you were asleep .
He claimed to know that already too , and said that's the reason he's come to speak with you .
What can I say to him , lady ?
He's got an answer for everything .
Tell him he's not going to speak with me .
Just a man , like any other .
But what's he like ?
He insists he'll speak with you whether you want him to or not .
How old is he ?
Not old enough to be a man , but not young enough to be a boy .
He's somewhere between boy and man .
He's very handsome and speaks well , but he's very young .
He looks like he just recently stopped breastfeeding .
Show him in .
Call in my maid .
Maria , our lady wants you .
Give me my veil .
Come , put it over my face .
Which one of you is the lady of the house ?
You can speak to me .
I represent her .
What do you want ?
What stunning , exquisite , and unmatchable beauty , but please , tell me if you're the lady of the house , because I've never seen her .
I'd hate to waste my speech on the wrong person , because It's very well written and I spent a lot of time and energy memorizing it .
Beautiful ladies , please don't treat me badly .
I'm very sensitive , and even the smallest bit of rudeness hurts my feelings .
Where do you come from , sir ?
I'm sorry , but I memorized what I'm supposed to say here today , and that question isn't part of the speech I learned .
Please , my lady , just confirm that you're the lady of the house so I can get on with my speech .
Are you an actor ?
No , madam .
But I swear I'm not the person I'm playing .
Are you the lady of the house ?
I am , unless I somehow stole this role .
If you're the lady of the house , then it's true you're stealing your role , because what's yours to give away is not yours to keep for yourself .
But that's not part of what I'm supposed to say .
I'll go on with my speech praising you , and then I'll get to the point .
Get to the point now .
I'll let you get away with skipping the praise .
That's too bad , because I spent a long time memorizing it , and it's poetic .
That means it's more likely to be fake .
Please , keep it to yourself .
If you're just insane , then get out of here .
Ready to set sail , sir ?
The door's right here .
Tell me what you want .
Tell me what it's about .
It's about you .
I'm not bringing any declarations of war or demands for cash .
I'm coming in peace .
But you began so rudely .
Who are you ?
What do you want ?
What's going on ?
What have you heard from her ?
Take me to the garden .
Who I am and what I want are a secret .
Everyone , please leave us alone for a moment .
Most sweet lady , Oh , "sweet" !
Where's the passage of holy scripture that you're basing your sermon on ?
In Orsino's heart .
In his heart ?
In what chapter and verse of his heart ?
The table of contents says it's in the first chapter of his heart .
Oh , I've read that .
That's not holy , it's heresy .
Do you have anything else to say ?
Madam , please let me see your face .
Has your lord given you any orders to negotiate with my face ?
You're overstepping your bounds now .
But I'll open the curtain and let you see the picture .
Look , sir , this is a portrait of me as I am at this particular moment .
It's pretty well done , isn't it ?
Wind and rain can't wash it off .
Oh , I'd never be that cruel .
I'll write out a detailed inventory of my beauty and label every part .
But you'd still be gorgeous even if you were as proud as the devil .
My lord loves you .
How does he love me ?
Your lord knows what I think .
I can't love him .
I know he's noble , rich , young , and with a fine reputation .
People say he's generous , well educated , and brave , and he's very attractive .
But I just can't love him .
What would you do about it ?
From that cabin I'd call out to my soul .
I'd write sad songs about unrequited love and sing them loudly in the middle of the night .
Not bad ; you might accomplish something .
But I'm still fairly high-ranking .
I'm a gentleman .
Go back to your lord .
I can't love him .
Tell him not to send any more messengers , unless you feel like coming back to tell me how he took the bad news .
Goodbye .
Thanks for your trouble .
Here's some money for you .
I'm not a paid messenger , my lady .
Keep your money .
It's my master who's not getting the reward he deserves , not me .
Goodbye , you beautiful , cruel woman .
But I'm still fairly high-ranking .
Ah , no .
Calm down , calm down .
If only his lord were more like him .
How strange I'm feeling !
Can someone fall in love this quickly ?
Come here !
At your service , madam .
Run after that obnoxious messenger , the duke's servant .
He insisted on leaving this ring with me whether I wanted it or not .
Madam , I will .
I don't know what I'm doing .
Fate , do your work .
We human beings don't control our own destinies .
What is fated to happen must happen .
No , I'd rather you stayed here .
At least tell me where you're going .
Honestly , I can't .
I'm just wandering , with no particular destination .
But I know you'd never force me to tell you things I don't want to , so I should be polite and tell you what I can .
He left behind myself and my twin sister , who was born in the same hour as me .
If God had been willing , I wish we had died in the same hour too !
An hour before you pulled me out of the breaking waves , my sister drowned .
How tragic !
Although many people said she looked like me , she was considered beautiful .
She's been drowned in salty sea water , and now my salty tears are about to drown her memory all over again .
Oh , Antonio , I'm sorry I caused you so much trouble .
Please let me be your servant so I can be with you .
I like you very much .
I'm going to Count Orsino's court .
Goodbye .
I wish you all the best .
If I didn't have so many enemies in Orsino's court , I'd go join you there .
But who cares .
Excuse me , weren't you with Countess Olivia just now ?
Yes , sir .
I've only made it this far since I left her place , walking at a moderate pace .
She's sending this ring back to you , sir .
You should've saved me some trouble and taken it away yourself .
Here , take the ring .
She took that ring from me .
I won't take it back .
You threw it at her rudely , and she wants you to take it back .
I didn't give her any ring .
What's she trying to say ?
I hope she doesn't have a crush on me !
It's true she looked at me a lot , in fact , she looked at me so much that she seemed distracted , and couldn't really finish her sentences very well .
Oh , I really think she loves me !
creet .
I'm the man she wants .
If that's true , which it is , she might as well be in love with a dream , the poor lady .
Ah , how will this all turn out ?
What can possibly fix this situation ?
Oh , only time can sort out this mess .
I can't figure it out by myself !
Come on , Sir Andrew .
And the doctors say it's healthy to get up early , I don't know what the doctors say .
All I know is that staying up late is staying up late .
A false conclusion .
I hate your logic as much as I hate an empty drinking cup .
You're a smart guy .
So we should eat and drink .
Maria !
Bring us some wine !
Look , here comes the fool .
Hello , my friends !
What a pretty picture , three fools all together .
Hello , you idiot .
Sing us a song .
What country is this , friends ?
This is Illyria , lady .
And what am I supposed to do in Illyria ?
My brother is in heaven .
Or maybe there's a chance he didn't drown. , What do you think , sailors ?
It was a total fluke that you yourself were saved .
Oh , my poor brother !
But maybe by some fluke he was saved too .
It's possible , ma'am .
Don't give up yet .
I was born and raised less than three hours from here .
I swear , this fool has an excellent singing voice .
My girlfriend has beautiful white hands , and great warriors aren't Ha , ha !
Would you rather hear a love song or a song about the good life ?
A love song , a love song .
Yes , yes .
I'm not interested in being good .
That was excellent , really excellent .
Good , very good .
A beautiful voice , I swear .
His breath stinks .
Yes , it stinks very sweetly .
Should we sing a round to wake up the night owl ?
Should we do that ?
Let's go for it .
Absolutely .
Let's dance to "You Jerk." You mean , "Shut up , you jerk" ?
So I'll be forced to call you a jerk , Sir Andrew .
It starts , "Shut up." I'll never be able to start if I shut up .
That's true .
But come on , start .
You're making a terrible racket out here !
Lady Olivia told her servant Malvolio to kick you out of the house .
For God's sake , shut up !
Are you all crazy ?
What's wrong with you ?
Are you making all this noise at this time of night because you have no manners , or because you're just stupid ?
Don't you have any respect for anything ?
We respected the beat of the song , sir .
So shut up !
Sir Toby , I've got to be frank with you .
My lady told me to tell you that while she lets you stay at her house because you're a relative , she doesn't approve of your behavior .
If you can shape up , you're welcome to stay in the house .
If you can't , and would prefer to leave , she's very willing to say goodbye to you .
No , good Sir Toby .
That's out of tune , sir .
You lie .
They certainly will .
You're right .
Go and wiggle your ears !
I could challenge him to a duel and then not show up .
Do that .
I'll write a letter challenging him to a duel on your behalf .
Or I'll deliver your insults to his face .
Dear Sir Toby , don't do anything rash tonight .
Ever since the Duke's messenger visited Olivia , she's been upset .
As for Monsieur Malvolio , let me take care of him .
I know I can do it .
Oh , I'll beat him up for that !
I don't have any "brilliant" reason for it , but I have a good enough reason .
That's the weakness I'll use to get revenge on him .
What are you going to do ?
I can make my handwriting look just like Lady Olivia's : she
Excellent !
I like it too .
He'll think these letters are from Olivia and that she's in love with him .
Yes , that's the idea .
He's going to look like a total idiot .
Absolutely , you idiot .
This is going to be great !
It's going to be fun , I promise .
I know my medicine will work on him .
I'll have you two hide , and the fool too , right where he'll find the letter .
Watch his reaction .
Meanwhile , let's go to bed and dream about this .
Good night .
Good night , you amazing woman , you .
She's a fine woman , all right .
She's a good little woman , and she adores me .
What about it ?
Someone adored me once , too .
Let's go to bed , knight .
Tomorrow you need to get more money sent to you .
I know I will too , if it's the last thing I do .
It's too late to go to bed now .
Play me some music .
Sir , the person who should sing that song isn't here .
Who was it ?
He's somewhere else in the house .
You're absolutely right .
I'd bet my life that , as young as you are , you've fallen in love with someone .
Haven't you , boy ?
A little bit .
What kind of woman is she ?
She's a lot like you .
She's not good enough for you , then .
How old is she ?
About as old as you are , my lord .
That's definitely too old .
A woman should always pick an older man .
I think you're right , sir .
So find someone younger to love , or you won't be able to maintain your feelings .
Women are like roses : the moment their beauty is in full bloom , it's about to decay .
That's true .
It's too bad their beauty fades right when it reaches perfection !
Who's the ruler here ?
A duke who is noble in name and character .
What's his name ?
Orsino .
Orsino .
I've heard my father mention him .
When I first heard about him , he was still a bachelor .
But there was a rumor , you know , people always gossip about royalty , that he was in love with the beautiful Olivia .
Who's she ?
I wish I could work for that lady !
Are you ready , sir ?
No trouble , sir .
I like singing .
Then I'll pay you for doing what you like .
You may leave .
Goodbye .
All the rest of you can leave too .
Cesario , go visit that cruel Olivia one more time .
Tell her my love is purer than anything else in the whole world , and has nothing to do with her property .
But if she can't love you , sir ?
I refuse to accept that .
But you have to .
Just imagine some lady might exist who loves you as powerfully and agonizingly as you love Olivia .
Shouldn't she just accept that ?
No woman is strong enough to put up with the kind of intense passion I feel .
No woman's heart is big enough to hold all my love .
They eat too much and get indigestion and nausea .
It's as all-consuming and insatiable as the sea , and it can swallow as much as the sea can .
Don't compare a woman's love for a man with my love for Olivia .
Yes , but I know , What do you know ?
I know a lot about the love women can feel for men .
Actually , their hearts are as sensitive and loyal as ours are .
My father had a daughter who loved a man in the same way that I might love you , if I were a woman .
And what's her story ?
There was no story , my lord .
Doesn't that sound like true love ?
But did your sister die of love ?
I am the only daughter in my father's family , and all the brothers too , but I'm not completely sure about that .
Anyway , sir , should I go see the lady ?
Come along with us , Signor Fabian .
I'm coming , don't worry .
If I miss this , let me be boiled alive .
Won't you be glad to see that rascal dog humiliated ?
I'll be thrilled .
You know , he got me in trouble with the lady of the house once when I arranged a bear-baiting here .
We'll have another bear-baiting just to make him angry , and we'll mock him till he's black and blue .
Won't we , Sir Andrew ?
If we don't , it'll be the biggest disappointment of our lives .
Here comes the little villain herself .
How are you , my golden girl ?
Hide behind the boxwood hedge , all three of you .
Malvolio's coming down the path .
He's been over there practicing how to act for the past half hour .
This letter's going to turn him into a starry-eyed idiot .
Lie thou there ( throwing down a letter ) , for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling .
Maria once told me she did affect me , and I have heard herself come thus near , that , should she fancy , it should be one of my complexion .
Besides , she uses me with a more exalted respect than anyone else that follows her .
What should I think on 't ?
To be Count Malvolio !
The lady of the Strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe .
Seven of my people , with an obedient start , make out for him .
I frown the while , and perchance wind up watch , or play with my , some rich jewel .
Lips , do not move ; No man must know."
No man must know." What follows ?
No man must know." If this should be thee , Malvolio ?
I may command where I adore , But silence , like a Lucrece knife , With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore ; M.O.A.I .
doth sway my life." Nay , but first , let me see , let me see , let me see .
I may command where I adore." Why , she may command me .
Why , this is evident to any formal capacity .
There is no obstruction in this .
If I could make that resemble something in me , Softly !
There is a fair behavior in thee , captain , And though that nature with a beauteous wall Doth oft close in pollution , yet of thee I will believe thou hast a mind that suits With this thy fair and outward character .
I prithee , and I'll pay thee bounteously , Conceal me what I am , and be my aid For such disguise as haply shall become The form of my intent .
I'll serve this duke .
Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him .
It may be worth thy pains , for I can sing And speak to him in many sorts of music That will allow me very worth his service .
Be you his eunuch , and your mute I'll be .
When my tongue blabs , then let mine eyes not see .
I thank thee .
Lead me on .
M" , Malvolio .
M" , why , that begins my name .
M.O.A.I." This simulation is not as the former , and yet to crush this a little , it would bow to me , for every one of these letters are in my name .
Soft , here follows prose .
If this fall into thy hand , revolve .
In my stars I am above thee , but be not afraid of greatness .
Some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon 'em .
Thy Fates open their hands .
Let thy blood and spirit embrace them .
And , to inure thyself to what thou art like to be , cast thy humble slough and appear fresh .
I say , remember .
Farewell .
She that would alter services with thee , The Fortunate Unhappy" Daylight and champaign discovers not more .
This is open .
I will be proud , I will read politic authors , I will baffle Sir Toby , I will wash off gross acquaintance , I will be point- devise the very man .
I do not now fool myself , to let imagination jade me , for every reason excites to this , that my lady loves me .
She did commend my yellow stockings of late , she did praise my leg being cross-gartered , and in this she manifests herself to my love , and with a kind of injunction , drives me to these habits of her liking .
I thank my stars I am happy .
I will be strange , stout , in yellow stockings , and cross-gartered , even with the swiftness of putting on .
Jove and my stars be praised !
Here is yet a postscript .
Thou canst not choose but know who I am .
If thou entertainest my love , let it appear in thy smiling .
Thy smiles become thee well .
Therefore in my presence still smile , dear my sweet , I prithee."
Jove , I thank thee !
I will do everything that thou wilt have me .
I will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be paid from the Sophy .
I could marry this wench for this device .
So could I too .
And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest .
Nor I neither .
Here comes my noble gull-catcher .
Wilt thou set thy foot o ' my neck ?
Or o ' mine either ?
Shall I play my freedom at tray-trip , and become thy bondslave ?
I ' faith , or I either ?
Why , thou hast put him in such a dream that when the image of it leaves him he must run mad .
Nay , but say true , does it work upon him ?
Like aqua vitae with a midwife .
If you will see it , follow me .
To the gates of Tartar , thou most excellent devil of wit !
I'll make one too .
Save thee , friend , and thy music .
Dost thou live by thy tabour ?
No , sir , I live by the church .
Art thou a churchman ?
So thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a beggar dwell near him , or the church stands by thy tabor , if thy tabor stand by the church .
You have said , sir .
How quickly the wrong side may be turned outward !
Nay , that's certain .
I would therefore my sister had no name , sir .
Why , man ?
Why , sir , her name's a word , and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton .
Thy reason , man ?
Troth , sir , I can yield you none without words , and words are grown so false , I am loath to prove reason with them .
I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing .
Not so , sir , I do care for something .
But in my conscience , sir , I do not care for you .
If that be to care for nothing , sir , I would it would make you invisible .
Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool ?
No , indeed , sir ; the Lady Olivia has no folly .
I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's .
It shines everywhere .
I would be sorry , sir , but the fool should be as oft with your master as with my mistress : I think I saw your wisdom there .
Hold , there's expenses for thee .
Now Jove , in his next commodity of hair , send thee a beard !
to fool ) Is thy lady within ?
Yes , being kept together and put to use .
My lady is within , sir .
I will construe to them whence you come .
Who you are and what you would are out of my welkin , I might say "element , " but the word is overworn .
This fellow is wise enough to play the fool , And to do that well craves a kind of wit .
This is a practise As full of labor as a wise man's art , For folly that he wisely shows is fit .
Save you , gentleman .
And you , sir .
I am bound to your niece , sir .
I mean , she is the list of my voyage .
Taste your legs , sir .
Put them to motion .
I mean , to go , sir , to enter .
I will answer you with gait and entrance .
But we are prevented .
Most excellent accomplished lady , the heavens rain odors on you !
My matter hath no voice , lady , but to your own most pregnant and vouchsafed ear .
em all three all ready .
Let the garden door be shut , and leave me to my hearing .
Give me your hand , sir .
My duty , madam , and most humble service .
What is your name ?
Cesario is your servant's name , fair princess .
My servant , sir !
Twas never merry world Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment .
For him , I think not on him .
For his thoughts , Would they were blanks , rather than fill'd with me .
Madam , I come to whet your gentle thoughts On his behalf .
O , by your leave , I pray you , I bade you never speak again of him .
Dear lady , Give me leave , beseech you .
I did send , After the last enchantment you did here , A ring in chase of you .
What might you think ?
What a plague means my niece , to take the death of her brother thus ?
By my troth , Sir Toby , you must come in earlier o ' nights .
Your cousin , my lady , takes great exceptions to your ill hours .
Why , let her except , before excepted .
I'll confine myself no finer than I am .
These clothes are good enough to drink in , and so be these boots too .
An they be not , let them hang themselves in their own straps .
Who , Sir Andrew Aguecheek ?
Ay , he .
He's as tall a man as any 's in Illyria .
Have you not set mine honor at the stake , And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts That tyrannous heart can think ?
To one of your receiving Enough is shown .
So , let me hear you speak .
I pity you .
That's a degree to love .
No , not a grize .
If one should be a prey , how much the better To fall before the lion than the wolf !
There lies your way , due west .
Stay , I prithee , tell me what thou thinkest of me .
That you do think you are not what you are .
If I think so , I think the same of you .
I would you were as I would have you be !
Would it be better , madam , than I am ?
I wish it might , for now I am your fool .
And so adieu , good madam .
No , faith , I'll not stay a jot longer .
Thy reason , dear venom , give thy reason .
You must needs yield your reason , Sir Andrew .
Marry , I saw your niece do more favors to the Count's servingman than ever she bestowed upon me .
I saw 't i ' the orchard .
Did she see thee the while , old boy ?
Tell me that .
As plain as I see you now .
This was a great argument of love in her toward you .
Slight , will you make an ass o ' me ?
I will prove it legitimate , sir , upon the oaths of judgment and reason .
And they have been grand-jurymen since before Noah was a sailor .
She did show favor to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you , to awake your dormouse valor , to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver .
You should then have accosted her , and with some excellent jests , fire-new from the mint , you should have banged the youth into dumbness .
This was looked for at your hand , and this was balked .
An 't be any way , it must be with valor , for policy I hate .
I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician .
Why , then , build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valor .
Challenge me the count's youth to fight with him .
Hurt him in eleven places .
My niece shall take note of it , and assure thyself , there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in man's commendation with woman than report of valor .
There is no way but this , Sir Andrew .
Will either of you bear me a challenge to him ?
Go , write it in a martial hand .
Be curst and brief .
It is no matter how witty , so it be eloquent and full of invention .
Go .
This is a dear manikin to you , Sir Toby .
I have been dear to him , lad , some two thousand strong , or so .
We shall have a rare letter from him : but you'll not deliver 't ?
Never trust me , then .
And by all means stir on the youth to an answer .
I think oxen and wainropes can not hale them together .
Look where the youngest wren of nine comes .
If you desire the spleen , and will laugh yourself into stitches , follow me .
He's in yellow stockings .
And cross-gartered ?
Most villanously , like a pedant that keeps a school i ' the church .
He does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies .
You have not seen such a thing as 'tis .
I can hardly forbear hurling things at him .
I know my lady will strike him .
If she do , he'll smile and take 't for a great favor .
Come , bring us , bring us where he is .
I could not stay behind you .
My kind Antonio , I can no other answer make but thanks , And thanks , and ever thanks .
What's to do ?
Shall we go see the relics of this town ?
Belike you slew great number of his people ?
It might have since been answered in repaying What we took from them , which , for traffic's sake , Most of our city did .
Only myself stood out ; For which , if I be lapsed in this place , I shall pay dear .
Do not then walk too open .
It doth not fit me .
Hold , sir , here's my purse .
Haply your eye shall light upon some toy You have desire to purchase , and your store , I think , is not for idle markets , sir .
I'll be your purse-bearer and leave you For an hour .
To the Elephant .
I do remember .
I have sent after him .
He says he'll come .
For youth is bought more oft than begged or borrow'd .
I speak too loud. , Where's Malvolio ?
He is sad and civil And suits well for a servant with my fortunes .
Where is Malvolio ?
He's coming , madam ; but in very strange manner .
He is sure possessed , madam .
Why , what's the matter ?
Does he rave ?
No , madam , he does nothing but smile .
Your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come , for sure the man is tainted in 's wits .
Go call him hither .
I am as mad as he , If sad and merry madness equal be .
How now , Malvolio ?
Sweet lady , ho , ho .
Why , he has three thousand ducats a year .
He's a very fool and a prodigal .
Fie , that you'll say so !
By this hand , they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him .
Who are they ?
They that add , moreover , he's drunk nightly in your company .
With drinking healths to my niece .
I'll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria .
He's a coward and a coistrel that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o ' th ' toe like a parish top .
Sir Toby Belch !
How now , Sir Toby Belch !
Sweet Sir Andrew !
Smilest thou ?
I sent for thee upon a sad occasion .
Sad , lady !
I could be sad .
This does make some obstruction in the blood , this cross-gartering , but what of that ?
If it please the eye of one , it is with me as the very true sonnet is , "Please one , and please all." Why , how dost thou , man ?
What is the matter with thee ?
Not black in my mind , though yellow in my legs .
It did come to his hands , and commands shall be executed .
I think we do know the sweet Roman hand .
Wilt thou go to bed , Malvolio ?
To bed ?
How do you , Malvolio ?
At your request !
Yes , nightingales answer daws !
Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady ?
Be not afraid of greatness." 'T was well writ .
What meanest thou by that , Malvolio ?
Some are born great , "
Ha ?
Some achieve greatness , " What sayest thou ?
And some have greatness thrust upon them." Heaven restore thee !
Remember who commended thy yellow stockings , " Thy yellow stockings ?
And wished to see thee cross-gartered." Cross-gartered ?
Go to , thou art made , if thou desirest to be so , " Am I made ?
Madam , the young gentleman of the Count Orsino's is returned .
I'll come to him .
Good Maria , let this fellow be looked to .
Where's my cousin Toby ?
Let some of my people have a special care of him .
I would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry .
Oh , ho !
Do you come near me now ?
This concurs directly with the letter .
Cast thy humble slough , " says she .
I have limed her , but it is Jove's doing , and Jove make me thankful !
And when she went away now , "Let this fellow be looked to." "Fellow ! " Not "Malvolio , " nor after my degree , but "fellow." Why , everything adheres together , that no dram of a scruple , no scruple of a scruple , no obstacle , no incredulous or unsafe circumstance , what can be said ?
Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes .
Well , Jove , not I , is the doer of this , and he is to be thanked .
If all the devils of hell be drawn in little , and Legion himself possessed him , yet I'll speak to him .
Here he is , here he is .
How is't with you , sir ?
Go off , I discard you .
Let me enjoy my private .
Go off .
Aha !
Does she so ?
Do you know what you say ?
Marry , and it shall be done tomorrow morning if I live .
My lady would not lose him for more than I'll say .
How now , mistress ?
O Lord !
No way but gentleness , gently , gently .
The fiend is rough and will not be roughly used .
Sir !
Ay , Biddy , come with me. , What , man !
Tis not for gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan .
Hang him , foul collier !
Get him to say his prayers , good Sir Toby , get him to pray .
My prayers , minx ?
Go , hang yourselves all !
You are idle , shallow things .
I am not of your element .
You shall know more hereafter .
Is 't possible ?
If this were played upon a stage now , I could condemn it as an improbable fiction .
His very genius hath taken the infection of the device , man .
Nay , pursue him now , lest the device take air and taint .
Why , we shall make him mad indeed .
The house will be the quieter .
Come , we'll have him in a dark room and bound .
My niece is already in the belief that he's mad .
More matter for a May morning .
Is 't so saucy ?
Ay , is 't , I warrant him .
Do but read .
Give me .
A good note , that keeps you from the blow of the law .
Very brief , and to exceeding good sense , less .
Good .
Still you keep o ' the windy side of the law .
Good .
Andrew Aguecheek"
If this letter move him not , his legs can not .
I'll give 't him .
You may have very fit occasion for 't .
He is now in some commerce with my lady and will by and by depart .
Go , Sir Andrew .
Scout me for him at the corner the orchard like a bum-baily .
Away !
Nay , let me alone for swearing .
His employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less .
Therefore this letter , being so excellently ignorant , will breed no terror in the youth .
He will find it comes from a clodpole .
But , sir , I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth , set upon Aguecheek a notable report of valor , and drive the gentleman ( as I know his youth will aptly receive it ) into a most hideous opinion of his rage , skill , fury , and impetuosity .
This will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look , like cockatrices .
Here he comes with your niece .
Give them way till he take leave , and presently after him .
I will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge .
With the same 'havior that your passion bears Goes on my master's grief .
Here , wear this jewel for me .
Tis my picture .
Refuse it not .
It hath no tongue to vex you .
And I beseech you come again tomorrow .
What shall you ask of me that I'll deny , That honor , saved , may upon asking give ?
Nothing but this : your true love for my master .
How with mine honor may I give him that Which I have given to you ?
I will acquit you .
Well , come again tomorrow .
Fare thee well .
A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell .
Gentleman , God save thee .
And you , sir .
That defense thou hast , betake thee to 't .
Of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him , I know not , but thy intercepter , full of despite , bloody as the hunter , attends thee at the orchard end .
Dismount thy tuck , be yare in thy preparation , for thy assailant is quick , skillful and deadly .
You mistake , sir .
I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me .
My remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offense done to any man .
You'll find it otherwise , I assure you .
I pray you , sir , what is he ?
He is knight , dubbed with unhatched rapier and on carpet consideration , but he is a devil in private brawl .
Souls and bodies hath he divorced three , and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre .
Hob , nob , is his word .
And you too , sir .
Accost , Sir Andrew , accost .
What's that ?
Good Mistress Accost , I desire better acquaintance .
My name is Mary , sir .
By my troth , I would not undertake her in this company .
Is that the meaning of "accost" ?
An thou let part so , Sir Andrew , would thou mightst never draw sword again .
An you part so , mistress , I would I might never draw sword again .
Fair lady , do you think you have fools in hand ?
Sir , I have not you by the hand .
I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady .
I am no fighter .
I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others , to taste their valor .
Belike this is a man of that quirk .
Sir , no .
His indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury .
Therefore get you on and give him his desire .
Back you shall not to the house , unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him .
This is as uncivil as strange .
I beseech you , do me this courteous office , as to know of the knight what my offense to him is .
It is something of my negligence , nothing of my purpose .
I will do so .
Signior Fabian , stay you by this gentleman till my return .
Pray you , sir , do you know of this matter ?
I beseech you , what manner of man is he ?
He is , indeed , sir , the most skillful , bloody , and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of Illyria .
Will you walk towards him ?
I will make your peace with him if I can .
I shall be much bound to you for 't .
Why , man , he's a very devil .
I have not seen such a firago .
I had a pass with him , rapier , scabbard , and all , and he gives me the stuck-in with such a mortal motion , that it is inevitable .
And on the answer , he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on .
They say he has been fencer to the Sophy .
Pox on 't !
I'll not meddle with him .
Ay , but he will not now be pacified .
Fabian can scarce hold him yonder .
Plague on 't , an I thought he had been valiant and so cunning in fence , I'd have seen him damned ere I'd have challenged him .
Let him let the matter slip , and I'll give him my horse , gray Capilet .
I'll make the motion .
Stand here , make a good show on 't .
This shall end without the perdition of souls .
I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you .
He is as horribly conceited of him , and pants and looks pale , as if a bear were at his heels .
Come , Sir Andrew , there's no remedy .
The gentleman will , for his honor's sake , have one bout with you .
He can not by the duello avoid it .
But he has promised me , as he is a gentleman and a soldier , he will not hurt you .
Come on , to 't .
Pray God , he keep his oath !
I do assure you , 'tis against my will .
Put up your sword .
If this young gentleman Have done offence , I take the fault on me .
If you offend him , I for him defy you .
You , sir ?
Why , what are you ?
One , sir , that for his love dares yet do more Than you have heard him brag to you he will .
Nay , if you be an undertaker , I am for you .
O good Sir Toby , hold !
Here come the officers .
Marry , will I , sir .
And for that I promised you , I'll be as good as my word .
He will bear you easily and reins well .
This is the man .
Do thy office .
Antonio , I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino .
You do mistake me , sir .
No , sir , no jot .
I know your favor well , Though now you have no sea-cap on your head. , Take him away .
He knows I know him well .
I must obey .
You stand amazed , But be of comfort .
Come , sir , away .
What money , sir ?
I'll make division of my present with you .
Hold , there's half my coffer .
Will you deny me now ?
I hate ingratitude more in a man Than lying , vainness , babbling , drunkenness , Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption Inhabits our frail blood , O heavens themselves !
Come , sir , I pray you , go .
Let me speak a little .
Away !
But oh , how vile an idol proves this god !
None can be called deformed but the unkind .
Virtue is beauty , but the beauteous evil Are empty trunks o'erflourished by the devil .
The man grows mad .
Away with him .
Lead me on .
Methinks his words do from such passion fly , That he believes himself .
So do not I .
Prove true , imagination , oh , prove true , That I , dear brother , be now ta'en for you !
Come hither , knight .
Come hither , Fabian .
We'll whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws .
He named Sebastian .
Still in this fashion , color , ornament , For him I imitate .
Oh , if it prove , Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love !
A very dishonest paltry boy , and more a coward than a hare .
His dishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in necessity and denying him .
And for his cowardship , ask Fabian .
A coward , a most devout coward , religious in it .
Slid , I'll after him again and beat him .
An I do not , Come , let's see the event .
I dare lay any money 'twill be nothing yet .
Let me be clear of thee .
Well held out , i ' faith .
No , I do not know you , nor I am not sent to you by my lady , to bid you come speak with her , nor your name is not Master Cesario , nor this is not my nose neither .
Nothing that is so is so .
I prithee , vent thy folly somewhere else .
Thou know'st not me .
Vent my folly ?
He has heard that word of some great man and now applies it to a fool .
Vent my folly !
I am afraid this great lubber , the world , will prove a cockney .
I prithee now , ungird thy strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my lady .
Shall I vent to her that thou art coming ?
I prithee , foolish Greek , depart from me .
There's money for thee .
By my troth , thou hast an open hand .
These wise men that give fools money get themselves a good report , after fourteen years ' purchase .
Hold , sir , or I'll throw your dagger o'er the house .
Nay , let him alone .
I'll go another way to work with him .
I'll have an action of battery against him if there be any law in Illyria .
Though I struck him first , yet it's no matter for that .
Come , sir , I will not let you go .
Come , my young soldier , put up your iron .
You are well fleshed .
Come on .
I will be free from thee .
What wouldst thou now ?
If thou darest tempt me further , draw thy sword .
What , what ?
Nay , then I must have an ounce or two of this malapert blood from you .
Hold , Toby !
On thy life I charge thee , hold !
Madam !
Will it be ever thus ?
Out of my sight ! , Be not offended , dear Cesario. , Rudesby , be gone !
Thou shalt not choose but go .
Do not deny .
Beshrew his soul for me !
He started one poor heart of mine in thee .
Wherefore , sweetheart ?
Why , I think so .
I am not such an ass , but I can keep my hand dry .
But what's your jest ?
A dry jest , sir .
Are you full of them ?
Marry , now I let go your hand , I am barren .
O knight , thou lackest a cup of canary .
When did I see thee so put down ?
Never in your life , I think , unless you see canary put me down .
Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has .
If it be thus to dream , still let me sleep !
Nay , come , I prithee .
Would thou'dst be ruled by me !
Madam , I will .
Oh , say so , and so be !
Nay , I prithee , put on this gown and this beard .
Make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate .
Do it quickly .
I'll call Sir Toby the whilst .
The competitors enter .
Jove bless thee , master Parson .
Bonos dies , Sir Toby .
To him , Sir Topas .
The knave counterfeits well .
A good knave .
Sir Topas , Sir Topas , good Sir Topas , go to my lady , Out , hyperbolical fiend !
How vexest thou this man !
Talkest thou nothing but of ladies ?
Fie , thou dishonest Satan !
I call thee by the most modest terms , for I am one of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself with courtesy .
Sayest thou that house is dark ?
As hell , Sir Topas .
Why , it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes , and the clerestories toward the south-north are as lustrous as ebony .
And yet complainest thou of obstruction ?
I am not mad , Sir Topas .
I say to you this house is dark .
Madman , thou errest .
I say , there is no darkness but ignorance , in which thou art more puzzled than the Egyptians in their fog .
I say , this house is as dark as ignorance , though ignorance were as dark as hell .
I am no more mad than you are .
Make the trial of it in any constant question .
What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wildfowl ?
That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird .
What thinkest thou of his opinion ?
I think nobly of the soul , and no way approve his opinion .
Fare thee well .
Remain thou still in darkness .
Thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will allow of thy wits , and fear to kill a woodcock lest thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam .
Fare thee well .
Sir Topas , Sir Topas !
My most exquisite Sir Topas !
Nay , I am for all waters .
Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown .
He sees thee not .
To him in thine own voice , and bring me word how thou findest him .
I would we were well rid of this knavery .
If he may be conveniently delivered , I would he were , for I am now so far in offense with my niece that I can not pursue with any safety this sport to the upshot .
Come by and by to my chamber .
Fool !
Fool !
Fool , I say !
Good fool , as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand , help me to a candle , and pen , ink , and paper .
As I am a gentleman , I will live to be thankful to thee for 't .
Master Malvolio ?
Ay , good fool .
But as well ?
Then you are mad indeed , if you be no better in your wits than a fool .
Sir Topas !
Fool , fool , fool , I say !
Alas , sir , be patient .
What say you sir ?
Good fool , help me to some light and some paper .
I tell thee , I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria .
Well-a-day that you were , sir .
By this hand , I am .
Good fool , some ink , paper , and light , and convey what I will set down to my lady .
It shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did .
I will help you to 't .
But tell me true , are you not mad indeed ?
Or do you but counterfeit ?
Believe me , I am not .
I tell thee true .
Nay , I'll ne'er believe a madman till I see his brains .
I will fetch you light , and paper , and ink .
Fool , I'll requite it in the highest degree .
I prithee , be gone .
This is the air , that is the glorious sun .
Where's Antonio , then ?
I could not find him at the Elephant .
Yet there he was , and there I found this credit , That he did range the town to seek me out .
His counsel now might do me golden service .
There's something in 't That is deceivable .
But here the lady comes .
I'll follow this good man , and go with you ; And , having sworn truth , ever will be true .
Then lead the way , good father ; and heavens so shine That they may fairly note this act of mine .
Now , as thou lovest me , let me see his letter .
Good Master Fabian , grant me another request .
Anything .
Do not desire to see this letter .
Belong you to the Lady Olivia , friends ?
Ay , sir , we are some of her trappings .
I know thee well .
How dost thou , my good fellow ?
Truly , sir , the better for my foes and the worse for my friends .
The better for thy friends .
No , sir , the worse .
How can that be ?
I'll ride home tomorrow , Sir Toby .
Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair .
Why , would that have mended my hair ?
Past question , for thou seest it will not curl by nature .
But it becomes me well enough , does 't not ?
Excellent .
It hangs like flax on a distaff .
Faith , I'll home tomorrow , Sir Toby .
The count himself here hard by woos her .
I have heard her swear 't .
Tut , there's life in 't , man .
Marry , sir , they praise me and make an ass of me , now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass .
So that by my foes , sir I profit in the knowledge of myself , and by my friends , I am abused .
So that , conclusions to be as kisses , if your four negatives make your two affirmatives , why then the worse for my friends and the better for my foes .
Why , this is excellent .
By my troth , sir , no , though it please you to be one of my friends .
Thou shalt not be the worse for me : there's gold .
But that it would be double-dealing , sir , I would you could make it another .
O , you give me ill counsel .
Well , I will be so much a sinner , to be a double-dealer .
There's another .
Primo , secundo , tertio is a good play , and the old saying is , the third pays for all .
The triplex , sir , is a good tripping measure , or the bells of Saint Bennet , sir , may put you in mind , one , two , three .
You can fool no more money out of me at this throw .
If you will let your lady know I am here to speak with her , and bring her along with you , it may awake my bounty further .
Marry , sir , lullaby to your bounty till I come again .
I go , sir , but I would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness .
But , as you say , sir , let your bounty take a nap , I will awake it anon .
Here comes the man , sir , that did rescue me .
That face of his I do remember well .
Yet , when I saw it last , it was besmeared As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war .
A baubling vessel was he captain of , For shallow draught and bulk unprizable , With which such scathful grapple did he make With the most noble bottom of our fleet , That very envy and the tongue of loss Cried fame and honor on him. , What's the matter ?
Orsino , this is that Antonio That took the And this is he that did the When your young nephew Titus lost his leg .
He did me kindness , sir , drew on my side , But in conclusion put strange speech upon me .
I know not what 'twas but distraction .
Notable pirate !
Orsino , noble sir , Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me .
Antonio never yet was thief or pirate , Though , I confess , on base and ground enough , Orsino's enemy .
That most ingrateful boy there by your side From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth Did I redeem .
A wreck past hope he was .
His life I gave him and did thereto add My love , without retention or restraint , All his in dedication .
How can this be ?
Here comes the Countess .
Now heaven walks on earth .
What would my lord , but that he may not have , Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable ?
Cesario , you do not keep promise with me .
Madam ?
Gracious Olivia , What do you say , Cesario ? , Good my lord , My lord would speak .
My duty hushes me .
Still so cruel ?
Still so constant , lord .
What , to perverseness ?
You , uncivil lady , To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars My soul the faithfull'st off'rings have breathed out That e'er devotion tendered , what shall I do ?
Even what it please my lord that shall become him .
Come , boy , with me .
And I , most jocund , apt , and willingly , To do you rest , a thousand deaths would die .
Where goes Cesario ?
Ay me , detested !
Who does beguile you ?
Who does do you wrong ?
Hast thou forgot thyself ?
Is it so long ? , Call forth the holy father .
Come , away !
Whither , my lord ? , Cesario , husband , stay .
Husband ?
Ay , husband .
Can he that deny ?
Her husband , sirrah ?
No , my lord , not I. Alas , it is the baseness of thy fear That makes thee strangle thy propriety .
Fear not , Cesario .
Be that thou know'st thou art , and then thou art As great as that thou fear'st .
O , welcome , father !
Father , I charge thee , by thy reverence , Here to unfold ( though lately we intended To keep in darkness what occasion now Reveals before 'tis ripe ) what thou dost know Hath newly passed between this youth and me .
My lord , I do protest , O , do not swear !
Hold little faith , though thou hast too much fear .
For the love of God , a surgeon !
Send one presently to Sir Toby .
What's the matter ?
He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too .
For the love of God , your help !
I had rather than forty pound I were at home .
Who has done this , Sir Andrew ?
The Count's gentleman , one Cesario .
We took him for a coward , but he's the very devil incardinate .
My gentleman , Cesario ?
Od's lifelings , here he is ! , You broke my head for nothing , and that that I did , I was set on to do 't by Sir Toby .
Why do you speak to me ?
I never hurt you .
If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt , you have hurt me .
I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb .
Here comes Sir Toby halting .
You shall hear more .
But if he had not been in drink , he would have tickled you othergates than he did .
How now , gentleman ?
How is 't with you ?
That's all one : has hurt me , and there's the end on 't .
FOOL Oh , he's drunk , Sir Toby , an hour agone .
His eyes were set at eight i ' the morning .
Then he's a rogue , and a passy-measures pavin .
I hate a drunken rogue .
Away with him !
Who hath made this havoc with them ?
I'll help you , Sir Toby , because we'll be dressed together .
Will you help ? , An ass-head , and a coxcomb , and a knave , a thin-faced knave , a gull !
Get him to bed , and let his hurt be looked to .
Pardon me , sweet one , even for the vows We made each other but so late ago .
One face , one voice , one habit , and two persons !
Antonio , O my dear Antonio !
How have the hours racked and tortured me Since I have lost thee !
Sebastian are you ?
Fear'st thou that , Antonio ?
How have you made division of yourself ?
An apple , cleft in two , is not more twin Than these two creatures .
Which is Sebastian ?
Most wonderful !
Sebastian was my father ; Such a Sebastian was my brother too , So went he suited to his watery tomb .
A spirit I am indeed , But am in that dimension grossly clad Which from the womb I did participate .
Were you a woman , as the rest goes even , I should my tears let fall upon your cheek And say "Thrice-welcome , drowned Viola ! " My father had a mole upon his brow .
And so had mine .
And died that day when Viola from her birth Had numbered thirteen years .
I'll stay a month longer .
I am a fellow o ' th ' strangest mind i ' th ' world .
I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether .
Art thou good at these kickshawses , knight ?
Wherefore are these things hid ?
Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before 'em ?
Are they like to take dust , like Mistress Mall's picture ?
Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in a coranto ?
I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace .
What dost thou mean ?
Is it a world to hide virtues in ?
I did think , by the excellent constitution of thy leg , it was formed under the star of a galliard .
Ay , 'tis strong , and it does indifferent well in a dun-colored stock .
What shall we do else ?
Were we not born under Taurus ?
Oh , that record is lively in my soul !
He finished indeed his mortal act That day that made my sister thirteen years .
Give me thy hand , And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds .
The captain that did bring me first on shore Hath my maid's garments .
He , upon some action , Is now in durance at Malvolio's suit , A gentleman and follower of my lady's .
He shall enlarge him .
A most extracting frenzy of mine own From my remembrance clearly banished his .
Truly , madam , he holds Beelzebub at the staves ' end as well as a man in his case may do .
Has here writ a letter to you .
I should have given 't you today morning , but as a madman's epistles are no gospels , so it skills not much when they are delivered .
Open 't , and read it .
Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers the madman .
How now ?
Art thou mad ?
No , madam , I do but read madness .
An your ladyship will have it as it ought to be , you must allow Prithee , read i ' thy right wits .
So I do , madonna .
But to read his right wits is to read thus .
Therefore perpend , my princess , and give ear .
By the Lord , madam , you wrong me , and the world shall know it .
Though you have put me into darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over me , yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your Ladyship .
Think of me as you please .
I leave my duty a little unthought of and speak out of my injury .
The madly used Malvolio." Did he write this ?
Ay , madam .
This savors not much of distraction .
See him delivered , Fabian ; bring him hither .
Madam , I am most apt to embrace your offer .
Is this the madman ?
Ay , my lord , this same .
How now , Malvolio !
Madam , you have done me wrong , Notorious wrong .
Have I , Malvolio ?
No .
Tell me why .
Alas , Malvolio , this is not my writing , Though , I confess , much like the character .
But out of question , 'tis Maria's hand .
And now I do bethink me , it was she First told me thou wast mad , then camest in smiling , And in such forms which here were presupposed Upon thee in the letter .
Prithee , be content .
Why , "some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrown upon them." I was one , sir , in this interlude , one Sir Topas , sir , but that's all one .
He hath been most notoriously abused .
Pursue him and entreat him to a peace .
He hath not told us of the captain yet .
Cesario , come , For so you shall be , while you are a man .
Taurus !
That's sides and heart .
No , sir , it is legs and thighs .
Let me see the caper .
He hath known you but three days , and already you are no stranger .
No , believe me .
I thank you .
Here comes the count .
Who saw Cesario , ho ?
Be clamorous , and leap all civil bounds , Rather than make unprofited return .
I think not so , my lord .
Dear lad , believe it .
For they shall yet belie thy happy years That say thou art a man .
I know thy constellation is right apt For this affair .
I'll do my best To woo your lady , Whoe'er I woo , myself would be his wife .
Give me excess of it that , surfeiting , The appetite may sicken , and so die .
Oh , it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound , That breathes upon a bank of violets , Stealing and giving odor .
Tis not so sweet now as it was before .
So full of shapes is fancy That it alone is high fantastical .
Will you go hunt , my lord ?
What , Curio ?
My lady will hang thee for thy absence .
Let her hang me .
Make that good .
He shall see none to fear .
A good lenten answer .
I can tell thee where that saying was born , of "I fear no colors." Where , good Mistress Mary ?
In the wars .
Well , God give them wisdom that have it .
Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent .
You are resolute , then ?
Well , go thy way .
If Sir Toby would leave drinking , thou wert as witty a piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria .
Peace , you rogue , no more o ' that .
Here comes my lady .
Take the fool away .
Do you not hear , fellows ?
Take away the lady .
Go to , you're a dry fool .
I'll no more of you .
Besides , you grow dishonest .
If he can not , let the botcher mend him .
Anything that's mended is but patched .
Virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin , and sin that amends is but patched with virtue .
If that this simple syllogism will serve , so .
If it will not , what remedy ?
Sir , I bade them take away you .
Good madonna , give me leave to prove you a fool .
Can you do it ?
Dexterously , good madonna .
I must catechise you for it , madonna .
Good my mouse of virtue , answer me .
Well , sir , for want of other idleness , I'll bide your proof .
Good madonna , why mournest thou ?
Good fool , for my brother's death .
I think his soul is in hell , madonna .
I know his soul is in heaven , fool .
The more fool , madonna , to mourn for your brother's soul being in heaven .
Take away the fool , gentlemen .
What think you of this fool , Malvolio ?
Doth he not mend ?
Yes , and shall do till the pangs of death shake him .
Infirmity , that decays the wise , doth ever make the better fool .
God send you , sir , a speedy infirmity , for the better increasing your folly !
Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox , but he will not pass his word for two pence that you are no fool .
How say you to that , Malvolio ?
I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal .
I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that
I protest I take these wise men that crow so at these set kind of fools no better than the fools ' zanies .
Oh , you are sick of self-love , Malvolio , and taste with a distempered appetite .
Now Mercury endue thee with leasing , for thou speakest well of fools !
Madam , there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you .
From the Count Orsino , is it ?
I know not , madam .
Tis a fair young man , and well attended .
Who of my people hold him in delay ?
Sir Toby , madam , your kinsman .
He speaks nothing but madman .
If it be a suit from the count , I am sick , or not at home .
What is he at the gate , cousin ?
A gentleman .
A gentleman ?
What gentleman ?
Good Sir Toby !
Lechery !
I defy lechery .
There's one at the gate .
Ay , marry , what is he ?
Let him be the devil , an he will , I care not .
Give me faith , say I .
What's a drunken man like , fool ?
Like a drowned man , a fool and a madman .
One draught above heat makes him a fool , the second mads him , and a third drowns him .
Go look after him .
Madam , yond young fellow swears he will speak with you .
I told him you were sick .
He takes on him to understand so much , and therefore comes to speak with you .
I told him you were asleep .
He seems to have a foreknowledge of that too , and therefore comes to speak with you .
What is to be said to him , lady ?
He's fortified against any denial .
Tell him he shall not speak with me .
What manner of man ?
Of very ill manner .
He'll speak with you , will you or no .
Of what personage and years is he ?
Not yet old enough for a man , nor young enough for a boy , as a squash is before 'tis a peascod , or a codling when 'tis almost an apple .
Tis with him in standing water , between boy and man .
He is very well-favored , and he speaks very shrewishly .
One would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him .
Let him approach .
Call in my gentlewoman .
Gentlewoman , my lady calls .
Give me my veil .
Come , throw it o'er my face .
The honorable lady of the house , which is she ?
Speak to me .
I shall answer for her .
Your will ?
Most radiant , exquisite and unmatchable beauty , I pray you , tell me if this be the lady of the house , for I never saw her .
I would be loath to cast away my speech , for besides that it is excellently well penned , I have taken great pains to con it .
Good beauties , let me sustain no scorn .
I am very comptible , even to the least sinister usage .
Whence came you , sir ?
I can say little more than I have studied , and that question's out of my part .
Good gentle one , give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house , that I may proceed in my speech .
Are you a comedian ?
No , my profound heart .
And yet , by the very fangs of malice I swear , I am not that I play .
Are you the lady of the house ?
If I do not usurp myself , I am .
Most certain , if you are she , you do usurp yourself , for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve .
But this is from my commission .
I will on with my speech in your praise and then show you the heart of my message .
Come to what is important in 't .
I forgive you the praise .
Alas , I took great pains to study it , and 'tis poetical .
It is the more like to be feigned .
I pray you , keep it in .
If you be not mad , be gone .
Will you hoist sail , sir ?
Here lies your way .
Tell me your mind .
Speak your office .
It alone concerns your ear .
I bring no overture of war , no taxation of homage .
My words are as full of peace as matter .
Yet you began rudely .
What are you ?
What would you ?
How now !
What news from her ?
Away before me to sweet beds of flowers .
What I am and what I would are as secret as maidenhead .
Give us the place alone .
Most sweet lady , A comfortable doctrine , and much may be said of it .
Where lies your text ?
In Orsino's bosom .
In his bosom ?
In what chapter of his bosom ?
To answer by the method , in the first of his heart .
Oh , I have read it .
It is heresy .
Have you no more to say ?
Good madam , let me see your face .
Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face ?
You are now out of your text .
But we will draw the curtain and show you the picture .
Look you , sir , such a one I was this present .
Is 't not well done ?
Twill endure wind and weather .
O , sir , I will not be so hard-hearted .
I will give out divers schedules of my beauty .
But , if you were the devil , you are fair .
My lord and master loves you .
How does he love me ?
Your lord does know my mind .
I can not love him .
Yet I suppose him virtuous , know him noble , Of great estate , of fresh and stainless youth .
In voices well divulged , free , learned , and valiant ; And in dimension and the shape of nature A gracious person .
But yet I can not love him ; He might have took his answer long ago .
Why , what would you ?
Make me a willow cabin at your gate And call upon my soul within the house .
Write loyal cantons of contemned love And sing them loud even in the dead of night .
You might do much .
Above my fortunes , yet my state is well .
I am a gentleman .
Get you to your lord .
I can not love him .
Let him send no more , Unless perchance you come to me again To tell me how he takes it .
Fare you well .
I thank you for your pains .
Spend this for me .
I am no fee'd post , lady .
Keep your purse .
My master , not myself , lacks recompense .
Farewell , fair cruelty .
What is your parentage ? " "Above my fortunes , yet my state is well .
Not too fast !
Soft , soft !
Unless the master were the man .
How now ?
Even so quickly may one catch the plague ?
Well , let it be. , What ho , Malvolio !
Here , madam , at your service .
Run after that same peevish messenger , The county's man .
He left this ring behind him , Would I or not .
Madam , I will .
I do I know not what and fear to find Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind .
Fate , show thy force .
Ourselves we do not owe .
What is decreed must be , and be this so .
By your patience , no .
Let me yet know of you whither you are bound .
No , sooth , sir .
My determinate voyage is mere extravagancy .
But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not extort from me what I am willing to keep in .
He left behind him myself and a sister , both born in an hour .
If the heavens had been pleased , would we had so ended !
But you , sir , altered that , for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned .
Alas the day !
A lady , sir , though it was said she much resembled me , was yet of many accounted beautiful .
She is drowned already , sir , with salt water , though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more .
O good Antonio , forgive me your trouble .
If you will not murder me for my love , let me be your servant .
Fare you well at once .
I am bound to the Count Orsino's court .
Farewell .
The gentleness of all the gods go with thee !
I have many enemies in Orsino's court , Else would I very shortly see thee there .
But , come what may , I do adore thee so That danger shall seem sport , and I will go .
Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia ?
Even now , sir .
On a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither .
She returns this ring to you , sir .
You might have saved me my pains to have taken it away yourself .
Receive it so .
She took the ring of me .
I'll none of it .
Come , sir , you peevishly threw it to her , and her will is it should be so returned .
I left no ring with her .
What means this lady ?
Fortune forbid my outside have not charmed her !
She made good view of me , indeed so much That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue , For she did speak in starts distractedly .
She loves me , sure !
The cunning of her passion Invites me in this churlish messenger .
I am the man .
If it be so , as 'tis , Poor lady , she were better love a dream .
How will this fadge ?
What will become of this ?
O time , thou must untangle this , not I .
It is too hard a knot for me to untie !
Approach , Sir Andrew .
Not to be abed after midnight is to be up betimes , and Nay , my troth , I know not .
But I know to be up late is to be up late .
A false conclusion .
I hate it as an unfilled can .
Thou'rt a scholar .
Let us therefore eat and drink .
Marian , I say !
A stoup of wine !
Here comes the fool , i ' faith .
How now , my hearts !
Did you never see the picture of "We Three" ?
Welcome , ass .
Now let's have a catch .
What country , friends , is this ?
This is Illyria , lady .
And what should I do in Illyria ?
My brother he is in Elysium .
Perchance he is not drown'd. , What think you , sailors ?
It is perchance that you yourself were saved .
O , my poor brother !
And so perchance may he be .
True , madam .
Know'st thou this country ?
Ay , madam , well , for I was bred and born Not three hours ' travel from this very place .
By my troth , the fool has an excellent breast .
My lady has a white hand , and the Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses .
If one knight give a , Would you have a love song or a song of good life ?
A love song , a love song .
Ay , ay .
I care not for good life .
Excellent good , i ' faith .
Good , good .
A mellifluous voice , as I am true knight .
A contagious breath .
Very sweet and contagious , i ' faith .
Shall we rouse the night owl in a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver ?
Shall we do that ?
An you love me , let's do 't .
Most certain .
Let our catch be "Thou Knave." "Hold thy peace , thou knave , " knight ?
I shall be constrained in 't to call thee knave , knight .
It begins "Hold thy peace." I shall never begin if I hold my peace .
Good , i ' faith .
Come , begin .
What a caterwauling do you keep here !
If my lady have not called up her steward Malvolio and bid him turn you out of doors , never trust me .
For the love o ' God , peace !
My masters , are you mad ?
Or what are you ?
Have you no wit , manners , nor honesty but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night ?
Is there no respect of place , persons , nor time in you ?
We did keep time , sir , in our catches .
Sneck up !
Sir Toby , I must be round with you .
My lady bade me tell you , that , though she harbors you as her kinsman , she's nothing allied to your disorders .
If you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors , you are welcome to the house .
If not , an it would please you to take leave of her , she is very willing to bid you farewell .
Nay , good Sir Toby .
Out o ' tune , sir .
You lie .
Yes , by Saint Anne , and ginger shall be hot i ' the mouth too .
Thou'rt i ' the right .
Go shake your ears !
Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man's a-hungry , to challenge him the field and then to break promise with him and make a fool of him .
Do 't , knight .
I'll write thee a challenge .
Or I'll deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth .
Sweet Sir Toby , be patient for tonight .
Since the youth of the count's was today with thy lady , she is much out of quiet .
For Monsieur Malvolio , let me alone with him .
I know I can do it .
O , if I thought that , I'd beat him like a dog !
I have no exquisite reason for 't , but I have reason good enough .
And on that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work .
What wilt thou do ?
I can write very like my lady your niece : on a forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands .
Excellent !
I have 't in my nose too .
He shall think , by the letters that thou wilt drop , that they come from my niece , and that she's in love with him .
My purpose is , indeed , a horse of that color .
And your horse now would make him an ass .
Ass , I doubt not .
Oh , 'twill be admirable !
Sport royal , I warrant you .
I know my physic will work with him .
I will plant you two , and let the fool make a third , where he shall find the letter .
Observe his construction of it .
For this night , to bed , and dream on the event .
Farewell .
Good night , Penthesilea .
Before me , she's a good wench .
She's a beagle , true-bred , and one that adores me .
What o ' that ?
I was adored once too .
Let's to bed , knight .
Thou hadst need send for more money .
If thou hast her not i ' the end , call me "Cut." If I do not , never trust me , take it how you will .
Tis too late to go to bed now .
Give me some music .
He is not here , so please your lordship , that should sing it .
Who was it ?
He is about the house .
Thou dost speak masterly .
My life upon 't , young though thou art , thine eye Hath stay'd upon some favor that it loves .
Hath it not , boy ?
A little , by your favor .
What kind of woman is't ?
Of your complexion .
She is not worth thee , then .
What years , i ' faith ?
About your years , my lord .
Too old by heaven .
Let still the woman take An elder than herself .
I think it well , my lord .
Then let thy love be younger than thyself , Or thy affection can not hold the bent .
For women are as roses , whose fair flower Being once displayed , doth fall that very hour .
And so they are .
Alas , that they are so , To die even when they to perfection grow !
Who governs here ?
A noble duke , in nature As in name .
What is his name ?
Orsino .
Orsino .
I have heard my father name him .
He was a bachelor then .
For but a month ago I went from hence , And then 'twas fresh in murmur , as , you know , What great ones do the less will prattle of , That he did seek the love of fair Olivia .
What's she ?
Oh , that I served that lady And might not be delivered to the world , Till I had made mine own occasion mellow , What my estate is .
Are you ready , sir ?
No pains , sir .
I take pleasure in singing , sir .
I'll pay thy pleasure then .
Give me now leave to leave thee .
Farewell .
Let all the rest give place .
Once more , Cesario , Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty .
Tell her my love , more noble than the world , Prizes not quantity of dirty lands ; The parts that fortune hath bestowed upon her , Tell her , I hold as giddily as fortune ; But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems That nature pranks her in attracts my soul .
But if she can not love you , sir ?
I can not be so answer'd .
Sooth , but you must .
Say that some lady , as perhaps there is , Hath for your love a great a pang of heart As you have for Olivia .
Must she not then be answered ?
There is no woman's sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion As love doth give my heart .
No woman's heart So big , to hold so much .
They lack retention .
Alas , their love may be called appetite , No motion of the liver , but the palate , That suffer surfeit , cloyment , and revolt ; But mine is all as hungry as the sea , And can digest as much .
Make no compare Between that love a woman can bear me And that I owe Olivia .
Ay , but I know , What dost thou know ?
Too well what love women to men may owe .
In faith , they are as true of heart as we .
My father had a daughter loved a man As it might be , perhaps , were I a woman , I should your lordship .
And what's her history ?
A blank , my lord .
Was not this love indeed ?
But died thy sister of her love , my boy ?
I am all the daughters of my father's house , And all the brothers too , and yet I know not .
Sir , shall I to this lady ?
Come thy ways , Signior Fabian .
Nay , I'll come .
If I lose a scruple of this sport , let me be boiled to death with melancholy .
Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame ?
I would exult , man .
You know , he brought me out o ' favor with my lady about a bear-baiting here .
To anger him , we'll have the bear again , and we will fool him black and blue .
Shall we not , Sir Andrew ?
An we do not , it is pity of our lives .
Here comes the little villain .
How now , my metal of India ?
Get you all three into the boxtree .
Malvolio's coming down this walk .
He has been yonder i ' the sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half hour .
Observe him , for the love of mockery , for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him .
