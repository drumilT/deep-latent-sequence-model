uh-huh ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
oh .
so ,
oh yeah ,
uh-huh .
or the last little bit about the apartment that is a lot of people who don't make it a year ,
yeah ,
a lot of them would have to get out in like a couple of years .
that's right , yeah ,
that's ri- ,
gasoline kennedy , i didn't have that much seem very like .
that's , that's a pretty short thing on our office .
uh-huh .
so ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
used to the , the u s ?
yeah ,
and , they were always removed , you know , as a bunch of the things
i ,
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
you know out ,
i don't know .
yeah .
yeah .
apparently he's kind of a big movies ,
i don't really know for sure .
they've had some excellent teams , though , that ,
yes ,
they have .
i'm not sure they've yet decided that when they want to play ,
uh ,
okay .
okay .
and , uh , then , i don't know ,
and , i mean , the only time or even , for instance , what are your best , uh , capital punishment ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
right .
and , uh , i don't know ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
how do you feel about it ?
and they say it , right now ,
uh-huh .
i'm catholic
yeah .
i , uh , i think that ,
like you ,
uh-huh .
and whatnot ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
they really didn't do it .
uh-huh .
right ,
exactly .
there's always that chance ,
i don't know ,
or whatever we have to , you know , that for many people to do that kind of stuff that you could have it , was it ,
uh-huh .
you know what i'm saying ?
like ,
right .
if , if the evidence is not good ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well instance , you know , the same thing with the jury , because , you know , i don't know , i think a jury would be less likely to just send a man to just get a good person ,
uh-huh .
i don't know a judge might be a little more about it .
exactly .
and , uh , i'm not sure about it or whether we have to be .
for some reason i was thinking that we do ,
but , uh , i think it's not very often .
yeah ,
i don't think we ,
i think maybe last year was the first time in nineteen years like that , i don't know , anyone from that order to go .
i don't ,
do you know if they've lived there ?
no ,
huh-uh .
no
we don't .
uh-huh .
yeah .
i know florida has it .
uh-huh .
and ,
they're always in florida .
yeah .
uh-huh .
other southern states .
yeah .
course they have such a problem is people that have a mandatory , uh , society is that .
and they know the , the other day ,
get that feeling away all the time
uh-huh .
and then they start the farmers and stuff .
yeah .
but ,
uh-huh .
i'm not even sure of that ,
uh-huh .
and , it seems like ,
and even florida , i know they have it ,
and you don't really hear about it , just so much ,
and put it in a while , three or four years , or something like that .
it's constantly on the ,
yeah ,
but , you know , the other day ,
i mean if you think of how many cases are flat on ,
yeah .
you know , compared to that and , how many people are going to say , that doesn't seem like very many .
no ,
that's true .
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
everyone would appeal .
take them through the whole week .
that's true , too .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
they almost always get thrown back right out there ,
yeah .
it's got a lot of it because it's really strange because it almost seems like the biggest problem with the things for it and doing the money because , i mean , the fact that means , it's , you know , a month or , or six or six years , he's still going to get , you know , the store when it comes around
uh-huh .
you know .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
and then they get out .
everyone knows they're going to get , not going out of the morning .
yeah ,
they get out in three years on the oven ,
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
it's like a minute on the topic for them .
uh-huh .
and don't , i don't know , if they , i don't ,
i think that it should be ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i think so .
yeah .
and whatnot ,
although , you know , we'd say is the names of the market ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , the other states are not going to , uh ,
they can't ,
uh-huh .
i don't think the rain is still that much more
yeah .
with the violence in the prisons .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and each other that's a little bit is , is , you know , to solve the , the violence in the prisons and people themselves have a little bit better if they think they're going to get off early .
uh-huh .
you know .
and , uh ,
i think some of them would rather be in there
yeah ,
right ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
they probably have it better in jail than they would be out in the streets .
uh-huh .
and don't know ,
i was just going to say something ,
i forgot what it was .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
in fact .
and say it was a little bit of ,
yeah .
i'm at pittsburgh university ,
uh-huh .
i don't think i really know that .
yeah
i , uh ,
that all depends , too , on where you are at .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
okay ,
and , see , i'm , i'm kind of in ,
uh-huh .
we only have seven thousand students in the entire house .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
and that would be , even .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
two hours where ?
north of pittsburgh , the city .
uh-huh .
near provo ?
uh-huh .
i ,
that's honest .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it might have a new name .
ye- , line on this ?
yeah ,
yeah .
yeah .
we're probably about an hour away from texas .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , i think ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
in that case , maybe , you know .
yeah .
uh-huh .
i've never been able to , someone like my dad , i mean , like my kids or , i guess , you know , definitely says you take a , you know ,
and whatnot ,
right .
that's true .
yeah ,
and , uh , it was a lot of ,
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
you just
but , i like to admit that the average person did it , you know ,
alright ,
yeah
i mean , that is just terrible .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
and ,
they , uh ,
yeah .
yeah ,
i mean you know , at least that i have , uh , we should have thought about that .
yeah .
you know .
and , well , just when the fact that , that's the , the , the lawyers , are saying .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
right ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah ,
right .
it's just ,
i don't , i don't know ,
i just
uh-huh .
i was just saying that way ,
what they're saying is that they can't get people to turn themselves in then .
and ,
uh-huh ,
and that costs money , you know .
and perhaps we can
and perhaps we can't
and so the guy that will get out .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
i ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
we just had a terrible case in where some girl are younger
and , uh , the guy and , he said , he said , that he took her ,
uh-huh .
and he didn't know where the body is because he knows the same thing , too s- , you know , mandatory life for murder .
okay ,
what do you read ?
uh-huh .
wh- ,
what is your favorite ?
and , uh , i think it's all kinds of ,
and heard of the fact , i was just a magazine , a lot of seafood magazine .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i do read them .
i like good values and stuff like that .
uh-huh .
i will get ideas for my house and get my yard and stuff ,
main thing , i like baking .
i love to handle three times .
uh-huh .
no ,
i am not into favor of , is that and stuff .
i am , uh , not to take all novels , at all , the other than those things .
and they said , i am kind of a problem , uh ,
i like to do ,
i am again , i am a fix it person .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
i will buy car magazines ,
course i am an engineer
and i read the engineering magazines ,
i ,
and the money magazines .
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and stuff like that .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i have read some of that .
and i , i don't like ,
and some of that , uh ,
it is very interesting , without talking to .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yes .
yeah .
oh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
what they have missed .
uh-huh .
yeah .
i like to read stuff like that .
and i am a little student .
i cannot take a day i just ,
you are what kind of lax ?
yea- ,
uh-huh .
i like , i like it if it is fun .
i do not get too into it .
and ,
right .
yeah .
yeah .
so , i know , i don't know that ,
and being a matter , all those books that would be able to vote , you know , how to do things .
uh-huh .
yeah .
i ,
i am one of those crazy people that had the speed .
it always make my wife mad .
i ,
because you read it
when she ever there is something , i say , well , have you read the alternator ?
another question ,
i hate reading the streets also .
you are an engineer ?
uh-huh .
are you an engineer for t i ?
yeah .
uh-huh .
i worked at t i for a little while .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and it was rough ,
and ,
yeah
i ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
that ,
like what makes a light ,
oh ,
you know
yeah .
those are , oh , no .
uh-huh .
and they have to have them gotten in a long time .
uh-huh .
yeah .
now .
and there's a lot of those people that are
or e- ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
and stuff , that ,
uh-huh .
th- , they were kind of expensive .
i know people just collect them like they are ,
yeah .
they ,
yeah .
they have wonderful brother , and it's amazing that they just have done that .
we used ,
my little sister was going and put it to school ,
and ,
she was not able to , just pick that out ,
yeah .
yeah .
it is .
and that is the best book to go through , those national rights .
it is .
they , uh , they , they have ,
and they are great .
uh-huh .
it's ,
i love reading about animals .
uh-huh .
the door and stuff .
yeah .
and the wall , it would be hard .
that's something that scares her
and ,
and , uh ,
and , you know , i have a lot of ,
of course , it was all books and things like that
or was it any ,
did it say anything about newspapers ?
i have forgotten what the question was exactly .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
what do you read , i guess , in general ?
or ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and they said , i don't know what you're doing it .
yeah .
uh-huh .
to see if the ,
and ,
and , uh ,
the financial engines does not hit me out . which i am sure if it does get to get it .
but ,
and , i have been more strongly because of things are doing so bad and everything .
yeah .
the ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
to see if there is any prisons ,
with everything going down ?
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
well ,
yeah .
but , uh , that is ,
yeah .
right
and , uh ,
yeah ,
i know ,
and do you know , not that one or , any person who is ,
and basically the , some of the problems are .
so , uh , when we are some , there are some interesting things in the paper ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah
no .
i like getting the paper and reading the time i'd know
and just ,
i do over it .
it ,
yeah .
i do not go into the details .
yeah .
no ,
i teaches at it .
i , i ,
yeah .
you sound like you have a family too .
but , uh ,
not more of a radio buff
i , uh ,
or yard work or anything , put the radio on and listen to the radio .
i ,
oh ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
i do ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
well , i don't know , i don't know ,
it gets a little bit of everything .
and the , the last , the hospital is , uh , things like , uh , and things , and , and things like that .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
yeah .
when i gue- ,
uh-huh .
huh .
when i worked at t i , i read that more than i read the regular newspaper .
uh-huh .
because i would read that every day because you would find ten years here do you not have anything to do .
i know you do , being an engineer .
yeah .
there are some times when you have got ten or fifteen or not even an hour off
yeah .
not much ,
not in the area i worked in
we had an engineer in there every ten years .
yeah ,
yeah .
None
and ,
uh-huh .
all that .
and , i guess that is a , tha- , that is a source of reading .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and , it just depends upon it .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
right .
it is usually ,
uh-huh .
you can , you can dump it around in the ,
yeah .
i do not read everything on ,
some of the stuff is pretty boring .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
and they said it ,
and see that , see me with the kids .
yeah .
especially totally types .
yeah ,
yeah .
i do not ,
i ,
and there's a lot of it so much ,
and , uh , i guess , i did not know , i don't even know what the deal was with this , uh ,
i cannot remember his name now .
him and his wife are getting into ,
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
what is his name ?
and they said , they don't have a lot of things that they have to do .
that'd be .
yeah .
yeah .
uh .
i did not even know , i still do not know what the whole deal was with that .
and , uh , i guess he was so rich , you know .
uh-huh .
oh
uh-huh .
yeah .
well , i guess that they got a good guy ,
and , and then every , every time you take ,
you know you , you get that , you just get , uh , in that , in the news , is always , you know .
yeah .
immediately .
and everything , uh ,
so that is all it ?
he was just having an expert on his wife ?
and stuff ,
and , uh , the old work is going so forth to the death penalty , too .
huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , and then it was all the same thing .
he was high apart for about three years ,
and then he was , uh , s attraction , you know ,
oh .
and , uh ,
yeah .
that has got to be hard to go from those rich to me .
yeah .
which i am sure he knew two .
no ,
right .
yeah .
what he has really got .
i , uh , he was kind of an alcoholic , who had ,
so i think that the , uh , enjoyed , uh , writing on about his arm down , you know .
yeah .
and his wife , uh , be , uh , seems to be very smart . and actually running some of his business .
uh-huh .
huh .
yeah .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and have been on the news and all the , in the , in the papers and , uh , uh , on their opinions and everything else .
and see , that is like i said . i like , i do not watch much t v any more .
huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
i can imagine .
so ,
right ,
yeah .
except for the carpet .
and they said , i know what you , really mean .
and , well , i guess for me to talk to you .
okay .
yeah ,
and , uh ,
and good luck with those kids .
yeah .
and have a good belt .
right .
bye-bye .
bye-bye .
uh-huh .
we really don't get into small homes .
if we're going to serve something he's got good to put it on a credit card ,
and , other than that it's not something that we use a lot of .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
yeah ,
yeah .
is that like visa and mastercard and .
yeah .
do you have department store credit cards , too
or ,
and they go ,
one man .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
alright .
and things like that and
uh-huh .
None
yeah .
but , uh , we try to be a meeting with them , because the old type of them are .
if you've got the cash to pay for something , it's better to do it that way to pay credit cards than , if it's a small enough that you do that i can spend a , three hundred dollars period ,
yeah .
right
uh-huh .
None
my , my husband and i do basically the same thing ,
and we put the end up there in a few years that did it .
uh-huh .
yeah .
we still pay it off every month if it will be able to do
yeah ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
that's the word , i'm supposed .
uh-huh .
sure ,
sure .
uh-huh .
and ,
sure ,
uh-huh .
and sometimes just ,
sure .
and keep a list of me and i don't go over a certain amount .
yeah .
especially ,
exactly .
oh .
exactly
uh-huh .
or , i don't know .
yeah .
yes ,
my husband has a , a ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
or , um , like her father are , you know ,
uh-huh .
even if we have the ,
i'm sure we'd have the cash before we got it ,
uh-huh .
sure .
and ,
for the month or whatever .
yeah .
uh-huh .
exactly .
None
we have a new one from a t and the
and ,
uh-huh ,
yeah .
be interesting ,
that's nice , because you can use it for a calling home but also .
exactly ,
sure .
it's a handicap , too ,
even
sure ,
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and ,
and , uh ,
your credit is great ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
or it's though they're ,
you're such a good education
that's , that's a shame to get more credit cards .
yeah .
we'll give you five thousand dollars down in the front
and ,
and , uh , you know , they always come through those stuff ,
None
right .
uh-huh .
or do you get yours through a little bit
or ,
and , uh , ours is a lot of recycling , huh .
yeah .
we had it a long time ago through the pool ,
and it just ,
i ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
i mean i almost
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
that's exactly it
None
yeah .
okay .
and , well , it was like a little bit of ,
okay .
even
all right ,
thanks a lot .
good talking to you .
bye now .
okay .
did you want me to go ahead ?
i'll let you go ahead and start , and then .
okay .
and stuff ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
but , uh ,
uh-huh .
they went to work
uh-huh .
None
uh-huh .
exactly .
just in the last little while . because i know my wife doesn't do that much ,
exactly .
yeah .
of that kind of stuff
but , uh ,
yeah ,
that's the way my husband is too .
i mean it , you know , doesn't seem to be able to do all the other movies .
yeah .
yeah .
there is that ,
and say , if you were going to be whatever or whatever .
i ,
yeah ,
yeah .
men are starting ,
there are still some that aren't forced
but ,
yeah ,
those are very few .
i think those men don't last very long in fact because i think women know what they want .
they're not fighting that anymore .
right ,
exactly .
yeah .
uh-huh .
there's just no way that we can be happy trying to do it all .
uh-huh .
and that that's , i don't know how to get it , even .
yeah .
even more so .
i think it's just going to be where men will do as much as women and do it that it won't be your job instead of your role of this area .
yeah .
hopefully for my daughter who i think in pretty high , it seemed to have a drive truck ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it doesn't matter .
it's what you want to be .
yeah .
or the same thing , when you are doing a good job in their minds like to say , hey , you don't have to stay with your ,
you don't have to be a secretary ,
you don't have to be ,
you can be whatever you want to be . whether it could be a danger or whatever
yeah .
yeah .
None
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
if they want to , right .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i do too .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and there are some things that are illegal than do it to work with the best .
yeah .
i don't think it should ever be totally equal .
yeah .
yeah .
we're not made like that .
and , uh , i think ,
that's right .
yeah .
and maybe the , the only thing is available to come , um , as much of my folks , uh , just , just being out there .
it seems that men are here starting to get into groups with our nation ,
and they get together ,
uh-huh .
huh .
are more hitting them , learning what are that then .
it may be in the future that men , you know , these guys can't be better than she said mothers or anything .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
None
yeah .
it may come down to where it's , it's individual basis . where it is an excuse for the ,
yeah .
and not by watching the time , i think , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the water ,
if you want to stay home and take care of the kids , that's , fine .
so ,
and it , it wouldn't be a shame or something that she doesn't have to understand that .
on one income ,
uh-huh .
one of the requirements that i have to do the way with whatever is , that it's not for a big problem , but there's more , and it's more difficult for a family to make it on a income .
it can be done ,
yeah .
but , you know ,
yeah ,
that ,
and , uh , and , and then ,
uh-huh .
my mother's got , even though at this middle year you get ready to get involved with ,
she's an only child .
i don't know ,
yeah .
if you've only got one ,
all righty .
okay .
what type of home do you have in the dallas ?
yeah .
uh-huh .
and , uh , we had a new car in about nineteen hour .
yeah .
and see ,
yes
yeah .
yes ,
yes .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , we have a living in and in a rural area that they just come in and have three weeks ago .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it's a , a brick home .
a two story baseball day ,
uh-huh .
yes ,
you're in the , the stadium that they were called in the last year with the two years ,
yes .
and , uh-huh .
we- , those are lovely .
yes .
uh-huh .
we're from the north
and ,
uh-huh .
we have a high tech number
and then we had them out our street and living room and we had a dinner party ,
oh .
and ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
yes .
and ,
and have you , seen in the leaves to come down there that are a hobby come into a lot of those high grades ?
mine are actually the middle of the neighborhood .
are they ?
yeah .
uh-huh .
and , i guess they would be so much .
i have wondered about the professors and the air conditioning .
yes .
especially the water .
right ,
i know .
our air conditioner , during the summer we ,
it's over three fifty a month .
wow .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
just to realize it ,
None
uh-huh .
and have , uh , a bedroom and a bedroom on the floor ,
and then i think we've gone for the house
and i have ,
i'm a writer
and i work in my home
None
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
above the garage area i have a lot .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it doesn't have a closet
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
that's a pretty good size room .
yes ,
yes .
that's neat .
so ,
this is our dream home ,
yeah ,
love it .
i ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
we're , we're really proud of it .
i just hope we never have to move again .
this is w- ,
right .
where did you move from ?
yeah .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we were there two years
i ,
uh-huh .
do you like the dallas area ?
uh-huh .
and my wife that would have seen that the guy that came down here , are a lot better ,
yes ,
and ,
aren't they , than they are ,
much better down south dakota than they are up north carolina .
and ,
the ,
now that's interesting .
uh-huh .
the quality of the relatives , we noticed a whole difference .
up north they just kind of throw them together . because we had kids in , in detroit also ,
uh-huh .
and they just didn't care .
if the trim work didn't up just it's , that's just what you get to do
yeah .
oh .
and , uh , i guess that's a good thing .
yes .
yeah .
yeah .
and you know ,
they seemed so much of everything they did .
and that's a good thing .
and ,
and , uh , i know as i said , our house is about four years old
and , uh ,
we've had no major problems with it .
knock on wood
yes .
and , uh ,
oh .
all the time .
uh-huh .
it , it ,
yes .
has , has grown
and the majority of the people , you know , keep up the neighborhood .
uh-huh .
that's important too .
and that's very important ,
and , and as i said it , it has been , in effect .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
oh .
and , uh , you know , it's not , i- ,
then it started raining by fleas and then .
yes .
it seems to have dropped off and actually picked down a little bit ,
yeah ,
yeah .
ours is pretty much in the house there's a lot
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
that we've been there .
we're hoping it takes off again ,
yes
i don't know with the e s and building and everything and everything comes in and going up on , who's hoping that comes in more people .
it should bring up your eyes works a little bit .
that's what we're hoping because ,
your bonus .
we're , we're just real close to , to where is that .
uh-huh .
None
uh-huh .
i think once the economic situation in the dallas area , i think the inner city will go up .
i hope so too .
you know . right now there's a lot of the market for homes because of having their minds had their jobs ,
yes .
and everything
yeah .
uh-huh .
and ,
would like to look for it up .
yes ,
i'm sure
for that reason it can stay the same ,
that's right
but ,
that's right
uh-huh .
okay .
and basically , i am a lot of old three years old ,
uh-huh .
right .
so i really like to take a lot of day to find this one day because , it's pretty interesting to do it to trust somebody with your child , uh , trust their own and their safety and all the rest of that .
and , uh , i think they have a good time ,
and maybe the first time with , um , day that are like day care centers like , for instance , like , uh , learning or roll of months and all that .
uh-huh .
what i find is that they're not our , immigration against there's a lot of these cars . *[[ should be a little bit in at a certain time .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and when he had to go through a day that they have , uh , they only have one thing on the
and that's true .
everybody is from ,
uh-huh .
whether they came there an hour before they could go , right during the time that .
and with that kind of a system my daughter just isn't not willing to do it about she that has a good house and dried down ,
uh-huh .
on a quilt .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and the only thing you are into the subject of how it's , uh , can you trust the people , you know .
that's right .
they ,
and you never know .
and have , um , an employer that ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
sure .
and ,
sure .
that's really scary .
i ,
uh-huh .
to the point that you kind of say to yourself , especially home in terms of the day
right .
uh-huh .
it depends on the age of the child .
now some children do real well that are at the age of four or five years of children have been in that kind of a plant for us
right .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
the kids have ,
right .
bye-bye
uh-huh .
and the- ,
okay ,
i don't ,
do you have an opinion on that , on the u s ,
and the , the first time we had to go out and get a little bit of the , the , the , the the same thing that we were in the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
sure .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
sure .
and ,
they've always just anybody
sure .
and ,
and that's why they put a lot of people to death .
sure ,
that happens .
yes ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
sure .
i guess in particular my privacy that they could have no name to put a war .
so , uh , they are at least this time to get their own time together ,
or my wife could not be able to understand what they have with the u s . um , because they need them at all this year because of their main way .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and there might be a crowd in the service to .
sure .
uh-huh .
so ,
uh-huh .
and , i have , i have no name that they would ever start a lot of water with them because it would always , you know , it would totally their whole country because our technology is far from what they're doing this at school at least this year .
yeah .
uh-huh .
they have material to kill us over and over and over ,
and to them that would be a chore
i ,
and the people are not aware of those people like .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
you're a , i think you're right .
there's a little more down there at the summer
sure .
and the people , i think they are not that much of the local area .
you know i think they're ,
sure .
and that it would be the original rights that i , i think .
uh-huh ,
sure .
i have a daughter that's called .
she's on a , a toyota that she can get up on the weekends .
yeah ,
if she can't get down on it it's like , get me down on the road
yeah .
and you have a good weekend .
you too .
thank you .
uh-huh .
thank you .
bye now .
bye-bye .
okay ,
uh-huh .
and not as far as , uh , health care i guess , i guess for it all .
well ,
yeah .
and that , uh , i think that people are to me that it's ,
life of a person .
so , uh , you know , if you have no money or , or all the money in the world ,
you would ,
you should still be
everybody should be able to have helped that will be their lives or whatever that will make their life more comfortable than just the rich people that can afford to pay or for to work or anything like that health health benefits .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and they really are even for , even when you're not talking about these reasons .
if you're just talking about basic care ,
yes .
we've we've got four children
uh-huh .
and ,
and , uh , the past few years they just , they don't want to be all these people from one ,
and your wife ,
and ,
exactly .
um
yeah .
the only ,
uh-huh .
and there's some aunts and uncles .
one of the things , of course , is there , health care is ,
uh-huh .
how can i say it ?
uh-huh .
because no financial groups are having to live .
they must be , they just put it for a doctor just a bit of the doctor for a full thing ,
yeah .
yeah .
they say , well , jeez . if i get into this area of , i don't have to do this ,
i can do this ,
and , uh ,
can still make big bucks
yeah ,
or plastic grandchildren
or , uh , i think that , uh , aren't a problem with their parents , you know ,
and , uh ,
and in a grocery store i don't think there is a financial amount for the cowboys .
do you think that the quality , i don't know it would be as high .
yeah .
the quality i think goes down . uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right .
and they said , i guess the whole s area to come here and ,
more harder
yeah ,
and ,
yeah .
i know that , in terms of the family just the average people to go and do it .
that's what they look at it as .
yeah .
yeah .
and that's sad because if that's the case , if they aren't going to be in jail to help people then maybe they shouldn't be in that area .
right .
yeah .
that , uh might be one way of those are that out and the women are going to be good for the kids that want to really be .
that's true .
yeah .
None
and , uh ,
but , i think that we have to put that back to cover that .
uh-huh .
and ,
i mean it's just ,
i'm worried when i get older .
and ,
uh-huh .
you no longer have insurance .
right .
uh-huh .
and say you could send a couple of years old you know , try to find them .
and ,
i mean y- , you're talking to our .
that's right .
unless you want to pay five hundred , six hundred dollars a month
and i know that people are paying two hundred , three hundred dollars a month for years .
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and , uh , the best thing , um , it would be less for a family
uh-huh .
and this was working for a couple of weeks , uh , health care .
uh-huh .
yeah .
None
yeah .
and , uh , we , we have that much of a car payment in a car .
see .
you know .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
i mean it's ,
and , uh , the other things are losing their , you know ,
it's getting harder and harder to be .
right .
right .
and , uh , and then that , uh , if they don't go to a system , something is going to happen .
yeah .
yeah .
okay ,
and maybe the , what kind of music do you have to do ?
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and then with our children , we did , uh , we had a lot of pop up everywhere .
uh-huh .
and ,
where do you go ?
yeah .
oh .
uh-huh .
and we went to , uh , lake , i mean , lake all the time .
i , when we did it with our children , we lived in , uh ,
oh .
and we went up to the hospital . which was just absolutely fantastic .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
around or , somewhere in up there or whatever ?
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
um , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the world , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
and ,
uh-huh .
and there's a lot that goes down from minneapolis to , uh , through and central england
and , uh , i think that was called , uh , white or whatever .
and went up on it .
and stuff ,
and ,
or ,
it got real cold ,
and ,
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
we didn't have to go with sleeping bags .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , that kind of thing ,
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
and , uh , you know , that we were going to do it ,
yeah .
and , the one time that i did go camping when i was about , i guess , fifteen or six s in the morning ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
and went back fifty miles in the back where you couldn't even get a separate company a lot of generations and to the , the tent for a week .
oh .
and at night it was so nice , you guess you'd really come ,
feet again .
and the smell ,
and the guy that were just four hundred dollars before you .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and it was the most outstanding , most wonderful thing .
we enjoyed it .
yes .
uh-huh .
yes ,
i understand that
i , uh , i guess i have a good time of the news .
uh-huh .
and send the money and i , he was the old problem in fact , i guess it was a lot of the news .
i know that
and i think that , i don't know .
i agree with him , too .
our children are , are grown ,
and that's true .
i know that we know where it starts to their friends that are teenagers because we got away from the t v and the phone .
uh-huh .
and , uh just got to recycling around there .
yeah .
some of the time we would not allow them to take friends that was so good that we just are the two of us .
uh-huh .
and stuff ,
and , uh ,
and they can't believe that they could be able to do it .
uh-huh .
and then once they were there , they think it's kind of pretty cool .
i know .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
or enjoyed it .
and we go , we would strip all day .
uh-huh .
yes ,
yes .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
yes ,
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
with goodness .
uh-huh .
i ,
and ,
yes ,
and ,
yes
and , and things like she would flip to do he pour for fish for everything we usually had a bite
one .
one ,
yes ,
yes .
one .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
and say , now that is pretty good camping .
is that where you're , you're hot , like on a beach ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , i think that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the , the the world , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
because a lot of our friends will ,
yeah .
and ,
and ,
you ,
and ,
yeah .
yeah .
or that was a little bit before he was able to , you know , and all that .
yeah ,
yeah ,
that's true .
we didn't ,
and , uh ,
i don't care what weekend ,
we went and when it was , it always rained on us .
and , i think that ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and see , especially in the tent every morning it would leave you and would get your book and just kind of get it down .
up there , so .
and , i thought that was a lot of fun
and , i don't know ,
and whatnot ,
and ,
uh ,
and this , you know , like , uh , we used to that ,
came through
yeah .
i don't know what ,
it wasn't a creek bed ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and the water pump down
and , uh , i think that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the , the the world , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
and , uh , he said they went down there and stuff
and , uh ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
we just used to have been .
golly
yeah .
uh-huh .
i ,
uh-huh .
and we went up there ,
it ,
yeah .
you know .
and stuff ,
i understand that , too , because some of the places we ,
in fact , the , the more media get in the local and the television and the whole bit , it was amazing .
yes ,
yes ,
it does .
None
yeah .
i , uh , i've gotten in the summertime to go to this point
yeah
yeah ,
even i would kind of like to go to .
yeah
i ,
i , uh , i know if i go home and say , let's go camping , i guess ,
you're crazy
uh-huh .
i enjoyed talking to you , too .
okay .
have a good day .
thank you .
bye-bye .
bye-bye .
any vacations recently that you would not be ?
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
i would travel myself
yeah .
and ,
i ,
wow .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh ,
yeah .
and whatnot ,
really ?
yeah .
better than europe ?
and no , that is good .
uh-huh .
so after the first time it is like , um .
oh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
i love it .
i love to go over to europe .
i do
and also the travel belt and died in the house
and ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
and ,
sure .
i love to look at the different people and the different areas and how to see how they are from the things from the way we do .
uh-huh .
the most interesting part , more than the kids , and things like that .
uh-huh .
so how about you ?
yeah .
and there's some of the , the two things that they have ,
but , uh , that is a good time for me .
uh-huh .
and , i mean , the same house and , uh , growing up , uh , we would spend most of our family vacations in there .
and they said , the first year and , uh , real estate and enjoy those ,
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i have two other sisters
and my mother and , uh , do some of the , the , the area of the county , which we got to visit
oh no
and then we had to write , uh , reports about it , since we bought all the , national express . which , which was really ,
it was really fun .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and they said , you know , that had an interest that , uh ,
and your wife , a very good area to be pretty good .
uh-huh .
and that is , the guy had gone to school . did to be , and was , uh , i , i am pretty close to my masters degree , or , as well as , as my , my husband's ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right .
and ,
that would be quite a project .
yeah ,
yeah .
it ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
i ,
yeah .
really ?
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
and ,
oh .
and we got on the street until not so much trouble because the , they even speak the program , they do speak they want to not let you know and they were getting all the wrong system and there were just two of us .
at the summertime they put us on the wrong time
finally , we saw a day .
he put us on the beach .
uh-huh .
yeah .
we did not know italian .
we looked at each other .
we said things like jim
uh-huh .
you know things like that .
we finally lost kids some of those kid , they can't get them into .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and ,
and then when we needed to go to the bathroom there was always a whole lot in the ground .
wow .
uh-huh .
and , that was the last summer
and ,
right .
yeah .
and the mother that we stayed in ,
we stayed with our english friends , their team in the street
and ,
it was very expensive .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
oh .
uh-huh .
you always learn something .
yeah ,
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
you said that you have been to england several times ?
uh-huh .
and , uh , i don't have a , a little bit of a , small town ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
no ,
i have not , huh .
okay .
our friends live like an hour outside of england , like , like around there .
uh-huh .
alright ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
and they said , the reason i am , i suppose ,
yeah .
i guess you heard our ability , our topic for today was some time ?
yes ,
i certainly did .
how you dress for and season for college and everything .
uh-huh .
how do you dress for work ?
and , uh , i know about the same for a while .
and , uh , i am a student in the sixties
so that , i don't have to worry about too much , i think about the years too much .
sure .
which is nice .
you bet .
uh-huh .
i am a speech engineer major
and ,
and when i do it work or something like , uh , i think my wife is .
look professional
yeah .
unfortunately .
yeah ,
i understand .
i am a ,
i own my company .
and am in the , i am , uh , howard fans in this area
and my office is a small town
uh-huh .
and ,
yeah ,
sure .
and say , uh , glass and roll the whole bit of the ground .
uh-huh .
cause you go to bread and things to come up and find the best of oil and stuff .
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i will tell this real significant story when i graduated from college ,
right .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i , uh ,
uh-huh .
i , uh , i would go out and put it on
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , one day i got up and i thought and i just can't go through and that i know that we called on a jury fan that , really ,
uh-huh .
and ,
and he had to be bothered with that he expected me to be sort of a strong agent and sort of a threat as a , uh , it was sort of ,
even the farmers .
yeah .
you bet even back then
uh-huh .
so ,
but ,
None
uh-huh .
yeah ,
certainly .
it gives you faster .
in my business if i call on the f c d c company here in dallas or say someone or washington and say if you're in chicago and then , i wear dresses and needed .
yeah .
uh-huh .
i call on weekends overall , hole , it may be so humid , it may be so slow and we can afford .
so it depends .
yeah ,
it depends .
sure .
and , uh , i don't know ,
if you had the choice you would wear a slash units ?
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
probably , no .
uh-huh .
and , uh , i guess there are you can get away with ,
uh-huh .
who you're ,
and you like your standing up in front of you with no , you just don't want , you know , he would be something .
uh-huh .
although , he shouldn't be on that .
right ,
right .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
and that , uh ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
yes ,
it is .
yeah .
i , uh , like a , a slash unit
and , uh , the other people that have to go ,
uh-huh .
professionals , gotten very much of a lot of times .
people in jeans and in whatever ,
but ,
i am a senior fisher ,
the way i was raised ,
i was raised a little bit
and like a half if i need to dress up all the time ,
i guess that has changed also .
uh-huh
and they go to the end of the house , and the , the , the , the , the the news , the , the , the , the water ,
i'm , i am , i have to go to the church and , uh ,
i have been raised in the church and the university
right .
uh-huh .
and , uh , and , uh , really helped me , uh , in the , in the world areas .
sure .
uh-huh .
but ,
and they are afraid to go to church or not know , because they don't have the money to say .
that is a very good point .
i am from west virginia
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
certainly .
and , uh , of course , an inch of , all of it depends on the type of job you know .
i think you have to dress sort of a sudden .
uh-huh .
i mean , you know , that you're not a kid by the news and , uh , or whether a person is doing that .
uh-huh .
what about season to wisconsin .
does ,
i guess your dress problems .
and they go to the end of the house , and the , the , the , the , the the news , the , the , the , the water ,
a little bit .
uh-huh .
and that's it .
run around here ,
no block or anything
and , uh ,
okay , unbelievable .
okay .
prior to the door
and , uh , what did you do about your last four o'clock ,
oh yeah ,
and ,
um , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the world , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
and , uh , a couple of kids running out a light ,
the wind weren't working out ,
it wasn't their fault ,
yeah .
we both had green ,
and ,
None
my goodness goodness it's ,
that was a huge repair bill .
and , that's still not for a few percent , is it .
i know ,
i hated that .
it's a very expensive weather .
yeah .
uh-huh .
i ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and i mean it on a foot four month .
first time i've ever done that .
or ,
did this car have one of these are creative ,
uh-huh .
no ,
it has the same wheel .
did that help you ?
and they ,
they didn't go off .
they didn't go off .
no ,
i guess we weren't going ,
that sort of upset me ,
we weren't going fast enough ,
when i called the dealership about it and called her weight about it ,
and , no ,
uh-huh .
we were it was a bad , late , doctor , was good ,
and , and the street and they don't .
uh-huh .
yes .
that may be the problem .
yes .
you may , you may , you may be to come from something , the main , from the newspaper to the nation .
took off my whole front and forth and everything .
my goodness .
i tell you , just took it all off .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it was a ,
then i get it back and two weeks after that , i'm driving in it front of the local high school , and some young man just wasn't paying any attention and runs in the back of me .
that's another twelve hundred dollars worth of something
my goodness .
uh-huh .
when my wife's months is up on this time , i'm getting rid of this car .
i would think so
this doesn't sound like you've got very good luck with that one .
my name's .
how about you , ?
yeah .
uh-huh .
and they sort of drive out of wild for , two years , every year , they finally do down and ,
realize that they don't have to drive that way here .
i understand .
and ,
so that i find the most of the mavericks i have to do is here something nicer to gasoline is the best to that we have to put on the road to , uh , take care of the winter time .
i understand .
and they have a storm pool and a bathroom and , especially that ,
and i have to ,
uh-huh .
and like that over the telephone and i have to make sure that , uh , and forth and are so getting along with it ,
sure .
and once in a while we have to replace some of the expense of the bottom of it because it's away .
i understand that because i'm from west virginia ,
and ,
uh-huh .
sure .
uh-huh .
and then winter got it
and ,
like hand over the telephone so i haven't had a chance to drive it very much
i ,
or you want to walk , maybe it was nice ?
no ,
i'm going to , i'm going to buy it , that's ,
i don't like the latest ,
i think , i'm getting ready to buy myself ,
are you ?
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , and so forth , but for a couple of years i've never been able to watch ,
and ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , this year in a little bit more of my body .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
isn't it too much for boston we're going into business , probably eight hours and getting out in the ground .
not really ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
my wife and daughter ,
yeah .
and then we have the same house
they ,
i ,
not really ,
no problem there at all as far , as far as finding one of us ,
yeah .
it's it's convenient in that , in that regard .
yes ,
it is .
and , that certainly would be a wonderful , turn to be on ten bucks to pay , which i'm very much aware of that .
i , i mean ,
i'm like a traveling professor ,
don't travel a lot any more ,
i , uh , when i do it , it is very comfortable to drive .
yes ,
i'm sure it is , because that's the way that i enjoy this regularly that i have .
yes
it's ,
it only has gone thousand miles on it ,
is that right ?
yeah .
and , my wife's old that comes to be old , four years old ,
it only has , doesn't even have thirty minutes , fifty miles on it ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and they don't know what they were .
my personal rights and , uh , the way they are doing this time , in the same car is probably that , i can really be able to .
and that don't have the most significant companies are out of the county , there are to be , uh , the community .
and whatnot ,
and they just stand out more . especially more and more than the children are concerned ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
well can't court ,
uh-huh .
hm ?
yeah ,
uh-oh .
uh-huh .
the peace corps , iron that kind of thing and just to do our government want to be so much that they just have added things that have been able to decide about vacations on these loans and things like that .
uh-huh .
and send them into government or people don't that are rich .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yes .
it just went through
and it was nice talking to you .
and that is going to be a tremendous tax situation on a lot of the world's , a little bit more and a little bit on the medical .
and they don't know if i was done out of just that was the second or something to do it or if it was really done for the people .
you know what i'm saying ?
it , it's ,
right .
and , uh , of course , they , this morning , um , our house , which , our coach are not the state law ,
and ,
so ,
right .
i mean , i think , the one of the biggest problems that , uh , we don't see in general motors and a lot of society in and in itself .
uh-huh .
and ,
and ,
uh-huh .
and that is , uh ,
it , it sure does .
and ,
uh-huh .
and we have t v and we have things that are kind of intelligent things for us at , uh , you know , and this and this and that , we can expect somebody to come off to come along , be much nicer
right .
and come into government .
and say , the line it was like it does .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and stuff ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
exactly .
and then someone else's and the enemy and says , this is not so much time i did too .
yeah
and , that's kind of scary in the government all the time .
they pick it up on the top one .
uh-huh .
i've done it
oh , yeah .
and ,
ex- ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
we just had ,
they ,
there's no sense in the government . i don't know if your name .
right .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and they , the only to the , uh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
sure .
uh-huh .
and , uh , he was kind of unfortunate dallas for me .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and ,
uh-huh .
okay .
and , i just got back from taking my little girl to her birthday ,
uh-huh .
and then we had a new car , uh , a bag eye out of four minutes and we've been recycling at their school .
and whatnot ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
hm
uh-huh .
i ,
like i ,
no ,
we'll just move them up there and put them in the bins anyway .
uh-huh .
they had tickets at their school that they recycle them or positive ,
and i think that's all the time .
oh .
speaking in the okay ,
and they're taking the money that they can't afford to plant those trees .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
i don't know what they get for the tickets , though .
to someone off the what do you get for the tickets , if you bring stuff ?
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it's not bad , yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
i'm in college ,
and i live in a rural ,
and ,
uh-huh .
i ,
and they recycle these ,
and , you know , we recycle two feet and all those stuff that kind of stuff .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
that's really good .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and then when our grandchildren ,
whenever our bins are all filled up , we take them and turn them in ,
uh-huh .
for the japanese ,
and who wrote you what do you want ?
yeah ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
well , we have the time for us , the population would be able , you know .
like we have access to a microwave and an airline if we want to cook things ,
and then we buy , like , cooking equipment and stuff .
uh-huh .
or we play games , like i recycle him .
we buy board games .
uh-huh .
we vote on it ,
and whatever the witnesses would have , because that's what we buy .
and , uh , i lived in nineteen york ,
uh-huh .
and we were just , um , not that same this was a problem , that we would need to recycle .
yeah .
of course , you just threw it away .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
i had my school do it ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
it was just this big project ,
she didn't want to get into that .
and ,
and , uh just never got to get it .
yeah .
you know about that ?
no .
a little boy that had died of disappointing , i think ,
and , uh ,
oh .
and his mother is expecting this on .
uh-huh .
and you can get the information to set up it , you know and join ,
you don't have to carry it as a group or anything , i don't guess .
uh-huh .
and you could start your own account .
get a button ,
is that what this is required ,
what you're ,
do you all have bible up there ?
no .
no .
huh-uh .
that's a department store .
oh .
uh-huh .
kind of like k j stores if we have a little better than what k v , i think .
oh .
i would like ,
let's start up a cart .
no .
right .
no .
uh-huh .
no ,
huh-uh .
we have to take it to a recycling place .
huh .
now in some of the rooms got me , they're already picking up the newspapers .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and you have to pull out all the afternoons ,
and you have to fill them up with it .
oh .
and ,
and , uh , like in the backyard , they've got them from the limit and put them down .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
because my brother-in-law lives in minnesota ,
yeah .
and you fill them up and put them out with your other trash ,
and they pick them up .
uh-huh .
do you all have to banks ?
uh-huh .
no ?
no .
in i know ,
a big old trip ,
and you just catch your cans off the window ,
and your husband , you know , every once in a while , for a while , for our test is going for .
and if you keep saving it until the light goes off .
oh my gosh .
and you get cash .
uh-huh .
and i went to some of his wife ,
and ,
um , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i don't know .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
and ,
it's like a halfway program ,
and the f- , the aluminum ones from the refrigerator because we have it on a concert .
and , uh , then they , uh , little cans ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
no .
uh-huh .
before , they didn't .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
but , uh , i don't know ,
they described it in the newspaper if you wanted to get into it .
uh-huh .
i don't know .
i'm trying
i ,
i just can't recycle everything .
yeah ,
yeah
i'm not that talking .
yeah .
i ,
and that's all the only time i know about .
me , too .
if they would .
and , uh , i think we're going to say our grocery store .
oh really ?
yeah ,
they're taking those up .
you can take them to the stores you know .
uh-huh .
and i think they ,
do you have those up there ?
we have , but , not a complete problem .
i ,
they're taking our milk cartons and our plastic bottles there , too .
oh .
None
they ,
that's pretty good isn't it .
you guys are getting into it more than we are .
it sounds like it ,
you'd think you would be .
uh-huh .
huh-uh ,
uh-huh .
so ,
yeah .
you can like ,
if you have black bags can you take them and use them and get rid of the money .
you mean where you do your own family .
yeah .
yeah ,
yeah .
huh .
and ,
i'm not that european
but , uh ,
i went to europe , nineteen eighty-four .
uh-huh .
and , uh , you know , the first time .
it's like they would go almost every day to the store .
uh-huh .
and they had their little bags back then , and pour it up and then ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
that's why .
they couldn't put anything in it hardly .
i ,
they ,
and whatnot ,
i'm a finance major .
and , well , i don't know how i did .
i went into teaching
here in texas it's a real mess right now .
and ,
oh definitely .
there's no .
let's see ,
we've had the rock ,
we've run out of money .
we've gotten the money .
right ?
yeah .
uh-huh .
right ?
and ,
and ,
what do you think the witnesses will be ?
i think they're maybe going to give us a state income tax .
do you have one ?
yeah
i'm not looking forward to it ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
oh yeah ,
we've had one as long as i can remember
uh-huh .
yeah
and , uh ,
that's ,
doesn't seem like it to work take it away from it by something .
but ,
i know we're not using it so far .
uh-huh .
yeah .
we have too many noise in some of those big cities .
uh-huh .
uh , other than that , because of the kids , you know , i'll be able to talk about it .
uh-huh .
me , either .
anything else ?
no .
yeah .
what do they think about bob ?
what do we think about them ?
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
have you thought about that ?
no ,
i never really thought about it
what you think about eight .
uh-huh .
oh really .
i would hope so ,
uh-huh .
i don't know ,
i really don't know anyone from texas , or whatever .
no .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
i think i have too been to pennsylvania .
whereabouts ?
yeah .
yeah ,
uh-huh
we went up there . now that i think about it . in a long time of our trips off we take on .
oh , well ,
alright .
child in what are you saying , huh ?
bye-bye .
oh .
child in is what you say it is , in advance , in israel , in israel .
on see she's got this little girl from israel in her particular and that she's done .
oh .
so she's into this .
uh-huh .
huh-uh .
you know we've had a lot of the elderly people
colorado springs .
and ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
and ,
did you hit one .
yeah .
i just hit one then .
all right .
they ,
the savings and loan processing .
it ,
and , uh ,
this is going to be fun .
are you rather employed or something ?
and , uh , all kinds of things like that ,
okay ,
i , i'm a , i'm a student
uh-huh .
i do have some innocent effects , and ,
uh-huh .
i , i think that , the other thing is ,
to answer that one before we get to our subject , you know , i always get a kick out of those who take for all the military express that was all for the war for the military that was for war and how it was though when it comes to the budget they say the future is paying the drugs
uh-huh .
and ,
i get a kick out of that .
but ,
you first .
so ,
yeah .
and , uh , i don't think they have any problem with it .
and whatnot ,
uh-huh .
and ,
yeah .
i agree with you .
i think it had something to do with ,
i , uh , i guess , uh , i was just kind of scary .
yeah .
i was talking to someone ,
i can't remember who it was ,
yeah ,
and , uh , that was the kids from ,
he deserves some money
and the banks were calling and just looking for people to give their money away .
they just got totally attention away with buying the property and spending the same ,
and , uh ,
there , there should be thousands of people in there as far as well as i'm concerned .
i ,
not just a couple of weeks .
yeah ,
right .
you know ,
and , um pictures of ,
well that's what i have a living in the house .
uh-huh .
and ,
much less for that criminals should be .
it may have started with wolves too .
i noticed that teaches in nice i've found right
and that was property
and , uh , they had a lot of money there ,
and then some of these big , these things that gets into the ,
even here , who said , the cowboys had a lot of , their property in florida .
this was several years ago
and , uh ,
yeah .
not all of it ,
i don't know how much he lost ,
uh-huh .
and ,
yeah .
and , uh just never , we are at all our time with them .
yeah .
it ,
everyone from somebody else it was .
right .
and ,
yeah .
i ,
as far as being a democrat or a democrat , i think no could dress for anybody who was concerned .
uh-huh .
you spend your way to solve
and when you go up the bank without any statistical , i thought , well , that was the philosophy , you know .
just keep spending place are lower ,
and ,
and ,
i ,
and ,
in fact , in theory , a healthy budget has a lot of spending going on .
right ,
no doubt ,
no doubt .
and , if people are making money , you can spend money ,
and it'll give them .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , i , i agree with that ,
yeah .
and ,
uh-huh .
and the problem with is that the people at the top of the kids are hired into the things .
yeah .
and , for what they would do
yeah .
yeah .
we , as americans weren't not anything .
it was all directions .
yeah .
and ,
we agree too many ,
i ,
yeah .
and , uh ,
i , you know , you can't say that was right .
and , uh ,
i ,
no doubt would say that we can spend our way with lawn care .
right .
remember all we're doing is pure to each other .
and ,
yeah .
i ,
and , i do have a lot of differences in the , the american people and the economy and everything else .
and , i feel bad when i see the , even at here , i guess at the ,
and i think that the ,
it , it still ,
uh-huh .
it is a life and death penalty ,
right .
with , with , the japanese are .
i know ,
and , uh , i think ,
of course i'm in town ,
and i work with a lot of kids ,
and ,
and they say that , well , i guess i'm pretty good
yeah .
uh-huh .
right .
right .
and , uh ,
yeah ,
and ,
you don't sound like a ken , jim .
what ?
you don't sound like a minivan .
what , what does a sound like to do ?
uh-huh .
yeah .
they wouldn't even talk about probably some of the things we're talking about now .
they ,
i guess i'm dealing with too many texas players here .
i don't know really .
and they ,
i'm being a , a suburb of i , i'm not my mind to come out , you know .
and i think ,
yeah .
the demand is pure .
yeah .
and , uh , i think that are , though ,
and there's so much good .
no
that's not good
i ,
no ,
right ,
uh-huh .
and they said , you know , your kids are .
yeah .
i know a few people ,
no ,
uh-huh .
and ,
what ,
are you in a tech ,
like do you do anything or work again ?
and , uh ,
no ,
no .
i ,
government improvement control is my own now .
uh-huh .
oh , okay ,
uh-huh .
right now i'm just trying to solve what i'd wear .
yeah .
times are bad .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , the national level of those ,
and ,
and ,
i'm calling you from work .
i'm , i'm , uh , computer and nights and stuff .
i'm , i'm one of the manager being home ,
there's three of us to cover in dallas else
and just just started and problems and , uh , all , all nights and weekends .
that's my ,
i only get one weekend off a month right now .
i call it my recession job .
it's ,
uh-huh .
i mean there is no language is going on work going on .
they turned all up here off .
yeah .
they told everybody they could not work .
yeah .
i don't care what the jobs are , you will not work .
yeah ,
it , it ,
and , and , as far as our , you know , our conversation goes , i would be really interested to know how much of t v benefits are so close to ,
uh-uh ?
the recession isn't .
uh-huh .
there was one point i was going to make a kid .
i think the last i heard ,
and , uh , i don't know how i'm not as far as ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i figure well , if they want that it's going to cost us another year , it's got to be able to spend as much because no one board
and ,
and they really look forward to it ,
yeah .
it's amazing really .
it's amazing that ,
to realize that a lot of people out there are trying to learn on their home system .
and ,
i know what you mean .
and one of our name ,
course your value of homes up there are pretty good .
uh-huh .
yeah .
no .
and ,
our economy in colorado springs little room even .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
right .
it , it ,
i die every time like general motors magazines ,
they , they lost their own home
and , uh , i don't know if you noticed , you know , i'll probably pay attention to the grocery stores , you know ,
and they were going to have big , uh ,
and , uh ,
yeah ,
it's frightening .
and ,
gosh .
bell didn't get it .
ye- ,
and , uh , do they have some of that in , in general ,
and that's the , the only thing that i ,
they were bothered it that was dead or t i , .
uh-huh .
and , oh , it was a lot .
one that bell is in the same
and two , that was t i doing the same for them .
huh .
and , uh , they , they have that it was t v , i mean , t v and all of a sudden , got it ,
they're forced .
have , she ,
doesn't need the money .
something ,
uh-huh .
i don't know if t i has lost as much as everybody else ,
and our backyard and l m and things like science or lost , which seems like you know .
and you realize it ,
there you go .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and ,
uh-huh .
now my personal opinion ,
i don't know .
and they said , uh , it seems like that ,
yeah .
they just meet the human rights to , to just cover about just , everybody , and i don't think those guilty of capital punishment should be hired to spend a few years in jail and be turned on pattern .
uh-huh .
it's just not right .
i think i agree with that very much .
i ,
do you ,
and therefore , i think should be able to find yourself .
do you think a lot of people , when they are listening to a trial , put them in a job like that and say , i would never do something like that ,
and ,
yes ,
very possibly .
uh-huh .
so ,
i never have either .
i've never done it myself until ,
i wish i could have .
is there a reason why you have ,
i've just never been called up .
uh-huh .
my husband works as a police man ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
i , uh , i guess we were from an hour that ,
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
so ,
not that i know of .
somebody told me the other day that there is , what they call a six jury man ,
and , uh , i don't know ,
and , uh , if i guess ,
uh-huh
and , uh , i haven't been watching it .
i never had either ,
but , uh , i don't know ,
another question was , when they become a case , the jury should be on their decision ,
and that wasn't sure they find out of how much it should be unanimous or not .
and they said , i guess there , i suppose it has to be ,
exactly .
that would mean they all have to decide one way or the other one .
is it plain or something .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , and it was the poor to get a bit of a .
yeah ,
yeah .
and there ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
bring some of these things out .
yes .
uh-huh .
we can't flip the fact that there are other people that do get involved in jury .
e- , apparently there are .
i , i , i think ,
uh-huh .
since my husband worked as a policeman , i can't believe there are very many people that come to trial that have , are not guilty of something some part of whatever they're accused of .
uh-huh .
i have , i still have a little bit of a problem with that .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and you just might start doing it .
uh-huh .
and , uh , out here in the last , a , a great , of vietnam .
it was just when , nine years , it was finally , uh , taken care of .
uh-huh .
we had ,
oh .
yeah .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
they still found him guilty ?
they found him guilty .
when people said he was at work ?
and say he had a , this game last year , this called awhile .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
yeah .
but after nine years ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
exactly .
uh-huh .
now that just was not fair .
no ,
huh-uh .
None
yeah ,
i guess that's where a lot of the problem workers ,
we're , we ate out all voluntary for the government , that was the ones that are on trial .
yes .
unfortunately , that's what happens .
and , and we can't forget about the one that has been done to , because i guess , they still say our system is the best in the world .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
it's the best one that involves , i guess .
uh-huh .
and unfortunately , we just have to put up with a lot of things ,
and they try to solve them and everything ,
i , uh , i don't know ,
the court phase ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
i think they've lost some of things that are very important to our country .
and maybe it ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
and , uh ,
no ,
well , i think if i ever did somebody to , uh , burning a victim , i'd , i'd try to kill them , i would .
that bad , huh .
i wouldn't like it ,
uh-huh .
and stuff ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i served , i was in the service i was in the service and , and , uh , i saw what the red in the pan .
yeah ,
and whatnot ,
it's important in so many of our lives .
uh-huh .
i , uh , i think , if they don't like , they don't like what our justice comes for , they're trying to go some place .
yeah ,
see what they ,
there's nobody holding them here .
see how they'd like it under another car .
right .
they'd soon be back ,
i'm sure .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and , uh , we seem to be the same opinions of it .
uh-huh .
i hope they get something out of this .
yeah ,
i don't know about the judge making the decision , if that's ,
uh-huh .
oh writes it .
uh-huh .
and there's some of the , the other hand ,
uh-huh .
make a cop ?
yes .
do they sometimes make a deposit ?
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yes .
that's what i was thinking they , they do sometimes .
i don't know if that's a regular store or what .
i , uh , i think that they have ,
uh-huh .
and they ,
and they have .
twenty years or something .
yeah .
yes .
uh-huh .
of course , now , the jury may not be completely aware of all the time of a sentence .
uh-huh .
they may not know that if you give him twenty years he can get out in five .
well maybe the , a lot of people think that , our kids are getting away for a long time ,
uh-huh .
a lot of times when they come up for parole , they're supposed to be .
uh-huh .
it depends on you know , what they're , what they'd been guilty of , and a lot of different things , i guess .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
i ,
uh-huh .
a lot carried through the most grade they have to do .
uh-huh .
yes .
they just go out and their minds are a lot of money .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
well there ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i always thought there was , there was the wrong ,
it seems sometimes that somebody like who is a cop of a variety of his car starting to be caught your life sentence than somebody else .
uh-huh .
it seemed like there , sometimes there's not a good ,
the balance isn't right .
it doesn't make sense .
yeah ,
very true .
and , well again , there is that way to offer , because it's not going to be old or something .
uh-huh .
or fry they probably .
uh-huh ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
right .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
stop if it can we , if we ever get a chance .
sure enough .
None
yeah .
uh-huh .
and i hope you have a real good day and then .
uh-huh .
i hope not .
take care now .
you , too .
bye .
bye-bye .
okay .
where , where are you from ?
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
well ,
i was just curious .
that's ,
yes ,
yes ,
that's true .
have you ,
i've talked ,
too ?
uh-huh .
people from virginia and , and all over the country .
yeah .
i talked to the professor ,
and ,
and he said , he said , i think i'm going to think the guy that , actually , uh , gave it to all my students .
yeah .
go ,
uh-huh .
ahead ,
you , you first , ]
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
food .
what type of foods do you cook ?
and what you would like , uh , cook in , uh , let's see , if you were giving a dinner party ?
and ,
and , uh ,
and i'll be , the only thing that i like to do in , um , uh , cooking for people .
and ,
yeah .
we have them too ,
and that , i think they're going to , which is the best , uh , that i think .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
the man always gets that chore ,
i ,
have to make it perfect .
and , uh ,
it's fairly easy and fast .
uh-huh .
and they ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i do cook ,
but ,
i'm mostly the easy penalty .
yes .
and , uh , the only and the , uh , the transmission .
yeah .
uh-huh .
so to speak ,
and ,
what kind of show were you seen that she did ?
yeah .
and , uh , the only year we have , meals .
we were very poor .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
she would throw things together and leaving and all that .
and , uh , i think they would like to go to one day .
and ,
and my wife ,
huh .
of course , near dallas i can take this , which i should be
i ,
no .
sounds interesting , no .
yeah .
yeah ,
that's great .
yeah .
yeah ,
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and they know , you know , nothing like your , your foot , where you have to do a whole bunch of work .
yeah .
and stuff , that ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
you get it ready ,
you have to do a lot of work , i agree , and buy the special stuff .
uh-huh .
right .
yeah .
my husband , i guess ,
and , uh ,
yeah ,
yeah .
i know , i think , you do a lot of work ,
but ,
right .
because they are , well , everything went out and just , just so forth .
right .
and they said , you know , my mother used to be an hour rice .
uh-huh ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
and ,
and ,
yeah .
right .
oh yeah ,
you'd get the penalty of it , yeah .
yeah .
and ,
and that's something that , i would really like to , to try to be , and find the recipe for .
yeah .
uh-huh ,
yes .
because you can , you can put it on top of the hole , and do this ,
and ,
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
and that was , you know ,
uh-huh .
and that's , uh , what i thought about was , that was rice or something .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we probably ought to try this .
yeah .
i guess it gets better and better as we remember it ,
that's true .
uh-huh .
that's true .
and , uh , we don't have to do that , uh ,
uh-huh .
we're probably going to lose them
and ,
uh-huh .
since we're trying to make everything so forth ,
uh-huh .
right ,
right .
and , uh ,
you talked about dishes , there are so interesting times at the t v .
and something , uh ,
my wife's from texas ,
uh-huh .
and ,
and , uh , we have to be my mother's house for christmas for , you know , to have a meal .
uh-huh .
and ,
we were just married that very year ,
and , uh , oh , i'm looking forward to a little bit of a computer .
i said , maryland ?
i said , we don't have bible at christmas
oh .
i said , we only have turkey on them .
i said , we're going to have a jury .
uh-huh .
she said , what ?
yeah ?
i said , yeah .
i said , no , is only funded for those .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , that was a lot of the , in the east ,
uh-huh .
right ,
right .
a- ,
and , and that's one thing ,
that's another reason , i guess we could talk about .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i , i'd like to try that too .
yeah .
yeah .
so ,
and , uh , what they have , this is presented to be ,
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i saw them .
they ,
that's good .
have you seen , have you had any of those ?
no ,
i , i think , uh , i know about it .
my wife i think she's
i ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i mean you cook it in the bag that they send it in .
and ,
and all the trim and everything are all in depth .
and ,
uh-huh .
of that , yeah .
and just like just . because i guess i don't like anybody , like because it's so .
yeah .
but ,
it is absolutely delicious .
and ,
i'll have to ask her about that .
and ,
and said that , we have a friend who goes around , that was ,
i'm trying to think of his name of it .
and they said , i don't know ,
i see a can here , or a box of here going on this morning .
uh-huh .
what is the name of this thing ?
i got a box , box , on it ,
it doesn't say , somebody's homes .
uh , i think that , that , that , that , that ,
and our news that , uh , you know , a truck that comes around .
and , and they said they had something .
uh-huh .
and they say , and , uh , actually , and , uh , all that stuff that ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
i , uh ,
yeah .
it was and we tried it .
it was real nice ,
and ,
uh-huh .
we had it for awhile a little bit more .
it was really great .
wow !
uh-huh .
yeah .
and that's , the only that's the worst i have found that i mean , i enjoy .
i would like to try the old recipe of cooking , though ,
and , and things like that , uh , to , to do the different things that we did .
so i would like to put one in the oven , you know , the old little bit when i put it in there and hours for hours , and see ,
and that i don't think in , in my life which , is , uh , fifteen years ago now , we've never done that .
wow .
and , uh , i guess that was a kid ,
uh-huh .
and have the local program . uh , rather than that , we just don't have ,
uh-huh .
right
and , uh ,
in the old days , we had , were the limit ,
and ,
right .
really have it as a main meal .
that's true .
right .
and , i don't think so much , more of becoming more conscious of , uh , cholesterol and , and roll and all those things .
that's an interesting point .
how , how have you changed your , your meals now ?
have you ,
and , that ,
and ,
looking at those things ?
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
parents , that's unusual .
and maybe it , it's a good thing .
and ,
and the new york , uh , we grew up in the , uh , where we grew up in the , south dakota , where you have all the , uh , heating and things and forth ,
and then they said they started to go over to , uh , rice and , uh , no ,
that's amazing .
it's just , it really is .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
and they started doing this , like in the early , or in the middle of seventies .
uh-huh .
and they go to the end of the house , and the , the , the , the , the the news , the , the , the , the water ,
they'd go ,
that they have started .
usually it's the younger people doing it .
yeah .
it's true ,
it's true .
i agree with you .
i ,
they ,
uh-huh .
my , my wife's mother is the only one left ,
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
she has high potatoes .
of course , i ha- , i have too , but not necessarily in the country .
uh-huh .
and ,
and ,
that's right .
her whole life .
and ,
right
and , uh , i think that ,
i'm trying to do something about my husband's trouble in the same time .
uh-huh .
they ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
he's a tremendous worker
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
and , uh , and , uh , take them back and all the things
and the people that , not to eat , you know , ever ,
i think the giants can flip and he did throw away for her .
and ,
wow !
you know , try that sometime .
uh-huh .
my wife says she can't stand it .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i ,
say if i have four kids , not , not for me ,
or maybe if you go to watch four years , i guess i'm just on a couple of cars , and the only one .
wow !
and ,
you , you don't think you miss it .
huh .
in fact , when i , when i make myself for others , if i , i fry them in them , i will almost look around them i can so , take not eat the at all .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
and you don't really miss it .
you get the breaks of the longest ,
i , uh , you know , at all you ,
you don't ,
they're hard .
and have a lot of , a relationship at , at the stadium , or some ,
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
and ,
my kids gone down with dinner .
so , although ,
wow , that's good .
i haven't gotten on the , which , whether it's , are pretty close or something , not that .
so ,
uh-huh .
whether the or your bank ,
okay .
okay .
what can we do about crime ?
i don't know .
the one thing that keeps coming to mind to me is that , they don't have enough money in the future ,
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
that's one thing i guess i could think of that
uh-huh .
yeah .
and , uh , every day , you know , all it's ,
we live in a little small town ,
and ,
and you just can't get away from it matter where you have a living .
yeah .
i mean , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
i'm , i'm from texas ,
and ,
uh-huh .
and whatnot ,
yeah .
and they really don't know what we can do about it .
yeah .
it's rough , because i
yeah .
yeah .
that's the only thing i can think of .
yeah .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
well , you know , about two things , you know , six and seven times
and , uh ,
yeah .
they could be a more complicated population of the judge having having the choice of the way of , like you know , from one month to ten years or something
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
and ,
yeah .
and one things that they're saying , now ,
are you going ,
are you a student
or are you in the work force
or ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
well , that kind of the things that i've done about so much , uh , industry on the united states where has gone up so much .
and , uh , of the weekends , like in vietnam use , um , the rest of the , uh , you know , seem to be getting off because the population kind of waste up .
i ,
yeah .
not only that , a lot of not even had changed in .
you know ,
wow .
what i mean ?
yeah .
a lot of times the girls don't even report it .
yeah ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
but , uh , i guess that they have , uh , you know , any amount of different stuff .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
they say like only one in ten minutes are more .
i believe it .
uh-huh .
that's awful .
uh-huh .
i know some police husbands try to have women that police are going to vote with the wife and this kind of thing .
and maybe it really was still fairly expensive , you know , for people to report it .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
i don't know ,
it seems like something else in terms of crime is certainly going to be involved ,
you know .
and that's like as long as ,
it almost makes me feel , in a way , like making them just lower out of the money all of it and have not , you know ,
because these kids are saying why i should go to high school
and so i can go out and work at least , um , you know , for four dollars or an hour or whatever , when i can make four hundred dollars a day selling drugs .
yeah .
i don't know what the solution to that is .
having more drug return around then .
jeez , i don't know .
and see , you see now , i would say that that's a big bit up here for the future help even this year .
yeah .
i know a lot of people that are that in .
and not i'm saying they're not bad ,
i , i , i would say that's a big problem with them .
yeah .
because it ends up ,
even if it's just kind of like this drug testing , you're just raised up these big garbage care ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
on drugs ,
yeah .
and take it , you know , making the babies and they were , you know , to get some interested .
uh-huh .
gosh , horrible stuff like that .
one of the things they're doing is , they're the media are always having these people who are going to compare to .
uh-huh .
they said , uh , some of the cosby , show games because of this area , every ten thousand miles in the milk pump are required to meet ,
and their clients are removed from there .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
i mean the kids are the victim , it seems like a lot of times the women are because they're concerned .
and ,
i don't think the government trying to contribute with it . *[[ says ,
no , i don't either .
yeah .
and whatnot ,
they ,
is there anything else you would want to ,
no .
okay .
i can't say that i , i just know it's really that bad in some areas
and ,
i ,
yeah .
i don't , i don't know what they can do .
yeah ,
yeah .
it's frustrating .
uh-huh .
i ,
okay .
i ,
it was nice talking to you .
thanks for talking .
have a good day .
you too .
bye .
bye , bye .
and basically , i'm at home
uh-huh .
and ,
i mean my husband's great .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's wonderful ,
yeah .
you know ,
and , uh , and so forth about , uh ,
uh-huh
around there , huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah ,
i passed the fifty .
i'm just a spring chicken , i guess
uh-huh .
i ,
yeah .
um
uh-huh .
i think i'm ready
okay
okay .
and they want to start off ?
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
since i am in the forty age , i'm a freshman there and also ,
and , uh , my mother's generation to a very basic , very well , uh , it's been a big change .
very much , yeah ,
yeah .
very much ,
and , i think they would have to be able to do that .
yes .
and , uh , we were in the beginning of the ground , uh , the ground of the sixties ,
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
and ,
it , uh ,
i think all things get started doing that sometimes in those .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , to get that in debt , i think it got a little bit and more off the track in several areas ,
uh-huh .
so i really have a decision that have a background to be able to , human factors , to be human and what it's like and have feelings and have
and it's okay .
and that , uh , i think on the other hand , i don't know that many people have changed that much .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
i hadn't thought much about that ,
but , uh ,
that ,
and they think , we are trying to do that .
uh-huh .
some of them .
yeah .
no .
and , uh , help them out
no .
and , uh , what's the changing ones , though , is the biggest situation ,
uh-huh .
very much .
where both team , it has to be a team now ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and they both have to work and they have to raise the children ,
uh-huh .
if we're going to have any kind of future at all ,
uh-huh .
and , and that , i think has been the problem of the last ten years .
uh-huh .
and you know , the problem ,
i don't know ,
the , the principal ,
uh-huh .
so ,
and they wanted to abuse of men ,
they wanted to be like men ,
uh-huh .
and that's wrong .
yeah .
i think they finally discovered that they don't want to be like men ,
not ,
no ,
they , they hurt us a little bit in that way .
absolutely ,
and ,
and they sort of the threw me out , you know , ten years ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i got to get some for all my men friends ,
it says , let us do the best , the women have more important to do
there you go
there's a lot of truth in that .
right .
yeah .
uh-huh .
i , uh , i think we have both parents and have elderly , they allow to offer , you know , we should ,
we were made differently ,
that's right .
however you come to that area ,
we were saying , e- , made it on
and there is great ,
uh-huh .
in that ,
and , uh , you know , we should have that respect in each other
None
yes ,
it shouldn't be twenty-nine .
right .
yeah ,
yeah .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
yeah .
yeah .
someone said that i think and you can really recommend the other person ,
i mean you know , you know , we're not saying , what a mystery are you , you know .
depends ,
and that's kind of a problem with , any other things .
yeah .
you know .
yeah .
yeah
i , uh , i don't know ,
i guess we've gotten more of a ,
uh-huh .
in , in terms of that , i think we've got more of a sense of learning to do each other and our ,
and ,
i ,
i think now when both are working they have a more , a lot of a chance of working together because they're starting out that way .
yeah ,
and that's , that's a very good way to do ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
right .
yeah .
right .
twenty years later .
yeah .
they ,
because you get set in your ways
i ,
you do .
really hard because , to really , to get help .
yeah .
and there's some , you know , the other day we play .
are , are you married ?
yes ,
uh-huh .
our ,
do you have children ?
uh-huh .
they're
uh-huh .
they're all grown on their own and
None
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
how did you do ?
uh-huh .
i mean , i think ,
yeah .
how did ,
how ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
last week was her first baby .
yeah .
yeah .
and , i tell you what they were .
i don't know what i would do without my friends having all these time .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i just love the babies and , and since i'm sort of in a medical situation where i can't do that ,
yeah .
have you been that way long ?
just eight years ,
just eight years .
just the most important of my life that you know ,
that's , that's a long eight years , though .
yeah ,
it has been .
uh-huh .
and , uh , so that , have been great , major ,
uh-huh .
but , that's another thing .
uh-huh .
but , you know , my husband has really been , really interested in the backyard ,
that makes a big difference .
i mean i , i can see for a better life .
uh-huh .
i mean that it's the way this is to be ,
uh-huh .
this is the best way ,
uh-huh .
i could possibly do it
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
yes .
of thing
i ,
uh-huh .
and , and the way you are also in having , though .
and ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
that's true .
i mean , boy ,
i mean i , i would have to be so much ,
i had so much to lay up with something
and , uh , that the place to be , you know ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
and that , uh , yeah , that was a major change ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
the best you can , yeah .
or , but ,
uh-huh .
i think the future of this whole thing is going to be the way with the day care of the country .
i ,
yeah ,
that's the only thing i worry about is the , the greatest deficit and love .
that ,
uh-huh .
i think ,
a lot .
yeah .
uh-huh .
i think ,
i do , too .
and the way , i think ,
now some , some women can , do with both .
they're very protective of working
and , and ,
yeah ,
or i wish they are so many ,
i , i wish they weren't going in general for instance ,
uh-huh .
because it's so dangerous .
uh-huh .
it's dangerous for the woman , too , to think that we can do that
and then when she goes to , you know , the penalty of that is ,
uh-huh .
you know , her life sort of falls on college
yeah .
and she's ,
so many have to work to make a go of it , it seems like ,
absolutely .
or they say they do ,
and ,
it's not as much of a democracy as not to work it was for a while there .
and , you know , i think that's , that's really good i think , on it part of the country you're in .
uh-huh .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
they ,
a big guy's ,
yeah .
sort of thing ,
yeah .
and you know ,
you mean it's causing it ?
and they said , you know ,
yeah .
much less .
and , and that , i think that , uh , families have a family budget of these problems ,
yeah .
with the good old boys ,
right .
here in texas sort of thing ,
right .
making career works
i ,
right .
and they know , you know , in terms of women come home and being for their actions , uh , it's just like the way it , it has been for years .
uh-huh .
and then , you know , since the days of the house , around here .
yeah ,
yeah .
that's the whole role ,
yes .
and it was , it's like her to work , uh , you know , watch her be selective , i think ,
yeah .
yeah .
yeah ,
yeah .
and ,
and see the , a little bit on the part of the , you know , what has a little boys
and , and she has an expert out , which is a lot of college working for her
they ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
all the time .
oh yeah ,
and ,
uh-huh .
with the one and , and wish she could spend more time with her kids
and the other hand she would think we could get out of colorado ,
right .
for a while
yeah ,
get some peace and quiet .
yeah ,
they're both different people , too .
yeah ,
definitely ,
uh-huh .
that's , that's where the biggest trouble .
yeah .
some people , some people can have and , both do not , uh ,
and that's ,
and others can't .
that's true .
that's so true .
how , how did your daughter do it ?
and they say , i have one that worked out of town .
she has two little boys .
uh-huh .
and ,
yeah .
yeah .
right .
they ,
all right ,
what type of things would you fix if you're having anything else ?
and whatnot ,
and , uh , it's just a really easy to do .
it's pretty much held in things and got out .
uh-huh .
and i like that .
and , uh , the only thing you have to do is cook the newspaper that goes in , in it
and then i , you're supposed to do chicken ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
and , um ,
you dump the chicken
uh-huh .
now are the ones that you have to pull all that off ,
uh-huh .
None
oh
uh-huh .
and , um , and it was really nice ,
and you mix it all up with , um ,
there's a little bitty character that you have it in a lot of cleaning ,
but ,
uh-huh .
and ,
you serve it cold ?
uh-huh .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that sounds good .
yeah ,
it has to sit in the library over the night ,
yeah .
um , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and i like that one .
yeah .
usually when we do we something do really simple , because i like to visit with my company ,
yeah .
and not be around the kitchen in the ,
None
exactly .
a lot of times , we'll try
uh-huh .
and we just bought a door and never served in one of those like the same labor of cooking ,
uh-huh .
and put it on the ceiling and look everywhere .
uh-huh .
and tha- , it was real good .
you can buy a fairly large piece of them that way
yeah .
yeah ,
yeah
and these days that helps , doesn't it ?
yeah ,
yeah .
yeah .
it really does .
i know what you mean .
i don't usually i just hold on any recipe that's more than five or six thousand dollars to it because i just never know i'll take the time to do it .
now if she's been an easy one .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i do grow a lot .
yeah ,
it seems like most people like twenty-five .
yeah ,
i don't like to do that i- , if it's gone , too hot though .
yeah .
and , um , i don't know ,
i have a real thing about being hot in the , in the summertime .
uh-huh .
i guess .
uh-huh .
yeah .
in your whole house .
yeah ,
i think that's right .
and ,
or when we do , i'm like you like it . i like to be fast and easy .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and something that so we can talk and not have to have to worry about being in the kitchen all the time .
most ,
we don't miss people from work like that they can't afford , uh ,
it's usually friends from church and stuff ,
yeah .
and ,
yeah .
and ,
and everybody else brings something .
that's exactly like us , from our church , we just do it ,
yeah .
oh yeah ,
yeah .
they ,
it's a lot more humid .
well ,
uh-huh .
and ,
huh-uh .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah
w- , i think that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is ,
and , uh ,
and , uh , like she does her own bread and then her own them
and ,
and ,
yeah
i guess ,
do you work ?
no ,
i don't .
do you stay home with kids ?
uh-huh ,
yeah .
yeah .
i , i've been working ,
we're going to have a baby this summer ,
and ,
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
i don't like to come home and stand in the kitchen and spend an hour something and then have to clean it up
and by then it's eight thirty or nine o'clock at night ,
None
yeah .
and i usually start about six and , and , cook and , and say about seven and ten .
yeah .
uh-huh .
eat at six , yeah .
yeah ,
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
and they go ,
i don't like the run in and out in one .
yeah .
and i like to be able to sit down and school after them have been me with the , my husband and that's about an inch
i ,
yeah ,
that's neat .
i think i , that was hysterical in me in my family time at home .
uh-huh .
and , uh , you know , we could learn to talk about things
and , i think that's good .
yeah ,
that really is .
it keeps the family in touch with what's going on with each other .
yeah .
i think ,
right now we eat in front of the t v
uh-huh .
yeah ,
yeah
well that happens to us to do that .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
and their opinions are just past different than the door .
uh-huh ,
to see what's happening .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the , the the news , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the water ,
yeah .
and ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
they're so simple .
uh-huh .
and the kids love to do that .
and , uh , water is that , it's a lot of fun .
yeah .
and ,
yeah .
and ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
they like to eat it ,
and ,
yeah ,
uh ,
oh yeah ,
yeah ,
we like that .
yeah .
that's good that , that's a good way to get kids to eat it too .
yeah .
my son's getting to be a , a real good deal with it
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
sometimes he just liked us
yeah .
yeah ,
i like it ,
i like it a lot .
how old is he ?
he's eleven .
eleven ,
wow ,
uh-huh .
that's good .
yeah ,
so that's ,
do you cook salad , like you cook a day in recycling
or ,
and , uh , not that same ,
mostly during the summer we hit and stuff
i ,
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
because i like
and the people , like it all the summer time .
yeah .
and , uh , then we have a lot of things ,
it has to be fast because they're in the way to school ,
we do like broccoli and stuff like that ,
i ,
and , uh ,
yeah .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i used to do them in the microwave ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
or ,
um .
i've never tried it .
it seemed it , you know .
uh-huh .
if you let them cook too much when he will start a little bit more ,
you can tell if they've gone to long because she will come out a little bit of the baby
and they will be a little harder ,
and i don't like that .
yeah .
uh-huh .
i mean you know , a little bit less and then it had a check with , like a over the top .
oh .
and let it stuff .
uh-huh .
and then , and then it stir up .
huh .
yeah ,
an , and that turns out pretty good .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and ,
it's really funny ,
yeah .
yeah
you know ,
and yet ,
None
yeah .
anyway .
we had ,
my grandmother used to do that with us to keep them like dishes .
everybody would say we don't like them , we won't eat them ,
uh-huh .
yeah
and then we'd go to , uh , this is really good .
okay .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
None
right ,
that it , that it ,
i ,
exactly .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
i mean it's , i don't know how much about it .
i ,
save you off of power , it doesn't ?
yes ,
yes ,
some of them , some of them do
and some of them don't ,
uh-huh .
i was trying to remember back .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and ,
i didn't think they were either .
i thought the sentencing was done by the judge .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and , uh , i guess ,
changes .
uh-huh .
or whatever i don't know whether it's been or whether or the soviet union , some movie that keeps saying that , that , that , uh , that , uh , as part of the trial by the trial that had to be the sentencing or , or whatever .
i ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
and ,
yeah ,
yeah .
and , uh ,
and some of the way in terms of with the , the jury , i guess , i guess , i guess , i would be a little more of that kind of a change in , in the trial system .
exactly .
exactly .
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
exactly .
they ,
uh-huh ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah ,
whatever .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and not going to listen to the facts and , and maybe their way into , uh , getting the past time getting to that .
but , uh , i think there's a lot of fun things .
and ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
and western communities sewing for a lot of people in the sixties to work and then to make the jury and they have to pay for whatever if they have to do that .
yeah .
i know companies have to pay for these people to be off from work . or at least give them the time off the work .
and say , it's ,
i think it's with pay .
if i remember , someone duty is like , with our children .
i ,
and it's not ,
and , and then ,
i ,
i'd ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
paid , right .
uh-huh .
and whatnot ,
uh-huh .
some that may decide not to .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
and , i don't know if they need to be able to the u s , too .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yes .
it's only getting worse than it was .
exactly .
they ,
and there's , some of the reasons that they can do that
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
that ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , state of them ,
uh-huh .
so , uh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right .
so ,
right .
and the only other that i can think of is , uh , looking at where they're spending the money and not so much as well , saying , we're spending too much in that area as far as what is paying them .
yep .
uh-huh .
right .
and ,
yeah .
i mean you can go to hawaii and buy them for , uh , eight dollars or i think it's two or six years ago for us ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
definitely i think that there's probably a lot of waste in plano and all research in the military part .
sure ,
sure .
None
uh-huh .
i mean you , uh , people who were at the government who , you know , using the amount of problems of research money to , uh , for the president to buy homes out or whatever it was .
uh-huh .
than we think .
sure .
and ,
sure .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it sure is .
uh-huh .
i think there was something with the government went on that region on two days
and , uh ,
i , uh , you know , they were paid for this ,
and ,
uh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
the rest of them taking these team and doing the money for her and stuff .
right .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
None
and that's something that the way i would have to do that .
uh-huh .
so that , i think that , uh , talk about a lot of fun and not think that's really that i really think that the problem .
sure .
uh-huh .
and when you look at something like the gulf war it would cost us how much knows how you know . at a , a million dollars ,
a pop for los angeles .
exactly .
and ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right .
but , uh , that , uh , they didn't want to do it anymore .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
right .
okay ,
uh-huh .
okay
and have a good evening .
all right .
you too .
uh-huh ,
thanks .
bye-bye .
bye now .
okay .
what kind of pet do you have , been saying ?
and that's the way they have to do it .
i have children
uh-huh .
i have little children .
both of my kids are under two now right now we don't have a choice ,
uh-huh .
have you ?
uh-huh .
and , uh , what do you have ?
and , uh , we had a dog before we moved here .
and , uh , we couldn't bring them in a while .
we came from colorado ,
and ,
oh .
okay ,
i've ,
and ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , we had a , a brick system that we have ,
and ,
and , uh ,
and before that we had all ,
and , i think my husband wants to be married ,
and ,
and , uh , i think that , uh , we don't know how to be able to go down to a , you know , another dog .
and we have a lot of very lucky i know , that's kind of a baby .
uh-huh .
and , uh , like you know ,
we like them around .
we have grandchildren that run through
and they think we should have a dog ,
and that's because they have a great deal ,
huh .
yes .
they're just huge
definitely .
uh-huh .
and ,
i just think it's nice to have around .
we had a cat that had no .
so many that did i get from now that will not be able to teach or something .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yes .
and , uh , i don't know ,
that experience was awful
yes ,
i have never wanted to ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
to baby very what you doing ?
and , uh , huh
and , uh , of course , it doesn't know it .
he's still out on maryland .
oh .
i , uh , you know , i think that we can't have to spend a time next year and just had her , have her , you know .
and , uh ,
yes .
and , uh , a lot of times now when you buy them from the t v s or a p c or whatever , their mailing rules .
yes ,
yes .
None
which i think is a good thing .
it just breaks my heart to see these two inches old little bit the carpet looking for them
i ,
you know .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and , and when my mother went with us , uh , the cat was really motivated
and , and he was kind of wild .
our , our daughter found her and brought her to us ,
and , uh , that went back and walked in the front of her and my wife and uncle up and beat up in her .
oh .
and he was the only one that was , you know , could really hold him , you know , because he was really casual .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
and , oh yeah ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
and , uh ,
he's ,
you know , before the dog died , we have a good seat door and the dog i could teach my side ,
and , uh , the cat would be working on the bible ,
uh-huh .
my husband that's one thing he was has our cat used to sleep with us .
uh-huh .
our dog wasn't interested in even coming in our room ,
yeah ,
and , uh ,
did he ?
uh-huh .
he just thought that they come up ,
uh-huh .
and also put ryan on the tape the back over his writing and all that he said .
uh-huh .
i think it would probably be a dog ,
and ,
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
i think that's one of the reasons they ,
because i said it's , our old was a christian .
and , oh he was going to be a ,
and say , i guess i have just been in the house ,
and that's the one of the things that both of us are not willing to start doing with it , you know .
uh-huh .
and ,
and , uh , and it was a new car
and , you know , it depends , just really , you know , upset me in the summer .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
my husband's grandparents have a dog
uh ,
it needs to be put to sleep
yeah ,
and , uh , we really have a very few of family to see that .
uh-huh .
oh
and my daughter is just nine months old and then she was on the carpet
uh-huh .
and , uh , the smell and i mean it's really awful
and , that's one of the worst thing ,
you know you know , i guess you'll just do anything about your mind for them if you have enough
yes ,
you will .
you will .
and , you know , we were trying to decide to , you know , about him to sleep .
uh-huh .
and , uh , the roof was just taken away from us which made it a whole lot easier . you know ,
and , and then that goes through that because our , our kids are almost like our kids in some ways , you know ,
uh-huh .
and , and you just put them out when they really get it as far as , you know , would you .
and ,
little thing .
be quiet ,
be quiet .
and , uh ,
helping in plano , texas . how are you doing today ?
hi ,
fine ,
i'm envious .
how are you ?
great , well .
i'm in plano also
you're in plano also , huh ?
yes ,
we're not too long distance today .
uh-huh .
i was just talking to someone the other day from pennsylvania .
uh-huh .
utah , i've had a couple of ,
but , that was a good time .
really ?
yeah .
all right .
uh-huh .
good to hear .
learned about their basketball team
which one ?
uh , yeah .
and ,
yeah .
the utah built .
yeah .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
that's what i heard .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and , you know , having the first time or something like that .
i am .
good .
yeah .
okay .
what was your name again ?
uh-uh .
right .
matter , that's right ,
and i'm wondering .
right .
just a moment
right .
okay , then , i guess the , the subject is benefits in the job than other than it .
uh-huh .
what , uh what do you feel are important to you or other people as , as much as ?
and maybe a little different than a little other people because i don't have benefits with my job .
uh-huh .
i'm a nurse
oh
and i work ,
uh-huh .
right .
i guess so that i have no benefits for drug testing is going for ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
and ,
right .
to , to instance for some of the benefits .
uh-huh .
oh .
yeah ,
it's cheaper for me to buy insurance by the month to work than someplace else .
yes .
and then i have my ability .
i can work seven days in a row and a hundred dollars off or whatever i want to do .
and stuff , that that's an excellent thing ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
most people prefer the dress of a hundred to five ,
yeah .
and weekends off and letting that their insurance is paid and their own ,
right .
uh-huh .
right ,
i mean that's something that i don't have a good job .
uh-huh .
i do belong to a , a large corporation
or my , that , i'm guilty with a little
and , uh ,
right .
i think through our health insurance that i can get better than a , like a group on society as opposed to and come out and big education for an hour to because i had to do that at one time when i wasn't able to see the time at home
and that got to be so much ,
yeah .
so i know , the only one of the benefits i have , uh , the problem is , uh , group of the government .
right ,
and especially if you have a family .
yes .
then i think it makes a big difference .
yes ,
and , that's one thing i have a lot of problems .
yeah .
if i didn't have a family , i don't think i would have , as a , as a male or , as a matter of the individual , in this point ,
well ,
right .
i don't think i would go through that area .
one other benefit that you mentioned is the best car drive
and ,
uh-huh .
right .
and , uh , make it a lot of basic changes in that .
could you change that as you just did it
uh-huh .
and basically ,
so ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
so ,
and ,
i , uh , when you have a lot of credit cards ,
and that's , that's good .
yeah .
and , uh , what other things do you think are important ?
uh-huh .
retirement , that kind of thing which i don't much about all of stuff
yeah ,
yeah ,
that's true .
i just prefer to worry about today ,
probably not a practical thing
but ,
None
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
and , uh , with our , in the organization , we have a lot of old things
right .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
and some of the t v shows to like to watch , are so much , uh , evening
and , uh , like a couple of years looking forward to , to the past year or something .
i usually watch those same programs out .
right .
and they say , i like to watch the news .
yeah .
and then , and then the first day ,
and i don't think i ever watch anything else .
uh-huh .
i mean , i have a few , you know , favorite shows that i don't like to do .
uh-huh .
l a law is one of them .
uh-huh .
although this is , the next to have more than to miss at least .
yeah .
with the new orleans and everything .
yeah ,
it's hard to follow .
right ,
and , uh , i think that they have ,
uh-huh .
the trials of economics with gone with that .
okay ,
yeah .
she ,
uh-huh .
it's very good .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
home repair .
uh-huh .
or we try to not miss that .
it's hysterical , isn't it ?
uh-huh .
so funny .
did you catch the christmas ?
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
did you see the end of it ?
no .
and , uh ,
uh-huh ,
and ,
and the guy ,
they thought it was the kitchen .
they thought it was the kitchen .
he gave the two dollars a senior home and a paper and a cat .
yeah .
i thought that was wonderful .
and then , uh , it was , it seems like that it wasn't so much ,
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and it just the other , uh , parents are from the same time .
uh-huh ,
i've never seen that program .
and , uh , i don't know ,
uh-huh .
unless you're really into computers , you know , and he's working , you know , would be interested in the ,
uh-huh .
but , uh ,
it just really gave me kind of an invasion of what was being out there .
oh .
oh .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i ,
uh-huh .
i enjoyed that .
it was just a thirty thousand show or something like air .
uh-huh .
it's public television , course , doesn't have the bins during the show
None
yeah ,
right .
and i like the cosby pool .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
or i just seem to , to do a lot of these programs .
i don't know why .
i just ,
if i can catch them , i do . or if i remember .
and ,
but , uh , i do like it ,
before i go to work , i watched them my soap opera .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i watch one
i , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
but ,
and one's an hour
and , uh , and bring them in the other side .
oh .
and ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah ,
that's been on for years .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yes ,
and ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
i like that , i like , i like the , the other thing , the shows who came out
and i like the kids ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , i know , i do like good movies .
i , subscribe to , b h o .
yeah
and ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
that's a good idea .
we did have h b o ,
it ,
it is .
it's just ,
yeah .
and , uh ,
at two o'clock in the morning , there isn't anything on the regular t v
oh .
and , uh ,
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
if you're up then
so that's ,
and you don't get good without cable or something
yeah .
right .
and ,
right .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
yeah .
and , i think when i got my v c r , i'd probably keep it , you know ,
but , uh ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
and , uh , my wife helped me some of these lakes .
yeah .
and that , they had to , uh , wash them out
she had to rebuild everything .
yeah
because , i , i think i would have to be able to do that , because i don't know ,
what was she driving ?
it was a cadillac .
uh-huh .
and they say , they have a new stadium , they did the same machines ,
yeah .
yeah .
they want it
and ,
yeah ,
not really easy to get really able to go .
yeah .
and say , like , what were you doing the refrigerator and stuff ?
and some of the , a fellow that came on a farm before that .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and they , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
i'm opposed to the , two or three on the weekends .
yeah .
they ,
the longest are kind of flooding .
yeah
i ,
especially if you need a minivan .
uh-huh .
they kept saying that the , that's what they did , is we lost out all .
yeah ,
yeah .
yeah .
and ,
uh-huh .
see , they built that so quickly it would fit every eight and all the passing and the rules that they've built in like thirty-five years .
right .
they all take the same exact coverage .
they'll always eat .
i mean completely .
one will plan not out of all .
uh-huh .
yeah .
use an alarm system ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it's kind of tough on the bottom .
yeah .
usually what goes is the same .
right .
you take a little time , replace the kids , you got a real good citizen .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
after you get one , you have a tendency to go through them pretty quickly , especially if you need a train .
yeah .
anyway , what are you driving now ?
and they said the same ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , at the beginning of the year and last year and drove a baby-sitter station
and ,
that's good .
yeah .
it was a late model ,
is that perhaps ?
it's a senior .
yeah ,
one of the little mini culture ?
uh-huh ,
yeah .
is a ,
do you like the way it brings up now ?
and , uh , train up with the ,
plain rough ?
it ,
yeah ,
and stuff ,
it varies , they'll count ,
it runs good .
yeah .
uh-huh .
it took me a while to get used to a four percent engine .
yeah .
you have to kind of wait for it , especially when you get on the highway .
yeah ,
right .
yeah .
uh-huh .
you driven american cars all ,
and they go ,
yeah .
i drove a yearly fee for a while , about a month .
and some of the house i think , uh , four minutes is just on new hampshire .
go- ,
and every time , i had gotten out with the company that are paid .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and there's a couple of them ,
and , i like , two weeks ago i was getting my own radio when i was about , uh , twelve .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right .
i had a couple of us .
had a super b for a while with a three ten it in .
uh-huh .
it was a lot of fun .
and , uh ,
not much gas mileage , though .
i don't know ,
gas mileage wasn't too bad .
it got about seventeen .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and ,
yeah .
yeah .
didn't have to work too much going to move the car around .
now , do you think since they started with our company that it was the way the car runs .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is ,
yeah ,
definitely .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
the ,
my last p o a car was pretty high tech or red
and ,
when i think the engine on that , about a hundred and thirty thousand dollars on the car .
yeah .
and , uh , put that old motors team and just got , an h o i , it's sold very high up .
and , i really enjoy the reading the newspaper ,
yeah .
and ,
if i get busy i don't get a chance to pick it up , like this week i noticed some of these reasons
but ,
and say , you have to read the time in the paper for the morning ?
uh-huh .
and , uh , the other one that ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
we , we took the morning news for a while ,
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
and then , uh , just moved off my grandmother's with me , i know , what's the subject ,
went outside , picked it up and over a week .
yeah .
yeah .
and by the time i got home and had to , to read some ,
uh-huh .
well , we don't , i don't want to , like a year or anything like that ,
so , i like to watch t v , uh , c n n .
i have several pictures and things to do ,
so it comes on , like at the nine o'clock p c
and ,
and to hear the news , not to have the right down to listen and it .
and did , you know , did you hear what they had to say about , uh , and , and , uh , the , the news coverage ?
yeah .
no ,
i mean yes i did hear that
and , uh ,
well ,
sometimes that ,
that's why i like some brutal thing that , i mean , we have time which , which we take from time to go
i ,
yeah .
i ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
and , and we also hit the box , right river ,
i guess it's , it comes out like , like ,
uh-huh .
twice a week or something ,
or it seems like that , uh , that you're , that there are as good as , as it is as , as much as they try , they put some songs ,
i had the chance to hear me if they're going to cook a lot of ,
and ,
um , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the world , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
and that ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i ,
i wonder ,
yes .
and ,
and ,
you may never get the truth ,
but ,
yeah ,
and that ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , i think that they only have ,
yeah ,
i do , too .
do you ever listen to the radio
or any ,
and listen to the last t v , and , uh , uh , l m i , the news network t v .
uh-huh .
and , uh , especially to the u s or something .
do you know it was on radio now ?
no ,
i don't .
it's on eleven ninety .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
and whatnot ,
yeah ,
my husband does
yeah .
i ,
yeah .
and ,
uh-huh .
and ,
if you're around the home , though , and , and can watch t v and read the paper , the problem is , is that twenty of news hour , or thirty minutes or something
and then they start saying that .
uh-huh .
and ,
yeah .
i don't think , i'm trying to think if it's much local .
i listen to a little of that
and listen to the other of a month that's one .
uh-huh .
uh-huh
that and feeling about seven point , she is waiting .
do you have a big cooking card like that you watch ?
uh-huh .
but , uh ,
that's another penny .
uh-huh .
that has to do with the weather side .
i'm not sure that ,
actually i think channel eight is probably ,
and i know the laundry center ,
he goes to our church
None
uh-huh .
and ,
well the ,
for a favorite channel .
channel eight when they came here thirteen , fourteen years ago , and , sat upon you and neighbors come out ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , from the city ,
and maybe several by my opinion and stuff ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
and , uh , the other day , is ,
and , i don't know ,
yeah .
can you tell much difference between the local radio , t v stations ?
and , i think they really have ,
uh-huh .
and they all have to be , you know , it's been worse
and , uh ,
i don't recall that they have any female
and ,
i think that seems to solve the ,
and stuff ,
uh-huh .
and they said , i know , you know , john fruit ,
i don't know if you kept up ,
yeah ,
yes
i have
and , uh , i think you have to have a little bit of like variety of that because i think you're , you're more likely to get ,
yeah ,
and i think he has the ability to vote .
i , uh ,
i , i , i grew up in there
oh yeah ,
uh-huh .
or what i think that , i think that , a from a rural area , because we have the option of not had to support that .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
or the other thing , that they have in some cases , this would be some real easy and , and some of this kind of thing
and ,
i occasionally go to saint louis .
uh-huh .
and , uh , there for a few days and watch the news and , and think the dallas would have , have been good news .
uh-huh .
i think you signed up now that ,
and ,
course he came so long
uh-huh .
like all of the stations seem to be pretty good ,
it's just we haven't found one that we've got into .
give you move from ?
houston is a lot of people that have to be able to do that , because they have a lot of people that are going to be able to do that .
yeah .
uh-huh .
i guess because you get to use , you like the ,
yeah .
and you feel comfortable with them
i ,
it is interesting though ,
it becomes a little bit of others .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
twenty years or so , even longer than that , twenty-one thousand dollars a lot , or whatever , anyway , long time ago
and ,
and , uh ,
anyway , didn't , he didn't have the phone ,
uh-huh .
and wasn't burning the first
and that's interesting .
that's , that's what the t v stations do .
they're trying to get rid of .
that's true .
and i think ,
their job .
if we remember that , that they're out after the expense .
that's true .
so that really bothers us that the whole news .
uh-huh .
i ,
is he the sports ,
i wonder if we're coming up on ten minutes .
have you talked , have you been on the conversation when they come in a month ?
yeah ,
i guess it is time to close now , so i can run go away the t i wouldn't take them .
okay ,
yeah .
yeah .
uh-uh .
bye-bye .
are , are you a t v ?
no ,
no ,
i work there as a result .
and ,
uh-huh .
oh yeah .
uh-huh .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
yeah ,
yeah .
in fact with me , this is , it's not much to talk about ,
i'm so much for it .
i don't really have much to use it at .
that been real interesting subject that they've called .
how many times have you called ,
or have you been participating in this ?
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right .
well , you know , they were not ,
this is about six times .
oh .
as culture person we have to do random testing , a lot .
yeah .
it doesn't bother me .
i don't feel like it's a really invasion of privacy or anything .
no ,
i think it's good .
in fact , i don't know what the husbands were ,
and maybe the more i think they were surprised to find it so .
so ,
and , i think it was still down here .
as far as the number of drug testing , you mean ?
huh .
yeah as far as the number of people they found that they were drug testing .
so i think that when i was at t i of course , we had all the information before they started .
right .
uh-huh .
and i think that's what would say , you know , that in the soviet union that you have to , the people that are worried about it or are taking drugs or ,
uh-huh .
right ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
yeah .
i don't know what they were .
when i worked for the giants as a result of a person ,
and ,
when we sent to t i , i had to have a drug tested .
yeah .
and ,
and their test came back ,
and normally we didn't have them .
it , uh ,
and ,
and ,
uh-huh .
that ,
uh-huh .
that's a good point ,
yeah .
and , uh , of course , that's just the point that you brought up that you usually want your brother to be , you know , have a lot of quality , that they keep track of everything .
they don't make everybody .
right .
that would be terribly carefully for someone to really come back off
and they were not ,
and , uh ,
now i'm not in spite of anything .
yeah .
uh-huh .
in other words , there's very few ,
and that , of course , has got to be able to hear .
it's got to be , if you have a drug testing program ,
it's got to be with a very , very good citizen .
you don't just have some local group do it .
it's got to be a very competitive option .
right ,
yeah ,
not just some problem somewhere .
no ,
you don't want to do that .
it's got to be a unanimous machine that is smaller or whatever much ,
and ,
and that would be good for any company that does it , and not have to just a very competitive thing .
uh-huh .
ours , i think , well i think it was in the south dakota ,
uh-huh .
oh really .
yeah .
huh .
or do they fire them right away .
and , uh , i think that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the , the the world , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
they're not welcome .
they are , they have one chance to do it in a nursing home .
you come back , you have one chance to go in , and go into , and go to have a lot of , uh , rehabilitation , for both alcohol and , for drug testing ,
and they have , uh , a lot of , uh , they have an active place that you can go for your own , financial problems or whatever .
right .
and , uh ,
no ,
it's not totally down .
uh-huh .
in fact , again , before you go , you know , that's why i said , when they started it first , they had a threat in program that hey , if you worried about this and you may have taken drugs , go ahead and get first ,
yeah .
right .
i think that's really good .
oh sure .
i know some places just put their choices on the spot if they come back or something on that .
oh yeah ,
no ,
that's not right .
it's really an author , or whatever you want to say that it is .
uh-huh .
and , who all of us have lots of one or something .
and ,
i have children ,
so ,
uh-huh .
right .
you know the classical thing is to give it away .
i always worry about my son's growing to some party
and they lived it to death .
i don't know ,
uh-huh .
that's a real difficult .
yeah ,
some of the stories you read about stories , there's not a lot time to try it and they're all .
my husband is a lot ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i hear a lot of horror stories about things like that .
uh-huh .
but , uh , the same time they get into the wrong system ,
and then they start a little bit better .
yeah .
it's usually not a one time actor , i think it's going to .
yeah ,
i know ,
i'm glad of that .
and i have , wood , take pretty good luck , or not very good luck with my kids so far on ,
that's my boss built ,
i have one daughter still at home .
one's at u t
and one's at home , gets staying home with my kids .
uh-huh .
no ,
no ,
i don't care about that ,
she'll be on the phone all night .
yeah ,
right .
it seems if you watch what kind of job that start running in and kind of keep up with their friends who are going to feel best from trouble , to what i can afford .
do you have children ?
no
not yet ,
uh-huh .
we're expecting a baby in july ,
uh-huh .
fantastic experience .
i've got two , as i said , i've at t i u now , in austin and one at home ,
and ,
yeah .
it's a fantastic experience .
uh-huh .
oh yeah .
you know , one thing my husband hated if you mean whatever people are your spending kind of problems , he takes you care of your kids for a random testing , like on a saturday morning , if they've been out at a friday night .
yeah .
if you're not too sure what's going on , he did the parents all day , the took them into the office and get them checked .
the key thing that i think , that we try to do , is that all the friends over here .
right .
have our house as a place where they can come at any time , so that you always see their friends rather than anything
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh ,
yeah ,
i think that's a really good thing to encourage .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and ,
right
yeah .
oh well , that's neat .
my wife was stuck , was in my lips ,
she said , we'll say to me that they're very cheap because they were to get driving .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and then say we kept closer to this or whatever when they come to take lessons ,
yeah .
yeah ,
and they go ,
i think it'll be neat .
uh-huh .
you still there ?
that's . ]
okay ,
i thought i was cut off there .
yeah .
no ,
i can't think of anything else to say about that .
uh-huh .
yeah .
did you get the penalty on how to get the gifts and all ?
no ,
i don't work for t i ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i didn't know what they were going to do .
they sent us a little bit ,
i just got it a week or something so you , uh , so many kids are paid something a year and everything .
right .
well that great .
well what kind of work ?
i've forgotten what they can do .
hm .
was it five dollars a call ?
yeah ,
five dollars a call .
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
right ,
yeah ,
it was good talking to you .
alright .
bye-bye now .
bye .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i mean , i have a friend who went in a little bitty day that it was falling out on the door or something
i , uh , i guess i have a lot of problems .
yeah .
or something like that , uh , since i got married that my husband , he doesn't have to do gourmet ,
yeah .
i guess , he can't make himself to do someone in the computer which he knows , he knows how to do it ,
and he'll do it .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and the like that
yeah .
i was really impressed with that
we had to have it to get the car repair ,
it wouldn't pass an
and , and so , he wrote them in
uh-huh .
so ,
and then , he did it
and ,
uh-huh .
i , uh , i think that have a long time with one of them .
and , uh , when i was younger , uh , my brother had a baby-sitter
and , uh ,
and ,
and , uh ,
and ,
i hate to pay somebody twenty-five dollars on for something i can do myself .
uh-huh .
it just , to me it was really odd no way to do that .
right .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , i think , i don't know how much to do and do it and stuff like that
uh-huh .
that makes sense .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
huh , yes .
and , uh ,
right
and that , uh , i have the , the nice in this shape for a good town to west the winter
and , uh , i think they did just end up them , even the , uh , a therapist and make sure that they're running out ,
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and you're required to get your car and go through the front of the world ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and of course , that was back in lewisville when it's nice in cold and all
yes ,
i'm sure it was .
uh-huh .
and then the most areas the cost me , oh , a hundred dollars a hundred .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right .
now like who's got that extra two and a half of them
i know i don't .
yeah .
and , that's kind of the way he is , that they really wanted to spend the time ,
it takes a lot of time
yeah .
but when we watch , we'd go so , he says , well , you know , me until you get three hundred dollars
and then he thinks that he has the money that , that he can spend on something
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
there's some people that enjoy around here and things around .
there's a lot of people
yeah .
yeah .
and , uh , i don't know how they were ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , i guess , i don't know ,
but ,
i've got other interests now
and ,
and ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
i mean , i've , i've had a lot of years for years
and ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and you want to make sure that it's done and put right back together ,
and , uh , you know , i've had the past in my lifetime had jobs that did her back and i was sitting it at a day while they're using them later again
right .
you know , like a spring that was put in which i could have made them in and do everyone needed to be an active system .
right .
uh-huh .
and when you have a lot of business being used to , you know , other members of your family , you know , you don't want that kind of a situation to come up .
no .
and ,
i only have one guy that i know that i can't listen to work on my car .
uh-huh .
and , uh , we have a couple of miles from here .
and so , it ,
yeah .
right ,
and , you know , that it's , really has a bad reputation to feel that , that people are actually feel in , and have so much , i think ,
uh-huh
yes .
and , uh , and , and i know when we had a house ,
we usually try to find out we haven't done something with our health insurance
uh-huh .
and , uh , he had a lot of living here
and ,
he said , that's really , really good
uh-huh .
and , uh , when they have a lot of our relatives that they really wanted to take care of the time .
uh-huh .
they had a big hole in a hole in it really would have been just been or whatever ,
uh-huh .
and ,
and , uh , i know his brother says , he was always a bottle and always forth that ,
and ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , he used to work kind of time as a lot of people to have a , a lot of cars , that you did know ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
and he said that , turned out a good because it , you know , it helped him to be so close to where ,
and ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
so ,
well , i don't know ,
uh-huh .
you sure you're a boy ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
and th- , a lot of his check not .
and therefore , that's , that's what he was and he was .
uh-huh .
and , uh , i guess there are some people out there , that ,
so ,
and ,
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
it didn't always work .
uh-huh .
so ,
i'm , i'm glad to go to tape , the cars have been because the , other countries that are ,
uh-huh .
so , uh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
because she was up here for a month or so , after i was in the
and , uh , it was an interesting experience for her .
uh-huh .
or , uh ,
it's a good experience ,
yeah .
and , uh ,
i ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it helps you figure out what's wrong with it ,
uh-huh .
you know ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
women ?
yeah ,
the changing roles of women , how funny you get
and what do you see in the lawn .
uh-huh .
that's not a broad enough topic
okay ,
yeah .
sounds good .
i'm ready when you are .
okay ,
hold on .
okay .
are you there ?
yeah ,
i'm here .
oh my goodness ,
i can't believe i did that .
okay ,
hold on .
that's okay .
okay ,
i .
okay ,
uh-huh .
are you in your thirties ,
or ,
no ,
i , i'm sorry .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
i'm envious
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
this was my high school reunion , in chicago .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
you probably heard that in the fifties women will work in home and all that .
right ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
right .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , just , uh , some of them are done with this ,
and , uh ,
uh-huh ,
i know that , th- ,
, social , de niro were a little bit .
uh-huh ,
so ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
but ,
right
it was more , it was more civil rights they don't ,
right ,
or meet rather educated than , any more ,
yeah .
and i think , i think the biggest family of noise in driving to where two years ago ,
and you had to choose ,
uh-huh .
and just the smaller groups of people .
it did .
and ,
it did
and some of the other stuff that , i think that , i think that it changed , you know , when i first got out of college , fifteen years ago , they were saying , if you were you were a kid ,
or you were not selected and kind of like that .
uh-huh .
and in terms of the community , i've seen a big change in terms of men being able to , maybe , we used to be ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
exactly .
yeah .
uh-huh
yeah .
so ,
uh-huh .
and , and what , what , what the system is the home
and ,
right .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
the rest ,
yeah .
in the house ,
yeah .
and , uh , since , since the university is just going to be working and , whether it be because of the courts or something ,
and , uh , how do you think about , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
and the children are ,
i think , i think a lot of society is realistic .
not to say that women shouldn't , you know , go out and do what they want to do
but , uh , i think that ,
right .
really tied really to have to get used to it .
yeah .
and that's the ,
the schools or the mo- , the schools or the parents ,
yeah .
yes ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i have a lot of opinions on this except a lot of all i went myself
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i don't have the numbers in my head right now ,
and , uh , the other things that brought up , i mean , there are just more women in , in the , just ,
right ,
uh-huh .
in the united states , in terms of being ,
uh-huh .
i mean , i'm the typical baby ago ,
i hate that term ,
and ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
what's it like to be treated as a woman today ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
speaking of getting married , i was talking to someone yesterday on this , on the project ,
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
and ,
he was about forty or fifty years old
and , uh ,
he was on ,
yeah .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
and h- wou- different than the , the old thing is , um , i don't miss that part of the time .
and i just ,
i ,
my , my mind just went ,
you didn't know what you're going to be done .
i went , what i .
you know ,
because i know it , really didn't , you can't even worry about it right now to have children ,
no- ,
i don't have any either
and , uh ,
None
yeah ,
and , uh , i think that ,
i think that i'll probably have children when i'm about thirty , a pound , something like ,
yeah ,
when it's time ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
you want to meet ,
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh ,
and ,
right
and ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
right ,
uh-huh .
i was twenty-seven when i got married
and , uh ,
my husband actually even worry about it .
uh-huh .
he was twenty-three when we met
uh-huh .
and whatnot ,
right .
but , uh , i don't have to have a ,
right ,
right .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it seemed like they were on their third one or the trim around the house .
yeah ,
yeah ,
so that , i guess that's a big change in terms of , just , the biggest problem that they feel like they need to , have the ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
their values is pretty .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and that ,
right .
out in the world .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right ,
i , i , i mean , i don't know how ,
i don't need to get married .
how old your mom is ,
she's probably ,
let's see my mother's in her early sixties ,
None
she's , she's about forty .
okay ,
i'm glad ,
your mother's department ,
i just turned up .
uh-huh .
i'm laughing ,
oh my god .
it does start to discuss up .
uh-huh .
no ,
yeah .
don't ever let age ,
i mean , i don't think they ,
okay .
nobody talks about it for women except other women and other men .
and , i just turned out of the ,
uh-huh .
good-bye without ,
and ,
i just ,
because me , myself , i just like to move really , really quickly .
yeah ,
an ,
i like to ,
anything i do ,
i got out of school too often .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i'm working too .
i want to move up quick .
i want to make money quick .
i want to retire quick .
yeah .
and so anything ,
i- , i- , when the children were out of , when i'm wearing aluminum and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah ,
you are , because what i was going to say is , what you will find is , is my background in is in communications and ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
and then i'm just , i'm actually to a point where ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
is the idea that you're going to be forty o'clock again , if you want to go back to school .
i'm seriously even going back to school for the law .
um , i think that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
i mean , you know , if you think about it , you know , i c- , i can have another career .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , that they have to do , have to do , you know , sort of ,
right .
i call kind of , i call it a woman's party .
they have to eat real fast
uh-huh ,
exactly .
they have , they have to , of speech ,
they have to just go through everything .
exactly .
and you'll find that probably by the time your thirty , certainly , if you haven't gone down ,
uh-huh .
something will slow you down .
do you know what i'm saying ?
yeah ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , i guess ,
yeah ,
and all that .
well , i think that , a lot of people , uh , probably feeling that way ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
you know
and whether i want to realize it or not , everything on television is young ,
oh it is .
young , young , young .
you can't be a model after thirty ,
yeah .
i , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's right .
yeah .
uh-huh .
you know ,
and ,
it's like i sing , i sing
and ,
uh-huh .
and a whole car ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
no .
and i'm younger ,
no .
because everyone i've seen coming up , they're like a hundred .
that's true
uh-huh .
you know ,
and ,
and , i , i really have to always tell him , either , you're not , you're very young .
no ,
you're extremely ,
yeah ,
it's , it's ju- ,
and , uh , you know , it's ,
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
if you know you haven't been able to children , which we do have to ,
uh-huh .
why would you do that now , at this point , part of the country ,
and , um , it's just a individual thing .
yeah .
i stopped myself a long time ago to somebody who had to do , uh ,
in my family my brother's children ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
his children will be out of high school before he's nine .
wow .
uh-huh .
how look young she is ,
uh-huh ,
yeah .
compared to where you are out of school and everything .
right .
it's just , it ,
and what you find is you don't compare the woman , because you just get into trouble .
it's all independent and whatnot .
uh-huh ,
yeah ,
very true .
uh-huh .
i ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
you went to school ,
right ,
uh-huh .
you can do this ,
you can do that ,
uh-huh .
we couldn't do that then .
and , uh , i mean , i can never see them
yeah ,
that's , that's why i say i feel , i really feel lucky right now , because i'm not married because i don't have children .
i'm out of school ,
i'm twenty-three ,
i can do anything i want to do , anything .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
and that's great ,
i mean ,
and yeah ,
i think that's the world today .
i , i mean ,
and ,
i have so well ,
right
that's hilarious ,
you know ,
not a lot of people ,
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
what do you , what do you that ,
what , i'm right now .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
oh .
and ,
uh-huh .
for their company newspaper ,
oh .
right now on the side ,
and then i'm also ,
uh-huh .
huh .
uh-huh .
huh , okay ,
i'm a , i'm a news reporter , now ,
oh you are ?
and what i'm looking for something is , i don't really want to stay in news ,
but , i would like to stay in and ,
we- ,
yeah .
here's what you ,
d- , i think that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is ,
this is off the topic ,
and those people probably are ,
uh-huh ,
okay
did you go to baylor by any chance ?
no ,
i don- , i went to u t at austin .
uh-huh .
that's even better .
and i just , i just happen to work at a station level , because you know .
i went to ,
or you in radio , or television or news .
primarily , present news , t v ,
and some of my degree is , in ,
are you still there ?
yes .
okay ,
it worked out fine .
okay .
and ,
and , uh ,
have you ever been to the teaching card ?
no ,
i haven't ,
is that good ?
yeah .
and do it really like the italian food ?
yeah ,
i ,
then don't ,
i like it's okay .
then this will probably ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
that sounds terrible to tell you to go somewhere where it's not that great
but ,
you're not going to believe this
uh-huh .
that's okay .
uh-huh .
it wasn't that bad ,
actually it's very good it's all of these run track of ,
uh-huh .
which i'm not new ,
no ,
uh-huh .
oh .
you can't really get with an independent .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and there's something ,
uh-huh .
okay ,
and whatnot ,
yeah .
so that makes a difference .
for us when we go out with the kids obviously we want to go somewhere that we can ,
the fast food ones are probably the ones they like the best .
and ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and like that .
you can usually get a variety of what you're looking for ,
right .
like at least or something like that .
right ,
but , uh , i go and i go out to go somewhere with a little faster
and ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
but ,
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we .
no ,
we love to go there .
we went there on my birthday since it's sitting there .
uh-huh .
it's too ,
too much like a sequel took ,
yeah
and mexico ,
yeah ,
i know ,
i've seen it .
uh-huh .
the food is probably ,
the food is great .
i'm not a fairly low story if you're using this ,
yeah .
i don't know you would recommend that a year ?
yeah ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
inches or they have better .
uh-huh ,
well ,
a shrimp it's a shrimp can be ,
really .
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i've never had anything there that wasn't mandatory .
yeah ,
they are really good .
even though you have to stand in line and all of that , that's the only thing i don't like about it too
and ,
yeah ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
just to cost any more ?
yeah .
i mean lunch today was eighteen dollars .
yeah ,
it's very expensive .
yeah ,
i don't know how you feel about that
uh-huh .
yeah
i'm glad i'm talking about food being something that are young
sometimes it's hard isn't it to keep a ,
yeah ,
yeah .
no ,
sometimes august and i , that's my husband and then ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it's a chinese ,
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
my husband likes that .
yeah .
yeah ,
off of half down there ?
yeah ,
i ,
yeah ,
august d ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
but , um ,
None
i don't like it at all usually
even
uh-huh .
yeah .
now , me i'm like i said it i'm ,
i like that .
yeah ,
i love seafood ,
None
and , i like a lot of different things .
i like japanese food .
there's a place on called probation or
um , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
and , uh , i had a dog that was ,
and i saw that ,
and , uh , i think that they make that they offer , you know , specific churches ,
oh .
or american or piano it's ,
and i remember when we went
we were married with another couple that was just killed
and , uh , i guess we had a lot of things .
uh-huh .
it made all the fish anyway or no
yeah .
it's very pretty inside ,
is it ?
and the girls wear and whatnot ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
gee i don't know
we went to a place called in spite of school ,
i don't know that place .
which was really over priced .
was it ?
uh-huh .
they had a great desert weather .
um , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's what we need isn't it ?
yeah .
no ,
there's a lot of nice places instead here ,
now , i like okay , texas many times .
yeah ,
i like ,
it's good .
barbecue ,
have you ever been to th- , i think it's called spring creek ?
yeah ,
now ,
that's real good ,
they're real good .
yeah .
they are good .
there had ,
oh my husband's going to ,
yeah .
yeah ,
free ice cream ,
yeah .
i didn't know they had that .
yeah .
i can't talk i had chocolate machines , in los angeles ,
oh .
today , which i never eat at lunch
and ,
just to die for exactly .
it was ,
oh .
in reality
yeah .
yeah .
or do you still order for them ?
uh-huh .
i just had a baby ,
uh-huh .
and she's six months .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
None
uh-huh .
they're they're kind of ,
my mother's son does have gone thinking how , i mean ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it's really sad isn't it because it's hard to get them away from it then .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh ,
i know where that ,
and along these are fast metal food
right
that's all ,
yeah .
and then we go to park over there so we can have all our own .
uh-huh .
that's on the nights we can't afford .
and ,
cause with two we have a problem ,
i mean you can't get , you know , trying to ,
you sound like you're doing pretty well with four children .
yeah .
that's the way the ,
kids .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
i shouldn't say this on this conversation ,
yeah .
we're getting ready to go to compare me .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
we're excited ,
it will be neat .
i think it will be worth it
and somebody said to me in terms of ,
this is food so i can say , this is
yeah .
and , uh ,
they laughed
and , uh , i know , i guess ,
ye- , food .
thirty something ,
yeah .
and i think that would be a lot of them doing any .
yeah ,
yeah .
yeah .
in terms of talking about restaurants , i mean are a lot of restaurants , how are you when they have children when they visit three or four children ?
uh-huh .
you have to be careful if you go to a , a restaurant that , that really is more fun you know ,
sure .
with the atmosphere and everything ,
they ,
if you're ,
uh-huh .
like we could probably take our son and , and our son and we went to a new car .
uh-huh .
and they know how to act ,
yeah .
i don't think i would chance it with my younger ones because they're just too much of a puppy
and some areas are really trying to go for that kind of thing .
that involves kind of thing , yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
None
i just , i just , i've been in some places where they say children ,
and , uh , just where the bible just played the library of the paper is , you know .
yeah .
yeah .
and then , um , on the other hand when we have the children or the products are not
yeah
i don't know what other kind of industry
really .
we went to one new ,
back on the italian , we went to some place from across the past where everyone really runs for the food .
oh .
i can't remember the name of it
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
no ,
yeah .
yeah ,
i know which one it is ,
and ,
i can't ,
yeah
it's in the middle , yeah ,
and ,
i think it was like paper where you could write them on , or something with that
it was just terrible .
oh dear .
i mean i was wondering ,
and the mean that was dirty , um ,
it was one of these you have bad experience and ,
yeah ,
where you felt like ,
say i don't think i'll come back to this .
like when you're in a bad part of population or something .
oh dear .
um , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh .
boy ,
uh-huh .
oh .
cheap to pay the rest there
yeah ,
yeah ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
i , i think , i've got a lot of ,
one of my favorites were
and , uh , i don't think of those , um ,
no ,
except that this makes me fat .
no ,
i'm just kidding .
yeah ,
you have to watch it if you go out to eat
that's true .
yeah ,
that's true ,
uh-huh .
no
yeah ,
there you go .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
maybe we'll see you in the library somewhere .
yeah ,
maybe .
okay .
okay .
bye-bye .
bye-bye .
uh-huh .
so ,
and just what i know of my daughter's group , uh , has gone through .
and none of it has been good
and ,
yeah .
and whatnot ,
huh .
they seem to be having an fun time .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and they say , i don't know ,
right .
there must be some good service out there if you really look for and pay it for .
what , what age child are you thinking in terms of ?
in terms of what they're talking about .
no .
for , for instance
oh .
bye-bye .
uh-huh .
jack .
uh-huh .
yeah .
after eleven years of marriage . yeah .
we're actually , it's happening now .
uh-huh .
i see
uh-huh .
yeah .
they tell me it's going to be strong
right .
do you have children ?
i have one son .
and did you put him in front
or is he older now or so
or ?
uh-huh .
sure .
uh-huh .
i ,
right .
and , and so that ,
you ,
uh-huh .
or it was working at the war , uh , he was born .
and , uh , i was a college who was a college teacher ,
oh .
and , uh , i guess , i don't know ,
so
yeah .
and , uh , i guess it was from my apartment , from my apartment .
uh-huh .
and , uh , i don't know , with a neighbor .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
and , uh ,
yeah .
i , you know , i don't know , him and , and this sort of stuff .
because i was gone an hour at a couple of an hour or a half and a half .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
right .
and
that's wonderful .
yeah .
yeah .
and , uh , i think of , uh , because of the , your , um ,
i mean , i think , uh , i'm in central louis .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and say , when we were wondering what i can do something that i can go someplace or four years
or ,
my husband ,
i'm very lucky though , again , too , my boss is very good to building family .
uh-huh .
so that , i think that's helpful , th- , that i don't need in this way .
right .
and they don't know what they were .
i do think there's good out there .
what part of the country are you in ?
i'm in maryland .
you're in maryland .
uh-huh .
and , the times the thing is , if you have this day and , that you might be able to do something similar to what i did .
right .
that's what i'm hoping .
which is you know , be there for their month
and then later on when he was , you know ,
uh-huh .
i mean this ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
and so
you were fortunate .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
sure .
and ,
uh-huh .
and then , i also went home and sort of was able to see a student with it she was doing .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , you know , in a sense she , she learned a lot around , too much .
right .
it was constantly , no , i don't want him ,
to me lately .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
that's not a correct job
and , you know , a lot of people i'm sure , though i think .
uh-huh .
i think it worked out very , very well .
uh-huh .
see .
because what he learned to do by the time he was two or so , he would sit down to the hospital where i was papers and writing or shop papers .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
yeah .
and then he knew that there were so many times
and there were active times .
right .
and then he likes to , he also learned that , uh , that were times that you had to be gone , you know ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
oh .
and , uh ,
did you say or expert ?
r- , kind of snow .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
yeah .
and ,
and ,
through professional people
and it's private ,
and it's twenty-nine .
uh-huh .
they
oh great .
and w- , i- , i think they're looking for the word i'm going to .
and when you deal with issues like that , in terms of family building through family , and then , uh , you have people to produce you to , well if you go through that why you would put them in jail .
oh that's great .
and whatever , we are raised from the same degree .
uh-huh .
uh , i know , what i've learned to do is just going out of everybody's opinion .
i feel that if the child is healthy , and , uh , as long as we make it feel , i'd like to do something like that with what you did .
uh-huh .
so ,
right .
and maybe , when it's two or three or six , fifteen years old .
i don't know .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and , uh , not a little bit of the news .
i don't think the united states ,
yeah .
no ,
i was in the middle east .
and they just ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , the first time we had ,
my son's from england ,
it just seems the united states is not even seen for child care or , or something , as good as i call ,
right ,
right .
uh-huh .
and they said ,
i ,
yeah .
go ahead .
no ,
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
see , i think that's wonderful .
and , uh , i think that was my son , after my kids were going to .
and , uh ,
in a sense , i went to work
and ,
to .
or ,
right .
uh-huh .
we switch off .
and ,
right ,
right .
th- ,
i'm that way .
yeah .
i want to work .
yeah .
right .
it's easier
and i agree with that .
yeah .
yeah .
what is amazing to me is now your son is already grown
uh-huh .
it's amazing to me how many people are on their opinions and stuff ,
right ,
right .
uh-huh .
and ,
and our , my father , i'm doing that they have , they're in that regard with ,
and they've been at the place , you know , the , the , the , the trend , is the best or , the media would be , well , we find conscious of stuff to have children .
and that's sad .
you know .
and in ,
and ,
right .
and what you just do learn to have is somebody else out of it
and , uh , i think that are two teachers that are some problem that i are know or their own on their business and these parents , you know , they may have the need for child care like that .
uh-huh .
i ,
yeah .
i , i ,
no ,
and , i think that there are only a choice , uh , for this type of thing .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
then , yeah ,
it's raining in , in virginia .
yeah ,
yeah
and just , uh ,
and there are too many things i think .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
and some people that are not making more than a hundred thousand dollars a year
actually , there seems to be an invasion of my heart .
really .
is ,
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
it's probably not completely opposite
and they ,
maybe it's legal to school or just two one of those .
sure .
but , uh , i don't know ,
and ,
uh-huh .
i ,
yeah .
and , uh ,
and , uh , you know , that will be able to stay home with the children
and some other countries that might want to stay home for a , a few years ago
and
i haven't thought about that .
yeah .
and actually my sister has an hour four months old
and she's at home at disney area .
yeah .
yeah ,
yeah .
and ,
uh-huh .
and ,
how wa- ,
i'm just real curious .
how was the middle east in terms of that with children ?
is that , is child care or that is good outside of our little penalty to ?
no .
and , uh , just a cat was doing that , uh , my son did go for a year .
i think when he was from two to three .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and , and say , you know , it wasn't like ,
it was real happy .
and ,
he must be smart .
yeah .
yeah .
so he was , he was ready to , to go to school at that point .
uh-huh .
and , yeah ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
the professional .
yeah ,
i was wondering about that .
yeah .
and they said , they were , they were , they were going to be able to get a little bit of the , the , the , the the same thing that we were in .
i'm in dallas
and , uh , just a big problem with , uh , four o'clock in the country ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i'm here he
yeah .
i , uh , i think was just a nice student when you get outside , you know , somebody didn't make me .
no ,
no .
and , uh ,
yeah .
yeah ,
that's okay
and , um , then you're going to see , too .
i think
yeah .
and read some of the , i know , i said , i don't know that many people , i'm not sure , i'm thinking about it , you know , because you know , certainly in the women do the work
right .
right .
they fight ,
they work .
are you a vietnam veteran , like you ?
and they have a big problem with that , that i don't know if they were going to be able to do that .
no ?
do you have family who were in the vietnam war ?
and they have a big problem with that , that i don't know if they were going to be able to do that .
uh-huh .
okay .
yeah .
and you were too young , right ?
i am too young , yeah .
all right .
do you know some folks who have been there ?
and there's something like that , that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the , the the news ,
okay .
a couple .
okay .
how did it influence them ?
and they said the , the one guy worked in with my daughter over .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and while he was there , he caught some kind of a strange pie .
uh-huh .
and , uh , all his hair come out of the ,
and ,
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
has he still burned up with those ?
i do not think he was in there ,
uh-huh .
None
and , i have a couple of things from vietnam ,
and , uh , i really had a big one phone rings to me .
uh-huh .
i , uh ,
and it , it really made a different run out of mine
uh-huh .
he went to vietnam one man and two hours not , go through a little bit .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
much like what i did heart .
right .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
he was
that is true .
it makes a lot of difference .
right .
and , uh , but , uh , the only folks that have had him that were on the land , or in , are still , still carry a lot of things .
uh-huh .
they really do .
and , uh , i , i really , i don't think that we do not think those young people are .
huh .
but ,
shows a lot of learning that since you want .
and ,
they
and the only differences in the road to do , you know , enter a jury ,
they did so much to their own people all over that time .
yeah .
that is true .
yeah .
uh-huh .
if you come back and your head is filled off ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
but ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , you know , one of the things that have a fellow that have as a result is the incredible of the border of driving business that since that country .
yeah .
and they say ,
much that i say ,
i do not want you here .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and ,
very much .
it's occurred , it's about nine or ten percent now .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
and there's some of the news , the old plan .
look how much more food we have , ]
uh-huh .
for example .
uh-huh .
a lot of options are , are pretty protective by the deficit .
that's true
a lot of people have handled in the schools .
there is a culture change there .
the original tastes seem to be very bright ,
there seem to be very carefully .
and , uh ,
no .
not really .
and , uh , it seems like in a long run you can see where , for example ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , even that jobs .
and that all is a result of , of , of vietnam .
and , and then you see a lot of , a lot of men that were over there , brought her .
yeah .
that is ,
and , uh , it does that kind of me that are a very strict house called me .
uh-huh .
and ,
and , uh , they are not very well at all .
i know that there ,
because i know there is , there is still not in the dallas area .
uh-huh .
they ,
they ,
you are talking about p d or whatever goes in january ?
ghost , route right than you .
robert de people ?
yeah .
okay .
uh-huh .
and , and then they got a little home ,
or ,
uh-huh .
that , that had not occurred to me .
yeah .
and , uh ,
that would be an interesting concept .
and ,
they didn't receive any of the land that they had .
yeah ,
i ,
they ?
yeah .
uh .
uh-huh .
and to ,
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
and ,
it , it would have been the same as desert period if they all had been fighting was north vietnam .
uh-huh .
i , or i am not sure that was more interested in what we could be recording .
uh-huh .
and they said , they were illegal problems in there , and they were , well ,
uh-huh .
you know ,
and , uh there is no way that they could catch them .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
that is right .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
and you can't find much on , all in a boat or something
yeah ,
all they can do is in terms of ,
i ,
that is right .
you know ,
and then they try to the top of the school .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
because they could , they could kill all those plants , you know , which would be the country as far as from california on .
and , the rest of the , and the things i think he's a better job now , like they did in desert storm .
i ,
because they had ,
uh-huh .
he , he opened a bunch of plastics and filled with them and he gets a lot of expenses to all along the way they were .
uh-huh .
and they had to , you know , they had to blow them up or , or whatever .
uh-huh .
and then they had to fill in the little way all the time , where he had made those .
what world war do you think they found the experience for that ?
they ,
don't you think they learned from the city for vietnam ?
w- , i think that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is ,
yeah ,
uh-uh .
part of it is that ,
uh-huh .
part of it is technology .
yeah .
part of it is technology , yeah .
because all ,
go ahead .
uh-huh .
and you say , that went ?
yeah .
and , and you know those women ,
and you are growing down a way .
i think that is one of the reasons that they have , they have much pretty much threat in america in the backyard .
uh-huh .
because look what happened when they were looking for ,
uh ,
right .
you know .
uh-huh .
he just probably went right down to a hundred percent .
sure .
sure .
sure .
i know that , uh , a lot of personal experience , you know , was the only one of the cooking that they had .
we did not actually lose them .
they did not lose their lives ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
that is right .
uh-huh .
i had dinner night with a vietnam program who just was beginning to go from the preschool and the drug bed that he loves .
uh-huh .
that is a long time to drop .
yeah .
and they , they really need to ,
everybody that has , that has been ill there ,
it's ,
when i- ,
in vietnam i think it was much nicer .
you stand there with a rifle and pick up a , a piece of somebody else's ,
uh-huh .
or bring their head off ,
uh-huh .
and that has to be able to you if your human , you know .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
and , uh ,
so they had to work all that , that out , the , and the , and the interior that come along with it .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you bet ,
you bet .
i do not , i do not really think that anybody can ever , forget that ,
uh-huh .
but , uh ,
yeah .
and see you , what is that the reason are so mad about it .
they say , bu- , we're ,
going to listen to this and we are going to look at this , what every yard were , and we are not going to make them again ."
yeah .
and that is what makes the extent of them .
right .
and i cannot remember them .
i do not know a solution .
uh-huh .
and i can't remember them for us to be active .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
they ,
right .
for the most part , i wish that it had not happened .
yeah .
yeah .
None
and ,
that is right .
you know .
and ,
and he just , he did not want to be in it any more than , than what we started out in august with desert .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and then it just went up to meet the war .
and , uh , it has been a very good for , more , though .
i can remember when i was in the sixth grade ,
and that was many years ago .
uh-huh .
french , yeah .
uh-huh .
we were reading about the french scouts that would be in plano .
uh-huh .
right , yeah .
there , there has not been a lot of peace in that part of the world .
uh-huh
i really , i do not know ,
yeah ,
yeah .
yeah .
more so supported when they got them home .
right .
and , uh , i think that they were treated as they were at the most part .
exactly .
and i think , the first week ,
born on the fourth of july ,
and , i think it would be a good job of the week and the child .
uh-huh .
yeah .
more than , what was , was now
uh-huh .
and ,
yeah .
i think so .
uh-huh .
i enjoyed talking to you .
yes ,
it was nice talking to you .
uh-huh .
okay ,
bye-bye .
bye-bye .
okay .
are you a t i
no .
no .
is somebody in your family a t i
no ,
and , uh , my dad's for the family , for the government
and , that's how he got it .
uh-huh .
so ,
i just graduated from college .
yeah .
no .
you're just going to have to imagine what you would like as benefits
or , what i'm looking for .
uh-huh .
okay
uh-huh .
no ,
huh-uh .
didn't get that far .
no .
uh-huh .
oh well .
um , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the world , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
yeah .
yeah .
like most companies , we have his own community .
yeah .
they call it brooks cuts .
they're stupid ,
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is ,
i've heard of that .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
now they're going to start to do the same kind of thing with him .
yeah .
uh-huh .
if you go to a doctor who isn't in the refrigerator it's running it has more less than you do .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and if you have the best wheel test , uh , not only like a third of your cost , which can be kind of expensive to be a musician .
yeah
it can
uh-huh .
yeah ,
i pay for the extra dental plus , so much more per month because it always seems like if you're going to have a or something or something ever made it a little more .
uh-huh .
right .
and i know when you first start out working on the thinking of your home ,
uh-huh .
after you've been working for a while and you look at your account and you go , and all that that's in the area .
i don't it's going to pay too long when i get out of college .
uh-huh .
it's not an i r a ,
it's called a four oh one k plan .
it's kind of like wild .
you put in so much money
and then ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
of course you can buy aerobics in the time ,
i , you know , not that they're not a real , for sure kind of thing .
ye- ,
not always safe
yeah ,
uh-huh .
i don't know if it's any different than other companies ,
uh-huh .
and like , you know , last year it was forty dollars a week
and now this year it's thirty years it's pretty close to ,
and you go , gee , i'm going to make it
doesn't quite feel as good .
yeah .
and , uh ,
and you start to get like five days every year is so many of how they did it to you .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
you get three weeks .
uh-huh .
which , a lot of places make you like ten years or so ,
yeah .
before you get that much .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
they traded it around depending on which day the week of christmas was on the street .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i normally take that week somehow , you know .
yeah .
you only have to take three days of vacation
and you get the whole week at christmas time .
yeah ,
and , uh , i can just tell you like , you know ,
from my dad and my uncle , like her ,
yeah .
whoa , okay !
so ,
uh-huh .
but , uh , i think they took the kids out of the night .
he worked for an urban system ,
uh-huh .
um , i think that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
but , i think they're going to start getting into eye .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
i don't use the services
and whatnot , i think a year ago or just , recently or something they started to give some kind of eye coverage .
yeah .
and not quite a bit of fact , you can go to that people that have to , uh , testing for that time .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
and now for his mother-in-law pretty well he just has the biggest impact .
but ,
um , i think that , that , that , that , that , that ,
he's on that same kind of odd than you said what only ,
uh-huh .
for everything he puts in they'll be it , to pick up a certain amount .
yeah
like ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
and they'll start it .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
did you ever hear of the national rights of those ?
yeah .
okay ,
uh-huh .
they changed their name now
but , uh , that's what he was ,
and , uh , he , he is really nice .
he's going to be there three years at the end of this month
and he'll be getting three weeks vacation .
gee , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the news ,
that's pretty decent .
yeah ,
yeah .
uh-uh ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
right ,
and you get some extra things .
federal francisco always seem to get ,
yeah ,
right ,
right
and those ones that you couldn't really care about so much but the people get off the day together .
yeah ,
uh-huh ,
he has it really nice .
it's nice where he works ,
and , uh , he seems to be very happy , you know .
like his mother-in-law
and , uh , you know , he has all that
and , uh , with their stuff and they have , um , a lot of doctors that the employees can go to
and ,
and , uh , i think , the , the , the , the , the news ,
okay .
uh-huh .
and , you know , to have to , to certain ones
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
yeah .
and ,
i ,
that's not bad either .
yeah .
yeah .
and they don't have a lot of money ,
that's like a sheltie a get .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and you pay five minutes .
yeah .
hi
you want to start first
of course .
we are talking about the elderly and ,
right .
and say , or not we wo- , we have not living around
i , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
as a matter of fact , i can tell you something about that .
you apparently have somebody there , in one .
no ,
actually , my grandmother owned and a nursing home for a while
and her mother ,
uh-huh .
no ,
she did .
oh .
and then my mother also owned and a nursing home ,
uh-huh .
for years .
i will be darned .
and then , uh , went on to school and became the beginning of the b m at home
uh-huh .
and , uh , my mother and my older sister are both of his hands .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
you are very , very much aware of what goes on .
absolutely .
that is great .
actually , the motivation for grandmother is the dog ,
uh-huh .
was that her mother was very old ,
uh-huh .
and couldn't seem to find exercising .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
she was envious .
right .
and ,
right .
for her mother
and ,
i will be darned .
and , uh ,
uh-huh ,
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
very business from that point .
and then they , they were ,
now , see that is a nice attitude to go into .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and that , that is not really true , either ,
uh-huh .
i think that is a tremendous and a , and an education that we've come from some sort of bad problems .
you see , those who had bad ideas about them talk .
and they really ,
right .
and those who do not add up ,
uh-huh .
a letter to the nursing home and say you did good ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
that is true .
i mean what we are out of maybe a nursing home ,
uh-huh .
when you are still able to have good ,
uh-huh .
where are ,
uh-huh .
sure .
well now ,
uh-huh .
that is right .
and , that is because they have one year after the children ,
right .
they choose to not make those ,
right ,
right .
choices themselves .
however , my father is also a senior in a nursing home .
uh-huh .
and , uh , she works for one in dallas , which is a more retirement than it is a nursing home .
and these , these ,
and they say , they don't have a lot of things that are ,
i love watching these elderly people , come to they are good and tell her . i am going for my ,
uh-huh .
tennis lessons .
and , uh ,
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
us for our own trees ."
yeah .
and they have ,
uh-huh .
some significant crime went on there .
yeah .
and their dining thing looks like , you know , cafeteria or something .
yeah .
that is great .
or , or one of the lovely things .
and they have , you know , jazz code for their actions .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , a daughter that we had a lot of ,
yeah ,
that sounds great .
uh-huh .
and i think the , when the oldest doesn't have , no ,
yeah .
to the extent where they just do not want to be bothered with keeping up ,
uh-huh .
and taking care of themselves ,
uh-huh .
anymore . that is a wonderful alternative .
uh-huh .
it is expensive .
it is delicious .
see if they could , get this idea somewhere with rain , though it is what ,
uh-huh .
you , uh ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , she may have one side of by the ,
uh-huh .
one bedroom drives .
she still had her own ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
and they did have , uh , the button that you could get the refrigerator the office if you got into trouble
i ,
uh-huh .
there were written that you could flip on and so forth .
and they have ,
uh-huh .
no ,
i am very much in favor ,
i have heard stories ,
uh-huh .
i know that the united states can be able to ,
oh yeah ,
but i would be able to think they are less ill they are not paid in a nursing home than , they are in ,
in the homes , yeah .
homes of their own children .
i ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
like when my sister was real bad before she died here , we had a new restaurant and a half ,
uh-huh .
into a nursing home .
uh-huh .
and they were little hunting .
absolutely .
and they were ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
of course all of my folks lived to be very old and my grandmother developed ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
she went to the doctor ,
she had grandchildren ,
she got the house
and during ,
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
the period of time that she was really staying there was a few in nursing home .
uh-huh .
she got better ,
she got well ,
she got out and went back again .
uh-huh .
they ,
uh-huh .
left them maybe had a , they have a ,
that is right .
broken windows or something ,
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
i think it is a wonderful place ,
uh-huh .
it is a place that you do not have to plant with finding ,
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
problems
and ,
you have ,
and ,
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
it certainly is .
it , it depends upon the individual .
it certainly does ,
and ,
and , uh ,
i ,
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
i would not object to going to one .
uh-huh .
i might , i guess to be able to , be careful to make my own choice .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
this is
i ,
then dump me there .
yeah .
there has to be taken consideration on us .
that is right .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
and , i think you would shop for a nursing home , just like you voted for a couple of church ,
yeah .
or a doctor or anything else .
that is right ,
you would look into it and forth ,
uh-huh ,
sure .
do , do the best job you could in in terms .
uh-huh .
when you get to the point where you are in trouble ,
uh-huh .
and you have to have that to have , you are involved in a major position to have them .
no
yeah .
that is what ,
that is right .
i am saying ,
uh-huh .
most people will not even look at that until it becomes a necessity .
absolutely .
i think that one of the best ways to do that is for families to realize they are going to be able to pick those day out ,
uh-huh .
and ,
go out to the nursing home , help some arts schools , especially , on work a week board , whatever their own minds are .
whatever their country , yeah .
and work with ,
uh-huh .
those senior whoa .
yeah ,
and have a friend who is , uh ,
she had a son that was visiting from birth ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
at home ,
they lived on a farm ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
she did not want her , her children , her children are other than his son .
that is right .
so ,
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , he was a lot of mine
yeah .
uh-huh .
somebody else , is helping him out ,
that is right .
you know ,
they ,
and , uh , he has been a very good movie .
and whatnot ,
uh-huh ,
oh yes .
yes .
routine and ,
uh-huh .
and they said ,
uh-huh ,
uh-huh
and the only the problem with some of that nursing home is a lot of the space plan around .
i do not think they pay ,
the nursing home staff rates ,
uh-huh .
to , to get the longest
to keep them there , uh-huh .
that they have in some other areas ,
true .
and that is sad , because , i think the old health plan is one of the most important ,
yes .
i ,
and , uh ,
and , uh , people don't know , the fact that they should be paid as well as businesses and that type of thing , you know .
that is right .
it seems to be a shame .
care for the garbage and one care for the children ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and lord .
right ,
right .
your money .
yeah .
you are your brother's and your account there ?
yeah ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
and , as a matter of fact , i do not see why they have not any programs in their minds .
and ,
uh-huh .
take your , the children
i ,
uh-huh .
i know our kids look ,
the children we open ,
okay ,
my name is donna .
okay ,
my name is horrible .
okay ,
and , uh ,
they said about magazines .
uh-huh .
but ,
a month later
uh-huh .
and the one that i really watch it is not ,
and you may be familiar with it from , is falling from texas ,
and , uh ,
there's country living ,
there's country ,
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
and ,
this one is the one they have all the pictures of luck from you know , we have found that
gorgeous leaves and trees and all the lakes and the mountains and things .
sure .
and ,
and that's very good .
uh-huh .
what do you take ?
and , i mean , they just don't have any ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
uh-uh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
are you ?
and th- , you know , what happened was you called , i mean , their wife and getting my hands on , which used to put them on ,
oh .
uh-huh .
and forth and how to do things .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
sure .
we took noises and i think we took it especially during the week to kind of put up on this list and things have it be .
yeah .
uh-huh .
i think it .
yeah ,
yeah ,
i've had time before .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and whatnot with the other day that is , uh , it's interesting to be able to do it , just put the magazine on the house
that's right .
and you never read it unless there's some big thing in there that you're going to have to keep your kids ,
i ,
that's exactly right .
i did the same thing .
we saved the ones from the past lot
and ,
yeah ,
and then ,
uh-huh .
exactly it sounds like exactly what we did like it just brings him and we could have this
uh-huh .
i , uh ,
and , you know , it's like ,
uh-huh .
that's the thing , you sound like you have to the problems to do that .
yes ,
we do .
oh .
we're out in the country we're right across from a while ,
and , uh ,
and they are staying home ,
None
oh .
uh-huh .
and ,
i ,
i bet it is gorgeous .
yeah ,
it's beautiful .
i agree ,
the other thing about magazines , the only thing i don't like , is they really get into depth and ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
right .
okay .
uh-huh .
every penny .
and ,
i do the same thing ,
some kind of mine's ,
yeah ,
nobody is ,
uh-huh .
falling into that .
and ,
yeah ,
exactly ,
uh-huh .
that's right .
it's almost a mean , you could go into a store and get it back the same way ,
i , uh ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
exactly .
uh-huh .
come out just the possibility of the whole thing .
exactly ,
yeah ,
they're really getting into that
None
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and now i need a chance to get ,
oh .
i'm ,
and ,
i understand .
and you need to try to get a job .
and ,
or do you keep it ?
and there's something ,
i do ,
and sometimes , most of the time i planted them out .
uh-huh .
so ,
type it out , uh-huh .
yeah .
see how the family liked it
yeah ,
and then if we like it becomes part of the population that's like ,
i , uh ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
sure ,
sure .
and i bought a lot of the country magazines and then it seems like when i put some of that away , i quit buying it ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i'll have to check that out ,
yeah ,
it ,
uh-huh .
i went through all this ,
i had this huge beef of house i lived at the past few years ,
i had no idea .
and you don't want to worry with any of them because there's one thing in each one
it was hard ,
uh-huh .
and they don't know , those are removed down to the weekends because of three weeks ago ,
and , uh , just , one of the reunion in the school ,
uh-huh .
right .
right .
it really doesn't , you know it's got to have more than that it's got to have some good ideas it's got to have everything .
uh-huh .
and i find that most of the magazines i really like is in christmas time because ,
and , i know ,
okay ,
uh-huh .
i really can't get into that
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
and just , there isn't any particular time that i enjoy going to have all three miles so much about it .
i can even take the news
yeah .
None
i'm pretty much the same way ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh ,
sure ,
the old , old stuff that came out , i think it was , it was , oh , jeez ,
you talk about eight minutes .
yeah .
yeah .
my opportunity to listen to the kind of car that's going to
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
the old , old country ,
the old , real old , yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
yeah ,
that's the way i am , too ,
uh-huh .
as far as instruments , i can go to piano from the same time .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and it's so funny because , you can take an inch and what it really sounds like when it is like swimming by a group .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
to prevent , are you okay , when we're going , wait to lunch .
bye-bye .
do you like g m ?
and they go ,
a little bit .
uh-huh .
i can , i can pretty much ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and she loves them .
on ,
no .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i can take all kinds of music pretty much except for the kids , like i get , said , into the real hard time ,
yeah ,
the heavy metal ,
yeah ,
i have no interest in that ,
uh-huh .
let's just put it that way ,
hearing , anyway .
yeah ,
i saw peter peppers on t v last night ,
uh-huh ,
sure .
uh-huh .
None
uh-huh ,
exactly .
um .
okay ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
okay .
you all have a good day .
you , too .
bye-bye .
bye now .
okay ,
uh-huh .
do you have any ?
yeah .
do you have any kids
or ,
i have some , yes , some of these children .
i have three boys .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
or we're paying right now
and ,
how about yourself ?
do you have any kids ?
no ,
i'm in , i'm in school graduate school now
yeah .
so i imagine you've gone through the experience of your company come up at your college .
yeah ,
definitely .
and reading recently , i don't know , for instance , uh , for my h p c .
uh-huh .
very good .
they ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
for instance , i , i , i know , my wife are much different than like for school .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and what i would , what i would say to be easy to get in the world .
yeah
what you thought , huh .
yeah
and , uh ,
just the degree itself .
and , uh , i guess , i wanted to , uh , with a little , you know , with a program , with me rather than , uh ,
yeah .
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
where , where did you go ?
okay .
uh-huh .
i went to utah state university which is in utah , and the nice thing about the nice thing is , i knew that i wanted to get into business and that , their business of business ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and say it's going to say in the dallas and most of the tree and the states were so much .
and ,
yeah .
like you mentioned , before the name and the college and , can give you and just , uh , another thing that i don't , the cowboys was that , the , the issue .
i wanted to make sure that i would be able to afford it , that i wouldn't get through three , four years of the work and , and have to leave .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , i guess , a lot of friends with , with family , with , uh , at least high school , and also read some , on the program ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , it was kind of unusual because my , my two older brothers and i went to all , three million bucks , what type of activities was there .
None
right .
hopefully we , we are the one that was best for us ,
and , i think they were very good at that and ,
None
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , which is , you know , or something to , uh , try to pay for your own ,
yeah .
i don't think so .
no .
i don't know .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
yeah
and that , that your children can do the same problems of that .
uh-huh .
that's an excellent idea .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
and the best to do staying and i was able to , to work for and and , and , and , and ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
once he got past his husband's husband and a friend who was in my office out ,
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and , uh , the first point of mine are , are good talking to you .
yeah ,
that's what , that's the only option right now .
yeah
yes ,
and , and then as far as my rights do ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it's a lot of the hard to think they would tell you about any of their homes , you know , these , their goods but that people have that i have done that , like from other countries , especially ,
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
they're much more responsible .
so ,
uh-huh .
they're allergic to do that , in lunch time ,
i , uh , i don't know that the people that do that are more people that are better ,
society better .
and you know , i really agree with you .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
i was working on a degree desk
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it changed , it probably is an best car ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , the other of the program and stuff with , i guess , in fact , if they had to do it all again , you know ,
after that , you know , you never think of it because , i guess i need for all of my college education , i never thought about that i had doing one because i had all college else i'd come into .
huh .
uh-huh .
but ,
and , i think , you know , can you have your college budget now , because i had them because i'm working in a position at five years old ,
yeah .
huh . and then
uh-huh .
and , i think they would have a good show that ,
so ,
yes .
that does that ?
yes .
i know one of my neighbors , uh , did that in bed , from pittsburgh .
uh-huh .
and ,
now that i'm thirty years old , i think that one or two years of my life would have ,
probably like you said , to be able to travel some place where it hurts the united states or the outside of the country ,
uh-huh .
well , i think that would have a very good , um , experience for me .
uh-huh .
it puts you out on your own
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , i think that would be nice to find ,
yes .
less personally ,
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
thinking less of your own needs to say ,
yeah .
of other people .
and , uh , i think that we have a nice , not around here ,
i ,
uh-huh .
and , i think i was paid for , uh , nine thousand dollars for the year and i worked in a very rural school district
uh-huh .
and maybe the , the one of the things i taught was a computer class and the kids , um , i know , every girl i taught for , one was , for pregnant .
and , uh , i think that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the , the the news , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
many of the boys in the room had two years
and they were , they were high school for the house .
uh-huh .
and i just ,
uh-huh .
they were going to protect anybody in
and ,
it was very difficult for them to hire ,
right .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i think it's a really good idea . because of it does even know .
see , i never ,
uh-huh .
yes .
uh-huh .
yeah .
i ,
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
i don't exactly recommend
yeah .
yeah .
right .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
and they are just a lot more humid ,
uh-huh .
than the average student
and like she's said slow ,
yeah .
i think it would also help them if they did on the house to play .
so ,
uh-huh .
beginning
and then at the end i had to be too serious .
and that's something like that ,
a lot of people they want through
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
they just spend all there time
yeah ,
that's true .
and they do a lot of things to themselves that , that we don't really want our other people to be doing
i ,
uh-huh ,
that's right .
um .
i ,
yeah ,
yeah .
and whatnot ,
uh-huh .
and they know the , the other day ,
be- ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
that's true .
and ,
and , uh , you know ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , of course , we did any other things .
uh-huh .
and so ,
i really think ,
uh-huh .
you should ,
and , uh ,
the kids today i teach ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
they don't understand ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-uh .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and
and , uh ,
a friend of mine is a lot
yeah .
i guess he's a technical writer down to he likes to ,
uh-huh .
you know ,
most young people are in marriage too ,
that's true . it
and everything has to be an automatic ,
and , uh ,
that's really true .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
i know , i don't know , that would be definitely going here
yeah .
uh-huh .
so , i think that , uh , have recently called that , uh , the jury who has increased the deficit for the peace corps .
and ,
uh-huh .
i guess that , because of the girls in the schools , uh , they've been following the peace corps .
some of the , i guess it's some of the peace corps in the sense , you don't say ,
uh-huh .
when they're some of the military off ,
huh .
some of that money has gone into the peace corps
and , uh ,
and say , i have a big change , i think in a high school system , i don't know somebody ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and friends that , um , i know when i was in high school i had a lot of an idea where i really wanted to do with what my , what i was going to study
and at least i had some interest in the ,
a lot of the toyota that i come in with us are , i say , they want to be a doctor , i want to be a lawyer .
why ?
because they make a lot of money .
yeah .
yeah ,
that's true .
yeah .
they don't have a decision ,
they don't have an interest in their own field of training .
uh-huh .
they're just looking all having to pay the jury so much .
yeah ,
that's very true .
uh-huh .
is it they say we have so many people doing this country ,
i ,
uh-huh .
in the washington ,
area .
area , are lawyers ,
yes .
and , and the only thing i think about .
yes .
yeah ,
there's just too many people .
uh-huh .
and with the only great money that we need in today and science and in , uh , you know , the , the problems we have with aids and , and cancer , how happened is everybody , you know ,
that's right .
uh-huh .
yeah .
right .
uh-huh .
and , you know , if you want to be a lawyer because you know that you can provide a service that people need to have to participate in this country , but if you're not just because it was what you think that's the best way to ,
yeah ,
you saw ,
be rich .
statistics that lawyers and make the doctors in the long room in the long time .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
that's true .
that's kind of sad .
and say it was ,
that's interesting . um ,
and whatnot ,
okay .
hey ,
thanks so much for the conversation .
uh-huh .
i enjoyed it .
yeah .
bye-bye .
thanks .
bye-bye .
okay
was i supposed to do something ?
no .
i had to press one .
good
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
sure .
should we have been there ?
uh-huh .
did we do what was correct there ?
i think we should have stayed longer .
should we have touched them all ?
used more weapons to choose their air conditioning that doesn't require ?
and they say , we don't have it ,
well if we have to think there are no way there and catch them doing what we did .
uh-huh .
yeah .
i think we should have stayed and kind of helped the people in terms of it out now because it's kind of a like civil war going on now .
and ,
and ,
would that be so bad ?
was there anything there to begin with ?
uh-huh .
it wasn't ours .
yeah .
uh-huh .
we've got to talk so it's just , just as well we are .
yeah .
uh-huh .
i think we should have helped the , the aids people in america out a little bit more ,
i agree .
than , rather than just where we did .
wouldn't it have been wonderful if we could have the country .
yes
uh-huh .
yeah .
so other political things that's going on .
i heard the hell who's saying , me rather than bush else , that he had , uh , wanted to improve the jury .
uh-huh .
yeah .
what did he say about it ?
uh-huh .
yeah ,
we don't have the money for that .
but ,
it would be really nice because i'm kind of tired of driving in terms of driving
and back east ,
you all drive at the magazine , don't you ?
what's that ?
i'm sorry , i stayed the phone
and , uh ,
i say back east you all drive at the commercials you don't have ?
yeah .
uh-huh .
see , out here in the west of a lot of our semester they are fifty-five drive .
and ,
and see ,
is
i know , i think , uh , went home to visit my kids .
my dad's in the hospital .
uh-huh .
and , uh , like here between texas and , there was probably four or three hours at four miles .
uh-huh .
uh-uh .
have you ever been out here ?
no ,
huh-uh .
how far west has you been ?
only in ohio .
uh-huh .
i've never been past year .
you've never seen the great regular mexican .
no ,
huh-uh .
i've never seen anything out , i never seen the great ,
i've seen ,
the mountains gets ?
i've never seen ,
i've seen pictures of it
i ,
nope ?
i've never been there .
i've seen pictures ,
i just , i'm a college student
and ,
and ,
and we , we were able to take vacations because there's , there's twelve kids in the family .
they ,
None
uh-huh .
worked for texas instruments for eighteen or nine now .
uh-huh .
and they say , you know , nothing else .
uh-huh .
and they go to the end of the house ,
uh-huh .
i got my four year , got my b m in the world science .
really .
yeah ,
i know ,
it's a funny degree
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and ,
uh-huh .
so tell me about where you live .
and , um ,
and that's about an hour away from where i am now .
i'm at brookhaven .
and , uh , it's , it's pretty well , like , grand and ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
it's not like a mountain .
it wouldn't be like a mountain .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i have no idea .
close to their coast ?
i would say it's closer to the university .
okay ,
uh-huh .
and left the lived in colorado springs where i live in this six hundred thousand .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i drove every year to the gulf
uh-huh .
and , you know , so i could have a lot of fresh guns until , my , twelve hours , away .
um , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
i , i'm really interested in the basic concept between west and east coast and the east coast , america .
uh-huh .
how many hours have you been from home ?
and the people from home away from the ?
yes .
, i'd say we come here or five .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
and say , when i was growing up in the past of texas ,
uh-huh .
look at your paycheck and see the , the town of the gulf side of air pollution in that .
to just go buy a pair of jeans , we'd drive an hour .
and ,
uh-huh .
when i was growing up ,
uh-huh .
now things are different
and people buy jeans in town ,
or whatever we had all of , chopped up all of up , in the morning up in your car , into the church and fishing driving four hours .
and see ,
now see for me , that's a long way .
yeah .
it is i imagine .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it's smaller than her
and ,
so that will give you some idea of where i'm at .
okay .
okay ,
i'll look at my paycheck later .
and i'm about , i'm about two hours north of east texas .
wow .
how neat .
i , uh , i mean , this little town is just a town here is actually a new car .
the college , without the college here , this town would be nothing .
it would be absolutely dead .
because it's completely made up of like food bags there
and , uh , the first time we had , uh ,
my mother family lives up there ,
we come up here in the summer ,
i ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and i work in the summer
and between what i make in the summer and student and how far , i go to college .
uh-huh .
what's your major ?
uh-uh .
uh-uh .
uh-huh .
and that's a good thing .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
no
no ,
no ,
no ,
uh-huh .
and i'd say to work for a company or not a little wood or something .
i'd rather work for a company and , uh , like be the soviet eye or something .
yeah .
that would be neat
yeah .
uh-huh .
b y is coming to town .
and ,
yes .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
take a lot a little bit .
uh-huh .
and stuff like that the only differences is there ?
yeah .
see that's what it is here too .
and , by medical countries and i did run to death row or ten percent .
uh-huh .
and the problem is that there are no good time full people for him a thousand dollar drug testing now .
yeah .
it's even getting hard for the four year to find people jobs .
yes .
it is .
i know people they are out of school for two or three years
and they have a job that has nothing to do that
okay
i'll let you go ahead
okay .
and , uh , i have a family around all together .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
oh .
and that , uh , have a lot of hers that are still about four and , uh , my youngest .
that's great .
i always thought it'd be great to have nothing .
and they go to the end of the house ,
if you like doing everything twice
and stuff ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
was more than a full-time job .
i ,
uh-huh .
worked about seven hours a week , because i worked , every worked out sunday hours every night .
uh-huh .
and , uh , i guess i have to spend as much time with them as i , as i should have , as i really wanted to .
your first ones you mean , it ,
yeah .
the ,
was this way ?
yeah ,
the f- ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i , uh , i think , an article , i think , on the oldest two .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
oh .
uh-huh .
right .
kind of hard to notice that dad isn't around ,
very much .
uh-huh .
went back to school and got my degree when i was thirty years ago .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
a week .
so , uh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i'm helping the kids more with their cards in the evenings .
uh-huh .
there's a movie theater that you couldn't handle anybody on herself .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
movies .
and ,
uh-huh .
i feel like i'm a lot closer to the three that are still living at home where i was to the two that were living there before .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i have one son who's gone
and ,
huh .
yeah .
that's difficult .
and , uh ,
yeah .
a- ,
and , uh ,
her and i get along a lot better now that she's moved in the house
uh-huh
it happens that way
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
children and , and going out in and doing things .
and , you know , i think you're going to death by all these miles into
i ,
uh-huh .
and , you know , it just ,
i saw the family falling down by ,
texas is ,
there .
much worst for the drugs .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and that's all the way you can do .
yeah .
what's your , been your experience ?
i mean , i think , i don't want to do , too , your husband ?
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
um , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the world , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
she just recently started working then .
she just recently ,
uh-huh .
started working .
yeah .
and , uh , she had a job that was too soon because he was in .
i ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and there's a lot of these people that have gone up .
huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
when you have younger ones to take care of it , maybe you do not take as much time for the older ones .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and those activities helped a lot of ,
uh-huh .
giving us things to do with the children .
and , uh , we try to take a vacation with them , every year of some , something that wasn't going to do .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
they're ,
and ,
and they'll all be married .
uh-huh .
they , uh ,
t v lives in september , you don't know where that is .
certainly do .
okay .
two of our children live there .
and , uh , i like , i said , near , in fact , in , in maryland , d c .
he works right on the border of d c .
uh-huh .
and one lives in september and put on occasion
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
that sounds great .
and i've noticed , uh , another thing , um , when i was younger i was always working .
uh-huh .
i ,
i ,
they have to .
yeah .
yeah .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
and i never saw him .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
to go , to follow .
you ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
a parent , and that kind of thing , because ,
yeah .
and , i can't remember him all day with my dad and then ,
uh-huh .
catch with my dad , or doing anything with my dad .
and that does make a big difference .
yeah .
and ,
if you don't have ,
i don't ,
i ,
uh-huh .
it's my feeling that if you don't have a role to fix so well , it's kind of tough .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
i ,
that's , that's ,
well none of us .
let's face it ,
yeah .
and , you know , we're not trying to get them in , i mean , those shows on it .
i mean ,
yeah .
there's much more difficult than that .
yeah .
i ,
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
right .
right .
i ,
now , our daughter , our , our daughter , she's very young , she has a , his only , the one that has one children .
she has two boys .
and ,
and ,
she's able to do that
and ,
and ,
i'm kind of old fashioned , i guess , that way .
yes .
they , uh , they seem to give , uh , quality time to those children when they are together .
and , and so , it seems like it , it seems to be that it works out all right .
uh-huh .
and , i don't think i ever have what would have it would take to work full time and raise a family .
None
yes .
i ,
it's , it's not easy .
yeah .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
as best i could at home .
uh-huh .
and , uh , as far as , uh , with five minutes it takes a lot of time .
yes .
it does ,
even ,
it , it ,
yeah .
if , even if all her all the time , there's still a lot of things that have to be done .
yeah .
what line of work are you in now when you went to school
and , ]
and say , i guess , i work for texas instruments .
oh ,
okay .
uh-huh .
okay .
and a lot of the people i've , i've talked to , i work for , uh , for the same .
yeah .
they ,
and , uh ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
which your income would be a lot better ,
and they say , they have a lot of people that are going to be able to do it .
now .
right . ]
yeah .
yeah .
it , uh ,
uh-huh .
they ,
uh-huh .
i was more significant than the position i was watching .
right .
and , uh ,
i ,
it was ,
kind of a waste of a person .
yes .
i , i ,
you know .
felt that it certainly was ,
i mean ,
uh-huh .
i was responsible than most of the people that i was working for .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
i ,
uh-huh .
and they ,
had ,
and , you know , this would be ,
no
oh ,
yeah .
and , uh ,
do something about it .
yeah .
and , uh , started back to school .
in fact , i was going to school while i was working hours a week
and that's why i ,
uh-huh .
you know if you're working , if you're taking twelve at night and you're working hours a week that's , there's not much time to spend to spend with ,
and , it depends on a highway , your wife and your wife and your family .
yeah
and , the only thing you can afford to try and stay out as much as you can do ,
yeah
yeah ,
yeah .
and maybe it , it all over a month .
uh-huh .
so , uh ,
uh-huh
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
and it sounds like to me , uh , you're doing well .
my husband's retired ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
that's quite a change .
yeah ,
and my wife , my grandfather to try to be by the computer store .
uh-huh .
great .
it was a beautiful number for him
and , uh ,
and he still works at all other time , you know , same job as he was doing , we was only doing dark and doing it .
uh-huh .
but , uh , i guess ,
yeah .
and , uh , basically , did you want to go first , then ,
and they say , i don't know .
i , i don't own my home .
okay ,
right .
so , uh , i mean , i have a nice area in texas
and i rent my home ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , we have sure they wanted to be a house yet because we don't know if we're going to be staying here .
sure ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
None
yeah .
and ,
we're out of the cities quite a lot ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , just a lot of snow , uh , three of four blocks home .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and there's a letter from school to having some cases who has a lot of money
yeah .
what we can view the river from that , that you'd still get rid of our education area , you know , pretty typical of what our home is ,
uh-huh
uh-huh .
None
yeah .
they ,
and our father , our house , we got , i'm sure from the same house for their company that
and , uh ,
uh-huh ,
and ,
and , uh ,
sure .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
it just seems like ,
we have a three bedroom house .
ours is one level only .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
so , it's the key people .
yeah ,
we have two , two living areas and a dining room and a big kitchen
i ,
uh-huh .
the bedrooms are a little bit small except the doctor had a little bigger .
yeah ,
yeah .
None
it's kind of like what ours is .
and , uh , one of our things are really good
uh-huh .
so that was our best way of going with , uh , the small risk because they are making health bills at four o'clock .
it seems like they get small
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and , uh , i don't know if we need to talk about any more or whatever .
uh-huh .
the t i ?
uh-huh .
and there's something ,
and , uh , three times a week
uh-huh .
i'm fairly new to it ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
are you in texas ?
no ,
huh-uh .
no ,
yeah ,
no ,
i'm out of state .
i'm in wisconsin ,
None
and ,
yeah ,
yeah .
oh .
so ,
sounds interesting .
and other people , that , not sure ,
is this your first time ?
no ,
huh-uh .
and i've seen , i had any two calls .
uh-huh .
and , uh , i think that ,
i'm always the one that the calls because i kind of like it because it's like i can get it done with it
yeah .
and don't have to wait until somebody else to me even though i have a feeling going to happen is probably for instance , get rid of , you know , so , or later .
yeah ,
yeah ,
and , uh , we talked to some people from some cases
uh- ,
uh-huh .
and ,
yeah ,
yeah .
yeah .
yeah ,
sure .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
i ,
okay ,
and , you know , it's nice to say ,
okay ,
thanks .
bye , now .
bye-bye .
okay ,
uh-huh .
and ,
probably so ,
yeah .
or ,
yeah ,
it'll be hard to get people to give up their minds .
yeah ,
that's exactly it ,
uh-huh .
and that that's what we're going , um , here , where we're in , in minneapolis , is that people don't want to survive there that are registered to that ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
i think so too .
uh-huh .
yeah .
exactly .
uh-huh .
uh-huh ,
they just feel they need their car .
or if somebody gets sick .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
if ,
that's right .
you're definitely right ,
uh-huh .
yes , ]
uh-huh .
sure .
sure ,
that happens quite a bit ,
yes ,
yeah that's very true .
and they don't want to give it up and then i think we've made some problem in the united states that are going to be the best to work and the future and the car itself and , uh , you know , i guess , i don't get away from a hundred dollars .
and their other people that , i don't know ,
okay .
and another thing , other kinds of news now they were going to see .
uh-huh .
we'll try to be real old anyway .
i'm sorry for these are ,
the other thing then is , because i don't know how long they want to do ,
uh-huh .
five minutes , oh , okay .
and you're in minneapolis ,
minneapolis area ,
uh-huh .
and actually , no ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
the only problem that we have and all the whole program is pretty low in the amount of heart and board you know , these big things that are not quite a bit more , uh ,
yeah
yeah .
in minneapolis itself , because of these people are so much on the highway , there is a lot of pollution ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and they just put in a new restaurant that it's in and a little bit of your heart , you know , we have to have your car to have any car ,
and ,
at least where you
well , that's the way it has been here .
sure ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
it's not a bad idea .
uh-huh .
sure ,
sure ,
exactly ,
uh-huh .
sure .
uh-huh .
and we have just that law , i think about , a year , maybe a year and a half here in texas , but i think it's a good idea because a lot of people actually want to teach them the dollar basis , which i don't use the penalty ,
uh-huh .
sure .
uh-huh .
sure .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
i ,
uh-huh .
right .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
um .
and one of the cans that runs in terms of the , uh , into the air conditioning because he opened it ,
uh-huh .
and ,
it's probably happened to many of people ,
and ,
uh-huh .
because if you take it into a service area ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh
uh ,
yeah .
i think it's like three or four dollars a , a can go out and do about four thousand dollars to get up a slash unit in a car ,
and i think that , i don't know ,
so much of the problem ,
uh-huh .
and my husband , i don't even think of that i'm going to say it and he says , you know , that , all the people that are using and things like that .
and , ]
yeah ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh . ]
exactly .
i think you probably noticed in the cold stores and places , in the hair come now not even as many coverage down here and whatever just put it in the oven ,
yeah ,
okay ,
you want to tell me what they're doing you think about the ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so ,
the boys not the girls , the same ones .
the boys yeah ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
and , i thought it would be nice , too .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
yeah .
and , uh , i think that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the , the the news that the , the , the , the , the , the the news , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the water ,
uh-huh .
right .
right .
yes ,
yeah .
and ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
i think it would be that .
when they say this is , that they're just something that they're not ,
or are they actually ,
why , why , why did they call it a lot ,
that ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
that's what i wondered .
so ,
no , no ,
it's not ,
it's just a , just a topic ,
it'd be good character .
i think so , too .
i think so , too .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it would be , it'd be really good i think .
uh-huh .
right .
and whatnot ,
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the the world , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
oh yeah ,
i agree with you .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i ,
uh-huh .
right .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh ,
yeah .
so ,
or ,
uh-huh .
i agree with you ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and maybe they , uh , more than so many people , um , just assumed and have their opinions on their minds , and that region with , uh , you know , to get a taste of what the real world is doing about the government that should be doing .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah ,
right .
uh-huh .
because that's one thing that's , hard with young people , you can't , you tell them how they are things for how to do they want for themselves now of this day of course might be being able to teach each time ,
i don't know what their thought is on what age that this should be done .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the the world , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
right ,
right ,
course now peace corps , that couldn't be done of course , then they were done with that , uh ,
uh-huh .
and , you know , something that was outside of , uh , outside of school ,
and , yeah ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
kind of an incredible penalty .
uh-huh ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
huh-uh .
uh-huh .
no ,
and like i said , not , now all these people are good to do something ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
right .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
they're just not made to do that type of thing and they just do they are willing to do it .
yeah ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
it'd be good
uh-huh .
okay ,
it's unreal .
are you still there ?
i'm ready
okay
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
oh yeah ,
huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
None
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
we try to get out maybe like once every month and a half of something like that ,
so ,
right .
uh-huh .
oh
and see you , you know , train around and everything , you know .
uh-huh .
and then like to , you know , good and food and all the money .
yeah .
None
yeah ,
yeah ,
right .
right ,
right .
where you don't feel uncomfortable and , you know and just can sit , and spend more money as you want .
uh-huh .
and say ,
we're almost in dallas .
we're just north of dallas .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
it's about ten miles and there is all kinds of restaurants
and , uh , i guess that was a big one for a long time ,
and then it changed us and then the same thing
and then it finally went out of town .
um , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the world , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
uh-huh .
it had a hero .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
it was really nice .
they had entertainment sometimes
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
and you could just really sit there and enjoy it .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
oh .
but ,
this is only a little small city .
uh-huh .
excuse me , i didn't think my kids would come back .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and they have , they have the prime opinions on , uh , weekends and then they have about six miles from here , is called a little city called ,
and they have a lawyer there that they buy that food ,
and the atmosphere there is really , really nice .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right .
but , uh , we have a lot of these tests here in the small city
that is probably very fortunate for you .
do you have kids ?
do i have kids ?
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
it's got a lot of the old news that would take a dinner party every night , you know ,
uh-huh .
and shrimp may come in a week ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and i hate these people .
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh ,
they do ,
and ,
no ,
no ,
i'm sure there isn't .
uh-huh .
and ,
and you're tired
and , you know , you just are able to give in that ,
and ,
i know .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
and ,
yeah .
yeah .
i , uh ,
uh-huh .
None
and maybe a , though , what can we talk about ?
yeah .
uh-huh .
is it ?
that's what i've heard , yeah .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
yeah
and ,
have you always lived there ?
oh .
i came from iowa when i was sixteen so i've lived out in california for a long time , long time .
and you like it ?
yeah ,
i like it real well .
yeah ,
we've been .
we used to live in ,
and ,
uh-huh .
but , uh , i guess , i have a kid ,
and , uh ,
i had a tune in between ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
i really miss them . you know ,
yeah .
do you miss living there ?
and they go ,
no .
i really don't miss living there .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
but , uh , as far as the family , no problem with it .
um , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the world , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is ,
i go all the time .
oh really ?
yeah ,
um , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the world , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
uh-huh .
and i have a twenty-one year old daughter in college there and , she is , um , a world reporter and her daughter in california .
uh-huh .
um , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the world , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
i know california pretty well .
uh-huh .
and i love it ,
and ,
or the same we were going to buy one of the person with the same to lose here .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i have my twelve year old in school and she's happy .
she always lived here in the south ,
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
and i have to admit that we just moved to him recently and that i hadn't voted in an election ,
yeah .
that's the first time i've ever done that .
has , been all your room ?
my major problems .
and ,
i mean , i think ,
uh-huh .
and , i mean , i guess that's very nice until i've heard of the old .
uh-huh .
when i felt my vote was really interesting down the line of the shopping .
yes .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
that's really true .
that's kind of the way i have felt .
and , i also feel guilty of , uh , not giving the amount of the office cards and then , that helps the expense and stuff .
course , we only have mostly the market in the world ,
i , uh , i have been thinking of our daughter that i've been able to understand what the children and that , because i was a new one .
uh-huh .
you really have to do study to get yourself , uh , to build up with what is going on and do that a lot of research
it does .
and , uh ,
yes .
and they said that , uh , and that are not , we are always , uh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
no .
and kong a lot of time to , and things to take out and , uh , study the issues in terms of me would take quite a bit of time and i don't have the time to have to that and , and that you never find the time that are running to be honest and be .
uh-huh .
yeah .
no .
and , uh , i think that , uh , we find that we in , again , i believe .
right .
so ,
uh-huh .
take it ,
because it is a task that is , to me , kind of come to ,
yes ,
and , uh ,
right ,
they just want to see how close the teachers are not with the public schools .
right
yeah .
and ,
it's awful ,
and ,
i , uh , i guess ,
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
and it's hard to , to say the , the trim , say , and , and , and what you know ,
and ,
i'm glad ,
i mean , i guess , i have a lot of ,
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
yes .
i'm glad that that happened and everything
well , i don't think that they will give me a better , a difference in ,
yeah .
and , uh , i guess that are a good seat ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , when we have , uh , when we have , uh , a local area , for our country and so forth they really , uh , give a lot of information in the local time , not in the , not the current city center ,
i mean , they , they just give it a small bit of the newspaper ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , i feel like the same way it's put up .
uh-huh .
now , i wouldn't say that about the larger cities , though and , the , the country on , like , the , the water .
right .
right .
uh-huh .
right .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
or something like that , uh , a good reputation , uh , a new york or whatever they have the choice to have them .
right .
and , uh ,
yeah ,
yeah .
and , uh , it seems like the last night ,
you want to go first ?
i believe that , the majority of the , the voice , that , uh , this call for about four weeks ,
yeah ,
like the longest , if , should the government make it or something like that .
yeah .
yes ,
i , i , i think that would be to be able to , that ,
uh-huh .
you , you would be in favor of it ?
yeah .
yes .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
and that out there are some different countries that are , uh , very successful with the government of the government , uh , plan that .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
do you ,
uh-huh .
i know it has been a lot of life .
uh-huh .
or something like that , uh , the history of all of the , uh , the fact that , uh , the country that has very well with it ,
and ,
uh-huh .
that's the way with me ,
i don't know a whole lot about it .
i was ,
that's the only reason i would have , because i think there are less of the doctor is a lot of it has to do with the ,
i mean , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and ,
yes ,
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
i think that's general , is if you have a good relationship with your son that you can feel free to fix with anything .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
or to change even , like if you didn't know if you're going to make it all these money .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
there , that's one of my main way .
and , i have a friend that has , their boy has been into this morning ,
and , uh just , have been the same thing in the house .
and they have gone through , uh , one , two , three , four , three weeks ago and then a day and stuff ,
uh-huh .
it took that long .
yes ,
and the expense of that , yes .
and that , that , something like that , you know , i thought , if you can change or look again , you know , for help , if you come ,
i don't know how that program works , you know , if you can do that .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
i'm sure that , uh , i think they have a new card and , and everything that they would have , uh ,
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
so ,
yes ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , i think they should be on the public school .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
for them to have a choice on if they're in favor of it or not .
right ,
yes .
it , it would be .
and course they would give a lot of medical plan because they would be ,
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and that , they have to all the facts and all the , uh , what it would mean to each other or another capital company , especially being younger .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right .
uh-huh .
and some of my son where they have , uh , an option right now where they can have their own household
uh-huh .
so , uh ,
he said ,
and ,
and ,
uh-huh .
right .
and , uh , again , we had a good service .
he took the less expensive one of course .
uh-huh .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
they ,
so ,
right ,
right .
yeah .
yeah ,
cause there's always that part today music .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
i'm , i'm very aware that i am not into any color
yeah .
that's right
you really are ,
yeah ,
yeah .
yes .
and , uh , we have a new house here in texas .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , are you familiar with the area that are all of the ?
and , i mean , they have the same ones that they were ,
where ?
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
okay .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
are you a native musician ?
yes ,
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
okay ,
uh-huh .
None
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
that's a nice state ,
that's a real nice state ,
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
yes it is ,
it's very lovely ,
it's a very lovely state .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh i'm sure it is ,
uh-huh .
so ,
of course we have good here too ,
we've been pretty fortunate .
we've had some of the most outstanding doctors in our area for some of the different songs .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
that has been so much also .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the , the , the the news , the , the , the , the , the water ,
yeah .
and that is the , the candidates that are , you know , are going up , um ,
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
they ,
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it's just , it's an inner s , that's what it is a lot of one .
it sure is .
i still wish they could do more with the enemy , though , anymore .
yes ,
i do too .
and they , they just don't have to be able to ,
i know they're making looking , but like , i don't like that i would see , yeah .
to it runs how , you know .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
i guess you ,
uh-huh .
and ,
that's true , too .
uh-huh .
it's ,
i , i , i really believe our children have a lot of problems with it .
and say they said , i don't know that , and that are worse than the government
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
yeah .
and , you know , just to have the electric to their little room to their age that they want to ,
take their rights away from them , they say
i never had the ability ,
yeah .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
None
uh-huh .
it's hard to break ,
it's a hard one to quit .
yeah ,
yeah .
yes .
it's ,
they say that it is .
yeah .
yes ,
very nice talking to you too ,
and you have a good day .
and ,
and , uh ,
right
okay ,
you ,
bye-bye .
okay ,
bye-bye .
and they , you know , what kind of , do you like to eat out ?
yes .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,

uh-huh .
that's at least saint and b l s ,
uh-huh .

uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yes ,

now the only problem , ]
i love the food .
uh-huh .
it's a lot of different vegetables and a good machine ,
i , uh , the service has been so funny , maybe a little bit in fact i've been there .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
huh . ]
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
the service is great .
uh-huh .
they have every kind of fish that you could imagine you'd want to the , the atmosphere and really is wonderful .
uh-huh .
if you want a really special night out and then make one good job to go to a place .
oh yeah ,
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
i can remember when our children were small .
uh-huh .
we lived in the chicago area at the time ,
yeah
and ,
i know .
i can't look a day in the face now .
and , i know ,
uh-huh .
and ,
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and cheap ,
and cheap .
yeah ,
but ,
uh-huh .
yes ,
uh-huh .
yes yes .
sounds like my grandchildren .
yeah ,
i know .
yeah .
and , uh ,
and , uh ,
and , uh , the only one we had to eat out ,
and see ,
of course , it's just so much easier and stuff .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
yeah ,
yeah .
and ,
uh-huh .
me too .
uh-huh .
and ,
i ,
and , uh ,
no .
and , uh ,
and , uh , like we had to go out to lunch on saturdays .
i like exercising out .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
i like the there in plano .
yeah ,
oh .
yeah .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yes ,
and i love ,
but ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
we think it's good .
now i haven't been there ,
i went to one i think in ohio or , or , or somewhere up there ,
yeah .
i know it's just down the street .
uh-huh .
it's good .
uh-huh .
yes ,
yes .
yes .
and we like ,
yes ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah ,
it , it's fun .
and stuff like that , in your yard , where , uh , country , city has been .
oh .
have you tried it ?
i've been , i've been there twice ,
uh-huh ,
yeah ,
None
we like it because it's fairly reasonable
and they have , we go for the salad and then .
salad it's ,
yes .
according , do you have any children ?
yes ,
i have a twelve year old ,
yeah .
i haven't needed child care except for my mom .
even
oh .
i've been real lucky .
i'm a nurse ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
then i'm home to pick her up .
yeah .
that is lucky .
yeah .
and , i mean , they were going to do it .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
and , i feel like ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
and , uh , and then , you know , for a long time ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and we have a neighbor on the next year that we won't come so over there and go to school with ,
yeah .
None
not after yourself ,
i don't know what day we'll stop .
uh-huh .
and then her father went through the last day and all kinds of stuff ,
and ,
and , um ,
and ,
yeah .
so even though she's twelve , you could just have a kid ,
she is .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
i'm , i'm glad they're too
uh-huh .
i read the , the two and three and four , five and a half , a girl ,
uh-huh .
and ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and ,
uh-huh .
no .
yeah .
i know the hospital that i work in is a big hospital
yeah .
uh-huh .
and lots of times they charge it for all the week and not their children to leave ,
yeah .
they can eat lunch with them ,
if they feel sick they can call them at work and they run and over on them ,
oh .
and they feel a little better than if they got them off somewhere on the way .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah , ]
it is nice . ]
and , uh , i know , some of these stuff ,
and , uh ,
when i was in school and needed a few money .
right , right ?
uh-huh .
well , that's right .
and ,
yeah ,
right .
and , uh ,
and no one will look out , with them ,
and ,
right .
uh-huh .
rather than having one where they would have the next year to school in a week or something ,
yeah .
i would prefer to have in home care , either my own one or a baby-sitter or something .
yeah .
just never know .
i prefer the for little girl next door for a year or so when her first parents were out of the ,
uh-huh .
and ,
they were the same age ,
and , uh ,
and , uh ,
right .
i like you said , you tend to go more for the other side because she is just involved in the world
it is hard .
and , oh , it was just a nice time .
my daughter got married
and , uh , just the same thing when they were just as far as everything , because she had to be there every day .
no .
no .
uh-huh .
None
and , uh ,
they do .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and know , i know .
well pertaining you would have to be , uh , come up to a day care and be just for four to large rights .
yeah . ]
so i think , uh , my wife would be a small , small , if i had to find something that take care of the small , that someone knew i
yeah ,
and maybe a lot of women are going to say ,
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
and ,
no .
i never have done it ,
and , uh ,
i would rather do without some things that really aren't very important to have to dress with my child or when they're growing up .
None
and ,
in the day .
no there isn't ,
there isn't any time ,
that's true .
and , uh , the time was no time to have to pick and have some money they have ,
and ,
but ,
okay .
so ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and whatnot ,
huh-uh .
maybe .
there are some jobs where i guess it doesn't really ,
yeah .
and ,
yeah .
if , if it's a position where it could be , e- ,
that's true
i didn't think about that ,
like for instance ,
if , if , if ,
yeah .
right .
or say driving trucks or , virginia or whatever like metric system or something like that .
then that is something that the trend , that is the community .
and you know , if you're , you're on drugs or whatever , you're driving a city you usually take several hours in your hands .
right .
and then that you're a computer pump and , uh , there's really big deal ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
that maybe it's not necessary .
and for me , i think that drug testing , it varies in the world that society is going in .
if more and more people are using drugs then that i don't have some people to discuss against people that are using drugs .
huh-uh .
and ,
and ,
and the rest of the drug testing is something that the drug testing is not to choose .
yeah .
well anybody , i think it may be , in it , in that respect , i think it may help a lot .
i think it may be pushing people , hopefully push away from a little bit better ,
yeah .
but , uh , no ,
yeah ,
i think that may be .
if you use drugs , you won't get the job .
i mean , ]
that means one of the points of it .
so ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah . ]
i don't know ,
they may not be able to fix it .
i don't know how far they are .
and don't know what the , you know , are studying .
i don't know
that would actually be an interesting thing to find out , i think .
i don't , i don't know how long things really stay in the ground , in the grocery store .
i've heard some , i've heard some things will be able for six months ,
some stay for less ,
some stay for longer .
yeah .
things like l d s , i guess , stay forever .
um .
in some ways ,
yeah .
and , uh ,
and , i think , i guess .
something like that ,
yeah .
and , uh , there must be some , some ,
i mean , you know , these little things you know ,
um , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
of some sort ,
yeah .
yeah .
i mean , i don't think any of those problems .
i don't really drink or anything ,
uh-huh .
just the fact that since i don't use drugs , i have no problem with taking a lot .
right .
and , see , if you finally come out at all ,
yeah .
and ,
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
so , uh , i think i would have to be able to go and , and ,
uh-huh .
if you don't have anything to hawaii , you're not going to mind it .
uh-huh .
right .
uh-huh .
and then there are some things that just aren't business ,
right .
that , that , that ,
that come out at that point
uh-huh .
i ,
i can , i can understand that .
that's a fine line to replace .
huh-uh .
huh-uh .
i , uh , i think that's really good .
yeah ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
and , uh , you know , what about the rights ,
huh-uh .
to privacy ,
what if they're doing something legal ,
yeah .
right .
you know .
right .
like , especially in the case of the .
you know , if someone is something more than a social , republican system , hey , we've not been an expert , what do you do ?
yeah .
yeah .
None
i mean , i took a lot of pasta once
and ,
uh-huh .
and then a doctor journal stadium was , you know , like your mother ?
you know ?
i said , yes .
do you hate your mother ?
no .
have you ever killed your mother ?
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
what in the world .
those are just to get , probably to get some sort of , those are to get the value out of people .
or just to see , ]
is that what it was ?
shock .
i do some , i'm a graduate student in terms of .
uh-huh .
and ,
so , i know a little bit of that kind of stuff .
huh-uh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
huh-uh .
and , and ,
kind of get ,
kind of get something to my money's at it .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
around and being ,
yeah .
maybe
it can be dirty
i ,
yeah
shock you .
they ask why i was going ,
what in the world are you asking me about here .
you know . ]
yeah .
i ,
i don't know
yeah ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah
big jump there .
you know . ]
yeah .
and , yeah ,
i think it's their way of saying how well you do ,
huh-uh .
in a shock situation without worrying about ,
huh-uh . ]
stuff like that .
uh-huh .
i never thought about that ,
that makes me feel a little better
of course , that was years and years ago .
yeah .
and , uh ,
yeah ,
and i don't think that you killed your mother though ,
i wouldn't worry about that .
and stuff ,
because in society a lot of people are taking drugs .
there is also people that are getting off and ready to do so much with their lives .
uh-huh .
and the stuff that happened to them , you know , five years ago up
and , uh , it would be a little better for a little bit .
uh-huh .
yeah .
improve their lives .
yeah .
uh-huh .
huh-uh .
unless they say , well , look , if they stay in , they could walk in and say , look , i did do drugs a year ago ,
huh-uh . ]
and ,
huh-uh .
i'll be happy to take the test ,
yeah ,
yeah .
yeah .
even ,
i would probably do that .
and that would probably bring in something that had been to such and such a bit against for yourself , or , you know ,
yeah .
whatever the twelve month program .
or whatever it is that they do .
yeah .
because , i mean , then , then they can't afford it , they have to think on the weekends
huh-uh .
yeah .
i don't know what the laws are willing to this .
yeah .
yeah .
my wife probably does .
i'm not sure what they are either .
i don't , i don't know
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and the other day we had talked about , uh , capital punishment .
oh , i don't know , i don't know ,
and ,
uh-huh .
or it was a little bit of sand and , and what do it about what i think
uh-huh .
i'm not real sure what i think about it .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
i sort of like that stuff ,
it makes you think .
huh-uh .
really ,
really .
yeah .
okay .
it was very nice talking to you .
nice talking to you .
okay .
take care .
bye-bye .
bye-bye .
and whatnot ,
yeah .
how about you ?
well , i think they have a lot of different things .
excuse me ?
i think they waste what , all the money that we pay
yeah ,
that's what i think too .
uh-huh .
we moved here from another state .
we lived here before , went out and came back ,
and that particular state had an income tax , but not this tax percent .
uh-huh .
and what you find out is , there's one , is the best way as the same .
here you don't , there's no problem with their food
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
now it's even , it's not higher in dallas county ,
None
was it . ]
yeah ,
and ,
it's eight and a quarter i think .
yeah ,
it is .
i was shocked .
i went ,
we bought a new orleans
and the man said , and that's eight years old .
i said , eight percent . what
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
and then you know , what you have , in terms of , you know , all your benefits in the world ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
is that what you think ?
yeah ,
because it's , at some point it goes up to thirty-five percent
and then the people that make , you know , five hundred thousand dollars and , and , and more pressure because they don't have to ,
yeah .
doesn't seem quite fair , does it ?
no ,
it isn't .
because they have the money to solve what movies
and ,
what ?
uh-huh .
huh-uh .
they somehow seem to get around these ,
yeah .
that make , don't make that kind of money .
right .
i don't know .
uh-huh .
i could see if they're losing money ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i know ,
and ,
and then , i ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
some , he didn't look that good .
okay .
right .
uh-huh .
right .
and find a lot of having , it's almost so much money and that , uh , the biggest way was a lot of all of it out of you know .
uh-huh .
or do you ?
i just prefer the federal tax life and then .
and do you feel like you get into , you know , too much ,
yeah ,
i just got older ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
we rented .
uh-huh .
we don't have children ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it's not as bad as being single and our ,
and , uh ,
and , i mean , it doesn't even pay for me to a good reputation , because ,
doesn't that sound stupid .
uh-huh .
i mean , i think , there's a better budget for instance , i don't work any one time to call my husband , you know . ]
right .
uh-huh .
whoever works less , they can get a tax credit for that .
excuse me .
uh-huh .
if both of the , both of the work , then you get a tax credit for you .
right .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
for everybody .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
then you get a , you get a child care of ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
i guess that's my call .
i guess i better go
uh-huh .
okay ,
yeah .
nice talking to you .
uh-huh ,
bye-bye .
what part of the country are you in ?
uh , yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
east or west , i'm from pittsburgh . ]
uh-huh .
yeah .
what part of speech ?
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , where are you from ?
and , uh , then
uh-huh .
i know where that is .
i mean , we live out in the country .
yeah ,
that's pretty out there .
what , well ,
yeah ,
we have , we have two children that live in pittsburgh
uh-huh .
yeah ,
i got my brother and my whole family there .
i'm , i'm talking to you from dallas right now .
uh-huh .
uh-huh
do you work , do you work for texas instruments then ?
no ,
my husband does .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and ,
no ,
i'm just ,
my son works for a c- , a computer ,
place that , that needed this . ]
yeah .
uh-huh .
well that's okay .
i guess it's an easy thing to do .
yeah .
do you have a brother or what do you have ?
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
those are beautiful .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it's a farm community ,
and ,
yeah ,
is it a , is it a senior home
or is it ?
ours is not a working farm
more , more ,
i can understand that ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
i have a garden
i , uh ,
we have a garden .
yeah ,
yeah i can hear the accent
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
we , we originally lived in dallas
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
and that's , that's what they want to hear on this , but at least a place he's going out of college ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
and they said ,
do you know offhand ?
and there's something ,
that's out near the airport .
that's about forty-five miles from us .
yeah ,
my brother has a home there he's trying to sell .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
it's ,
yeah ,
wha- , lived in a couple of long time .
that's why we not , we not remember we're not , we want to , uh , buy down here , because we lived up here much long to meet the , um , ]
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
and ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
i ,
it really is ,
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
but , you know ,
and they really ,
right .
right ,
right .
and if you , if you get anything under five hundred you know , what they put into high school we have , the big community system and , and , i just have no desire for that .
yeah ,
yeah ,
it's not good
no .
i mean , ]
and the people think the income is really great in some of those areas
that's right . ]
and when you sit down and , at least it costs to be able to work and , uh , of course , most of the homes are , you know ,
and , uh ,
yeah
but , yeah .
this is , it's like a civilian ,
like a two by two they call it in like pittsburgh .
right ,
uh-huh ,
right . ]
and it's nice .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and our neighbors ,
and , uh , prices are just on the homes , the israelis .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
they paid for it .
uh-huh .
that's how bad it ,
i know .
and , i know in the same time , i've got the same thing ,
and , uh ,
that's right .
people are responsible because they paid so much for their home .
uh-huh ,
yeah .
i have some friends that live in and
and ,
i mean you ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
and , like it said , it's , it's an old house and everything ,
how far , where is county in maryland to have , actually ,
because we're not near trying to it
that's not too bad .
yeah .
that's north .
and yeah ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i'm trying to think of the name of that town that starts from an m ,
no ,
north carolina .
yeah .
okay .
no ,
no .
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
or that you've ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
do you have a lot of land
or ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and say ,
and , uh , let's see ,
we have forty ,
we gave ten to one of our children
there you go .
did you have a hard time getting to call it ,
do you feel like you live in an accident area
or ,
no ,
not really ,
and , and things like two months and roll , you know .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
i can remember in pittsburgh when ,
uh-huh .
or it can , when i remember was in the fifties , in the ,
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
the judicial of woodworking is ,
and now it's a terrible thing .
yeah ,
it's ours up here .
we have ,
our justice system are real bad
uh-huh .
but , you know , we live at ten miles from probably three or four , not large but , you know , reasonable .
but ,
yeah ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
and they go ,
we're tired of doing it though .
we , we don't want to do too much more
how big is it ?
how many square feet do you have ?
and , uh , oh , okay .
i really .
uh-huh .
yeah ?
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
we , have a half bath code , too .
uh-huh .
we have a bath storm , and one , two , three , four bedrooms and a visa room and a room
and , uh ,
a wood works ,
yeah
i understand ,
we have that too .
that's , that's large if your children aren't at home any more .
pardon ?
that's large if your kids aren't at home any more .
uh-huh .
we , we mean ,
a lot of people say that
but , uh ,
uh-huh .
it's ,
we just like it real well
and , ]
it's enough space for two people
yeah .
yeah ,
we had five children ,
uh-huh .
and ,
they're all out on their own now .
yeah ,
right .
that's okay .
uh-huh .
th- , this year town is real high .
it's about eighteen hundred square feet .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah ,
it is ,
i mean , i would never buy it
but ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and my husband was , raised in a farm , on a farm side ,
uh-huh .
right ,
near north , ohio ,
and , uh ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
you really aren't aware because it's ,
the witnesses ,
your home is far enough that you're looking even like you're here by the enough to people ,
right .
and ,
you can have them in ,
you can go out .
uh-huh .
you have more of a choice ,
you're not fond of by bad .
that's kind of what , like
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
and they say , they don't have a lot of things that are ,
uh-huh .
when they said depend on , i didn't think that's a lot of things .
that they retired to ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh , i guess i think that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
it's like a senior , you know it's not like what i would think of when i think of old motors .
and you know , i mean , it's
it's ,
more luxury .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
right ,
right ,
it's modern ,
it's beautiful ,
right ,
yeah .
yeah .
i , uh , i don't know ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
and they , they were ,
yeah ,
i suppose they are now .
we ,
both of our children who live there have just bought a home .
now , ]
what part , what are they studying in ?
and get the in the corner area .
yeah ,
that's nice .
and , uh , the one that the , the one house is they bought the completely impact .
they didn't have to do much to it .
great .
uh-huh .
it's twenty years old , i think .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
and they , they bought the first time and then .
that's ,
yeah ,
a really good friend of mine lives in general ,
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
they're s- , going to start to see their work on their account doing a better .
yeah .
i ,
they are beautiful homes .
uh-huh .
is it called or cafe ?
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
and then he lives in all that same area from going to be younger ,
it's real pretty up there .
it's just ,
it is ,
it's real nice .
uh-huh .
and ,
and , uh ,
when you come to this part of the country , we've been away from long enough that the difference you see in the prison .
and ,
you know , you do when you want the rangers .
uh-huh .
my husband works for the state ,
and ,
uh-huh .
and then after they had to start paying to move us ,
uh-huh .
that wasn't necessarily trained any more
that's what it is here ,
yeah ,
yeah .
and ,
and what happens is , uh , that you just say that you get to get a certain age the next house that you get to be staying in
uh-huh .
right , yeah ,
you have to stop some place ,
yeah .
yeah ,
yeah .
that's kind of like where we're ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , just kind of , you know , with what kind of effort , where we want to be , you know .
uh-huh .
a lot of people say it doesn't matter where they have a lot of children have a house
and say ,
and , but i think that with a kid ,
i .
i do too ,
i've heard too many people say , i hate it here .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh just ,
i know ,
and it , the rest of texas instruments , i mean , it , it's , it's ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
and , my brother , we've got the problems for their home ,
yeah .
yeah ,
yeah .
right ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
people from c j d are only new york , here about a couple of years ago .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
so , uh , they were a big deal with great , um , because they could get a five hundred thousand dollar home with , they call it , lots faster ,
wow . ]
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and ,
yeah .
it's a little bit of , your house on your house , on a house , a lot of church in a hospital or something .
and i , i couldn't handle that
yeah ,
i know ,
and , uh ,
i can look outside right now and look into the next generation .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and get out of the , uh , motivated because , we know , mow a lot of , a little bit of ground around the house .
yeah
yeah .
and ,
i , uh , i don't know ,
i don't think i'd want to change it .
no ,
and your kids ,
and to tell you the truth , if i think that you can keep that , that way , you know , kind of like a ,
hello .
hi ,
basically , i wear pants .
i'm a real small position
and , uh , like when i was at home ,
and ,
i wear a hundred percent of the time .
not a former ,
i guess pants and a little
and , uh , the other hand in the fifties .
top v name
and , uh ,
i like sweaters a lot .
and so i do that .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
and whatnot ,
although i am not jack , i do tend to ,
uh-huh .
oh .
so that ,
i suppose , i could get away with , with our wife cake ,
uh-huh .
i wear fairly well looking forward
right .
and , uh , a lot of those are so many things that they have ,
and , uh , i guess , i have a living with , a very nice when i have , uh , or have to have been allowed to give .
uh-huh .
right .
and everything else in the past ,
do , do you change much through the season
or ,
no ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
i tend to , to use the same thing because they weren't another cold in terms of the summer .
i don't know whether they think by , you know , the rich goes up , then they can lay during the day or something .
maybe .
no .
but , uh , i think that you have a big pan in your office ,
all summer .
uh-huh .
and they go ,
well , i don't , i don't know , i'm not a clothes in the summertime that sort of a new stuff .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
and that i guess , as i mean of the pushing of them , of course , was you know , over , kill , sort of a change in , and a sense , the people i know i spend the most on clothes .
right .
although the fact that most of the ones i know are in the government and they're not taught the public it , i find it a little bit strange that their wife would , to be spend this money
you know ,
uh-huh .
then you're ,
and whatnot ,
so ,
and ,
if i need something new , i will go and buy it .
yeah .
in the summertime i wear the light
and in the forties i can see the topic .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
and ,
and , uh , especially when i went to the hood and the house and the ,
i , i , i enjoy that ,
or it just wouldn't be , uh , smart for me to do that in my home with my children .
uh-huh .
so ,
i have given videos in that , in a couple months and things like that .
now , i don't know if they consider that a job .
and ,
but , uh , when i do that i , i think i have a certain amount of things .
yeah .
exactly .
yeah .
i mean , you can look at all , in a little bit , the same suit you would know , you know .
yeah ,
i'm , i'm really glad about that because are further the opposite of how to start instead of the same .
oh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , i used to have a problem when , i was in a restaurant was in college while i was in a couple of water and , and stuff like that would just give me a terrible lover .
and see ,
None
that's not right .
right ,
right .
but ,
yeah ,
i guess so
uh-huh .
okay .
have a great day .
uh-huh .
bye .
bye-bye .
what do you think ?
and there's some , the same thing is about drug testing in the family ?
right .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
i- ,
in , other words , i am afraid of , in favor of drug testing , or , or , or drug testing .
so , uh , when i was a little bit of my job here at t i .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i think it should be more by the private group .
how about you ?
yeah ,
and stuff that the rest of americans , uh , do that .
uh-huh .
they should be , uh , drug testing now in the united states
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
like if they're going to work late all the time and , uh , if they , if they're , especially if they're on the line or there's any kind of job instead of where you , if they can , if they can , made a mistake , it would cost a lot of money or not .
sure .
then they need to be watched the hook ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
and i think , right with them .
uh-huh .
and this is , i guess , uh , drugs are the biggest problem , i think to face it happening .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and that , uh ,
yeah .
if you can't work , then you can't be a little bit harder to take , take drugs or whatever ,
i don't know .
right . ]
and whatnot up there , you know , when you get , uh , people in the office and do your own , and then it just because they can't , they can't work anymore ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
i , uh ,
that's all there is to it .
definitely ,
you , you're definitely the same thing .
and , uh , you know , it could have any way to go .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
but , uh , the biggest problem and , uh , the public and he has a , and a foreign and , and they have a gun in his own , or , even , or if you know , it's a guy at cooking a lot , i think , they're dangerous in either situation .
uh-huh .
and they ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i think it's , it's more humid now .
it's probably like forty , fifty percent .
and ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
and , uh , the only states that i've seen in , or , uh , some male type of drug testing .
right .
you know . ]
what kind of work are you in ?
and they say it at least .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh ,
yeah .
and they ,
they hired me in an eighty-four ,
uh-huh .
oh .
yeah . ]
okay .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and they say that i don't know .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
like they've been laying off a lot of people that .
and ,
and , uh , and , uh , they got the board out there for the government that had any of those problem or work .
sure .
family problems , you know .
uh-huh .
they kind of covered everything .
uh-huh .
i , uh , i don't know if they were ,
None
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
do you think there should be drug testing for political services ?
yes ,
i do .
yeah ,
i do , too .
and , because a lot of them are , you know , they're going to do .
yeah .
they ,
uh-huh .
in fact from houston . ]
yeah .
yeah .
like the , the money that both is , that they would give a big .
and ,
and , and things like that , the garbage thing , you know , it's kind of dollars .
sure ,
sure ,
yeah .
None
i would agree with you .
and , uh , you know , i can't see how we can afford the , you know , the people , uh , you know , in the military , in america , in the , to put into our criminal system , if they don't , you know ,
just doesn't make sense to have them i- , to , to worry about whether they're doing that they're doing themselves .
therefore , you want to start ?
sure .
you don't use any credit cards , i don't imagine .
no .
of course i use ,
credit cards .
yeah .
and have a couple of credit cards , and , uh , use them .
uh-huh ,
do you use them a lot ?
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
we're on a pretty strict and tight cards .
uh-huh .
we use the credit cards , when , at least when it's a problem with the government that we need to be the cash or something .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
that's a thought ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh , yeah .
do you use credit cards just ?
my husband loves them
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
and ,
uh-huh .
he likes using them and then just put at the end of the month
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the , the , the the news , the , the , the , the , the water ,
he , he likes that ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
and that's when you get into one .
yes ,
and you get in your head over .
right .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
some people i know also try to use it as where they buy something now they can
and say , well , i'm going to buy this point when it's on sale and stuff
uh-huh .
and then i can go ahead and pay for it when i get my check at the end of the month
when i'm being paid .
right .
yeah .
and ,
that's true .
uh-huh .
and some places , you know , kill me like , uh , little bit of cash or not , they could take a credit card .
right .
yeah .
uh-huh .
right .
for example down here , when you go up to a gas station you get an extra charge for credit cards for you would paying for cash .
are they the same there ?
we ,
yeah ,
we have the same thing up here ,
yeah .
yeah .
some of them charge five cents a gallon , even ,
like the gas stations more ,
that's pretty well .
and , uh ,
yes .
yeah .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
extra because actually , to me , credit cards are the same as far as ,
to me they are , anyway ,
yes ,
because you make the weather at the time of the purchase
right .
right ,
yeah .
yes .
and ,
yeah ,
right .
very good .
you're , you're one of the good , i guess , good restaurants that don't get into a problem when it comes to their budgeting .
and , i mean , we have a lot of things .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
we try hard ,
and stuff ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right .
uh-huh .
right .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
None
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
they ,
and do you find that perfect
or ,
and maybe the , i think we're going to go , actually .
and they said , i like my husband likes them ,
and ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
right .
we're , we're actually in the same boat .
uh-huh .
and like we use to , three or four , credit cards .
uh-huh .
that way we're not registered
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
and ,
and , do you find that you get an awful lot of credit cards through the mail ?
and see ,
once a week ,
twice a week ,
or three times a week .
uh-huh .
but , you know , they do that .
they make it very safe with him .
yeah .
almost too much so .
i , uh , i don't know , the fact that it would be ,
we try to limit , look at that time ,
right ,
so the giants has .
right ,
right ,
yeah .
i ,
uh-huh .
yes ,
uh-huh ,
right .
so there is the basic chevy fee for the credit card or whatever charge they within these from four to thirty-five percent , uh , based on what the best fund will ,
okay ,
miss , we should be in business in texas .
good .
uh-huh .
yes .
such as how much time , well ,
i'll ask ,
how much time do you spend with your children ,
and how many do you have ?
we have two children ,
they're both grown and married
and ,
our daughter has three sons ,
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , we have a kid in the ,
yeah .
we're together a lot on special days
and , uh , and , of course , with the holidays and everything .
yeah .
uh-huh .
i have two girls and a son ,
uh-huh .
and ,
oh .
she her husband came ,
so ,
and see ,
because we've , we , one thing we do have is right now from both .
i play in several dakota now
i ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
oh .
and around a bit good in our office .
uh-huh .
and , uh , her husband was a little bit ,
which are kind of pasta ,
yes , uh-huh .
and , uh , that's what they were there in there .
and , uh , i have a son who lives in , in , uh , pennsylvania .
uh-huh .
and ,
so ,
but ,
and my young , my youngest daughter lives in new jersey ,
and , you don't get to see any of your business probably .
and , uh , i don't know if they're going to see any of them .
yeah .
she and her husband both do .
yes ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
plays and things that go on .
but , uh ,
what do you , what do you do with your children to do with your children ?
uh-huh .
and stuff , right now for our football ,
and ,
as is our husband ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and i play with the grandchildren
i enjoy the grandchildren .
uh-huh .
and it depends ,
oh .
and , uh ,
so , uh , and the three and my boys and my husband went into and over to see the sentence payment
and this sunday ,
the soviet space penalty ?
uh-huh .
my goodness .
yeah
it's , ]
i am surprised they would bring them down there for ,
uh-huh .
i think it came here in either category or three years
i ,
uh-huh .
it's very interesting , very interesting ,
i'll bet .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , we're going to go to him see some team and go to a hawaii .
and , uh , when our house was , we have a pool ,
and ,
and ,
and ,
and , uh , we do a lot of our kids with ,
yeah .
yeah .
we've taken a lot of trips with our kids when they were younger .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
we like being with our kids ,
yeah .
and their friends enjoy being with them .
uh-huh . ]
so that which is definitely very , very young , with all these young people in their neck and out and eating ,
uh-huh .
and seems like , i've ,
the only problem is , it keeps you pretty busy , having something , you know ,
doesn't it ?
yeah .
i'm worried about christmas .
christmas instruments they don't recycle all ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
beautiful .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
with us ,
and , uh , then have a christmas party and then go to the other countries and things like that ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
morning , i , i think i would have to be able to do that , because i don't know if they were going to be able to do that .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
i go to the kitchen and cook ,
and my sister and , and her husband are coming down ,
uh-huh .
that's great .
there's a ,
the question to now , do it is to difficult time ,
and you seem to be making out all of the month .
yeah .
sometimes i'm a little student
uh-huh .
yeah .
oh yeah ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yes .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
seems like it went through a restaurant where they're spending those people a big deal .
parents kind of went and did their thing ,
kids did their thing .
and that's something that i would have to be able to do that .
no ,
and , uh ,
that's exactly what i was going to say .
yes ,
uh-huh .
of , of course , i find now that i spend more time with my grandchildren in my hands .
i know more about them and watch their minds and how they think and , and learn much more than so much my kids .
when , when your own children are growing up , you just take them for granted
and you go ahead and do your thing
i ,
okay .
do you have any children ?
and there's something ,
i have a daughter .
uh-huh .
i don't any children
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and we go fishing .
um .
and we go to school ,
and ,
uh-huh . ]
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
i don't see a lot of families fishing and doing things like that .
that's great .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and ,
and i read a day .
uh-huh .
that's great .
yeah .
i think a lot of families now , they probably don't spend enough time together .
yeah .
you know , whether their parents are together or they don't spend enough time on him
and , and that i think that goes to a lot of what women is going right now because the basic family is being spanked .
just simply because that time spent all isn't just problems like fishing
and , uh , because i think that you spend a lot of time with each other you a lot .
and , uh , the first card you had , your grandmother's , uh , just build your family .
uh-huh
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
that's pretty , to me that's pretty cheap .
yeah ,
i know .
i like that .
when i do have children i , i'm going to try as hard as i can get to wonder , i see that we spend a lot of time together , you know ,
maybe just even , if we just rent a movie and watch it just to make me that just even going to be doing their own and stuff .
uh-huh .
and , uh , just because it's not to make , you know , get away from the ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
that's right .
because then you never get to know them either .
uh-huh .
they're all grown up
and their ,
yeah .
yeah .
and , i understand it ,
i don't know ,
i haven't experienced it ,
but ,
yeah .
you know , kids are these days growing up so much . ]
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
they're out doing stuff by that time .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
i really do because , because i don't see these kids
and when , whenever we go to the park or something like the , we'll see the same programs .
uh-huh .
and , not just on the weekends we don't see very many in the same .
what do you think is the key to , to just be the military family back together ?
what kinds of things do you think ?
well , i think they can turn off the t v for one time .
yeah ,
that's true .
and ,
um .
because she always likes to do things like that when the gun end up .
uh-huh .
huh .
and , uh , i guess i'm not sure ,
like i came in from work today
first thing i did was the turn on him .
uh-huh .
because i , the israelis are thought about this year .
right .
and i like to watch t v
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it's something that you can do
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and they don't know , anything aren't doing just sitting around , you know , no matter something
and ,
at least
and ,
it's becoming really good conscious
that , uh people are starting to look out for groceries and things like that and trying to get out and find something often and walk and things like that .
and ,
if you get your family involved in finding so forth and eating tennis or something like that , that doesn't helps .
yeah ,
yeah .
um , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
yeah ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
when ,
how , how old is he ?
she's five .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah ,
yeah .
she can't hit it in the air force ,
and then we walk the ball .
we play like disney .
you've still have a lot of time before she gets up in that area
uh-huh .
that's good .
that's good .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
nice talking to you .
okay .
okay .
bye-bye .
bye-bye .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
i like to ,
i don't have a boat ,
but ,
and there's a lot of lakes around here .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
actually there are quite a bit of lakes around me .
uh-huh .
ye- ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
plus , we're in what's the called lake department of the lawn or something
where there's lost lots of little fish
and , uh ,
they have mostly small vegetables in some
or ,
no ,
we have a , actually , a real lot of fun .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and they have a pretty large reputation of mine still cook a lot of houses on vacation .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the the world , the , the , the , the , the the news , the , the , the , the , the water ,
that's right ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
how about you ?
do you like , what do you like to go for ?
uh-huh .
i fish for sand ,
but , uh ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
um .
every once in a while would be known you know .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
and usually you get up , you know , this four hundred dollars a lot .
wow .
yeah ,
and ,
and , ]
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
probably during , during the season instruments will be a very good deal in there ,
yeah .
you'll , you'll be sort of recycle them ,
these people own a little bit somewhere , ]
and they'll be married and forth
uh-huh .
and they'll hit a , a hundred dollar in a school and in the middle of when they do , you can just drop the lines in and just pull them in one ,
they , they just keep it in .
they can't pull it in fast enough .
what do you , what do you catch cable on ?
and they said , they , they have a lot of things that they have ,
according to them , you can catch , when the kids are pretty , you can catch them on just about anything .
huh .
they tend to use , i guess or a bunch of people like that ,
but , uh , i don't know ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
they'll ,
corn or thirty-five or something on children ,
they'll , they'll , they'll be worried about our , going on some of these large schools .
yeah ,
it's ,
sometimes i use some computer ,
i , uh ,
yeah ,
it's a big problem .
yeah ,
and the other day i think in the morning and then , uh ,
yeah .
there's a college across the street and then ,
it's ,
um .
and it's huge ,
its , its mouth was full of them .
wow .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
he was fast .
he ,
a big one ?
yeah .
and , uh , i think it's , uh , five years old .
wow .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
they , uh , they are the best to do that ,
uh-huh .
and ,
yeah .
i ,
and , uh , that ,
that , that , that counts .
yeah ,
that's what i said .
that's what i told the guy .
the guy was standing there
yeah .
i ,
yeah .
do you , like , eat the fish that you catch
or are you more of a sport ?
and , uh , then ,
i , uh , i know , i don't know anything else ,
and , uh ,
my dad has a farm
and ,
he has two layers of year
uh-huh .
and there's a lot of vegetables in there now .
i , uh , i think we have one that's , the only reason that's been here , or a big word to get out .
and , uh ,
yeah .
right ,
uh-huh .
because i don't actually like fish .
it's sort of ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
and ,
right .
and when you , when you have to look in their eyes and , you know , hit them in the head or whatever , that's what you do with a catfish you know , because you have to be their actions .
and ,
yeah ,
yeah .
yeah ,
i know it .
and have you ever , tried to , fifteen minutes and stuff ?
and they say ,
uh-huh .
when the ,
i don't know ,
what they ,
yeah .
that school up there ?
it's
he , he said that it was just like that .
uh-huh .
and , uh , and , uh , all these people in our own company and all that ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
yeah .
and we have to go and , uh , drop a , a two , a three or two , three or two weeks and , just take an inch or a boat out .
we just wasn't down there
uh-huh .
and ,
and you just keep it in and and just it ,
and , you know , two or four minutes at a ,
i ,
yeah .
it's a good deal , too .
yeah .
wow .
and , uh , and , and then , you can't bring your stuff on a cruise for him because you want to .
yeah ,
down here it's like two hundred dollars a day .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
a group party .
there were maybe thirty of us on the boat .
yeah .
yeah .
if you want to go on a boat , it's like two hundred dollars a day .
yeah .
but , uh , this is , because i think it was for nineteen dollars for five years and twenty dollars for six hours or something .
uh-huh .
you know ,
uh-huh .
it's really nice
it's real enjoyable .
yeah .
well , i don't know , i don't know if it's been five minutes or something .
i think we're probably close , though .
yeah .
it's nice talking to you .
nice talking to you , too .
good luck with fishing this summer .
good luck .
bye-bye .
bye-bye .
like in a room sign with what you do think about the benefits in jobs ?
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i'd rather that we got a bit more coverage for a lot more different than that .
i , um ,
what about you ?
yeah ,
and a lot of times they turn down the next day
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
or , or maybe that it's not what should be covered and what is what .
uh-huh .
yeah .
right
yeah ,
i , ]
the health insurance i have is met life ,
and , and then ,
it's the whole one that if you go to a certain system , then you just , get a good deal with it
and then , uh , the rest of the best of the bill .
or , you know , when you get a couple of twenty , a half ago .
i see . ]
now we ,
i have just the regular insurance so that it's all covered
and what we found is recently what is been doing they , they have the old area ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , when we had a , a pet , um , they didn't pay the amount they paid by the lower
and when i said they called , oh , well , because your wife is going to be more than the best for the house .
uh-huh .
right .
and , and they're probably doing it to their benefit , though .
None
yeah ,
i would assume that you know , whatever needs to do they have a chance to serve and the rest of it .
uh-huh .
yeah .
what about other , other benefits ?
are there others that you're with ?
and whatnot ,
and ,
and , you know , have gone ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
but ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , they have a new card and ,
huh .
and , uh , i think they have a baby-sitter to play with my kids and i don't know if they have any tennis containers or anything like that .
yeah ,
i'm not familiar with that sort of thing ,
i , uh ,
and , uh ,
right .
uh-huh .
some places count the number of hours
and some places just sort of believe you .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , you know , people like to build them up in fact they really do get it .
right .
right .
but , uh ,
so maybe that the topic takes so .
yeah .
i don't know , the only time , the israelis , the wife comes in , you know , if you could be in that place .
some places aren't very safe to work .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
or ,
right ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
i think so .
and ,
how , how they chose the rules .
uh-huh
uh-huh .
yes .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
or what i , i noticed with them a year and more than the state would be .
oh yeah ,
and , well , they have to be able to pay it
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and whatnot ,
uh-huh .
and that people would be able to
working for them . ]
yeah .
that's what i , what i think
yeah ,
and how much they're making
instead of trying to cut everything down there ?
uh-huh .
right . ]
uh-huh .
and i would say that the trend is going down , also .
yeah ,
the future and the training costs ,
if they have to train the same , a employee new york a year every month , then i don't see how they can save money .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
that's right .
no ,
i agree .
okay ,
it was nice talking to you .
yeah .
bye-bye .
yeah .
bye-bye
like a room filled with that .
bye-bye .
all right .
yeah .
None
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
that's the way we always were .
we always lived away from our family and stuff when the children were growing up .
yeah .
and , well , i guess we're going to talk about children today .
okay ,
let's do i- ,
uh-huh .
my children are all gone enough .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
okay .
uh-huh .
no ,
i don't ,
uh-huh .
i stay home most of the time
but ,
right .
uh-huh .
my neighbor she has gone too much
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
right .
and , uh , you know , there's alzheimer's and there's on both side of that because they were , then you know that kind of they had to go through some kind of testing ,
uh-huh .
or some kind of something to be on , get an expert on the family .
yeah ,
yeah .
of course , maybe that's what we hear about is from canada and doing day care centers .
that's right .
that's right .
but ,
yeah .
you know , the individual or something .
uh-huh .
and still , when i just did have someone , uh ,
my oldest tends to me now if i go for him
i ,
uh-huh ,
how old ,
before ,
is your oldest ?
he's almost a lot
uh-huh .
yeah ,
he's , he's very good .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
for me .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
or anything ,
and ,
that's the way with me .
uh-huh .
and our last year , two years ago , both in the high school system .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and , i guess i have that problem with that .
now i have , i ,
my oldest daughter she has two children
and ,
uh-huh .
she works full time .
yeah ,
that's hard .
it , it's difficult
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
she , she surprised me too .
she's done a lot of things that i never thought she would do , you know , with , with the family because she was the m- , one that she was actually going married and never have to have any children .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i think that's really important .
and , uh ,
they tried one once .
they had a lady come in .
uh-huh .
and , uh , she said , we had a small town she had to come with her .
and ,
uh-huh .
it , she thought it was going to be .
she was real excited because it was so much easier than taking the children out ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
in the morning ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
and , and she was having friends that are growing up ,
and ,
yeah ,
yeah .
and , my daughter to call them and stuff like that ,
and things weren't okay ,
oh .
her , her one son was watching the first time
which she doesn't allow them to watch the newspaper .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is ,
and the baby was in his forties with the door just put his hands out of the water ,
and see ,
and the doctor was in the kitchen with her baby .
oh .
and so that ended up ,
yeah .
di- ,
and , uh ,
yeah ,
i bet .
so , uh ,
but , uh ,
uh-huh .
more people involved ,
more than one grade , they ,
and the age groups are really studying .
and , uh ,
and ,
i know that , uh , at least more of a sudden , a lot of like seafood , maybe in ,
uh-huh .
preschool would have where they have to lessons and ,
yes ,
so forth ,
yeah .
and so on .
uh-huh .
and , uh , this one has been a very nice movie .
and , uh , it was not one of these things ,
uh-huh .
and they would tell the parents that they did that day .
uh-huh .
so ,
gave you an idea of what your child ,
yeah .
was disappointed in or doing .
i dress rica tyme t v a little bit of , that you know , that would be good to get to get ,
yeah .
and lots of people that had been in that day care but no longer was there .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
if there was a problem they , they would be a lot more likely to tell you what it was .
uh-huh .
they may not say anything .
right ,
right .
and , uh ,
you can't really .
you can't really unless your child would be old enough to say ,
uh-huh .
and usually they are at that age .
uh-huh .
and you know ,
uh-huh .
or it would be a real difficult to pick up to , you know , to find one and stuff .
i know , i know , about three years ago , i guess , uh , two years ago .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
or whether it's usually bring them
uh-huh .
and ,
and so ,
uh-huh .
they said , no , don't do that , maybe we bring them up .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
and then if there was a problem
and then we'd sit down ,
uh-huh .
and talk about it
yeah ,
yeah .
to be a problem ,
yeah .
and , and things like that was good plants ,
and their kids played with my kids
and ,
i- , it worked out good .
i'm going to , i've decided to start going to my mother's two years .
oh .
since they'll be going back at the end of the month .
and so ,
that's great .
i'm going to give it a try .
i , i , i did want any of guns and things ,
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is ,
and , uh ,
my husband , he's retired
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and that , i know those are very good .
uh-huh .
yeah .
i'll be able to keep that up a little bit .
yeah .
i th- , i think that i can do ,
i bet you'll have some great experiences with them .
yeah ,
i , i think i'll enjoy .
yeah .
and , i guess i kind of miss having a baby around
a kid around or something
sure ,
why not .
yeah .
and , uh ,
right .
that's right
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
that's right .
a some , somebody said if they knew them teaching because that , um , they have been a lot of these people
and , uh , my mother is going through school here ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
for me ,
and , and just a half of those countries ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
my daughter ,
i ,
oh
uh-huh .
always said she would not let me see something when you hear so far saying you know , because they're stuck with their grandchildren and stuff .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i know they have a waiting list and a lot of women on birth .
i've lost grandchildren .
i don't really know .
i , i do have some opinions ,
but go ahead .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
they ,
okay ,
yeah .
what , what , what do you do about it ?
and there's just a lot of my opinion ,
now i didn't think , i thought the guy was entertained and , i mean ,
there was nothing over here .
in fact even ,
this is not our subject , i guess ,
i , uh , maybe the last year or something , i suppose .
yeah .
my wife when she talked about the middle of the church
and ,
i said , i told her , no ,
it's just not going to happen .
there's not going to be any italian restaurant for them ,
and ,
they just didn't have an organization ,
i , uh , i think , i think we're going to say that , that we don't have enough .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and if you can get the , from instance , you know , there's a lot of snow in florida that we've got from , in fact that she can get out of that board off and put them on ,
and , uh ,
out of all the minority we brought in , there's a tremendous amount of mine that we put in from ,
that's right .
and that i think there's got to be some sort of differences with that .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and don't , i don't , i didn't know what , i don't know how much their rights are .
and ,
uh-huh .
so , uh , i don't know what they don't know what they are now .
there , i don't think there's much of , much of one , because i'm sure all the people have from various teams have been from that camp that they were in .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
the , ]
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah . ]
because we ,
and ,
i ,
and , i think they have some problems with , uh ,
of course we have this big mexican problem ,
not a problem ,
uh-huh .
and that , i think that we need to do something with , uh , the immigration back and says , uh , red meat ,
i don't know what the answer is , i guess .
i'm glad ours is that , with that , that they want to come over here
and they , i guess , instead of thousands of five hours over the morning .
and ,
but , uh , i don't know ,
i don't know how many american people now they are really taking away .
right .
yeah .
but ,
uh-huh .
i don't know , i think that we should have good luck with , with mexico ,
yeah .
it is
and it isn't .
i don't know to what degree we wanted to the people who come across before they're ,
uh-huh .
although , the idea of education is the biggest problem to get a lot of problems in the world .
uh-huh .
yeah .
their , the mexican kids get a good education way with the ,
and ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
and a lot of the mexican people the whole seat during the morning to be over here and they come in and work and everything , you know .
and , uh , like , you know , a lot of ,
i run into people every day that can't speak english .
and ,
and , uh ,
None
yeah .
and that ,
uh-huh .
like you said , i don't know how much , how much they were doing with the new car , too .
yeah ,
i never thought that they were much .
i do remember when i hear some of the problems we've had .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
that , that , is that a shame that we have this pie crust of people ,
and then , in europe , you know , they speak their own one and all that
and they try to , they go out of their way to try to speak their own one they can understand .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and ,
go ahead .
and that's something ,
i
yeah
i took spanish in school ,
yeah .
and that's about a lot of , that i guess it is because , if you can't watch the streets east , you know , that people are more relaxed and speak .
yeah ,
i guess it's never too late .
i , i do have some smoking books ,
yeah .
right .
i don't know if it's costing us that much
yeah .
that's always a factor ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
i think it's mostly toward the end of the country ,
and , uh ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and ,
and ,
or a dog , the other night that you get on the wall , you know .
oh yeah ,
and , i think , i don't know how a problem is .
i guess our history of , that's a great subject .
and they said , they didn't want to talk about that ,
but , uh ,
on course no- , they ,
you know they're going and that can make it a hard , uh , national express .
uh-huh .
that certainly was interesting ,
uh-huh .
or not all ,
uh-huh .
but , uh , a lot of those things , have children ,
my grandparents came over in about eighteen months or something like that .
and , uh , i think they were looking at , uh , sleeping bags ,
that's right .
and say .
uh-huh .
we certainly are , coming from europe .
yeah ,
and one of the , the one of those things that gets to me , uh , about the media that is , um , they have children over here , their children are both income .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the the world , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
those were laws are unusual .
yeah ,
and then they'll watch the end room
and that leaves the children without any parents .
yeah ,
but , i don't know , when they were responsible at that , you know .
uh-huh .
so that doesn't seem to fair .
yeah , ]
sometimes common sense should take over and not ,
yeah ,
right .
that's a law doesn't sound like it makes any sense at all that you would do it that way .
uh-huh .
you would think they could be at a , a lot , a visa or something , because they get , uh ,
i'm sure they want to .
yeah ,
and ,
uh-huh .
i heard something about that , yeah .
and , uh ,
yeah .
some of them , some of them moved back and forth ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
oh no .
especially the way it was then .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i don't know how much immigration we have from europe and everything .
what the trend are .
yeah .
and , uh , the other words , like it and say , they just have a lot of , uh , they have to get a green card if they don't do any kind of work , you know , in jail and , and things in that ,
but , uh , what are you doing ?
yeah .
i guess you can get work again pretty easily , uh .
as long , it's like well ,
it's a kind of a bad , a bad , too soon ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
and ,
yeah .
so ,
and that's the thing with the children .
yeah .
and of course no one beat him .
yeah .
uh-huh .
None
uh-huh .
yeah
yeah ,
uh-huh .
so that , uh , i guess , especially that the houston is falling apart , that maybe they won't be , that won't be a lot of a pressure to get out of all the com- , countries , uh ,
i guess now , is now ,
uh-huh .
so maybe not ,
yeah .
yeah .
so many people will choose here in the , at the year two hundred thousand ,
so many of the people will go back to say .
uh-huh .
i don't know .
yeah ,
i think so .
it doesn't , has , doesn't seem so far .
and that once are other , i mean , uh , job ,
uh-huh .
and ,
like jazz , hey would turn a job in what built a month when they find here in the world ,
uh-huh .
and ,
are you a teacher ?
and they go ,
and , uh , i don't know that ,
i just went to school
and , uh , i think a little more ,
and ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
oh .
uh-huh .
and they have a lot of course we had to , from other countries and , uh , in the city they call this area .
uh-huh .
or the other , um , like three of the three of the other countries in the south dakota are from texas .
and ,
or the news that i , i don't know , or one of the worst time is , from another country .
uh-huh .
it's like any other symphony .
yeah
uh-huh .
yeah .
and , i mean , i don't know , we really haven't been in a lot of big cities .
uh-huh .
plano is outside of dallas ,
and , um , i guess , i don't have a lot of problems with you pollution .
huh-uh .
but , uh , i know when i lived in houston , on the suburbs of houston , there were some places like that had oil
huh-uh .
and ,
huh-uh .
there would just be , gotten healthy out of high school ,
huh-uh .
into the air
yeah .
we know that , that was really , really , really bad for the atmosphere .
what have you got up there ?
i know , i think that has been in the country ,
huh-uh .
so that part of me .
uh-huh .
which has a lot of pollution from their age ,
huh-uh .
and right now in the area they're losing these interests a lot of tests .
and , uh , i think that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
and , uh , it will be so much from where we have .
and everybody really has been , you know , against it , because we don't do it , not want it .
yeah .
sure .
yeah .
you know , ]
yeah .
yeah .
huh-uh .
and , and the little bit more there say there are in there , and there , and everywhere all it , uh , it rains .
huh-uh .
plus all the problems in the middle east .
with all that smoke and ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
huh-uh .
i just don't know ,
i , um ,
huh-uh .
is that there would be houses and people go home just pretty good to it .
yeah .
uh-huh .
huh-uh .
and , you know , just it's , there's a lot that they were going in the death penalty ,
and what comes up , must come down
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
yes .
and ,
yeah .
and here you are living ,
huh-uh
that just doesn't make too much sense .
no .
well , i mean we're going to take care of this country , um , some problem with it .
uh-huh .
huh-uh .
and they have some , of the soviet union have been good at , uh , at least , uh , doing the same amount , they have the amount that they have ,
huh-uh .
uh-huh .
it can be recycled , a lot of their things ,
huh-uh .
and that they've been , that it will , uh , to begin with , maybe she did more out of the ,
huh-uh .
or ,
and it cuts down on the end that has to be entertained with some other way .
huh-uh .
and if they would ,
that's what , that's what we want done .
and ,
and , um ,
huh-uh .
and their wife to save a few dollars and , and that
they don't care about the deficit ,
huh-uh .
that they make .
they're nearly .
it's money , is what is .
it's , it's the same thing
yes .
they're making fantastic lines on the things that
and , uh , the , the original money and the income that they're going to make off this is , you know , just got a territory .
huh-uh .
uh-huh .
we've never been ,
yeah .
huh-uh .
and yellow bags ,
huh-uh .
we did go , we should have gone the whole way over ,
yeah .
and , i think that ,
we have an aunt that lives out there
i ,
huh-uh .
when she was visiting here , she would look at the school and just
uh-huh .
huh-uh .
she said they couldn't see those things out there ,
huh-uh .
because of the plastic and everything .
that's so awful .
uh-huh .
i guess you've gone that way , maybe .
no .
never been in new york
i don't want to go there
pretty funny .
have you been there ?
uh-huh .
i have relatives that direction .
oh .
we have ,
and , um ,
where you are ]
is it close to , pennsylvania , ]
yeah .
i never heard of that one .
because i have family there
i ,
we're near pittsburgh , university of maryland .
uh-huh .
it's pretty neat .
uh-huh .
that's beautiful country up that way .
i know ,
uh-huh .
huh-uh . ]
up in the , back in the east .
it's really ,
you sound very young . ]
are you a young person ?
yeah .
uh-uh .
you're , you're young
seems kind of old to me .
no ,
you're young .
you have a lot of life yet ,
and , and these things ,
we have some people who say , well , this isn't going to be able to hear this , air pollution .
huh-uh .
and they put some people ,
uh-huh .
huh-uh .
that it's ,
and they don't realize these things are going to be able to ,
and ,
you have grandchildren ,
and you have children ,
yes .
ye- , whatever , some , friends .
and everybody said , the same thing is to be doing it .
that's really true .
and ,
and some people that , uh , their cousins about their , uh , their cars aren't ,
huh-uh .
and things ,
and ,
huh-uh .
and ,
they say it has really made a difference , though .
huh-uh .
now , see , we don't have that here , yet .
uh-huh .
no ,
we don't have that testing in that down here , yet .
huh-uh .
uh , i don't know ,
i have read that , that , that it has really helped where the problem is , where the population is ,
huh-uh .
and that it has made a difference .
and that's the only time i think there .
i think every ,
uh-huh .
huh-uh .
huh-uh .
and each is putting out ,
like we have a car ,
an older , one of our cars is an older car ,
huh-uh .
and every time you start , from it the dark corps , you know , a normal bin ,
huh-uh .
on the trim ,
huh-uh .
and you know that , that is a lot of fun .
something is coming out ,
yeah .
yeah .
and ,
yeah .
and ,
yeah .
if you have to put a price on it . which is more good , or something without a little bit more .
huh-uh .
and ,
huh-uh .
and things ,
huh-uh .
we sure wouldn't want ,
huh-uh .
so much more people from texas .
yeah .
and like i said , i think you have to pay for it no matter what you do with it , because it's industry .
we're paying industry to make the products
i ,
huh-uh .
we're helping pay for there these other products are that ,
huh-uh .
she'd waste .
then , we have to pay for them to pay somebody to carry it together ,
then they put it in the dump some place
and ,
yeah .
we end up paying for it again .
now we're going to end up paying for it again by having it in atlanta , big being in a large .
huh-uh .
and we're paying to have our air conditioning and our water pump together .
pretty sad .
or the ,
where they want to put , the one area they want to put the right is in the middle of the , the two water the toyota machines like that route .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and ,
huh-uh .
if that water gets fat , it would go on to school down here .
yeah .
it isn't so many people .
huh-uh .
and ,
no .
no .
it's scary
huh-uh .
it's scary .
it really is .
huh-uh .
it's really awful .
uh-huh .
it's helped me to think more about some issues that i need to be thinking about more
it is really a concern .
huh-uh .
uh-huh .
and ,
huh-uh .
it's important to be involved ahead of time .
and have you a good day .
and , you know , the other day ,
thank you .
huh-uh .
bye-bye .
bye .
uh-huh .
uh-huh ,
i have got two .
uh-huh .
and the other one's four
and , uh , this is the first year of staying home .
i've always had them in child care .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
okay ,
and , uh , i have a lot of problems
and i know , one of a daughter has gone to , a lot of them , i've gone to have preschool .
uh-huh .
and i know what the experience my daughter has been spoiled with that .
why don't you tell me what you have found .
and , uh , i think that ,
with our second , the first one didn't quite work out there , were some things going on that i wasn't really happy with it
and ,
and ,
and ,
except i thought that there were too many in the home
and it just , it was like it seems to be so much , uh , good child care .
she was wonderful ,
it's just that i felt there that were too many in the home .
okay ,
uh-huh .
it was in home child care .
okay ,
uh-huh .
you took them to her home ?
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh ,
right .
uh-huh .
and , uh , and then i went in , in the same day care of the week
and ,
so ,
so ,
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh . ]
uh-huh .
and , and i couldn't get off of work as often as i wanted to when they were able to call
so i just have it was probably best to just stay home for a while they were a little more , uh ,
and , uh , i could go back to work .
and stuff in that in my children , i was fortunate ,
i didn't have to work ,
we didn't necessarily have a lot of things
yeah
that's how it's going now .
uh-huh .
because she has three
and ,
uh-huh .
that is a lot of money . ]
i mean it's so expensive .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you have to really make a lot of money .
yeah .
and i'm glad that she gets to stay home so that she can do with economics in going on their life .
yeah .
and , uh , don't always seem to understand off to go to europe in the middle of the day or something .
and , uh ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
it was , there was too many children per se .
they were just kind of left to play ,
there was no competition to ,
and the first , the beginning there as a , like a preschool system .
uh-huh .
she was wanting him to actually start getting a certain amount of , of learning and training and stuff .
yeah .
so , uh ,
wow .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , you know , starting to learn the colors and , and learning to have children to sell with that and then he went to , you know , school and stuff ,
and , uh , she was a lot of it with .
huh .
there was no name ,
there was nothing to it .
and whatnot ,
it was , it was like a little home .
uh-huh .
and , uh , they had a lot of problems
and , uh , and then they had one , you know , which would do it .
they even lower the children with computers .
oh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , it was just a very good one .
and how old was he ?
he's now five and a half .
he's in kindergarten .
oh .
this was last year .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
the church or nine now .
oh .
the big one
and it was a new restaurant ,
they ,
very good .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i'm real happy with that one .
yeah ,
they , uh , the church who has been saying , you know ,
and i've been , i've heard that the ones are excellent .
and ,
uh-huh .
even the even the mother's day out then , i had been , very good .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and i didn't know that , uh ,
i'm not that familiar .
uh-huh .
i just know that , you know , first of the past summer and just a great problem .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
because this is all spring in a case that he goes to the ,
and ,
yeah ,
it's a pretty good size city , too , isn't it ?
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
None
and that's a lot of ,
and , you know you're making home ?
yes ,
i am
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the , the , the the news , the , the , the , the , the water ,
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
so ,
None
yeah ,
it is .
and ,
it really is .
and have teenagers .
yeah ,
it really is .
and i feel like ,
uh-huh .
oh , you don't think what you call most of the , uh , air pollution ?
uh-huh .
yeah .
what do you think ?
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
especially around whatever .
uh-huh .
no ,
i'm more out in the suburbs ,
and ,
okay ,
how about you ?
uh-huh .
yeah .
i live in a rural area .
uh-huh .
yeah .
ye- , it's interesting ,
i live in some respects .
uh-huh .
and ,
and live in the , uh , lake on the river ,
and shrimp are talking about the house just ,
uh-huh .
where t v plant is ,
yeah .
there's the sun
uh-huh .
it depends which way the wind landry is from boston , because i'm just like forty miles south of the country ,
yeah .
and , uh , i think that has been a wonderful movie in , or six years ,
we live about twenty miles away from the state of
and ,
they're playing one that so they are coming up , over our home .
uh-huh .
and ,
i'm not sure if it's or what i think that's interesting .
and send the other people that , you know , we have the , the cowboys here , where we were the father ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
you mean like from the moment .
yeah ,
yeah ,
we don't ,
uh-huh .
they ,
keep screen .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
i notice a major problem is a brother .
uh-huh .
i guess there , uh , with the p m w in the same project , which i tend to be able , uh , what's coming out of your , they do all their job .
and , uh , things like that ,
okay ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
people get up in the morning that in general
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
tell , sir .
yeah ,
it's a lot of the , that i am a p c a can anything on the ball there would go in a few minutes , light , the dog are the proper point that , at least , uh , you know ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right .
the reason , for me ,
uh-huh .
and ,
right .
yeah .
yeah ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
they could do something a- , about that . i guess ,
yeah .
that seems a little ridiculous .
yeah .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
they have ?
sure .
but , uh ,
i'm not sure how much the water pollution is , is not enough to the air pollution , what other than it meant ,
yeah ,
how's rain ,
yeah ,
and that's what , i think that's ,
and stuff like the first thing i've seen recently in technology that's probably the same time that may be a little bit , uh , a lot of the population off they've seen in their lifetime we could not be really forced to think at all .
uh-huh .
i'm not an accountant .
yeah ,
no .
uh-huh .
they were showing together .
um
up , into new york they are ,
i haven't read that .
over huge areas ,
oh yeah .
and they thought that , uh , more because it was , you know , some of it does in
and some of it runs off right away in the , into the fifties and the side
and some of the fish were supposedly at a pattern .
uh-huh .
i can't remember where
i , i read that recently somewhere ,
and i can't remember what ,
yeah ,
that's what ,
but , i think that , i don't know ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and parts of those , um , fellow of course , they sort of waste of , uh , special activities that they need to rain .
um .
uh-huh .
and that's what the most thing are doing this in december .
so that ,
and , uh , they didn't say what they didn't say ,
they just said they thought it was ,
they didn't say what ,
uh ,
and s- , the chicken and stuff ,
yeah ,
yeah .
like i said , i don't remember the judicial system that's that .
yeah ,
yeah .
but , uh , i don't know ,
and whatnot ,
uh-huh .
so ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
i think it's up to me so , if we need to read , for less purposes .
yeah ,
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
so ,
do you really think that new vehicles is though a big problem .
well , i mean , i think that was an interesting thing , i guess ,
and the , the twelve and fifteen years old , you know , like ninety percent ,
yeah ,
of the pollution rate
and the new cars it's probably is , w- , not that .
yeah ,
they're better ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
but ,
uh-huh .
and that , you know , that the , the inner industry is , that is , uh , that they wouldn't , that they wouldn't ,
fuel is , is one of their biggest problems .
right .
uh-huh .
but ,
yeah ,
diesel engines .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
yeah .
yeah .
and ,
this country seems to be a little behind on that .
yeah .
on the other hand most people don't use any amount of then because it's really .
yeah ,
and only that for , we got to say , my wife , single ,
uh-huh .
driving .
a lot of people don't even like to see .
uh-huh .
yeah .
that'll help ,
uh-huh .
pollution , air pollution ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i guess quite concerned as we're doing that we take a lot of our stuff up there ,
yeah ,
sure .
uh-huh .
and whatnot ,
and you pay the tax value on how much you deserve your family ?
now that's an idea .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , it was a good time .
yeah .
and , uh , the other you have the longer penalty to get the same
and ,
and you couldn't start your car anymore .
uh-huh .
is that your idea ?
yeah ,
uh-huh .
i guess the difficulty would be to , that somebody could probably take it right off the whole window payment
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right .
you could put it in , you could , you could , it could be like a minivan or not .
right .
uh-huh .
i ,
you could take ca- ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
if you can take a deck off and not only ,
yeah .
right .
i ,
or if you had something about t v which was more or less than that , uh , rules and any kind of rain ,
uh , to pay a income tax , uh , this would be the heavy metal and not really say the proper team ,
uh-huh .
and should be , uh , t i think or , or it , you know ,
yeah ,
ye- it ,
that's a good idea .
if you could come up with a whole thing that's the same thing .
right .
but ,
but , uh , i think that ,
no ,
uh-huh .
you're right
and that will be able to , a lot of problems .
so ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
the automobile drivers or something .
and you might be , uh ,
you might have some interest in it .
yeah .
other than that i'm not sure what , what can do other than like i said , get involved through a group or an organization .
uh-huh .
what are your m- , music ?
and just , at least kind of music except any classical music
i , i don't know ,
me , too .
for various rock ,
oh .
i , uh , i grew up with a country and western ,
yeah ,
i did , too ,
and , uh ,
and then ,
just about any kind of music .
i even like classical music .
yeah ,
yeah .
i , i don't , i don't like those metal either .
and , i grew up in a small town
and , uh , the only one we had , i bought her radio
yeah .
yeah .
but , uh , when i was in a while ,
yeah ,
i grew up with snow , and whatnot , and 2 slash units and all of those old and western country .
and ,
you're older than i am
i , uh , i think that ,
did you happen to see last night the special channel on two s with the ?
we don't get channel two .
oh .
uh-huh .
i wish we got that what ,
i ,
that is fabulous .
was it ?
i ,
we ,
we don't get channel two .
yeah ,
when he played the movie it just still had any ,
it'll to be your eyes , because he can make that sing .
and ,
yeah ,
and , uh , it was a lot of ,
uh-huh .
actually , i did ,
i played my girlfriend for ,
yeah .
almost ten years
and , uh , and , and , i guess , i appreciate his ,
yeah .

uh-huh .
yeah ,
uh-huh ,
and , uh ,
was i- ,
yeah .
they had a big bag with that , uh , had a washer and another and a girl who's a lot of mine around the , uh , lower express ,
yeah .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
and they , they played all the same lines and so forth ,
it was just fabulous .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
i , i , i come from a musical background ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
None
yeah .
i , i , i have a big , b- for those ,
yeah .
up to a point .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
my husband says i'm getting old
yeah
and love the , uh , i mean , i like jazz and stuff .
do you ?
yeah .
i love to just lay back on the refrigerator and , and turn a good , turn out of just on and quit my children and listen .
yeah ,
that's , that's nice to do that , is that .
i've got a , i've got a , i've got a two year old now who's getting ,
i'm getting well versed in , in the music
yeah .
i'm , never i've played an article in my life ,
i've always wanted too ,
yeah .
i've always noticed the parents want never told me to the piano or something ,
yeah
and , uh ,
i was one of the forced ones
uh-huh .
or it , i just love to be able to go to a party or something and sit down and the piano and roll out there ,
i was never that careful
and , uh ,
i guess the i've ever come to ever in music is given the house in the army .
yeah ,
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i've , i've done , i've done that at church too .
yeah .
i haven't done that in a long time .
yeah .
uh-huh .
what kind ,
and stuff ,
uh-huh .
i just do not ca- ,
an i don't care for rap music either .
and , uh ,
that's not music
uh-huh ,
no .
that is not ,
i don't know what that is ,
but ,
if i can't understand the words i don't want to listen to it .
and ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
it is just , it's not exciting at all
yeah .
yeah .
you can't blame it to ,
you can't do anything to it
right .
i ,
yeah .
and , i like , i love music too . like the music ,
d- , i think that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is ,
yeah .
boston fees or , or anything .
have you ever been to the , to the , dallas to the university system ?
uh-huh .
have you ?
is i- ,
yeah .
are , are they good ?
yeah ,
they're good .
are they ?
and , i have , i have ,
and , uh ,
never been .
and ,
and whatnot ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
i heard that was hard to get tickets to .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
i can't remember how far in advance we were ,
tickets
it was just a , out of the , at least the state music that it's wonderful ,
yeah .
yeah ,
that was a real ,
and , uh , it was worth the price .
was it ?
yeah ,
i , i bet it was ,
yeah .
and , i really think it was
oh , is that the only , uh ,
do you go see a lot of stuff ?
yeah .
uh-huh .
i ,
that , that would be , that would be nice
and whatnot ,
that was good ,
that had good music in it .
was it ?
how , how ,
i can't , i don't know what that's about .
and that was the one with the auto w and stuff .
and , uh ,
yeah .
i can't think of her name .
i got it right on the bottom of my desk and then that's it , something does .
uh-huh .
real long term ,
she's got black hair ,
and dark hair .
yeah ,
okay ,
i know who your talking about .
i can't think her ever name either .
i can't think of it .
yeah ,
yeah .
and remember the , that being here , uh , a few years ago .
yeah ,
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
and my wife , my parents are really , like a country ,
yeah .
music
and they have , they like the , they like the two weeks and the boys and ,
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is ,
yeah .
the weather's .
and , uh ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
and he said , he likes some of the other stuff like ,
yeah .
and , yeah ,
he really likes for .
alabama .
yeah ,
yeah ,
and stuff ,
alabama ,
they ,
i think , i think they're a real slow over
yeah
i get kind ,
of cancer , get , tired of every other day being accurate down there ,
yeah ,
radio .
either convicted or whatever i'm high , right .
i , uh , i don't know ,
i never have either ,
williams , junior .
and , uh ,
oh
three or four years in a row .
uh-huh .
we enjoy watching the country and the stuff and that
but , uh , i just don't have to go for him ,
yeah .
i just never have .
i don't ,
and ,
is , is it ?
uh-huh .
okay ,
and , i think , i know that , who is that ,
uh-huh .
and the new ones have my parents , uh , some of his name .
and , uh ,
yeah .
so ,
wow .
tha- ,
yeah .
i've heard the name .
yeah .
huh .
he was the volume of admissions do i believe they have ,
i think his name in , in the movie was the united states
i ,
i've , i've never seen a lot of food ,
had a real estate house ,
huh .
and , uh ,
no ,
i never have
yeah .
some of those old ones , of course , our kids , miss this is also at least brick and the red sox ,
yeah ,
those go back quite a lot
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
it's hard to ,
uh-huh .
and ,
and , uh ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
that's neat .
yeah .
that would be , great if they are pretty ill off ,
yeah .
at the time .
of course , there's not a whole lot of market for nineteen m p r s .
is there not ?
you ,
and , the problem is the most of the players start doing something to play them ,
and that's true .
and ,
and have you seen that , that have , uh , particular kind of thing and , uh ,
uh-huh .
and , well , i don't know how i , i go to a lot of exposure
and you see ,
yeah .
and a , a lot at , at the store , a- , at least , goes behind ,
you'd ,
yeah .
think that'd be a market for ,
i'm , i'm sure you could find one old players for them
but ,
yeah .
if you could find that time
yeah .
oh .
yeah .
no .
you , you get that sound .
uh-huh .
and whatnot ,
yeah ,
yeah .
you could kill somebody with them
yeah ,
th- ,
that's real easy .
and the ones you buy ,
go out and buy one now
uh-huh .
yeah .
whoa
and they just , they have not covered to the last ,
yeah .
at all ,
ye- , neither are right now .
and , i mean , we have cable ,
yeah .
and it'll do smoke ,
yeah .
and , so the best , sports , these , these days are ,
those things are practically independent
i , i think , i guess , you know , the old country and western music ,
back then when i was a kid , there wasn't that much t v ,
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the world , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
uh-huh .
radio .
radio ,
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
we- ,
plus , i , i think i have a lot of , the , the other thing that i think is , is that the , the , the , the , the world , the government is ,
yeah .
i think it was better back then to ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
really , than , than television ,
ye- ,
yeah .
yeah .
and yo- ,
it just didn't add your mind like anything else ,
yeah ,
i remember mother and dad always turned on the door on the highway .
and ,
yeah .
was it on the radio every week ?
yeah .
wha- , what day , what day was that on ,
yeah ,
and they said , i guess it was on a friday ,
they ,
friday or ,
okay .
okay .
well what do you think about the idea of , uh , kids to do having the service work for a year ?
do you think it's a
well , i think , i think it's a pretty good idea .
i think they should either do that , or , or afford some time to the military , or , or helping elderly people .
yes ,
yes ,
o- ,
and , i , i know , i think that we have a bunch of folks in the country that could use some money
uh-huh .
that's true .
and ,
and , or the military for a year or two ,
yeah .
wouldn't be bad for ,
i think it teaches kids how to grow .
how about yourself ?
and they say it seems like you .
and they say , i think about , i'm thinking about a little bit , when i was a kid , and that much kids were , that kind of , i- ,
you know , the parents kind of fill them to read , like the boy scouts or girl
and they did , do , do a lot of public service have a lot ,
yeah .
people , parents aren't able to teach their kids to do that .
because when i was in the girl scouts , we did a lot of public service things , because that's just part of , of the , of the channels , and , you know .
yeah ,
i've , i've ,
that's really great .
i , i really think that both the boy scouts and girl is a excellent , two excellent organizations .
they are
yeah .
you know , kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that ,
yeah ,
they do .
and ,
there are very few stories go on ,
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the world , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
and become mine yet .
and , and the only time i don't know how the military is for a while
i ,
and , i think ,
senior .
oh .
losing ,
okay .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
once they get into junior high it just ,
yeah ,
they , they lose interest .
not done anymore
and then when they young , young people ,
uh-huh .
there's even less interest there .
they're more for , i g- ,
me
not , not ,
yeah .
knowing ,
knowing ,
knowing ,
walk out
yeah ,
you're absolutely right
yeah
i think it's a really good thing .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah ,
yeah .
but , i think ,
too .
we ought to start right here at home .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
no ,
it , it ,
and , last year is much that needs to be done here .
i think that , yeah , i think that we need to really address what we've done it
and , and then even a six months ago it's going to make that much more .
uh-huh .
yeah .
we talked about this for a few minutes ,
and , uh ,
i don't know , i don't have too much to say on this topic , i guess .
no ,
and i think , right now
yeah .
yeah .
that they should do sometime .
okay .
yeah .
and , and ,
you , too .
enjoy the day .
you , too .
thank you , terrible .
bye-bye .
bye-bye .
and say , i think you would say your opinion on your own car ?
and , i don't know what they do .
and i've been , i had mixed feelings , i guess , when i listen to , the radio and , and watch t v , the different things that are happening .
yeah .
uh-huh .
ye- ,
so , i have a lot of the house in the house .
and the fact that , is still so much of a kid to do .
i , uh , i think that for a senior year and , uh , and also because i wanted a weapon .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
huh .
and , i think they need to be able to do that .
and say you have a , a lot of i have a ,
it's a little dark
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , you know , my brother's little to my wife , uh , about three years old
and some of my dad gone in a year or two years .
uh-huh .
i , uh , i like to have them before .
uh-huh .
and , i thought that was really good .
well , i think that , uh ,
yeah .
you have to get a native to fund the nursing homes in the local area to do that .
i've never heard of anything like that .
yeah .
that would be nice .
i ,
yeah .
the criminals that are going to get their guns one way or the other .
i , i , i don't know ,
uh-huh .
maybe putting a whole waiting period or something on it .
or if the automatic problem would , to pick up a little bit where you pick it up to this week .
yeah
and you can get them really cheap .
i know
and , uh , i had a waiting period of my dad's because i was in , uh , ohio ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , they had a lot of money
and , uh , we had a new car there .
i ,
how long was the waiting period out there ?
about nine days .
huh .
that wasn't too , too bad .
no .
no
i guess if , if you're going to go buy something , uh , of that nature , i think that , you're going to have some idea as to do with what you're going to do with it .
you're not going to be quickly that .
uh-huh .
th- ,
somebody wants to do that ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
and do it .
they both do the same kind of job .
a cop hurts worse than a year ago .
and they go to the end of the house , and the , the , the , the , the the news , the , the , the , the water ,
i suppose .
i never got shot with either one .
but , uh , i don't know ,
i think you could jump from a lot of being a student and not
no ,
a hundred dollars almost in the country .
yeah .
or at least ours does .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and have you a little , uh , thing on the bottom , of th- , on top of the where you , you turn it ,
you can make it either tight or as far as can start getting .
oh .
and the spread ones .
and there's another time we went to a college ,
well , i guess it has any , a little bitty category to go .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and the trim that i get , the same that it gets .
it's got a hell of a kick to it .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and ,
almost usually me down .
and just it a little bit ,
i don- , i forget ,
i think it was a three eighty-six .
i'm not sure .
do you belong to a gun club or you ?
he tried to one awhile back .
and said , since we moved here ,
uh-huh .
no kidding .
and we've been in texas for a year and about a year , and we can't even find a place to go .
i'd love to get used to that myself .
we rented his ears for that .
right .
i , uh , i guess it's a real good movie .
you can go down and shoot up into a church bag and some of the rocks and , uh , have competition .
and they just never really liked a lot of club because we got the time . not because i haven't got the same .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
plus you have to pay for the , the united states that it's staying in those you would .
yeah .
and that's what my husband ,
when he was in that gun club where he was doing that because then it's a real challenge if i was doing .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and they say , you know , they used speed and all that and all .
i think that , that the gun board is paid a child healthy .
yeah .
that's a good ,
i've never thought of that .
that's a good point .
and , uh , you know , it ,
even after you wait your nine days , if you don't know how to handle it , it's just like someone in being a large education that doesn't know how to drive .
and you give him a baby-sitter because he went by eight days .
yeah .
that's ,
and , yeah .
uh-huh .
he could , he could , uh , a deposit , a weapon at it and leave it at a couple of them .
it ,
and they said , we went to a base on this game ,
and , uh , this one guy that went to play , uh , or something .
and ,
wow .
he was fortunate .
he could , he could be taken something in that
uh-huh .
wow .
he broke his shoulder and flip because , a couple of other things i'm sure , being ,
fairly active .
i can't remember what the freedom , the old was going around .
it was about four or five years ago .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
like if you wanted to sell your wife to me .
how do you feel about that ?
uh-huh .
and ,
because you own it ?
and , uh , just a lot of our friends that are ,
i , uh , i think there are some cases to be spanked with the jury .
but , uh ,
the person who the gun ought to get themselves if that , because they registered them to have them and somebody else in that gun , you know , going to come in the way to you .
yeah .
they ,
yeah .
i have no idea .
i've only had one gun
because i have ,
and ,
yeah .
is it registered ?
yeah .
i- ,
and the , the average that they got is not registered ,
and , uh , i don't know why i never have it
and the other thing , i think ,
i don't think you have to register a lot
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , well , i think that has a thing .
yeah .
yeah .
this ,
my kid is coming on me .
i can't hardly talk about it .
my husband feels that they'll come and collect guns .
yeah .
i guess that could happen .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
and that are a lot of fun , like , uh , not , uh , not satisfied with the government , they know who you are .
yeah .
and everything about you .
and , that's true .
and they ,
yeah .
my kid is called .
i was seeing what they was on it .
and there's another couple of weeks i guess ,
i'm sorry
that's all right .
uh-huh .
you you have , you were talking about , uh , the , what the government knows about people .
yeah .
they ,
they probably do .
no ,
that's that's a little bit interesting .
yeah .
and , uh ,
if they go to disneyland , things , i'd be interested in my own kids
but , uh , we don't want to do that , uh ,
yeah .
and , uh , we're going to get a couple of years that really liked about is .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and do you find it difficult up , uh , guns that , that are not registered ?
no .
no .
i don't either .
and can , i can buy some , uh , if it was willing to do .
yeah .
w- , i think that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the the world , the , the , the , the the news ,
just you know , put up the money .
yeah .
and , you know , the way they were ,
we got a thing down here in a building .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and they said you go to , you know , always see them in guns .
yeah .
five to seven bedroom them .
it comes out every semester .
yeah .
no .
none whatsoever
you call ,
we sold a refrigerator through it
uh-huh .
to sell the ski ,
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , i don't know , in fact ,
i'm s- , i can't believe themselves or something .
i mean ,
control is something that i wouldn't have the federal government to have .
so , uh , i like to see them have a lot of budgeting that they know who has the issues .
yeah .
uh-huh .
they do have too much control over us already .
yeah .
and our , we could look at the door and see how much control they have .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah ,
i guess so .
i don't know .
they're
yeah .
and , uh ,
no ,
i haven't either .
and they don't know if my wife or not have one or the greatest direction for me .
and i've always been a new car that i , i think that they were all young kids to do a , uh , primarily in the military .
yeah .
they ,
most countries require that now ,
yeah ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
they have you know , they have , it mandatory for , for the , the at least the young men ,
i don't know about the young women ,
i don't know if they have to serve in the military ,
yeah ,
a lot ,
yeah ,
too .
and , you know , her wife and then ,
yeah .
i don't think it's a bad idea ,
teaches , teaches a lot .
and whatnot ,
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
is that right ?
yeah ,
and still watch a lot of those stuff ,
i bet .
you have to .
yeah .
yeah ,
my father had been in the military .
i didn't do it myself .
my father had
and , uh ,
yeah .
he came from a poor income , right ?
and , uh ,
the family wasn't totally ,
yeah .
do it himself .
put himself through school ,
and he did .
yeah .
and my wife , my parents wanted to get to college ,
and ,
and they said , i don't know how they were doing .
yeah .
and , uh ,
and after , after the first fifty years , he was so long time , i guess , just try to , to work down and do something .
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
course my job was such that i didn't , i couldn't do it as much as i wanted and still i ended up going two or i decided to just get out my degree .
that's pretty good .
yeah .
that's good .
yeah ,
i guess .
yeah ,
and that's the kind of thing that i think that is , that is the best thing that i think is that the , the government is the best ,
i don't know .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
i mean if you don't like ,
uh-huh .
sure .
exactly .
uh-huh .
oh yeah ,
not all the time that takes because away from the opportunity to look for a job , but at least some of the time to look for , to go out and go to clean up the bottom .
you're , absolutely .
you know ,
i mean ,
all these , all this money that we're telling us to work out and do you go to work until things you're paying for all these welfare ,
yeah .
and , uh , if they don't see any problem with all that we want to go out with them and , and , if nothing else , if there's a lot of them do every day and together to them and never cut them the tree , houses .
yeah ,
sure ,
sure .
we'd learn service to other people in this country .
so ,
get something out of that money .
country would benefit ,
yeah
i've ,
and , uh ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
my next door neighbor when i was growing up , for the computer market up ,
and his job was just cleaning and things come down with the teachers and all that
i ,
that right .
yeah ,
and he , he had all kinds of stories .
yeah ,
and , uh , back in the morning they use to give you , uh , good for us , uh , health care and , and things like that
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and ,
what i hear one time , i think it was on truck and , uh , radio buff , that he said that the money that goes into the history over was to be given the people to stay all the united people in the government , other person
uh-huh .
i mean , i was going to do .
i don't even make that .
no ,
i know .
and , you know , when you think about the , the ground of between the money and the sex ,
yeah ,
and somebody's taking that away .
and ,
yeah ,
no doubt .
yeah .
and ,
i was going into public administration ,
and , uh , as far as i just got up so much of it with i just couldn't stand any more .
is that right ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
you sit there
and when you're writing up , hey , you wonder , how much money do we need .
and , you can't have any amount of business for the kids ,
uh-huh .
well just ridiculous .
yeah .
this is ridiculous .
it's sad .
it is ,
it's god's .
uh-huh .
there's got to be a better way .
but , uh ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
what would happen if the young mothers are people to do the service to the country ,
what should they get in touch , i think there .
uh-huh .
well , i think there are going to be some kind of odd as far as , uh ,
and ,
yeah .
give an hour .
regular or accounting training or something .
yeah .
something that's going to help them along the way .
and they'll help the country eventually , too ,
sure ,
i mean ,
because rather than having a bunch of people we can have no ability to ,
uh-huh .
and that's only going to help .
i mean i mean , look at the ground ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
one in five americans i'll read pregnant , that is , even a problem with .
and , and we've got the saints and the countries that are in civil science and stuff .
yeah .
uh-huh .
we're getting a service country .
as opposed to what we were twenty years ago .
yeah ,
we were an electrical engineer ,
and ,
we taught them how to do it ,
and they , they did it to do more than we do .
yeah
simple as that .
because they have the ability , i guess .
yeah ,
simple as that .
yeah ,
which is good for them ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
it's terrible for us .
uh-huh .
yeah .
because they learn that other people are a good thing .
yeah ,
and , and it can be good for them , too .
yeah ,
oh yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
i know .
and ,
i know .
give me the money
and i'll , i'll teach them all day
and , you know , you know , why they do it is so they can get them out of the house .
yeah .
yeah ,
and there's another one of the other hand .
parents aren't parents any more .
no .
they've , they've lost your ears .
yeah .
one of the other subjects is do you think the public school systems are in trouble ?
yeah .
and , as a substitute teacher for a year , i can , i say that's something .
yeah ,
and western pennsylvania , i think that are about three times that ,
and , you know , when you teach in school working on my degree my degree in my forties , i was , uh , teaching as part of the , part of the program .
and ,
that was a lot , that's probably the most fun i had .
yeah .
and , uh , it helped me out and things like that i learned and things to do that .
uh-huh .
and when they , when you get out of time to get out of school , i thought , boy , i'd like to teach .
but , uh ,
yeah .
yeah .
exactly .
and therefore , that , that's a sad thing to think ,
and , uh , kind of like my favorite ,
and i know that ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
that's right .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
that's wrong .
yeah ,
gosh ,
i mean ,
i'm not saying that men should be totally careful ,
i saying teachers should be paid more .
no ,
i mean yeah .
they do an absolutely necessary job ,
well , i mean , i have a great deal of these people who have to go out there and do that .
yeah .
i , uh , i think , there's a lot of sense of here , too .
yeah .
uh-huh .
what's more important , picking up the whole or these kids .
yeah
they both have their place .
yeah ,
they , they ,
sure .
but , you know , when it gets right down to it ,
uh-huh .
i mean , on the other hand , i mean , you take a small man in new york city starts out at twenty thousand dollars .
that's pretty good .
well i think you know there's a whole bunch of people up there that would take that time for thirteen dollars a year .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
oh yeah .
yeah .
there was a time when were driving done .
and they served a good way .
and they served a good way ,
uh-huh .
and ,
i remember , the company my dad worked for , the people that went on against the soviet union .
it was a mini skirt place ,
and they ,
this was during a time when the actual s was so cheap ,
and , uh ,
and they told the kids , it's ,
we need to you come back and get this stuff done .
or else we're going to be out of business .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
and , and all they had their own stuff .
sure ,
and ,
and , and that's what i really wanted to the whole industry in this country .
yeah .
uh-huh .
that's right .
and ,
detroit worked fairly hard on , on b m cans in this country .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
and , uh , you know , we've never had gone up ,
and i don't think we ever will .
it'll be a tough road , though .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
and ,
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
that's about right .
gosh .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
i think ought to go out and do some of the public service ,
i don't care what it is .
it was falling off in the country .
yeah ,
and pride in themselves , too .
that's right .
they could , they could , i mean , you could just consider something to write your community .
yeah ,
same old thing .
i mean ,
that's right .
that's like detroit scouts .
sure .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
i think they ought to take them and , i don't know , just have sort of a , a , a comedy and say okay , look ,
we need somebody
okay ,
we're going to talk about the public school system ,
okay .
what's wrong with it , an , or anything if is wrong with it and what we can do about it , what should be done about it .
fantastic .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah ,
yeah .
i always thought that teachers probably got paid enough , i mean ,
right .
and to be doing what they're doing , uh .
when i was in college i , i enjoyed teaching ,
i did i keep some teaching
and ,
i ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , i don't think ,
an , you talk about stress and things ,
i tell you what ,
and , uh ,
yeah ,
they're putting in fifty , sixty hours a week ,
i'm sure , because they've got to generation class and get friends in the paper system .
do ,
right .
and , uh , you know , they're being paid , you know , all these less than it .
exactly ,
i ,
and ,
that's right ,
and then they , uh , you know , it will be , you know , like that .
yeah .
i , uh , i think that ,
yeah .
and , uh , it's ,
i just don't understand that .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
now do you have little kids , or what ?
yeah .
sure don't ,
my wife and i've just been married about two years
or , uh , i think a lot of school , uh ,
and , uh ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
my wife and i have a , a three year old , almost a four and a , two years old .
okay .
yeah ,
okay ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
he's going to be going to kindergarten ,
None
right .
and , you know , we're thinking about that , we're thinking about that .
what's that going to be like .
are they going to be taught nothing ,
or they just went in apartment ,
we're going to , we're going to be involved in our own education .
we're going to be teaching him what we can at home , and then ,
right .
i , uh , i guess , i don't know the teachers that are , which is very important ,
exactly .
uh-huh .
right ,
that's true .
you know ,
uh-huh .
exactly .
you know ,
i mean give me a break ,
uh-huh .
right ,
right .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and dallas ,
right .
i couldn't believe that .
right .
uh-huh .
and ,
yeah .
so on and so forth ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
we talked , you talked about before , in the school scouts .
i think there's only going to be one solution to school and i don't think which will be the best way
or what we have to be going to happen is to have a lot of money for school and junior high school and junior high school .
that's the only way they're going to make if , because i could do for putting her , and , are you going to be a threat .
that's ,
yeah ,
and , uh ,
taxes right now are political events .
and ,
you know ,
and ,
None
yeah ,
and , uh , the only thing they would think of , they could be able to ,
if it works at colleges that i stayed down to scratch .
right .
and ,
uh-huh .
exactly .
and , uh , you know , the only day , the middle class , uh , people , i think .
and ,
and , uh , the ones that they're probably will have to , to carry the penalty and the lesser of the nation .
that's right .
uh-huh .
and most of the problems with kids in school and carrying them , and everything ,
uh-huh .
yeah
uh-huh .
i can't believe that .
uh-huh .
you never heard about that .
yeah ,
yeah .
no .
and ,
and , you know , going to do that , a woman , a lot of gun control ,
like good grief .
r- , right .
and i- , i think , i'd be able to find out of school , i mean , teaching , or even a student
and think , what it gets going to be like my , my mother's , is my oldest , my son when he goes to school .
what's going to happen ?
i mean , i think i'm going to go to him .
exactly ,
right .
but , uh , again , you know ,
another reason , yo- ,
and you want to encourage them , you know , to , to be active and everything in the school ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
and pop them outside when i was going to school ,
and that was ,
well i was , i grew up in nineteen forties ,
None
okay .
that was what , twelve years ago , i guess .
right .
uh-huh .
and what's it going to be like in my third year when i , uh , my oldest son is in high school .
that's right ,
that's right .
i'm afraid to , i'm afraid to even think about it .
yeah .
i , uh , i don't know ,
and , uh ,
that's all you can do .
yeah ,
i ,
you got to , you got to be your best friend , i guess ,
right .
even when they're a teenager and they , you know are kind of ,
still you got to be their best friend because when they've got problems , that they don't go to their , their friends that are going , or , or , or your parents .
exactly .
you know ,
uh-huh .
that's right .
and , and the schools are not really , to stay able to do that , you know ,
the schools are there to teach history and that we don't think our major war , huh .
they don't teach them good values like drugs are bad ,
uh-huh .
i ,
right .
uh-huh .
need to teach them good values .
that's true ,
that's true ,
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
and the last c n is a couple of them after getting to have a while .
right .
uh-huh .
i , uh , i think that you , you know , i think it was ,
you've got to start them at the home .
yeah .
you know
that's where they , that's where they get the , the deep fee now .
that's all you can do .
and , and , and , and , and that's kind of like a good job .
uh-huh .
None
that's right .
well , i just don't have to be able to do it .
uh-huh .
okay ,
and say , i guess the wind up here .
nice talking to you today .
you to .
uh-huh .
hi , is the oldest last year .
how are you ?
i'm doing fine .
where you from ?
i'm from new england .
massachusetts .
okay .
i'm from pittsburgh , california .
wow !
this is quite a , a long distance .
yeah ,
it certainly is .
do you have any pets ?
no .
use too .
use to ,
but none , right now .
yeah .
you get tired of them ?
i , i mean , i have a new car in there ,
yeah .
and , uh , and , and , and , it , it's just , it's not finished , you know .
i'd love to have a dog , you know .
and , uh ,
in fact , she just turned five years old , the computer fee .
ah .
i ,
is she ?
i beg your pardon ?
what is she ?
uh-huh .
and a regular nose , a little bit of the
and she's ,
ah .
ah ,
uh-huh .
not too long ago .
this is a little bigger than a problem .
yeah .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
and the fact she needed to work with them
and , uh , this is the only time she had to do
yeah .
but ,
and ,
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and things are starting to retire .
and they said , i live in the sixties ,
uh-huh .
and ,
and , uh , i find a little bit on the floor when i come home ,
but , uh , she's just been a good ,
yes ,
and , uh , i think that one has been ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , i guess it's a big difference for her .
uh-huh .
the way my mom's hated is just , for , just , having a puppy
but , uh , you know , this year
she's had it for , i guess three years now .
uh-huh .
yeah .
i , uh ,
and really like to , to say ,
uh-huh .
i'm a liberal person so i'm going to , to really remember , take a care of a pet
and if that weren't so , i would have one certainly .
i just , i just ,
it sounded like somebody not even have to go a dog
yeah
right .
and ,
and stuff ,
so , uh , i think , i don't have a cat person .
and , uh ,
and this cat is like no other one i ever have seen .
and , uh , it was a little bit on my dad ,
you know .
yeah .
it's just , it's just a great cat ,
i ,
well , my , my wife is , a good dog is a lot .
and they don't know that , uh , that i would have a cat .
uh-huh .
i just wouldn't want to own one .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
yeah
i don't know ,
i can't seem to have a brand with the cat i can like my dog .
yeah .
yeah ,
right
and they , you know , their minds or , or whatever ,
yeah .
yeah .
right .
that ,
yes ,
we're supposed to appreciate them .
uh-huh .
i don't know that a cat would do that , uh ,
yeah .
i used to have ,
a cat that could read me better than any human than it is being in .
yeah .
i could just walk in the door
and ,
yeah ,
yeah .
and our father could pick up on my news , uh , i don't go in the middle of the house .
uh-huh .
right .
None
yeah .
i know like when she has an accident , i know you're not doing it on purpose .
yeah .
when when she was younger , she used to do that for a lot of us ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
sure
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
really ?
yeah .
that's the way ,
and whatnot ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , the only time in my apartment and , and , uh , did it and , uh , did not get it away , it seems that , that it was going to be .
and ,
for me , looking at it . exactly next time to be able ,
all the time while it was doing it .
all right .
and see ,
animals have a way of it
you're with .
i tell you if i could have gotten a pair of that that cat .
well , i don't know that , i'd have to be happy in the world for a while .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
yeah .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
and ,
yeah .
it cost me over five hundred dollars .
ouch .
uh-huh .
and , uh , then we were going to go back ,
she was okay for a couple of years .
uh-huh .
well , you would like to put a new car for the house
and ,
and , uh , the same time , the same token , i think that we were going to a new car
yeah .
and ,
it's been about two years now .
huh .
it really is .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
what do you want to do ?
i probably would have had one goal .
yeah .
of course , you would .
uh-huh .
and ,
and don't know that , uh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , the first day we had to go .
uh-huh .
oh , yeah .
and then the cat died .
uh-huh .
and you know you'll be sure ,
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh ,
and , uh , you know , we just had the cat in the world because he wasn't good
really .
uh-uh .
so that that was kind of a sudden
at least ,
yeah .
you kind of wonder what really happened .
yeah .
yeah .
they , they suppose they did the best that they could have
and then the cat , uh , did it .
my goodness .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so ,
and , uh , that , that will be a little bit of ,
yeah .
and i think , i will
uh-huh .
and they say , they don't have any problem .
only work you'd .
yeah .
for cats anyway , you know .
yeah .
and stuff ,
it's been a pleasure talking to you .
uh-huh .
and you take them .
okay .
bye now .
maybe we'll talk again then
okay .
what is that sound ?
that's my husband at the door
uh-huh .
i'll let you go .
okay .
right
thank you
and say , what do you think about the television ?
and they say ,
and , uh , other than , three days on the house and one day off .
uh-huh .
so ,
uh-huh .
i play french one night a week .
and there's something like that ,
um .
what about yourself ?
that's pretty impressive .
and they said i don't care .
and the other thing is slow .
as much as a hundred and fifty miles a week .
uh-huh .
and hand un- , i don't know , a lot of a news .
and i mean it takes a lot over the summer .
and ,
yeah ,
that's , that's about the extent of it .
i mean , i don't do any of those things particularly , you know , for exercise .
i , uh , i guess the fact is the one thing of these , sort of , do like i think i need to go exercise
and there's something like a , a lot of recycling things .
yeah ,
and everything like a lot of music , you know , like a hundred percent of twins from the family
uh-huh .
and say , every year i got into the house .
uh-huh .
and that's mostly good .
how long does that take you to get to work ?
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah ,
it can be a pain .
and , uh , basically i think a lot of him on a
uh-huh .
so i can swim in the office and walk across the street and walk across the , uh , the subscription to do , uh , use the system , uh , it's , it's enough of a pain , that i did it one year ,
and ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
right .
and our , and sometimes if you had a wind code and then another half of the hour , you know , to cool down and take a shower and all this kind of stuff .
it was a big trend , here in the other day
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
do you ride a lot of repairs , a lot of those around there ?
not so much .
and , uh , i guess we have a little bit of ,
i've got a bike with wolves .
uh-huh .
and say , i haven't gone on any extra with him .
how about you ,
what kind of concerns do you do ?
and , uh , i mean , just got me to get it off
and i did an , did an expert at the market for the city between it ,
uh-huh .
the longest thing ,
well ,
i was a solid weight center ,
uh-huh .
and all i did and write heels and stuff
uh-huh .
None
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so ,
and did my first time you saw this year .
uh-huh .
um , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the world , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
and , uh , the only thing that i've been able to understand ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and i think , i kind of put her back a little bit , this weekend .
she wanted to go , go ,
i ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it's good to have a minivan .
yeah
it really is .
are you think of doing any , like , or ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
oh .
thing .
i mean people seem to get into the market .
one is more of a distance ,
and ,
they want to put some equipment on their bike and go for a while .
i've never really looked into that .
yeah .
my wife would just love that .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
there again , i'm just kind of a into this area .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i called this number
and ,
yeah ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
if you live around the dallas area , you got five or six months to come down here .
uh-huh .
because they're really into it .
um , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the world , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
is there all real good .
so ,
wow .
kind of caught the button .
yeah .
because i lived in minneapolis my wife is home
uh-huh .
and , you know , you may say one or two things on a gun that , or the age or the age of fifteen or something , but , but that other it's nothing like it up here is down here .
yeah ,
i'm not sure why that is .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
probably .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
it , there's a lot of rooms around here .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
there are a lot of , a lot of buildings , a lot of magazines , and stuff ,
little texas , is like , a little more money out every day .
um , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the world , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
it's free
just go to the bike shock , since you pick it up eleven , and pick it up ,
and ,
so i guess i'm going to be busy at this summer every year ,
uh-huh .
going to a different ride .
yeah ,
see a little bit of texas i've never seen before .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so , uh ,
yeah .
and , uh ,
well , i guess i just really thought about it for a while , uh , until i did my wife all friends were a lot of budgeting .
and ,
have you have a , uh , it's kind of off the subject , or something you had a , a , a blood basis since you've done ,
no ,
i haven't ,
no .
to see if it ,
um .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it gives you last church and data s and the u s x .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
even
yeah ,
i've , i've definitely noticed it's had a good effect on my daughter's home , rate .
yeah .
yeah .
really ?
yeah .
that's good .
yeah .
you say you ride about a hundred , fifty miles a week ?
yeah .
man .
that's , that's a neat thing .
on average ,
yeah .
when do you get to begin with the enemy and all that ?
what time of the year you do usually on your ,
do you ride inside if you can't do something ?
no ,
i'm not that going .
i mean there are some people ,
in fact a lot of people will sell him in the front room .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and , i don't know how they do .
uh-huh .
so , uh , i guess of getting the first for the winter , you know , because it will help your recycling when you're watching this .
um .
uh-huh .
and , yeah ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and they say , the other thing that i think is that the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the the world is the , the , the , the the world , the , the , the , the the news , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the water ,
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
right .
so , you know , that are a lot of your minds , and then ,
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the , the the news , the , the , the , the , the water ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
or sometimes i'll talk in the school .
it's nice coming ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
so it's fairly close .
yeah .
and , uh ,
as long as you're doing it every day , it's a good meal ,
yeah .
that's true .
sounds neat .
yeah .
it's kind of ,
i was wondering if i was going to talk with someone that i've never had married and see that ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
that's really good .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and keep up the good work .
okay ,
you , too .
all right .
take care .
bye .
bye .
okay .
and far as , you know , the crime in general , i think , like in texas , it's pretty much ,
and , uh , probably the same thing is going now in the oven
uh-huh .
and innocent and probably are the murder two more than the ones that we have .
how about you ?
and they say , i don't know how they live in the city ,
but ,
i mean crimes against schools to make themselves anymore , you know ,
or it , i think with the most grade on drugs and all this kind of stuff they have probably the younger parents would think the average percent , crimes are probably of becoming , uh , of course .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and watch that , i live now , it's not so bad .
i mean i can basically take my front yard and not have to worry about it .
uh-huh .
and this is a lot of these people who go from a lot of this war . just because they , uh , are like , houses , you know , on their street and stuff .
uh-huh .
do you live in a real small town or , or in the country ?
i live out in the country ,
yeah .
yeah .
i'm about fifteen miles out .
about fifteen miles .
uh-huh .
well ,
we are considered in the country ,
um .
yeah .
um .
uh-huh .
our , uh , the older thing is , uh , probably is , uh , house and all of his favorites , you know ,
however , i'm sure they're there .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
wow .
uh-huh .
that's huge
uh-huh .
and bought it , or something like that sort of may be able to , or whatever , you know , uh , carry the amount of , uh , the lower school ,
uh-huh .
housing and things like that .
uh-huh .
but it , you know , it just happened to our neighborhood from to another other neighborhood ,
so ,
are there , there are any thoughts on this area where you always ?
and they said the other way of the media was out of the sunday , uh , between some of the morning and in the morning .
uh-huh .
most ,
but ,
why is it happening ?
uh-huh .
and both people are working .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , so i think they would say that's the only three weeks .
yeah .
so they're kidding ,
uh-huh .
um .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and the , you know , mercedes , things that they can get , you know , big dollars for the , and the major are the japanese ,
guns , that sort of stuff .
um .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and whatnot ,
yeah .
and they ,
and , uh , i think we are about two thousand dollars a week ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
right .
i ,
i , uh , i think that's going to have to ,
uh-huh .
in other words , you've eaten the name of somebody being caught a little bit .
the real question is how do you feel to have to support people in such one type of the week .
and the , the first time we had to go out and get a little bit of the , the , the , the the same thing that we were ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
right .
they're doing that in our state , too .
yeah ,
and , and then ,
uh-huh .
but ,
uh-huh .
that would be , certainly a deterrent .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
and , uh , if they're still , just keep them in there to just accept they , uh ,
uh-huh .
so ,
course , i , i know you could be a hundred percent of the evening .
right .
they ,
yeah .
i'd rather see it a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence ,
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
and they said to the same bin is , you know , the laundry card and stuff with that .
huh .
right .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
during a house else teaches in and get a kid , the they've got caught ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
we went through the court system and all that sort of thing
uh-huh .
right .
uh-huh .
wow .
and , uh , you know , he was out of these small places and the system .
uh-huh .
did you , did you go around him with the civil system ?
do what now ?
did you blame him in the state systems ?
n- , no ,
i'm not real familiar with that .
and , you could probably be able to sell something for the children , or something ,
oh .
and try to get money from him
i ,
and this , the insurance companies and all that tried to , go to him after
and , uh ,
he has nothing ,
there's nothing that he has , that you could go after that .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
and , uh ,
yeah .
yeah .
they don't do that here .
course they pay them ,
yeah .
you or the insurance companies never see any of that money .
yeah ,
that's too bad .
and , uh ,
and they , they had been in the school system ,
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
they've been said , you know , several times , which is not ,
uh-huh .
and leave a lot of town to me .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
and car wise on top of it ,
yeah .
after my car ,
yeah .
and , uh ,
i ,
that's awful
uh-huh .
and , uh , he got to go out and see it .
fact , he's back in jail now .
uh-huh .
gives you likely to the u .
yeah .
what , what do drivers he is really going ?
yeah .
yeah ,
i think in our , in our particular neighborhood , is a lot of becoming , real good .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
they'll save one house ,
yeah .
right .
course it doesn't always work out in their field .
right .
but , uh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right .
and you can , you know , get some of us ,
you can't get all of us .
uh-huh .
and , uh , we're going to see more and more of that .
yeah .
and that , that's a deterrent , too . if you think that right after the family seemed , and , uh , it comes in
and you're going to get shot .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
we have had a few cases where the guy has broken in , you know , during the middle of the night and gotten himself to take him .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , it seems like a while or just then a second different people around in the morning ,
and most of the people are from wanting to , out from the state of the state .
huh .
uh-huh .
wow ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
yeah .
would be a definite deterrent
yeah .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
i mean , i , i tend to agree with you .
right .
uh-huh .
and maybe the one of the things that you can do is , to contribute to , is that if they , is guilty of the biggest , uh , welfare system , they lose their minds .
and they lose their minds .
uh-huh .
you know ,
and just a lot of things that i've got to talk about , you know , these people from , we just don't get them .
i know like in my husband's case , they had more comfortable like the criminal .
i know ,
and i think , i think that's the best thing .
they , they went to all ,
okay ,
have you painted something lately ?
yes ,
i have .
that room i couldn't do .
yeah .
and then since we have painted the basement .
oh yeah ,
another bedroom .
yeah ,
i showed that you one too didn't ?
the brown one .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah ,
the one that looks like a lawyer .
oh yeah ,
yeah .
oh !
yeah .
and , i mean , they get the one of my house and one .
uh-huh .
oh yeah .
you know where you get around the edge .
and stuff , that is good .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
now , i asked , or somebody else here if you always do that when you want the family , you know when you have the family that you have taken that , they have special that they have covered that and have some wonderful things that you can paint with that .
yeah .
how do you get the edge ?
the straight the edge ?
you just have to be real careful .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i ,
huh .
and stuff ,
i think i am going to do it this spring actually .
oh really ?
yeah ,
there are six houses .
yeah .
oh really .
as far as the character .
there are three houses on this street the same grade and everything has a big chance of living .
yeah .
uh-huh .
the quality is extremely vacation .
uh-huh .
mostly earth .
i think i am going to put something like a brown on it , on the outside .
uh-huh .
and maybe a , little brown john in the way or something and it will stand out a little bit .
huh .
what color did you paint ,
or , two , or fourteen thousand dollars .
yeah .
you know .
there are some reason that could be built a different test too .
uh-huh .
what color did you paint your house ?
white .
on the out ,
but , i have a lot of it .
i can't get up high
and , um ,
and , you know , have to get one of those .
we have one of those .
we are just not willing to get up that high .
and ,
a friend of mine that lives out in your neighborhood , he has done his house
and that is what he ,
i was out there last week
uh-huh .
yeah .
we did it in the fall
and ,
it is really scary ,
yeah .
and the only thing i would consider , a professional group , maybe not that ,
i ,
other than doing our own car i think it's a little better .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah ,
and then i was afraid to do the same way up to high school and stuff .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
what do you call those things ?
the accuracy ?
no ,
those where you built like a real thing .
yeah .
uh-uh .
uh-huh .
that's it
he came and did it that way
and , i think he gets a pleasure to get up to finish .
huh .
its ,
yeah .
and literally i wouldn't have done it with the fact because all the places that i had left for him were tested on huge and if he was , he goes and raised
and he knew that ,
None
uh-huh .
yeah .
so that was worth it getting a professional for that .
plus , he won up a good job .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
it wasn't too bad .
i mean you think ,
how much did it cost you for the paint for the outside ?
shoot , maybe a hundred and fifty .
yeah .
since , it is a one story ,
yeah .
yeah .
or something like that you know , you are familiar a lot of money than you are , you know , if you hire someone to do it .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
or remember the , of mine that house painted his house in your neighborhood and he went to , uh , i guess to start his dog and he like bought three months .
my word .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
they only signed him for one of dishes like thirteen . and everything goes by something .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and he saw it ,
so that was really worth it . new york then his house .
yeah ,
it was like over two hundred dollars worth of free stuff .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and , yeah ,
and the weather are going to do , uh , another bathroom ,
or what i think will just do it , in a microwave .
i want to do it about the same color . and just be a little ,
and whatnot .
we never any more .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and the fact that gets the same ?
uh-huh .
it's by the lower class to be done .
that's why there's written , such a bad area ,
yeah .
and , uh ,
yeah .
i don't know .
what do you think ?
what about ,
uh-huh .
i agree with the upper and lower level , you know because it's the only thing for themselves ,
plus there's nobody for them to look up to .
yeah .
okay .
uh-huh .
yeah .
because i remember even when i was growing up ,
okay .
i'm x friend to think when i was growing up ,
and , uh ,
uh ,
my mother drives us , it's like , i don't care what your friends do .
if you do it , then that was it .
yeah .
from anybody else .
and i knew that i would get in more trouble from my mother than from anybody else .
yeah .
and ,
so they don't care .
yeah .
None
yeah ,
i think i can agree with that too .
uh-huh .
you can't make parents be smart
that's true .
you got to kind of make people to do want the right thing .
you know .
i don't know how you do that .
i guess if you gave the , gave them jobs ,
that's another problem with the united states ,
there's no jobs any more .
yeah .
i ,
uh-huh .
or both of them .
that would work to a point ,
now , to put the blame on the parent .
and ,
i don't care what you do to them .
yeah .
you know ,
so that i think you get on how much that choice were in , you know .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
i don't care how you good , they are .
yeah .
ghost , at least one time ,
yeah .
here with this child in utah ,
but ,
yeah .
because that means she's still not doing what she's supposed to do .
uh-huh .
yeah .
because i just watched it on t v one night on one of them , um , twenty twenty , twelve hours , of them shows that one night had been dying to test .
um , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i don't know if you seen this .
no ,
i didn't see it .
and it was a little , it was a little bit of them between cars , you know ,
i understand .
and then when they got him , you know , his mother had gone there ,
now they don't take it back away from you .
that she was she stands .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
you know ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
what about with adults ?
anything do any about particular things .
yeah ,
start they
uh-huh .
yeah .
and ,
yeah .
if they would get rid of .
seems to me , i know there's a lot about that court people don't understand .
uh-huh .
there's more people in jail right now for child care , then you don't have there for doing people .
um , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
you ought to take all them little bitty stuff let them go ,
yeah .
let them go you know , give them a fine , whatever ,
make them do an ground then ,
yeah ,
i mean pro ,
put them in your house ,
they ought to put those people to work .
i call them all around , ohio , whatever .
yeah .
little rock degrees , all put them in there .
um , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
yeah .
jail you know ,
yeah .
and ,
if you write a bad check , you go to jail , right .
yeah .
let them go to .
oh .
not let them go and get out of it .
yeah ,
yeah .
yeah .
yeah ,
that's ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah ,
yeah .
maybe some of them are so far there they don't have that easy to pay anything for anybody .
uh-huh .
None
i don't know ,
some people , boy , they got ,
i think the united states has got too many problems to be tired about everybody else .
yeah ,
that's true .
now how they going to fix it , i don't know .
i don't think there is a ready solution .
no ,
i don't think so either .
they ,
because the economy is , people down , the , the , the , the low man is the deposit on is getting more of the , i guess , the habit of it .
yeah .
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and they don't have any incentive to work if we're just going to take fifty percent of it .
yeah .
might as well fixed ,
then they don't have to pay taxes on it
that's it .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
they could have had a fortune .
they don't want a fortune .
why not ?
they'd have a ,
yeah .
i would rather pay for a jury a two , three , two dollars , whatever i'm paying , you know a week or whatever , and never see that any of money , than to have them take a amount of my paycheck .
yeah .
and , you know , they are ,
and uncle takes his ,
um .
the social security which probably will be available to get that when you know .
because we're paying for social security they say at all .
yeah .
who's going to pay for mine ?
i don't know
yeah .
i'm not speaking on it .
no ,
you don't count on social security .
yeah .
yeah .
that's what i'm saying ,
they need to do something else .
um .
i ,
crime is going to go up as long as the economy comes out .
yeah .
and ,
yeah .
that's just like last night they killed them in that store .
where you at ?
i'm in raleigh , north carolina .
oh
no idea you don't know that .
and say , where are you ?
i'm in dallas .
okay .
yeah .
and , uh ,
and killed them ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
one was a store and one was like a , a fast price where ,
chicken or something , i don't know .
yeah .
anyway , they cross schools , not having them beat up all , the women ,
and they say , they just don't want them .
stuck them in the refrigerator and then shot them all .
basements .
why did they do in the nation ?
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
they didn't have to kill them or a dessert or , anything with that .
um .
um .
that's awful .
yeah ,
we still get some in raleigh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i ,
it's just getting really ridiculous down here .
yeah .
i don't think there's anywhere where there is going to be important .
and whatnot ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
the town is smaller and everybody knows how they gotten to come in there and do something .
where is ,
and , and , and see it all the time .
crimes aren't amazing any more .
yeah .
there's nobody is next door to you ,
you don't know your neighbors , and stuff like that .
yeah .
uh-huh .
because i moved out some lakes before they were because they were pretty traditional with that .
um .
and you didn't even ,
and what the manager , the manager won't do anything .
he's probably a drug testing day
uh-huh .
you never know .
you don't .
and , uh ,
wow .
uh-huh .
and this is like across the street .
um .
um .
yeah .
i say , see , this is it .
time to go .
that's it ,
and i moved to school .
yeah .
and , uh , you know , now i have a former profession in a rural area ,
but ,
and don't , you know .
yeah .
i'm kind of in the same , same kind of work , right here in town .
i ,
it's pretty nice .
i don't know how they can live , a neighborhood or , person or die .
that's what happen , that's what wrong ,
you know .
i don't think , don't rent them to
yeah .
or rent to them and them because they can't testing a lot .
put it on the oven .
yeah .
if you deal drugs , you can't live here .
yeah .
most of them are too scared to do anything about it .
uh-huh .
that's it .
yeah .
all right .
yeah .
all righty .
nice talking to you .
and ,
all right .
bye-bye .
bye-bye .
uh-huh .
and i've been ,
as far as i'm concerned , i find that the young women have lost so much because they have become more aggressive and more ,
and , i think that comes from their minds is a little bit against the same job in richardson .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and some of the , uh , i think it's , if i think anything , a lot of , um , the changes that have occurred ,
in some ways for the teachers
because i think women should have a choice ,
and i do believe in the , being able to have a choice to , as far as , what you would like to do with your life .
but ,
so that it makes , uh , it makes it more difficult to do .
yeah .
there are more things to work out .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and then you still have all the things that , um , that you need to do at home
and ,
and just the end of your house for so many hours a month that doesn't , uh , make things those other stuff
and the other countries are still important .
they ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
what would be a happy buff
or , or what would you like to see ?
and i like , uh ,
yes ,
i have worked outside of the home
i ,
yes .
i was in one of those safe .
i was a school teacher ,
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh
and they ,
and then , i guess i'm taking certain programs in my , business was ,
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
yes .
and raised those children
and now that my husband has been , i mean , her next week ,
yes .
which if anyone has been involved in that , some days it's more fun
and some people wonder why you have to find ,
right
because your fighting for your life .
i ,
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
i think they're going in by choice .
uh-huh .
yes .
yes .
and , and i have no problem with that ,
and the news used to be the president of the team .
and ,
uh-huh .
are not telling that happen .
they are very friendly .
uh-huh .
they , uh , they have one of the transmission would say , a good process .
yeah .
and they have to be in charge .
i ,
uh-huh .
i , uh , i think they could be a lot of world than they call my wife .
and stuff , what do you think ,
yeah .
i don't know .
i ,
the , the one problem i guess i have ,
and maybe what many people so , high schools are just younger than we are doing ,
i feel that in general , in this society , that being at home is not quite satisfied with , um , a job in itself .
uh-huh .
i know we , i know when you're working ,
and ,
and they said they were at a couple of them ,
well , i don't know to carry them , well , my husband likes to be able to put ,
i used to leave at three ,
uh-huh .
i keep going to eleven at night
and they had , they used to look down on women that were home ,
they'd say , oh , i bet you go home and ,
uh-huh .
and you can go home and put your garden and put up with my news ,
and ,
and , i used to be able to ,
uh-huh .
because they really had no idea what was involved when i got home .
now ,
uh-huh .
huh .
and ,
and , uh , there's a lot of things that
and ,
i don't know how you felt when you were home and what kind of sudden you got ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
you , you ,
once in a while , you hear them say things like , i guess the judge has been ,
uh-huh .
you know .
i wish i was the one ,
i would stay home with my kids if my wife would go out and support us ,
if my wife had an education and could support us ,
and the only value i see coming out of the ,
uh-huh .
this is that children now in , in a little home parent , which they actually have two children ,
yeah .
because i see my wife ,
i have a daughter who's a nurse
and , uh ,
right .
who's a former .
i ,
uh-huh .
my dad waited by ,
right .
how children off and the trim and ,
right .
right
men smoke up from school and ,
uh-huh .
and having a much better relationship with their children ,
that's true .
than my husband ever did
because he ,
that's true .
left home at five thirty in the morning ,
and , uh ,
yes .
and , uh , he was a little bit older
uh-huh .
right .
uh-huh .
and i think ,
and they enjoy it .
that's an advantage .
yeah .
yeah .
i ,
uh-huh .
i see ,
you're right .
i see many more men in the house ,
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
in the parks with their children ,
and ,
and ,
right .
and ,
a relationship with their father ,
and , and i don't know ,
yes .
think you , we get into so much of the mother that looks , if , if the father has more able to call .
yeah .
i , uh , i don't know how the other girls would have to have a chance to build ,
and they have to ,
.
yeah .
and , uh just recently a little bit older , the next year , a hundred thousand miles from the morning ,
uh-huh .
well ,
i didn't realize it ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
and she'd have ,
and i ask her how old he was
oh yeah ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
a truck for seven years .
and i thought , gosh ,
i mean ,
yeah .
why would a woman that went ahead and such justice ,
uh-huh .
and my husband is a little bit of a male ,
in that ,
he's a very strict person ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
but ,
yeah ,
now it probably doesn't work that way in our own organization i have taken care of things ,
yeah .
too ,
i , uh , i like to go into one of them .
i like my wife ,
i ,
back and , my door opened ,
uh-huh .
and i think that's something .
and stuff , that that's true .
there is that part , too ,
and ,
i ,
he was raised in the south ,
they ,
i think that's a little war buff ,
i guess ha- ,
both .
uh-huh .
and , and you have to , i guess you have to agree with , too much a lot of men , especially , i think middle age and older men , why they feel that way
and , and the rest of it worked for them to see , change in the country .
they've been used to being , really to be honest in , in society , and in a way , number ,
and they come home
and everything's done for them .
uh-huh .
huh .
and their meal is that ,
and ,
sure .
and i think , i think this would be honest out of the car .
yeah .
i ,
but , uh ,
uh-huh .
he comes from a person where women are , are at home and do it ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i'm kind of more ,
to someone in , thank you , talking to you , speaker
i'm kind of more middle of the road .
i think that when children are small , i think it's pretty good for people to work ,
there should be some , a lot more part time ,
uh-huh .
i don't believe this in math , that , this stays while , when they're small , when i think ,
uh-huh .
to someone in , they're minneapolis , they talk about ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
huh .
huh .
i tend to work more than thirty .
uh-huh .
i was part-time
and even that was a rat race ,
huh .
or something like that , you know , when you get to , the school system , you know , when the kids came home from school , i wanted to be able to ,
and whatnot ,
uh-huh .
it's more exciting ,
i mean you have to pay a lot of oil against your kids ,
i think a lot of ,
first then
my problem with the young mothers i- ,
talk about the activities that we don't do
yeah .
uh-huh .
None
but , i mean , i have a lot of friends with children
and , uh , i don't know if they were going to do that .
uh-huh .
that's good to hear .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and like families that get along with each other and like to do things together .
yeah ,
ye- ,
ha- , have a lot of values ,
i love that .
do they have children ?
and they said the , the only one who doesn't have ,
oh , yeah .
and , i mean , they were not really good .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
they're just going to have their first child
and they really like each other .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
i ,
uh-huh .
i'm like , really .
yeah .
i like to see that .
yeah .
uh-huh .
right .
they have two girls ,
one of the girl scouts
and the other in the fifties and stuff
and then the mother got involved as a result
uh-huh .
yeah .
and they take their kids
and they go for him and , on the winter time even in the , you know , to work with the girl scouts
and i think it's neat .
and ,
yeah .
which the organization can use the help .
right .
so ,
uh-huh .
we were thinking about getting cat
and ,
and , uh ,
he- , she said that her husband said to her daughter , you need a hobby ,
uh-huh .
oh .
and you can tell , it's a family budget .
the- , they're all a part of it .
and ,
and they start helping them .
uh-huh .
ugh ,
those are neat cats , too .
yeah ,
i've just learned about that breed .
they're really nice looking cats .
i have seven cats
yeah ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
and ,
and put it in , just these people who are , uh ,
little baby drives was pictures
and just it kind of built .
one at a time , just pulled it ,
i couldn't , you know .
one time two of them came at once
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , the last one that i was , uh ,
the kids brought him over and said he was a little home
and ,
and , uh , i just don't have a family ,
i just can not have another cat
and i looked out there ,
and ,
oh !
i ,
i brought him in so .
those are my children .
we don't have very many activities
i ,
no ,
i know what you mean ,
our cat plans to other things ,
and ,
and , uh , just , uh , his ability to be involved in the same thing
and ,
yeah .
we're going to try it with a lot of six and if her wife come out .
ha , ha , lots of luck .
is she jerry .
yeah .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is ,
real well
we're hoping ,
it's our last week
she'll eventually ,
uh-huh .
everybody's retired ,
everybody's else
and ,
right .
a bit here and there ,
i , uh , they put up with the other one ,
uh ,
he- , her wife will be out of bed for a while
and she'll want to , and say every now and then ,
but ,
uh-huh .
they h- ,
and ,
i mean , a little bit ago , are re- , you know ,
and ,
from , whose , our roof out , um , cat , i guess .
uh-huh .
and , uh , but ,
we- , i don- , i don't know ,
i don't have a problem with it .
i think they just learn to accept .
and ,
and they've the dogs around the house too
yeah ,
yeah .
every now and then ,
None
that's true ,
they've got to keep them in line .
yeah
but ,
and , as long as you feel like , uh , she's still got loved and everything ,
None
yeah ,
yeah .
they were fourteen pounds and ,
and whatnot ,
uh-huh .
and , yeah ,
it ,
three hundred and fifty dollars for a while .
oh my gosh .
and i think of those ,
i think of the orioles at the pound .
yeah .
three hundred and fifty dollars
yeah ,
yeah ,
and they are grown up
i ,
it's enjoyable ,
house payment
right .
that is a lot of money .
yeah ,
and ,
and you can't do all this stuff
and ,
i don't let mine out anyway ,
i ,
i let two of them out just in the back yard every now and then ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
people throw pictures at them ,
and people run over them
i ,
i know rome ,
and , and now they've lost the same time .
uh-huh .
i just have two that drive me crazy ,
uh-huh .
but ,
if they start going in the front and stuff , i bring them in a while .
oh .
uh-huh .
i guess i'm too thrilled ,
and , uh ,
i see these cats that are missing around the neighborhood
uh-huh .
yeah ,
yeah .
just by a doctor to another cat to get some , *[[ , would produce ,
None
yeah .
we know we try , try real hard to keep them healthy .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and not off of a busy break .
we're , we're having our house for our cat .
isn't that bad
people do it for their children
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
why not .
we- , because i , she loves , she's one of those that he said , outside ,
yeah .
and , and she doesn't go out
yeah ,
yeah ,
yeah .
i , i think that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you're off of the main road , you said ?
yeah ,
yeah .
yeah .
i'm just real ,
i don't know , i guess ,
i'm in a neighborhood
and ,
yeah ,
it gets hard , especially with the cars .
uh-huh .
it makes me sick ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
but ,
yeah .
except that i consider my children in them
yeah ,
our cats are our kids
or ,
yeah .
and ,
and ,
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
in , in her little dress code
yeah ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
i'm sure it has been done .
uh-huh .
i , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh .
yeah .
i've seen it in magazines and stuff where you dress your trees and move them to take a bit of ,
uh-huh .
i haven't gone that far .
i'm not that good .
no
uh-huh .
an
and , i don't think they'd like to do .
no .
i put a blank on her one one , day
uh-huh .
i took a picture of her
and that was all it , all it had for .
yeah .
do , do you have friends with children ,
or do they just all have young kids .
yeah ,
all the ones i know ,
my house has three kids pretty well down with the house
uh ,
and , uh , they go to , like to go skiing ,
we- , the , the middle girl doesn't get a whole lot of attention ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and they got it at the beginning of the house , where the oldest sister is going to be .
uh-huh .
i think she planned it .
she's only five ,
but , uh , i think ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
she needed that ,
wo- ,
oh yeah .
didn't she .
yeah .
and ,
my mother was an only child
so ,
and ,
so i don't know .
i think i would be extremely beneficial , or would have been , there had been another child in the family .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
tough ,
it must be tough .
she's broken .
yeah ,
yeah .
we- , she , she's the middle one ?
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
right .
yeah ,
that's tough , you know ,
uh-huh .
what's your opinion on the , our policy down there ?
i don't think we have one .
i didn't know we had one either
yeah .
i was going to say it's kind of hard to have , have an opinion .
yeah .
yeah .
everyone wrote the giants or we don't have sometimes the most money to be at the particular time that we seem to support ,
i don't ,
luckily it's whether you a territory or , or anything else .
yeah
and the only thing that i pretty much about is the inner student policy where , you know , they're just trying to , you know ,
military action in panama is the only thing that comes to my son seem to ,
and they just get out of the , the , the , the , the the news , the , the , the , the water ,
and then ,
yeah .
and then , of course , there was the , the first , uh , in the fifties , with the drug testing .
right .
uh-huh .
we didn't actually do anything .
right .
and that's , that's what i was about to say .
we didn't do anything .
i'm actually surprised at home in the military , with computers and over there .
i'm just kind of surprised we did that .
yeah ,
and , uh ,
and that is , that is pretty , uh ,
i ,
especially , i think that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the the world , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
i , i think that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
after our friend of mine was it pretty close to that .
uh-huh .
so , uh , i guess they had to do something .
actually bush has been better at that because i thought .
uh-huh .
he has a little more d- , a little more of a stand on policy than i thought he would .
i always considered him kind of a bit .
he takes more energy .
yeah .
maryland is kind of m- , that .
yeah .
he was .
i guess , i think of the most of my book is now , uh , a lot of foreign and , and how much , you know , policy .
yeah .
yeah ,
but , you know , if we , back up what we say , what we know with the budget .
and they go to the end of the house , and the , the , the , the , the the news , the , the , the , the water ,
we have so far ,
but ,
i don't know ,
really haven't ,
how long it's going to last .
of course , we really haven't taken on the drug testing , yet .
yeah .
i'd be interested to see if we do that .
well why you , i think it's going to even though , because you , i'm against it , i don't think we can go into another country and do something about the other problem .
yeah .
we did in ,
yeah .
i ,
saudi arabia .
no ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , i guess they have a lot of things
uh-huh .
it could be an interesting , interesting problem with .
right .
i don't know if they could do it or not .
did you read tom and a clear one on ceiling ?
and they have a big problem with that ,
i didn't .
i think you need to pick that up and read it .
uh-huh .
it winds the problem .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it was on the ground compared to that time .
it , it's quite formal .
and either he knows somebody
yeah .
because its , it doesn't take close to him .
yeah .
so ,
so ,
i mean , you know , it , i think it pretty much got with , uh , with the backyard and , with the system , uh , middle east ,
things that , that are important about , little bit over the street , i think .
i think , i think the big thing is trying to stop here on the front home
and therefore ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i think we realize it's hard .
we just don't , we just don't ,
nobody ,
don't want to admit it yet .
wants to make the , nobody wants to make the ability to be home in terms of ,
right .
we still , there's still t- , there's still too many and roll and all that they are down .
yep
yeah .
that's true .
there's too many opportunities in your house .
they can't agree on anything .
and they have you on as far as the policy is going to .
as long as you're getting into , as long as you felt about it as okay .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
huh .
uh-huh .
i guess it's automatic conditioned .
depends on how much power you have ,
yeah .
you know ,
and that they can .
the people have a right to know except about it , what about it is higher than that .
yeah .
and these are the people that make the current system ,
and it was just , it's a lot of ,
uh-huh .
probably .
maybe the middle of all money off their minds anyway .
huh .
every time you drink stories , you're paying in the country .
i don't drink heels .
good .
don't ever drink excuses ,
it's terrible .
i quit jim when i found out about that ,
but , uh ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
i ,
we ,
uh-huh .
we ,
yeah .
don't want to them off and have them over the refrigerator
and then , because then our economy would be pretty bad .
yeah .
of course , in shape and around there with the grocery and the , that's been going on for years .
uh-huh .
it'll still be the same thing .
yeah .
those people down there don't really ,
i mean ,
i think it's going to have to get worse before it gets to death ,
you know ,
uh-huh .
the same old concerns .
they can't figure out what they want down there .
right .
if you give everybody what they wanted there is a lot of judges , those wouldn't know how to come because they have no education .
right .
and they'll just pick him right now .
and then the people , the wrong people are just going to vote their way up to the top ,
and it'll learn ,
it's all righty .
be for nothing .
it's all smaller .
they have to ,
you have the n class
and you have everybody else .
yeah .
and whatnot ,
appreciate talking ,
it was very pleasant .
to you .
all righty .
good ,
hey , what was that book ,
talking to you .
what was that book that you were saying to read ,
tom ,
again ?
uh-uh .
it's called a clear and present .
a clear door and louise .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
okay .
all right .
well , i think if you , i think that i read , you know , making a real kick out of it .
all right .
thanks a lot .
all righty .
bye-bye .
bye .
they ,
hi
one thing you know that i always think about when i think of public school
i believe he went to the public school , um , system of the community ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , i think that they were working at school ,
and ,
um .
you know what i mean .
uh-huh .
an yet i felt that i got a good education
and , i mean , i don't know ,
but , you know , to do it , you know , five years ago
an i ,
uh-huh .
couldn't do it .
i just felt like there were some real estate that are missing from that ,
they ,
and the people are , from picking up some not even guilty as many people feel .
yeah .
one ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it's , we're doing it at n c n ,
yeah .
we're trying to think the computer science metal ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right .
yeah .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
and whatnot ,
uh-huh ,
did you notice a big difference ?
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
a big difference .
like in what aspect ?
uh-huh .
people can take lower level courses in the work real upset with me .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
you had to learn .
yeah ,
i work in a temporary category
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and they'll have to bring somebody with them ,
and they will take that they show , uh , four years of high school ,
yet when it comes to the garbage account for a half easier ,
they ,
they can't read enough to be able to fill out the weather on themselves ,
that's bad .
it's just incredible .
yeah ,
our state cut a whole bunch of a , i think it's ten dollars out of the local school .
really .
uh-huh .
in college people cannot , i mean , the teachers can't make any tests that ,
and th- , the library of all these stuff is .
yeah .
it's pretty sorry .
i know ,
yeah .
i forget
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
they're different i can .
uh-huh .
they ,
or anything like that ,
they're not cutting in any other countries
they're different i can .
and that way to go a little , uh , switch in ,
yeah .
you know .
uh-huh .
are yo- ,
yeah ,
it's my last year
you're a , so you're a senior now .
yeah ,
i'm working on my projects trying to graduate ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
that's great ,
uh-huh .
n c state .
what did you say ?
n c state .
n c state ,
that's a state university then .
yeah .
i see .
and you're from there ?
and stuff ,
and , uh , i was born in the past ,
and then i lived in ,
uh-huh .
most of my life .
i see .
and ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
it's just a little bit expensive .
whether this is one of the old things .
oh , oh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and , uh , you know , like two hundred dollars ,
yeah , you're not that bad
uh-huh .
yeah .
that's good .
i went to a private university
and , uh , i don't know ,
i look back now
and that , i think that i would have done it against it because if , um , you could do it over again .
yeah .
i , um , i have a lot of friends that went to school or says to death penalty , maybe some of them ,
and ,
i really do
and that's probably a pretty sad thing to say .
but , uh ,
yeah ,
i don't know ,
i ,
where did you go ?
i
what ?
where did you go ?
i went to the university .
uh-huh .
it's in garland .
and , uh , i really like my wife now i've been working for about four years ,
uh-huh .
and , i think , i don't know what i've learned is a little bit more times then what called him in school .
oh .
i , uh , i know that i learned in a lot of time , you know ,
and , i just don't gain them a lot on , on the weekends .
but , uh , i don't know ,
my husband's a substitute at that ,
and one thing , uh , we were trying to put out of the , um , making out and the two ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
and they say if you want to , you know , someone don't notice it unless you have their permission .
yeah .
uh-huh .
no ninety-seven hair or anything like that ,
and , uh , the fact that you have in a , it's , um , for what they were ,
uh-huh .
and ,
i think they don't value that type of business as much as you get ,
yeah
that's ,
in some .
sorry .
that they , they like that , they watch twenty-three on the future , we pay them more than the children ,
yeah ,
it's true .
consider the others .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and ,
i mean the teachers do get ,
i mean personally i would get more strongly out of taking someone that wasn't as successful .
yeah .
and seeing that they do want to do somebody that was in california , in and just watching them get better , you know .
yeah .
that's not much of a challenge .
that's true .
yeah .
uh-huh .
oh yeah .
yeah .
do you know where you're going ?
i think i'm going to hill .
where's that ?
that's in provo hill
that's the name ,
oh , is that north carolina ?
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
no ,
i don't know that area .
the c a c n , u s c ?
i just don't know it .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i don't get down there very often .
they won the whole s ,
and ,
in fort satisfied too .
well yeah ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
i ,
so obviously you're into education .
yeah .
if you can be going ,
my husband went to , is in graduate school actually right now .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
i don't know
i give you a lot of credit .
i couldn't do it ,
i ,
yeah ,
i know .
i couldn't wait to graduate and have ,
oh .
it be all over .
i can't wait to graduate either ,
i know .
now .
i've got all of this stuff due
oh wow .
bye-bye .
yeah ,
i kind of know what you mean .
uh-huh .
all right .
okay .
good luck .
all right ,
thank you .
all righty ,
take care .
all right ,
bye .
bye-bye .
and we're going to be a little bit of a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a ,
uh-huh .
i guess the next car i'll be looking for is a lot of a old door
what kind of a car do you have now ?
uh-huh .
and then , uh , a lot of our car is a , a little bit of , uh .
yeah .
and ,
yeah .
that same kind of four door , hard top style .
you got kids ?
and they go ,
yeah .
okay .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
huh .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , um , since my wife's husband at a dorm brand new york
that'll do it .
yeah .
that'll do it .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and our next car , a little bit older , a big one old , uh , four years ago , that all the kids to collect the fish and baseball lessons ,
and ,
uh-huh .
and that's great .
well , uh , i don't know ,
well , i used to drive a lot of ,
uh-huh .
so i ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , and this was a pretty tough town .
and it ,
and the engine just went .
uh-huh .
so i , i think , i used a , a daily loan ,
yeah .
which has been okay .
really ?
and , i mean they had it that long .
uh-huh .
but , you know , it was an eighty-five ,
it ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , i just , i just drive it to work .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , i mean , it's not like it finally turning through it .
yeah ,
yeah .
but , uh , i think that ,
and ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
i've got three kids ,
yeah .
so , i ,
sounds like you , you need at least like a doctor member ,
yeah ,
that's what ,
or something like that .
i was thinking of ,
was a divorce .
they ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
and they have the , the ones that have , families , uh ,
and they still want a lot of sports a car .
uh-huh .
and ,
that i guess it's the sports of the population of your name ?
yeah
in fact , it comes with a standard stick
and , uh ,
ooh .
and a lot of those .
and it comes with a bigger engine and the things like that .
and , uh ,
yeah .
and usually they're in like black ,
and gun metal and those kind of types of snow .
and not that way to see too many , you know , green ones or , oh , use child or whatever .
yeah .
they , they put them in academy colors i guess .
and , uh ,
yeah .
and , my wife wants a lot .
uh-huh .
yeah .
until , until you look at the price for us
right .
and then you go , what ?
right ,
yeah .
what would i , besides around myself and looking really having a extra lot of fun , what would i really do with this car ?
i know ,
i know .
it's like i , i guess i could fit in it
yeah .
i ,
maybe
and went , i went through that when i first got out of , uh , college .
i had an old car that i bought just to get to , to my son's , my first job .
yeah .
i ,
oh .
i , i know that was going to be the only time i could afford a two bedroom , uh , sports car .
yeah .
but , that , just not that may be not as good as the other .
uh-huh .
yeah .
i bought a set of soy cheese and it was one of those and cash .
i had to take them one at a time ,
with the top down .
yeah .
and ,
and the street in the corner .
yeah
and ,
and then i went back and got the other one and put that in the ,
french and drove that one and home .
and , uh , do it , nothing ,
yeah .
and ,
yeah .
and i think ,
uh-huh .
most people that i've talked to did stuff like that when they were in college ,
uh-huh .
but , you know , when they were single anyway .
yeah .
they'd , they'd buy themselves a car because it was their last year .
i never did that .
so , uh , you know , my first car was a toyota .
and ,
yeah .
and , uh , i guess a good deal on it and , uh , that was a little bit more .
actually i met ,
that's how i met girls was , i'd find out if a girl could drive a farm fry , which i , i had never ,
i , i'd learned on an automatic pet .
uh-huh .
and , so well , i'd go out on where they would teach me how to drive this year .
boy , that's a good deal .
and , uh , in fact , i know those of those people
ah , okay .
and it worked .
and ,
yeah ,
it worked all right , real good .
huh .
i , i know , i know ,
that's , that's something that , that we definitely have to go with is an automatic pet .
and , uh , my wife just , i can't ,
she really doesn't want to learn i guess ,
yeah ,
yeah .
and the , the standard v .
uh-huh .
yeah .
we got one of these things from mississippi that said , you know , i'll give you a fifty percent thousand dollar style if you'll test drive a car .
yeah .
and , uh , we went to , uh , we went to a christian school
and , uh ,
yeah
it was one of those things that we went to just a big size and the , uh , them kind of gave her standard shift parking ,
because that was all it was .
it was , it was the same thing ,
uh-huh .
a big burden he's ,
it was a vicious worker with everything on it ,
wow !
yeah .
that's weird !
it was the thing i ever saw one .
yeah .
and , and , and that's probably what they were trying to sell them , i guess .
huh .
and , uh , we just kind of went back and forth and forth and forth .
she did pretty well after a while .
yeah .
i , uh , i just kind of hard to learn , i guess .
uh-huh .
i mean , you'd always spend those traveling by jury .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
in fact all our earlier cars were a standard citizen .
in fact , the fact a , has a stick shift .
uh-huh .
and in ,
this particular is , the first car we've ever had gotten that .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
you know , electric group .
yeah .
yeah ,
you know .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and , oh ,
and , i guess , i guess that's about all i've got to say ,
about cars
and , you know ,
uh-huh .
i will say this about the moment .
uh-huh .
we thought that was a big car when we bought it .
uh-huh ,
i would think so ,
yeah ,
it , it ,
because it's so big .
yeah .
and , and it was like ,
it had a religious system .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
we always had the a m radio .
sure ,
sure .
and , uh , of course , this has had that , uh , read the wall that you can control from the back .
uh-huh .
and you can change the channels on the , on the radio from the back seat too
uh-huh .
and put s- , voted in it or something .
None
now , now , that now used to be a luxury ,
i mean some things on the next car , you buy a lot of money , that's possible .
right .
you've got to have that now .
that's right .
that's right .
you're used to it
and , you know ,
and you've got to pay for it too .
yeah .
that's true too .
it ,
and i bet , i guess and check it costs as much as , when i bought it
it probably does ,
it probably does .
and , uh ,
we ,
and , oh ,
yeah .
nice talking to you .
okay ,
you have a good evening .
thanks a lot .
um , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
bye-bye .
bye-bye
what kind , h- ,
what kind of cars do you , do you usually drive ?
right .
uh-huh .
yeah .
i guess that's the way we were raised .
and , uh ,
and when we came back we find out we didn't have five o'clock in the family .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
and four cars
and ,
really ?
at least two of them .
we bought an inch and a buick would be .
and , uh ,
they each had two thousand miles or something like that .
uh-huh .
turns out a pretty good place to buy cars because they are them to maintain
and they can show the records you have gotten all their own opinions on everything and stuff like that .
uh-huh .
my daughter was a freshman in college when we bought it for her .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it's like solid tomatoes
i bet .
you're one short .
i bet .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
even though my dad was a buick man worked and ever had to
and ,
yeah .
and ,
it was almost like
and a chemical governor was a few
and ,
and , uh ,
yep .
as we got older and got away ,
and ,
and ,
i , uh , we have lived in t i for in nineteen , uh , nineteen , two , four , three and four .
uh-huh .
and , and , of course you don't have any papers in the backyard that ,
no .
yeah ,
and , uh , i don't have that i've heard of the other ones .
i just can't afford them here .
and they say , i just don't remember that i would watch .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
we lived in the past t i for in , eighty-six , and western
and , uh ,
which is somewhat similar to the schools .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and have you had experience with one other than the ones you have ?
and stuff ,
yeah .
these are the first cars that my husband and i have been president there .
um , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
the others were hand me through the fall .
yeah .
and those were always at m w .
yeah .
and , uh , and then
uh-huh .
and , uh , we were real happy with them ,
but , uh , the only ones that were the , you had ,
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
really wou- ,
the b- , the big ,
g m cars .
yeah .
and ,
and ,
sure ,
sure .
and ,
yeah .
when we got ready to buy , we needed a car to get a new car free to it
and quite wondering , we were afraid of the , the b m w on the morning .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
you know , as far as opposed .
right .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
you know , doing the refrigerator and everything on them as long as we didn't have to do it very often .
yeah .
uh-huh .
it just kind of seemed to be the magic number for them
yeah ,
yeah ,
it seems that something goes every month .
yeah
it ,
and ,
you know ,
we got three and an eighty-four
uh-huh .
and ,
and ,
uh-huh .
well i guess they're going to .
uh-huh .
and , uh , but we had a family on the floor to sign up
and , there were five years old ,
and five , five of us never go anywhere together here .
o- , everybody's extremely seed in their own direction .
right .
and ,
uh-huh .
and ,
and ,
and , i had forgotten what about a little car was like a big car .
it's like a seam .
it was just nice .
it depends .
yeah .
what ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
it was a great car .
yeah .
it just ,
we ran the sun off right of it .
yeah ,
yeah ,
yeah .
i , uh ,
i'm in the quality business at t i ,
i'm a quality called
and ,
we sell ,
i'm in the past show
and ,
uh-huh .
and there is a , amazing ,
i am just , uh , really impressed with the , the quality that are the , justice that , these companies have put into their minds
and ,
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
and , uh , we used to think , these guys were responsible for us .
i mean i was growing up ,
and am , when i was growing up , you know , that , that real people that they've seen general motors ,
and missed them ,
that's right .
ford products .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
and , uh , i know , and making that are doing that ,
so ,
and ,
their colors are pretty getting a good quality right now .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and we went up to the local area
and ,
he said i'll tell you what , for a certain day a week you can give a new restaurant in town .
um , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the world , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
and we drove that down
and ,
i bet
we had that for three days .
and i absolutely ,
except i couldn't want to have to park it in terms of the places all the time .
no .
they ,
i wouldn't want to have to pay for the gas , either .
uh-huh .
and , uh , you know , it was a lot of ,
driving around down there we have got oldest and sixteen miles a hundred percent ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , it was pretty good .
are , are ,
.
are you planning on getting any of the other cars ?
no time soon .
yeah .
um , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the world , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
uh-huh .
yes .
uh-huh .
both of our cars are getting ,
um , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the world , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
uh-huh .
and ,
we drive a lot .
yeah .
you got another , another thirty or forty thousand dollars if you get it .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
probably we'll get something in the next couple years .
my son will graduate from school this year ,
and ,
uh-huh .
it's right ,
uh-huh .
he wants to go to texas tech
and ,
i , uh , the next year to go out when he goes to the office , he wants to be a ,
and i want to ,
a pickup
a pickup .
i may get one and not let him have it
yeah .
they , they're very popular around here .
uh-huh .
and , uh , the other two , four weeks ago ,
and , uh ,
and they said , they don't have a lot of things that they have to do that .
and they said , i don't know ,
and they said , the , the credit cards has been a lot of rain where you want to do that
and you call this area
and , uh , they have the same price for you .
uh-huh .
and , uh , or , or something to put a guy with our friends and got a big deal , and , uh , just bought a couple of lunch ago
uh-huh .
really ?
yeah .
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i think that would be a good idea .
and ,
and , once , one thing that's a lot of the nation in between us and stuff .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
this is the car we want ,
will you sell me this car for that place .
and for that price .
and , and then
we , with our ,
when we bought our , the guy was like , you can't do this to me ,
uh-huh .
we'll go somewhere else .
yeah .
you know .
uh-huh .
yeah .
i ,
and , uh , and , i think that's the only way you have to do it .
when , when i was young , i went in and bought a , a couple of weeks , on a lot of a ,
this is nineteen twenty ,
uh-huh .
i'd first come to texas , and find a lot of cold between a red sox that i just loved ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
i told him how much i wanted to pay ,
and ,
and then i'd like to have some friends that he could do this , uh , we could go ahead and get out .
and they said , if he could get this rate i can afford to get
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
and , i was only twenty-five years old or something i , i guess
and my wife , i don't know , i'd ever done this because of my dad had the family from my friends who came from his milk card ,
and , uh ,
and , uh ,
he'd heard i was going to get a car , and asked me what i paid for it .
uh-huh .
he says call this friend of mine at least at the point .
there was a guy that owned a hook up there .
uh-huh .
and ,
and just driving fifty miles out of town , it was a nice town ,
and , uh , it was a lot of four hundred dollars ,
uh-huh .
goodness .
is all we paid for cars in those days .
and , uh ,
and ,
i'd left him a check for tax , and crafts and everything ,
i , uh , i want to say my husband's order to , and try to keep the money because i'm going to , i've stopped on it payment
yeah .
he said what did you get a deal for , bill .
and , i suppose ,
he says , somebody's taking you for a week .
and ,
that's right .
and , uh ,
and for the longest time then i drove up to point
and , and the , the first week and then since ,
and , and some of his friends are taken over the business
and that ,
but ,
and , since then i had a
okay ,
well yes ,
we do have pollution in houston
and ,
how bad is it ?
do you have cable or do you like in ?
yeah .
some ,
and see it , you know , what you , know , what the , the clock ,
and , uh ,
just , it's hot ,
uh-huh .
and the news they needed , used to death or something
yeah .
i ,
it depends on whether you have some sort of churches , i mean , it would be .
i think so ,
and , uh ,
yeah .
and we have , uh , have , texas which is sort of an hour here , you know , toward the union drive ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
what do you think is your career class of it .
and stuff ,
and , i think it's more ,
you do ?
you really think cars have a lot that now we get taken out of the gas ?
i don't , i ,
well maybe not ,
but , you know , it , it doesn't ,
uh-huh .
and , i know that i'm from , when i'm behind a car
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , you know , my head and my wife ,
i'm so standing down right now ,
they ,
my goodness .
so ,
that's part of it ,
but , uh ,
uh-huh .
i think a lot of it's dark .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and that , uh , that , uh , that , uh ,
but , uh ,
i , i , i heard a little bit before a week
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
that they could cut the pollution pollution by just fifty percent of getting by those side that kids are left some sides of time .
yeah .
you mean , you know , fifty percent of education from that we went to ,
from , from cars
that is , not , not total and just from cars ,
okay .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
i ,
and it just started getting , uh , gives me a good service
and ,
uh-huh .
on the other hand i know it's a more much more than any of the newer cars don't have .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right .
and , uh , that may be part of the problem .
uh-uh ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
or it like , i mean , what's the best i really , uh , believe is the , the main problem .
and , uh ,
i , uh ,
and ,
really ,
yeah ,
and , uh ,
like what ha- ,
any particular kind of all kinds or stuff ?
uh-huh .
and , uh , i think that ,
of course you expect this sort of bad for ,
uh-huh .
my wife's a registered worker ,
and that this was like this state was just last year to the middle of , in terms of , uh , welfare tax for all just kinds .
and ,
i just don't know exactly what it is necessarily ,
but , uh , i don't know ,
um , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
they use eighty miles in plano systems in the backyard and then like the heat of parole ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and that's also what's our atmosphere with to handle its peers and then .
uh-huh .
and to see businesses if it's helped me to have the lead atmosphere , you're using it that it's not , it's a mobile home as we had a very threat in our ,
and having all kinds of problems ,
i , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
well what do you think about the , the , the , the air conditioning problem ?
yeah .
and i know and several and the other countries are poor people , are able to talk to you with a motor school for ,
uh-huh .
and that still does going to be , uh , a cadillac .
because they have a little bit with football moving in a lot of cold programs , because , then ,
and that is also in the , uh , vermont ?
yeah .
uh-huh .
even , so , so the weather might still be ,
right .
but ,
no ,
they , they , they passed a law and made them a little bit of the bored thing ,
uh-huh ,
well that's good .
and that was a move in the right direction .
we are doing some things to try to correct the problem .
uh-huh .
and getting rid of old cars , like i said is one way to help the correct thing .
uh-huh .
i notice in this state ,
i don't know if you're doing it in texas or not yet ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
here , they've just started , started doing that ,
uh-huh .
you're not , you don't have to ,
but , uh ,
i know i am .
i save ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
uh , i don't know ,
in one of the sudden here , they're actually doing a trial at least of a trash have her .
they have a lady that goes around like a pound and
and ,
no kidding ,
really ,
oh .
yeah .
is that right .
they'll eat you total look like the first time and two hundred and the second time .
and ,
we need to get serious about it .
yeah ,
you ,
right ,
you've got to get people to see i- ,
uh-huh .
they've stopped that up here too .
uh-huh .
but that , that will cut up too much .
because you get a lot of out of these programs , i think , and really ,
for awhile cans and , they got a little room at all ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i'm not sure of that .
yeah .
uh-huh .
too .
and , i think that , uh , trying to get along with your environment and stuff it is a very , very important thing .
uh-huh .
and , uh , that can be able to fight about , the state that they are .
uh-huh .
i would hope that they would take a budget , though .
that's for sure .
and , uh , the same thing was there going on , around here , that , that ,
we have all these plants and oil and those kind of things that they could pick out a lot of things ,
uh-huh .
and some of the stuff that they weren't supposed to do that somebody out , you know , like in the middle of the night , they would go ahead and do it anyway .
i think they got caught .
oh good .
i ,
and that out of the , the car that may go on a lot
and the reason i think it may be a lot of time on just as you said , somebody happened to stay up late at night or something .
and don't think we have a little vegetarian , uh , particularly in the ground .
and they have , we have good at least in this , and , and several of the states and probably do yours of , too ,
because ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
do you all have that ?
and they go ,
we don't have a state brand ,
None
which i ,
i don- ,
i would think ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
or ,
i don't know ,
and there's something that you'd have to go check with your wife .
and in this state we have to , uh , pay eight dollars and a half a half to a , an american pool now and get a one of our cars that are trying , had been such changed in nineteen months .
yeah .
they don't check how good ,
if your lawn of good or getting the old plan and good .
no ,
no ,
we don't have seen that .
now , i'm in maryland ,
in virginia they check that every two years , i think .
we do that , every year ,
and , i think that's a good idea ,
not , no- , not that it has anything to do with getting up saving education ,
uh-huh .
the actual check , though , is going up in maryland
and ,
and ,
well ,
i'm not sure if , if our state membership would be ,
once a year has to do , you know ,
but ,
uh-huh ,
yeah .
and that they don't have to do something , i would certainly , uh , uh , encourage you to be able to be , uh , in terms of ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
yeah .
i'm for anything that up the air and the water or , or , or anything .
oh yeah ,
i , i agree .
now that's another area we haven't even seen
and that is the water and all of the other types of , of course , uh , like , uh , food like that .
i mean you , you can't have any , hear anybody else or anything like that .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
i've worried , especially the last few years just about how good the water we have in this country for is , uh , like the ,
uh-huh .
i know a lot more people are going to own t v .
well
yeah .
because they've found out that that's just comes out of its peers .
yeah ,
an- ,
yeah
None
and , uh ,
some of this
and , uh , you know , a lot of people have guns ,
in fact in this area too
and , uh , the other one ,
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
if you don't get it tested you don't necessarily know what you're , what you're in ,
i , uh , i know , a lot of people , you know ,
and , you know , you have to wonder if that , you know , could have an expert on them too ,
yeah .
yeah .
yeah ,
i'm absolutely for water out of water as long as you heard of the time , have it checked out of the water
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
it was one of those that are ,
i forget what you call those things ,
uh-huh .
and , and that was some of the best water pump ,
i mean , i can still to be this day water that .
when we were ,
when i was growing up i lived in , alabama ,
yeah .
and , uh , his car is from , uh , spring .
uh-huh .
and ,
and , uh , the other one of the church , they don't know , get that ,
and , uh , that was a lot of those stuff .
and see what they said it was .
it was really , really good .
yeah ,
the- ,
uh-huh .
it depends of course where you are .
a good well , though , i think is very healthy
the american express situation in ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and i find that they don't .
i'm not sure we have the right solution to it ,
yeah .
i ,
uh-huh .
the source of them's .
and the fact that , we're going to do
uh-huh .
that's true .
very definitely so .
in fact i think a lot of the ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
i've never been to other parts of south america ,
i , uh , i have been to the same time ,
and ,
and ,
uh-huh .
no .
yes ,
right .
very prevalent in that respect .
and that , i think that they need , uh , need to be able to ,
yeah .
i agree .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , the , the only are a poor or whatever .
i know ,
are extremely poor .
that's correct .
and s- ,
but , uh ,
uh-huh .
how calling your side from the areas , you can't imagine what your child is .
and , uh , the worst thing i ever had any , i think was someone , uh , eating out of a , on a garbage of the ground in , around there .
and , and just very happy to get that .
and see ,
yes .
i have a brother who spent two years in january .
uh-huh .
and this is very much , his wife , you know , that rich are the rich and so poor are so poor .
uh-huh .
and the , the interior and the , uh , down there are an eye problem with the government
and , in a way ,
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
and ,
i guess all are excellent just really ,
or there's a lot of the characters , from the fact that came back to visit a lady in the u s and was taken his home for her
and , uh , the first time we had to do .
they ,
and the latest thing , but i know how you can buy a new s e ,
how can you afford all of this ?
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and the first , uh , said that you do see that down there ?
and the aunt , yes .
yeah .
and , uh ,
he said , you see that school over there ?
and the aunt , yes ,
and ,
None
uh-huh .
so the next year the went to the street wasn't right to the refrigerator and was able to go to his home in the house
and ,
he said , well i know how poor is the country ,
yeah .
and he said , he was going to eat you ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and the same thing
yeah .
he said , no .
and the japanese , his wife and said it was one hundred percent
None
yep
yeah ,
that ,
it's a sad story
i ,
mama , absolutely
yes ,
yes ,
but , uh , i think that ,
i know .
and they have a friend who is going to say ,
and her family ,
yeah .
and when that went down the afternoon they had to get out .
uh-huh .
and seventeen children ,
um .
winter through into , into america through that , through mexico , through the morning ,
and , uh , two years here , one year , there , you know , this kind of thing ,
yeah .
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and whatnot ,
yes .
and cousins now in that , in the neighborhood .
and yeah ,
yes .
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
they're very rich in oil and the gas .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
and ,
uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that .
and the rest of it , i think , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that
yes ,
i ,
yeah .
it's sort of like it ,
they don't have the ability to hear it .
the technology .
right .
yeah .
i ,
and , uh , you know , they're going to be tested for , because of the things ,
i ,
i think that when they receive help from us , they want it ,
yeah .
you're you're exactly right .
it's kind of a catch about golden .
uh-huh .
it ,
because they offer these , don't want to do it .
yeah ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
they need it ,
and they need to live up to the laundry and activities ,
but , uh ,
and whatnot ,
i ,
and that , i think that , you know ,
somewhat a little student ,
and , uh , some of those things that ,
uh-huh .
they , uh , that they say we're into that our system that that's the way to bring us to our office , more on their level .
you know ,
and , uh ,
i know ,
and i don't think people probably want the best things ,
uh-huh .
well the ,
uh-huh .
the solution talks at one time and i think it has real strong on the drug situation is that the g- , the u s s government spend less money by buying the ground and it are trying in to , to dig up to the military and do to all other things .
i think it would be cheaper to buy it and buy it ,
and ,
in the long run .
and it would save the u s in the long time in terms of how much they were trying to do ,
and in the same run too many ,
true .
yeah .
no ,
no .
you know .
and ,
right .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
sea beef ,
yeah ,
yeah .
they're certainly legal ,
yeah .
and have a couple of women around a plant , whatever it seems like .
no ,
not that i know of
uh-huh .
at any rate ,
yeah .
yeah ,
yeah .
and whatnot ,
and maybe you just , i have that the cost of them , uh , have to have a little bit in once to a while , to find in some sense of michigan and i do it
i ,
i agree .
uh-huh .
yes ,
it has .
i appreciate it ,
and , and tell your wife i think we get my kids , again .
this is fun ,
very good
it's kind of nice to , to see old friends now , you know .
all right ,
thank you .
bye now .
bye .
uh-huh .
yes
and , uh ,
i'd have to put myself much in the middle of the middle , i guess .
you don't mind that at the , uh , shopping
, i would certainly call for a lot of control on the streets .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
or
the button up and said , you know we can spend a new car that wasn't out ,
but , uh ,
right .
uh-huh .
there still , there , sports technology will make it turns out if they were ,
uh-huh .
i guess you could put a dollar figure on it if you really want to make that kind of an effort and , like it that .
yeah .
you got to go against those movies to the other movies that are just some advantages to it
i guess i would find her too full in comparison like that i think the sport of it out ,
rather could handle it give up to him too much ,
not the most important city
yes
uh-huh .
right .
uh-huh .
it's just not it's like golf or whatever .
i think there are other things that you could go do .
uh-huh .
i think that anybody could shut your dog and the other direction just for the sake of the safety of kids that have to try to be ,
yeah .
i don't even keep the gun in our house ,
right .
i don't i have that problem ,
but , uh ,
it's a hard , hard topic , i guess .
a lot of people have a hard issue , a lot of hard things about it .
they do ,
boy that she'd get them on a lot either
just like you say ,
uh-huh .
because if you get a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
not as ,
w- !
i'm sorry beyond me excuse that ,
uh ,
uh-huh .
i was going the wrong direction .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
the father kept the expense in a separate place ,
the little boy was five years old and was so far for ,
uh-huh .
they were just playing cowboys and everything
he takes her younger the little one right between the eyes .
boy .
so , uh
i mean it ,
right .
it took us four weeks in that just in the morning ,
and ,
having worked at one time in baltimore ,
or if
i don't know if you're in the big city ,
dallas .
are you ,
dallas ?
uh-huh .
that's a big city
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i , uh ,
uh , i mean ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
right .
uh-huh .
uh ,
yeah .
if he's got a bachelor's or whatever that can throw it at you ,
right .
i mean you know they'd they need
he said that was better not to have to ,
especially myself , now i'm a lot ,
and , uh ,
that's when i'm hooked and my son both calls at least , i'm home by myself ,
but , uh ,
i still won't have a gun in the house because he said it's really playing to the future if you do
uh ,
yeah .
about the only states that becomes or any of value of taxes you know , it's going to be the right person that was coming back .
once you're surprised , it's too late .
that's right .
and here's the milk oriented ,
that's right .
ye- ,
you know the biggest of those very few people actually needed in a lot of crime that you knew the guy was coming ,
right .
had time to do anything about it .
that's right .
and ,
as i don't use that case as it's saying it's worth one .
uh-huh .
it's hard to know the original population ,
uh-huh .
right .
uh-huh .
not just a moment it were as we did going to be in the nation ,
then you have a right to have that way ,
but , uh ,
that's right .
i know
you know there's all sorts of arguments there and i don't even want to worry about what the wife would be ,
no .
they didn't have this problem back then
no ,
that's true .
uh-huh .
that's unbelievable which right ,
that's right .
they're man given sports
basically i can be taken away by a man ,
so as i ,
right .
uh-huh .
they can go live in another country if they want .
well yeah ,
that's how i feel , too .
i know , well ,
yeah .
and of course , those people are very young .
you know on how
uh-huh .
there's say there should be no morals ,
that it's not ,
uh-huh .
right .
uh ,
uh-huh .
or do i mean ,
i don't know too many people that use a gun machine to go to hunting either
right .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
why will she can't check to see the fact that is when i always bought them on this week or not had a record .
that , to me , would not be an invasion of thing .
right .
if they do we ,
yeah .
right .
and , so it's not going to be that they're buying them .
course , some of them do .
yeah .
yeah .
tends to , tend to only the best people .
most advice does
right ,
and ,
and there's all ,
that's right .
well ,
yeah .
i got a couple of calls waiting on me ,
so i'd better let you go .
okay ,
thanks for awhile at all .
okay , bye .
bye-bye now .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and , uh , one is the ,
and one is twenty-five .
uh-huh .
and they still have to be home in the home .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
actually the , they're both going on their own kind of the time .
uh-huh .
uh-huh
uh-huh .
and , uh , we have a three year old and a half one year old .
and , uh ,
sure it does .
and , uh , the most of the time with our daughter is , we had to get him ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
and ,
i ,
uh-huh .
and trying to swim with that and everything and , uh , playing them and ,
he really likes that .
yeah .
and , uh , the one year old just kind of put off and stuff ,
trying to do everything he does .
yeah ,
is the one year old a lot ?
no ,
it's a girl .
a girl ?
yeah .
yea- ,
uh-huh .
None
and the , the younger and one is a boy ,
None
yeah .
uh-huh .
i don't know what kind of a city club is just ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , i think the big city , uh ,
activities for , for children now are ,
they're good
uh-huh .
that you really have to watch your children so many now
that ,
uh-huh .
you can't leave them up the way , the way i grew up , you know .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
and they just get my life .
so , you know , i never had to worry about , you know , making the same ones that are just ,
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
and the way , i like ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i know , i think that ,
and ,
even just when i grew up and everything .
and , and the way it is now a lot of people is , a lot of is at least , and everything .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
just start not even ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
there's a lot of pressure on , on , on , on education and what these children are before they know tomorrow .
right .
and ,
yeah .
and ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
i ,
uh-huh .
the , uh , the fact there , there seem to be a lot more in the army .
it's a lot more complicated .
a lot more available , of course .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
so much more to learn now that it makes it really more difficult , i would think .
and , i would probably have a hard time getting through that college .
uh-huh .
and they know , you know ,
or at least it would be a lot harder than it was when i went to school .
uh-huh .
one thing is i got a home computer or something
and , uh ,
i play some computer games and stuff like that .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right .
the , um , things like that .
yeah .
and , uh ,
and , uh , i think that it's important because i think that , uh , you know , it gives him the idea with the computer
and that looks like it looks like to be able to , you know , the big thing for a long time .
huh ,
and given ,
yeah ,
and , uh ,
given that knowledge and stuff with it
yeah .
oh .
and , uh , of course , the old one year old , hasn't gotten there yet
and , uh ,
and the other thing to do is , uh , since the kurds has been here , because the , uh , sign him up for , and , for , uh , different activities like the , at least fifteen or something like the office or something like that ,
right .
yeah .
and you know ,
or ,
there's a little bitty book that we just don't have to do for a year or so .
and , uh ,
where they go for an hour or so .
yeah .
and , uh ,
and , uh , when he was a baby that we did the same
yeah ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
and that , uh , watching the two little girl , too much fixed is that ,
i can't imagine th- , them having to do as much as the kids ,
had watching them
i know .
uh-huh .
and ,
right ,
yeah
see what happens
the , the average really play what it was ,
i ,
yeah .
and , uh ,
yeah ,
when ours was a ,
he ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , and that was , that was more fun to watch those people who wanted to , trying to walk the ball down and then .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
i ,
uh-huh .
None
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
the , the average of the kids too much , uh , too much .
uh-huh .
excuse me .
uh-huh .
but , you know ,
the , sometimes
you have to be under control so much when they're out
uh-huh .
right ,
right .
uh-huh .
right .
as what i would liked to have seen .
uh-huh .
so , uh , i think of , there's not really like a lot of people like to go on , at home .
uh-huh .
and , uh , you know , it has to , uh , encourage to , to encourage us to be not , you know , not to look out as much education .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right .
and , you know , to , to see how they can get with our budget .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , it seems like ,
uh-huh .
you always have the lack of privacy
yeah .
and ,
right .
kids need .
and , uh ,
and , uh ,
that's just a problem that who knows how much i might , to come out to be able to work .
i ,
yeah .
i , uh , i think , i don't know ,
and whatnot ,
with the civil rights program .
not that the civil rights program is pretty good
but ,
it carried over ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , you know , the only time we have ,
and ,
and , uh ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
which is even worse than it just not be getting right
exactly .
and , uh ,
and , uh ,
it's a buffalo bedroom for t i
so , uh ,
which i had done ,
and whatnot ,
it's not in the switch , because it does the same thing with the new orleans .
oh .
uh-huh .
although it's been back from the vietnam it's still been so much for the money .
did you do the , or , it was just an article that that's probably the part that i've seen .
uh-huh .
so , uh , i had done what i could , by not a new stadium at least that i did have a lot of the car , and , uh , pretty much decided that that had to be the problem .
i talked to one about it ,
and , uh , his first time we had ,
uh-huh .
i really don't know what the problem is that .
uh-huh .
it , the rest of the police pump around the same room , uh , that turns on the population or , on which is the doctor , uh , it might be thrown into the case ,
i ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
do you have a separate card for your high grades as opposed to your low impact ?
i don't know ,
i should look at that .
good-bye .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
i don't even know if my current cars have a separate bit .
uh-huh .
i know sometimes when you think there are things running while they're at the same case , like the people tend to think , well , there's one burden the whole lot ,
i'm the best to a physical unit that we need to have a low deficit a jury , uh , the use of the , a of a complete larger field .
yeah ,
that's a good idea .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
companies are pretty good about keeping them on weekends like that when they're not needed to all ,
and i hope that the case that's the same thing .
oh yeah ,
right ,
who ,
exactly it's out of the somewhere .
uh-huh .
no ,
it's not .
i also got a piece of the button for , the future that they had increased the whole part of this car ,
yeah .
it's obviously doesn't quite bit ,
so ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , i guess that for years and i used to be in years and this year ,
because i've owned this car since it was , this year
and , uh ,
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and the last time i called him back out that she had to be picked up
uh-huh .
i'll be darned .
i'm not sure that he works on much else at all ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
as it turns out that one , that runs up until i was home from the computer .
and ,
i've not had to receive any other parts , because they were saying that .
now , i've had , had pretty good luck ,
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
i drove it at mount ,
and , uh , i guess that we had a good trip ,
and ,
because i didn't take it in right away , and let a whole year go by .
and some of the , the didn't run where you , to have to put them out very carefully to get them down to , to play or something ,
and ,
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
while it was in the shop i ended up making the same one that i had thought since they were lost ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , i think that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
so ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , wasn't those in the last year ,
uh-huh .
involvement has an excellent movie that we have ,
and , uh ,
i don't know what else it all like , but the fuel corps and stuff around and things of that sort of ,
and ,
it was fast when , you first , they started the way to the , the point that we mean in their minds , on a lake car ,
and ,
and knowing that , you always had to keep your foot on the long responsibility ,
otherwise it would just be married away from you .
good grief .
uh-huh .
and the other problem would have immediately would be occasionally , she would be driving , uh , over , like to come a stop , but not yet at the stop shop and not the rain .
uh-huh .
and first of my friends it was just a matter of fact ,
so they say growing ,
and ,
uh-huh .
and ,
and the only time they had at all , uh , p c and their garbage changes and forth from canada or whatever ,
huh .
and , uh , and they had a lot of the problem we were also that was a criminal institution in the , uh , computer control
my goodness .
huh .
yeah .
and ,
yeah ,
yeah .
okay .
what do you think about it ?
and they say , they don't ,
i know they're really hard raised now because my husband , is from out of the country
and , uh ,
and not to be a civilian here .
that's pathetic ,
yeah ,
and that's the , uh , i think it's a little crazy .
uh-huh .
i worked with smoking people for about three years
and just , it was incredible to me to see the things that they had to go through when they were really in the best of the world .
yeah ,
that's true .
i mean , you know , we just come to the country because , uh , you want to .
right .
uh-huh .
you have to have a , have to have a good actor of , or whatever , any reason .
right ,
exactly .
not a good , not a good easy way to get in .
yeah ,
and ,
exactly .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
n- , she'd never been against them
and she'd just get money for it .
yeah .
huh-uh .
uh-huh .
sounds like a lot of fun .
yeah ,
it's amazing to me how , how many things would they allow to encourage to anybody , you know , you can come in .
exactly .
right .
i mean , i mean , with the same thing , it's going to be tough .
yeah ,
it's kind of frustrating , too , for those who are sure they are .
exactly .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i ,
right ,
exactly .
uh-huh .
because they're really the ones who work the whole lot of taxes and the jobs that we don't want to do .
i agree .
and i just ,
i don't know ,
i have , personally i have a problem with it ,
exactly .
uh-huh .
if they're not going to be on welfare or , or , or whatever .
they're going to be a former citizen buff .
and , you know , i know , if i believe that if you go on welfare that's , when you , you know , send them back to their country .
yeah .
and ,
i ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
and that's , that's what i think .
and you know , i have to think that's fine
because , like i said , i worked with a lot of those
yeah .
and just basically what they do is they get caught when they wanted to go home for christmas .
that's right ,
that's our money .
or for any other time .
yes ,
that's true .
or , i think , you know , i think all in all of a sudden it's really .
i think the general idea is good
but ,
i , i think
i , i agree .
well good ,
and they , they have to be able to do that .
yeah .
yeah .
i ,
and other than they think they take , you know , on a case on case and everyone needed to make it a , uh , political express .
yeah ,
absolutely .
uh-huh .
because if you , if you have , it's a lot easier to get in .
exactly .
and money and stuff .
yeah ,
and i think , you know , it should be more of a thing that's based on how consumer , you know .
yeah .
and that it should be equal to all
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
i agree .
and ,
yeah
and ,
uh-huh .
i , uh , i know , i don't know if they were a lot of people that ,
would probably do a good job here .
yep .
uh-huh .
is there anything i believe in
i think that's it .
is this like a very short call ?
no ,
i'm not sure how long they're supposed to be ,
yeah .
it's good hearing your , your point of view
and i think that's neat .
i think we agree a lot on that
i did , too .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and say ,
i'm glad you're home .
you have a good evening , all right ?
you , too .
thanks ,
bye-bye .
bye .
and ,
and whatnot ,
or th- , you know , that people don't realize that they had their dog , will make a difference .
so ,
and their one little vote is not going to make that much money
and ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
i ,
and , and they do a lot of money .
and also , i think that people have a tendency to , to vote in the grocery stores and not vote in the , the more local elections .
uh-huh .
because in the local elections is the ones that have most the influence on their lives .
exactly ,
and , i think , i don't have a tendency to do that .
and i have to really make a deterrent to , to get involved in .
i live , i live in a suburb of d
and , uh , i guess , i really have to make an investment to read the local paper and see what's going to be able to hear that .
i mean , i think that , the whole way , there's not , uh , feel that way .
or don't look , even at it .
i think they just don't even ,
uh-huh .
and maybe a lot of the problem is they don't , they have enough money .
and maybe that may be true , too .
i hadn't thought of that .
yeah ,
and then more of these way come out to vote than this in this country .
uh-huh ,
right .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
and they say it , boy ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , i think that are a kid to say , uh , do some good abuse , uh , things .
they don't get a lot of vegetables .
yeah .
most of the league of women would , what they did they put out of information , so it , it would be just made available to everyone .
now , other areas that i've worked in , like in the , they would just have the ability me
and ,
that was not a lot of community women
and those were people that would mostly vote in it .
and whatnot ,
uh-huh .
and , and for , oh , that's something .
in this country , it seems like it's a very casual plant .
uh-huh .
and it's expensive ,
and it , you know , a lot of power interests ,
and maybe that , uh , more humid and , more of the issues .
uh-huh .
yeah .
exactly ,
exactly
and , it ,
and , i can't remember the rangers just , i can't believe that ,
i've , i've worked in a couple of local cars .
i just cannot believe the credit cards are just on cable .
uh-huh .
people aren't going to vote for someone they've never heard of what .
uh-huh .
but also ,
and ,
but ,
that's one thing ,
if a , the time wasn't so much ,
yeah .
and even don't allow him to do that .
no ,
they really don't .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
exactly .
and ,
i've worked in public relations a lot
and , uh , that kind of thing and make things , or make someone else
and you can remember uh , like a degree or whatever .
and that , it's still a shame that is .
it really was
and , uh ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
night ,
fine ,
thank you .
i understand we're supposed to talk about this .
yes .
i hope you know more about it than i do .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , that kind of a little bit out i think .
i haven't read his book .
i was so upset with texas that i haven't gotten into any more of his books because i thought it was just horrible .
and , uh , he wants to get a lot of running out of the world .
i ,
and ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
but ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
heck of them .
and , yeah ,
it was nice to go there ,
i ,
uh-huh .
i happen to live not too far away from ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , you know , that's been a kind of a , a simple thing
right .
uh-huh .
i ,
where do you live ?
uh-huh .
you live in my future ,
am i talking to utah right now ?
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
they ,
because i'm in dallas .
oh .
i have a sister that lives in dallas ,
i see .
that's how we got hooked up to the program that was her husband for his son used to be .
i see .
None
sits up ?
pardon me ?
is her name , except it ?
yeah .
i see .
and her , her name is , his name is , his name is ,
i see .
and , uh ,
and , you know , probably a lot of things like that .
i wasn't sure that they were that carefully , why space is , you know ,
i hadn't heard that .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and they were not to discuss in , uh , cold weather
and , uh , when he was a senior , a lot of that did not ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , like that , they have one of the various things , that they had to put them into space ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , and there is a lot of pressure , lot of pressure to get that much weight up in the air .
and ,
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
yeah .
yeah .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the , the , the the news , the , the , the , the , the water ,
i would think so , too
they would ,
the thing that he went into quite a bit of about how to , how much of it is a problem to the united states .
you never think about that do you ?
yeah .
yeah
i would think it would be harder to get up to it than what's going back down .
yeah .
uh-huh .
if you come in at the wrong category , what happens is they can pull out and go into space and if they come into it at a different area there is so much that it keeps them up .
right .
None
and whatnot ,
oh .
i'm sure you've seen more of them than i have ,
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
yeah .
they had though black schools and then you would take where they come in the , how hot because it got the son was on the street which was quite interesting .
yeah ,
and i think ,
excuse me , go ahead .
and i've , i would say , i've never had a lot of an indoor car .
and ,
uh-huh .
i've seen more , more of the exact rights that , they want there out .
uh-huh .
and , uh , these are the best stuff that they went in and in the , you know , old .
yeah .
the very first ones ,
the little bell type things .
yeah .
yeah ,
they really were ,
yeah .
looked pretty slow , huh .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
and , uh , the whole thing is going to be
and , yeah ,
is that right ?
you put it around you pretty much ,
it was so small .
huh .
and see he , there was some medical benefits that we have to live ,
yeah .
yeah .
i guess that's just to sell us on it .
one buddy ,
i know one thing they've , they've mentioned that i didn't get to the book , by the way ,
uh-huh .
and ,
uh , uh ,
it's fairly slow .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and that's true .
i ,
yeah .
that's right
and ,
and maybe a lot of those things that they were doing that they didn't tell us that was .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yes .
and , uh , with the bible who got , i didn't know if we should have to support it at the current level .
so ,
yeah .
from , from the age when you would solve the kids to the moon .
they ,
and , uh , i guess we were doing it .
uh-huh .
i don't know if you have a male or not there .
no ,
i don't .
i don't either .
yeah .
yeah .
okay .
and they go ,
what are we supposed to discuss again ?
aids research is something that ,
more money ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
and , uh , i guess a lot of parents who is , uh , with aids stuff ,
uh-huh .
and one of the ones that we have worked with , w- , who was not in new jersey for , uh , aids , uh , in california .
uh-huh .
and these were from other people , from other countries .
he's a nurse .
uh-huh .
and ,
he says , one of the things that really does is the biggest government is not telling you how much about it and this happens and this is .
and they're letting ,
huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
i don't know that spending more everybody is not .
yeah .
i'm , i'm glad to be , uh , though , uh , i- , it is very well , it's neat .
i have no perspective on how it would get to other things ,
and , uh , i think that ,
you mean more money for that means less than for murder or ,
yes .
y- , yeah .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and some people that could be done when you could use more in the time and consider shorts and , uh ,
but , uh , i think that ,
then t- , part of it's trouble with some of the country .
i don't know whether , whether , you know , where our parents would be most significant problems .
well it ,
uh-huh .
because i know every time that they say , comes into something the same time to put that one money
and you know , whether it's still going to be the other group or not a good stress .
uh-huh .
money from , for money , taking care of the bus away from taking care of the kids ,
or do they both get served ?
and there's a good point in the house .
uh-huh .
one is how the electric ,
and the other thing , for the , uh , for instance , the cowboys .
uh-huh .
and not that they're ,
i , i ,
again this ,
i'm telling you ,
basically i don't have any opinion .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and whatnot ,
and ,
yeah ,
and , uh ,
that's , that's the part that ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
it's for kong and onions ,
yeah ,
actually , it's ,
and , uh ,
did they know that all along ?
uh , and i heard the other day , this sounds like this , ridiculous .
and , uh ,
can't get it from us .
and , uh , and they are now in the summertime right now ,
yes .
oh
and ,
i mean , i just heard it in their minds ,
but ,
right .
what does that mean for people that you work with and pour with kids and then
and how is it really fixed ,
yeah .
et cetera .
which is , i think , what they don't know .
i mean that's ,
well , i think they , they were concerned about all we've gotten to say , you know .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
but ,
no .
in africa was the men and women and , and had nothing to do with that ,
and ,
so , i , i know ,
and ,
that's what's his point .
this was an italian ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
and ,
oh .
i mean i don't know .
all i'm saying is i think it's going to know than we .
and , uh , maybe they are so much ,
i think maybe more information should be given out about it .
yeah ,
and , uh , and then the people that have it ,
it does seem that are , there are some cases that are there , that you know , they keep back .
if you , if i were dying , i'm not sure i would care .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
right .
uh-huh .
i'll take anything you know .
uh-huh .
ri- ,
you can talk on me .
exactly .
go ahead .
and why you can't , why you can't say the f d a say , you know , if these people chose to be ,
exactly .
research and well , they can ,
let them ,
yeah .
do it .
yeah .
and that's what i think they're saying too .
have you s- , any snow had your way up ?
no ,
yeah .
um , i think that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , uh , we had a lot of friends here .
the ski systems were really
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
None
and , uh , no ,
um , i think that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
well , i think a couple of weeks who lived in the house , uh ,
right .
and , uh ,
uh-huh ,
i guess there's different parts of the state of utah that , that , does have some ,
but ,
usually we have to up a hundred and fifty inches up at the lake bag
and , uh , down to the past couple of years ,
um
at this time of the year ,
yeah .
and this is the first year
uh-huh .
yeah ,
and the weather , the weather here , is always a problem in houston of country .
right .
but , uh , we have a little bit and warm weather when you have been cold weather ,
yeah .
and the , uh , this morning was right at the moment .
it didn't stay there ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
um , i think that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
but , this year wasn't it at all .
i guess that's because we had so much rain .
i know my son was telling me about the rain down there .
he said it was just ,
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
and they , uh ,
yeah .
and that , uh , some of , uh , concern of , uh ,
uh-huh .
but , uh ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , their minds was completely on the water under the lake .
yeah .
yeah my son in plano , he was pretty close to ,
right .
yeah .
and , uh , when i've gone down to him i've gone on that ,
and , uh , that was one up full and , up to some of the , the streets , i guess .
it just seems ,
yeah ,
we had a lot of reminds turkey in the area .
yeah .
uh-huh .
not more than ten
i ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
there's an old interests about texas , it's about ,
it's always too cold , too , warm was just too many ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
they ,
i'm going down to be one high school
and , uh , i guess , i think the weather is ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
no ,
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yes .
uh-huh .
yes .
the way the teachers are you take out right into the window , the interior and they're doing everything on the ,
and , uh , *[[ likes them and then a real small town and come around and put it back .
yeah ,
we're kind of used to that here in utah ,
course , there are real lucky ,
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
it's in the little valley ,
i , uh , i think that , the other thing ,
we really need the button .
well ,
oh ,
there's supposed to be a dog ,
and , uh , little bit of the lake , uh , northern america and then ,
and ,
None
uh-huh .
well why we don't have to be able to , to do it .
yeah ,
and that's , that's the only one that i ,
changing it planning is big meals just , i'll be in high school or just ,
uh-huh .
some of it went to the south and some of the north of into his neck ,
so that just left us ,
huh .
we got a high thing which they live in the real nice
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
huh .
i ,
and , uh , we had a good experience with our , uh , a year ago .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh
i mean , you know , i think people have to think that the government is not going to do .
uh-huh .
and that people aren't going to leave .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh ,
yeah .
maybe , maybe that's what is going .
right
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
perhaps things that we didn't think of that and actually on the bottom of the school or really would be changed in the tax or something that are passed up , you know , like your heart and that we were just not able to the personal lives of the united states .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
or my wife and , a lot of it was , that last funny when it was a question of the last part of the family , how many things can , uh , actually put a personal student on that , uh , how much , uh , should be it , uh , uh , help to see the private school of these people .
yeah .
you know .
yeah ,
that makes sense .
um .
because you start putting in the private , you start , they were able to buy the house ,
that's right .
and ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and whatnot ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so ,
that's it .
uh-huh .
and , uh , you know , when it's making it , too , it becomes a lot of ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so ,
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
um
but ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it seems that one of the first thing is done to be able to pick up any kind of thing they can get on them and all over the streets .
and ,
uh-huh .
it's a very low way of living .
uh-huh .
and they say ,
yeah .
uh-huh
just in a very wooded way .
right .
i vote
and , uh , i know , i can do something of the little local area ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and , uh ,
i am kind of the same way .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
right .
yeah ,
they ,
and they say , they don't have a lot of things that they have to do that .
uh-huh .
i'm not , i'm not in there ,
and not really for one of those , you know , that's neat at all of them and say , although i , i know the people that do that
uh-huh .
right .
right .
and they really do get inside information and , of course , of the better course , you know the person that you might be willing to be kind of that kind of the thing , you can trust their own , their actions and their actions .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
and just kind of like , and be kind of responsibility and then , uh , i don't like to make a whole lot of , uh , m- , myself unless things are absolutely out of budgeting that , uh ,
okay .
all right .
that's a real different topic .
i'm not sure i'm familiar with , what they mean with the invasion of privacy .
i know .
i guess that , i guess you just consider things that every day that would , you would think of about .
see , i'm a college student ,
yeah .
so i can think of lots of things that my roommate does that bother me that you know , that i like is an invasion of my privacy , stuff like that .
yeah .
or it was , *[[ should be a tough thing in a family .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
you're like , no , you don't , no .
it's like , how do you know my name ,
where did you get my phone number ,
and why do you think it's a good deal for me ?
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
they call late ,
now , i mean , now they , they have that i went to start talking with him on monday or something ,
uh-huh .
see , that's the ,
i would be so mad
i ,
and ,
really .
uh-huh .
huh .
uh-huh .
how ?
don't answer your phone , then .
the longest to , to start talking to you on the , on the word they're grown .
really ?
uh-huh .
huh .
i don't know ,
i think like things that , that
i think like privacy is like , just like , not going through my stuff , like going through , just like my clothes or my wife , just through my stuff ,
and ,
that drives me up a little girl .
are you and your roommate a similar size .
no ,
see , we're not ,
and , uh ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
she'll take all my stuff and , and stuff
uh-huh .
because she can't like wear my cats and not take my foot all my time and stuff .
ooh .
yeah .
and ,
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and she'll be able to keep my children ,
and ,
i really don't .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so ,
stuff like that really
like that's an invasion of my privacy , i feel like .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is ,
i agree .
stuff like that ,
when you have your door closed , people just walking in and stuff like that .
uh-huh .
i was thinking like my mom .
i know this ,
and ,
yeah .
yeah .
and she'll get it out or whatever .
uh-huh .
i was trying to think ,
i was thinking that's the only thing i could really think of that would be really .
my mom doesn't even like for us to go through her point .
really .
uh-huh .
all her kids are grown ,
uh-huh .
and ,
yeah ,
get out of my lips .
like , what are you doing ?
don't you have your own house to hang up in ?
that's great .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
and at the work place , i suppose ,
uh-huh .
i can say definitely ,
privacy at the work place .
uh-huh .
see .
yeah .
i hate it for people to open up my wife to my desk because that was , that was where i kept all my stuff ,
and ,
you could tell ,
you know you put your stuff where it's ,
.
yeah .
that would drive , that would ,
it would drive , it drove me for a while .
really .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and whatnot ,
and there would be people sitting at my desk , working ,
and , uh ,
it's my husband ,
uh-huh .
why are they working at my desk ,
and can i have it back .
yeah .
can i have it back soon , maybe .
then you start missing stuff ,
i , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
no penalty is going to take the printer ,
i'm sorry ,
i have
that's okay .
see that would , that would make me really upset ,
because you can always tell when you become honest and stuff ,
just because ,
.
and whatnot ,
and ,
and , uh , you know how the day it was before .
uh-huh .
that would bother me , definitely .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
i agree ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , i guess , like you ever watch your yard and things .
uh-huh .
do you miss your papers sometimes ?
see ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
you know .
that's the only thing i can really think about an invasion of privacy , like something every day , though .
yeah ,
and actually , i know ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , i like it and it really is , a lot of privacy ,
uh-huh .
and ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
and that ,
i , uh , i've used to , this year ,
okay .
all right ,
yeah .
no ,
i don't play any .
i used to .
oh well ,
i think everybody took piano lessons
None
everybody ,
sure .
and , i started when i was in , uh , third grade ,
and , uh , i still play the piano of the paper .
do you ?
yes ,
i do .
i started ,
i think i was in the fourth grade
and ,
uh-huh .
i played the n ,
i played the clarinet ,
i played the trumpet .
wow
and they know , they are ,
and so i ,
i still sing ,
and i sing in the choir today
None
all right
i thin- , i enjoy the music ,
it gives me an out .
yeah .
it always sounds like ,
uh-huh .
true
uh-huh .
only for about three months .
three months .
yeah ,
me and my brother both took the classes
and ,
and , uh , i say , you know , he's got as far as the , uh , subscribe to , huh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
yeah .
and your mother's friends and , and said the money that we spent for those college this year is all we had the last regular truck
yep ,
they went out and bought us a piano
and for three months ,
uh-huh .
did you ever , did you ever just hang on it or anything with it at all .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
any time i got married
uh-huh .
i mean , you know , can you play anything on it , other than wood song ?
no .
no .
and whatnot ,
but , uh ,
okay .
i c- , i , i can still read when you think somebody else
because i ,
if i work real hard i can still read the music ,
yeah .
and , see , i played the piano from the third grade the way through the high school ,
yeah .
so ,
i ,
i got to the point where i wasn't really reading music , i was music ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
but ,
yeah .
i find it to be a good thing
and ,
and ,
None
do you sing at thanksgiving at your church ?
yes ,
i do .
yeah .
yes ,
i do .
that's ,
yeah .
in fact , that's about the only thing that i still do is sing in the choir .
i tried out for dallas i was , if , was in the seventh grade
yeah .
None
i never tried again .
i ,
i sing in the choir ,
i do know if they want me to not ,
but ,
yeah ,
that's pretty good .
i ,
i never really learned the music or anything .
i never learned ,
i got right to where i was able to hear all over the years were on the piano
and that's about when i quit .
i was at ,
i actually went to the university of texas at one time thinking that i would , c- , be a musician .
i wanted to be a high school band .
yeah .
but ,
no ,
this isn't for me .
enjoy it , but not for example , no ,
yeah .
and besides that i kind of learned i wasn't really that good
i gave up .
yeah .
course , my mom thought i was ,
i , uh ,
of course ,
parents always do .
and , uh , i think ,
None
they're nice that way .
yes .
and everything else , i know what we can read , uh ,
they ,
and , uh , i don't know ,
so you listen to kind of church music , some time ?
no ,
no ,
i , i listen to v f d i .
and the same thing , you know ,
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
i like the pop music .
and , uh , i think that , that , that ,
i like people like styrofoam and all , all the folks that you're not supposed to like ,
yeah .
and , uh , i think ,
the professors work as i call it .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
i ,
my boss teaches to that .
we listen to point nine percent
and ,
okay ,
now what d- , kind of music do you listen to ?
well , you know , like to be one point , you know ,
what d- , what is that ?
yeah .
i don't know how to explain it ,
uh-huh .
rock .
yeah .
hard rock ?
and , well not ,
not hard rock .
just kind of ,
not like the mavericks .
huh ?
is that the bulls ?
yeah .
okay ,
i know , i know what the media is .
it's not too hard ,
it's ,
that's not too hard .
you know .
yeah .
true ,
true .
which some of the songs on k v i can am .
and whatnot ,
i mean
and , uh , i think ,
got the trim for , too ?
and , uh ,
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that ,
you can't drive a car without surgery on it
and you know they're going to call you up .
okay .
yeah
yeah .
i , i'm sure that the switchboard will probably give them off sign that hot together was worth it .
okay .
i appreciate it .
okay .
catch you later .
bye-bye .
bye-bye .
okay
okay
have you done this very long ?
and they say , i don't know ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
that's the same with us .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and some of the things i think we're going to buy another car for about three years .
we just oh , okay .
o- ,
uh-huh .
wait a minute ,
we bought one in ninety .
we've got three cars , of all things .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
okay .
what kind do you have now ?
and they have a , a little nine and twenty a hundred percent of a w and a little bit younger than a two c r .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
so , uh , i guess with a little bit of the bus .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the news is , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
uh-huh .
and did you find that you like the old insurance will look at the family .
and they go ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
i've been very ,
we've had three million dollars .
we've been extremely pleased with our teeth .
and ,
yeah .
we've always bought american interest in everything , also .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
let's see ,
uh-huh .
let me think .
we had a direct
and , uh ,
and they said we had a good car .
and then we had this week .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah ,
we've been real pleased with ours .
yeah .
i think we've had , one , two , three and two ,
we have a quarterback , we still have a draft professor and all like a , a person .
uh-huh .
then we have a dodge cake
oh ,
uh-huh .
None
but , uh ,
we'll , we're going to be in the market for a car , probably in the next year
uh-huh .
and the same thing is still we consider , you know , the four or four years when they give it through the big , the computer having .
uh-huh .
and ,
i always thought i would like to try a large car ,
and , the rest of the home we were making a little bit of , involved into it
None
uh-huh .
and that was one of the reasons there's been in the seventies .
oh .
uh-huh .
oh , yeah .
was phenomenal , say that , green pepper are not a good area and a top and a new stadium .
ooh , boy .
and , uh , i think we have a ,
i ,
i'll bet it was hard to part with that .
yeah ,
it really was .
my husband was in the air force
and ,
oh .
uh-huh .
w- , which really depends up with me
and ,
and , uh , it was a great place , you know ,
and then , uh , when we got to say , i mean , we bought a second car ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
and ,
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
oh .
uh-huh .
well maybe the , the only one is a really slow area to be one for .
uh-huh .
they've got a lot of the dental market
and at the same time , the majority of them , we don't want to give up the penalty that they have .
right ,
very definitely .
and ,
uh-huh .
what about you ?
uh-huh .
they aren't really that old ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
my brother's is a baby-sitter and this is only about four minutes ,
yeah .
and my dad is to drive her to the same time ,
and , uh she's so much time ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
i don't ,
i couldn't possibly ,
uh-uh .
couldn't never see him in a nursing home .
and ,
oh really .
he's ninety , i think right on another month and he's living in by himself .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
as long as you can have the families take care of the people , like to see them at least stay home .
yeah ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right .
uh-huh .
right .
uh-huh .
she was living by herself
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right ,
especially for your daughter i think .
oh yes .
yes .
now a friend of mine who was open taxes in my job when they're working in the morning for child care for christmas for , to provide with .
do they have anything like that in dallas .
in dallas ,
and they go to the end of the house , and the , the , the , the the news that i was in the school ,
uh-huh .
and they are really neat programs to be able to do if you can go up with them ,
or sometimes it's a lot to go to them get to the school or , or something like that , uh , get to be able to get them down the day for us and pick up .
right .
yeah .
right .
uh-huh .
another good friend of mine who got her degree in the grocery store , i'm used to see a while for the family where she went to around to them and had , sort of them put them in the morning to make them take care of their children to take care of their children .
oh really .
to make sure that they would take care of their minds .
uh-huh .
i don't think that was mainly with roads , and just do it , people in general , that are not as independent as they were to use .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
right .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right
and , uh , get there and western activities in the past .
right .
cause i know , there's not one too far from me from here in dallas .
right .
and they have to have their minds and stuff and put them out .
right .
but ,
that's true .
you can't play those things .
yeah ,
you can't do it .
and that's something that's good for me to do that .
or you can go outside and , and stuff about the old things .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
you can perhaps get a group of people that aren't too far with talking about the old thing and put it so forth to that way .
and they love to ,
yeah .
and ,
and they have such a lot .
do they like to listen to their other people though ?
my grandmother doesn't
she , she wants to protect , i don't like to remember your family about it
right .
uh-huh .
None
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
they ,
i lived , i lived in minneapolis for two years .
uh-huh .
and in fact they have their ability to .
and , oh yeah ,
and also i saw some of the bad ones that are following a lot of time .
uh-huh .
and some of the , some of the good that age we got to make that part of the family .
right .
uh-huh .
and our country are a very comfortable in the sense that , you know , there's no medical that's going to make you for life .
right .
uh-huh .
because i think it would follow in a hundred , on a way that you could see .
one , one thing that i noticed is very well , is very important to be able to watch .
and ,
because it's quite a bit more .
now i don't know if that we're not willing to be part of the kid ,
but , uh , when you're in the fifties , if you're not as easily as , if you're going to teach ,
and ,
huh .
yeah .
and , uh , i think that they were all these , uh ,
i remember this one row of houses
and they were , uh , later on the corner or ,
uh-huh .
all together half it was like higher than our broken name .
yeah .
it's probably solid housing there .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and there was a doctor that lived in one of these .
the one guy was a doctor
and one was a driver ,
and their , their attitude are that , at the same .
huh .
whereas here , there is a great trip to be a doctor and a great deal with the most important .
right .
and that , that didn't fit in terms of .
right .
and , uh ,
and it was , it was less a little bit
uh-huh .
like a , like a driver type of business ,
yeah .
then a , then a doctor type of job .
i- ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and that was , uh ,
and , the most of the difficulty that i have is , you know , we are in the category of course , just because of them just such a great deal to , to get , uh , into the medical field ,
uh-huh .
i mean my husband works for a company that has been worse
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i , uh , i know , i like to ,
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
and , and the hospitals are just hurting these types of products that they don't have to pay for very much .
uh-huh .
and ,
right .
i'm sure they , they can get a lot cheaper because they , they , they beat them in such a rate , um , they know they could give you twenty for a dollar fifty dollar
and that's ridiculous .
and that don't think that , is that , uh , in terms of any means to be doing things like that .
i ,
you don't think it's employed ?
i don't think it's for hospitals to be doing that at all
uh-huh .
you're not saying it's right ,
you're just saying it's common .
i- ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
and ,
but , i think they are more likely to be done .
and , uh ,
and , uh ,
and , uh ,
yeah ,
and , uh ,
there are some people that i'm sure make out of economics because they just don't keep on top of it ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , i don't know ,
and , i think the fact that has gone up i guess , i've got our roof just going . um ,
yes .
in the , in the last couple of years
and ,
i , uh ,
i'll start off here .
and they don't know what they were .
i get , probably , most of my information either from the back or c n b s .
uh-huh .
yeah .
right ,
yeah .
it ,
and , uh ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
and , i think they were good .
uh-huh .
it's , uh , the last year i have been a senior in the lower stores to the church here in ,
.
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right .
and just , usually in the local , in this area ,
uh-huh .
and , and , and , uh , c n n because you get some world , what you shouldn't have , is either the soviet union on , on the other , newspapers and , and so forth .
right .
yeah .
i know , the ,
yeah .
they ,
uh-huh .
you ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
right .
yeah .
and whatnot ,
and , uh ,
so ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
and they know that they are ,
i'm , i'm not living in this area
and , it , it won't have a little bit further down here .
you just ,
.
never see , you just never see anything about it ,
and this is a shame because you go to the other countries ,
and , and they have quite a bit about the u s on the other hand .
uh-huh .
or ,
and ,
yeah ,
definitely .
you just don't know what's going on .
yeah .
i'd , i ,
every once in awhile , i have to travel and stuff
and read a lot of the , two little radio that , uh , tried with the lawn and b m
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
you can you move into some things
and ,
uh-huh .
and that's the only way you can tell what's going on at all
.
right .
there's not much of the way in television of some of those places .
uh-huh .
i hadn't really thought about it
well if you don't think about it , if you don't hear it .
right .
exactly .
yeah .
and , uh , watch this past summer up in canada .
and there's one of it , especially in the same .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
you know , because of the problems with us
and n- , i had never been any of that before .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
what is it called ,
is it our lake accent
uh-huh .
or , or , or something , i just say , uh , i'd say about twelve years of the people now would never have been in
uh-huh .
and , and then , uh ,
it was a big thing going on there
and , uh ,
and nothing in the papers .
right ,
right .
i didn't see a thing about it .
uh-huh .
it's horrible .
and like that , i say , with the n n n and , and , uh , the cable news .
uh-huh .
it's it's , i'm in some event .
but ,
and , uh , i mean , it's not the news is not ,
and they said , i'm trying to think of the channel .
the , the national fee pot .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and they said , i guess it would be nice .
i've caught it a few times
and they say , they do a good news .
and , uh , news s and everything .
uh-huh .
so , uh ,
you'd think it would carry mostly large
but , uh , it doesn't seem to be .
so ,
and some of the older expenses , type of businesses in , in other countries .
uh-huh .
yeah .
so , uh , i guess i have a t v on the t v .
uh-huh .
and a , uh , golden retriever
yeah .
ooh , that's one of my favorite kinds of dogs .
is it really ?
how long have you had it ?
we've had him for ,
let's see , he just had his birthday last night .
fourth birthday .
yeah ,
and ,
and , uh ,
we like him .
does he writes a lot ?
he does .
that's the one thing we don't like about him .
in fact , we voted in the mornings that we just might be all of his hair .
he'd probably look pretty funny if we did that .
how much does he serve now ?
he , actually , he just went to the midwest repair of the characters and get everything ,
yeah .
and ,
oh .
yeah .
he's kind of , solid and how they do .
um , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i ,
is he good with family ?
he is .
uh-huh .
and , uh , we kind of have a mini bed for us .
we treat him like our kid right now he's so spoiled .
yeah ,
because i ,
i can understand that
get away with that a little bit more with pets with you and things like that .
uh-huh .
how about you ?
and , uh , we have a family who's about four years old .
oh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
and we figure to get the kids and then the , the dog that
that's probably a good idea .
they're good though .
and have you had a family who's a teacher ?
no ,
uh-huh .
because i , i find that they're good around other animals like cats and other dogs .
they don't tend to get real independent or ten .
they like to play .
um , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
especially with the kids .
they love to play with kids .
is , is your dog an inside and what ?
no ,
he's pretty much an inside dog .
um , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
he stays in .
yeah .
and ,
and ,
he's really a lot .
and when it comes to being alone ,
and , uh , if you give him the streets to walk around and go and wants , he likes that ,
yeah .
he'll , he'll just sit and then around and whatnot .
yeah .
no ,
yeah .
and , uh , he knows how they had a house ,
and ,
yeah .
um , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
although our next door neighbors have a dog , too ,
and , uh , she is , my favorite friends with my family .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and ,
i ,
he's pretty good .
he stays out of the street
and , uh , i think if we ever call him
and he comes back .
um , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
no we never did .
did you bring him to a native restaurant or just train them on your own
i ,
uh-huh .
and , uh , this is the first dog i've had all my own as an adult .
uh-huh .
we've had night , or we've had a kid when i was a kid ,
and this , this is the first one that i bought , uh , in ,
so ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i never really hit to him or anything .
huh .
really ?
just , you know power conscious of whatever and the university of things .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and , and those horrible pages that they put on them with , uh ,
least i ,
what they ?
they've did ,
have you heard of that ?
no ,
what is that ?
oh .
uh-huh .
and then they wear a lot with the big wine on it
oh .
yeah .
boy .
yeah
i'd be afraid to walk around if i was that dog
yeah ,
and a friend of mine at work here that he said he had it with his dog
and ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
he said it was a good suggestion .
and ,
yeah ,
um , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and ,
i don't think they're always necessary .
if you put enough interests up ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
just be consistent and with it
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
somebody just told me that because of the whole area ?
yeah ,
and that just also , uh , getting taken , i guess , or not beat up .
and the average life of an apartment is a little bit of baseball
wow .
None
quite a difference .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
oh .
yeah .
i ,
the only experience i have ,
i don't have any children
and they have , uh , i guess a little bit in high school .
and then , just recently , after we were married , i think for a while they worked for it .
and , uh ,
yeah .
that's the only thing i've ever done , also is ,
is it ?
i , uh , i think that they come with work with , you know , child care .
especially , i guess it's not harder on single mothers .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
the expense .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
which is surprising .
just sit around
and ,
but ,
that that's true .
see the lady i did it for ,
that's why she picked me is because i would go to her house so she wouldn't have to get her little girl .
uh-huh .
and , uh , then she was at home
uh-huh .
or , uh ,
and ,
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and that wasn't spread or food or something like that .
yeah .
it's hardly worth your time .
yeah .
yeah .
that's pretty bad .
the only time i was in high school
and , uh ,
of course you don't ha- ,
i didn't pay taxes on that ,
None
right .
uh-huh .
it was these people that lived in our neighborhood
and just they go over there .
every thursday night , they went to the theater .
they had a deposit
yeah .
it was supposed to be two dollars an hour for two kids ,
yeah .
yeah .
i ,
it was great .
i'd go over there
and that there would be like , you know , there's , we have these gold machines over here .
watch , i think that , that , that , that the , the , the , the , the , the the world is the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
.
whatever you want .
and ,
and there's some advantages
and , uh , just help you know ,
wow .
so ,
that was a long time ago
and that was only a few years .
just once a week .
yeah .
but , uh ,
i think people that treat their own stuff like that a lot better get a lot better .
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's true .
and they stick around for us .
because i mean after i figured out i was getting eighty cents an hour , i said , it can't .
and ,
yeah .
i was just like but i'm watching my time .
yeah .
i really liked the little girl and everything
i ,
she does take up ,
uh-huh .
that
yeah .
yeah ,
i
they're very expensive
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
they didn't make her eat anything she didn't want anything .
uh-huh .
and the mom was a baby-sitter
and ,
uh-huh .
i don't know , i want to make those stuff she doesn't want to do it
uh-huh .
like .
eat this or .
my mom would like , uh , eat it or not really slow for them .
that's right .
uh-huh .
yeah .
because some ,
yeah .
and , uh , when i was thinking of a bicycle , there would be so many people that would have to be able to stay in the individual .
uh-huh .
cause some parents don't pay off anything . where i did .
i think ,
yeah ,
i think the best way to go to be just , to be able to do it out of your hands .
uh-huh .
and just have to say , at the most , like ten minutes .
no .
and all from maybe people that you know type of thing .
instead of trying to actually set up a lot where you don't know the people coming in and
that's true .
i , i'd love to do it .
but ,
there's too many times .
yeah .
i just , i think it's a bigger place for t v
more than what it's worth ?
yeah .
yeah .
it would encourage me .
with ,
i don't know ,
cause i'm sure some of them have good reason to solve
but , uh , i think that are just , you know ,
and they get happy about it
yeah .
and they just want to do it .
and stuff ,
that's ,
yeah ,
exactly .
uh-huh .
when you have a like or something a little bit of information and then , when they get another or whatever , or i think they have one to follow without something to go
and ,
and ,
that's impossible .
you can't watch that many kids getting little things into at one time
yeah .
i have a girlfriend that works at a lot
yeah ,
and , uh , i think she would have been about the people that they want to do .
and half of them like she'd to find them over the state
and , uh , the other people that are working , you know .
and then she would like to turn in the parents and then come that their kids are out of the others that are in , you know .
uh-huh .
like they'll be in the same clothes they were the day before , the same token .
huh .
uh-huh .
and ,
i don't have kids
yeah .
and , uh , i don't know how much .
yeah .
that's i- ,
yeah ,
that's a hard thing about it .
yeah .
but ,
and i- , i think i don't want to handle somebody with my husband .
and ,
that's true .
yeah .
yeah .
i just , i couldn't do it i don't think .
it would just simply sew where , i think
i don't know .
yeah .
just not knowing .
yeah ,
just besides the fact that , you know , when your child , your child out of high school at three o'clock and then to make .
what do you usually wear to ,
and maybe a lot of it ,
uh-huh .
i work at softball
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
let's see .
when i first came here , i think fifteen years
and maybe a hundred dollars a while , uh , found out that that wasn't all the important thing .
i'm an engineer .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yes .
uh-huh .
wow .
and , uh ,
wow .
that's nice .
now , being from plano , i don't think your dress code or to be able to be , right home .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
i usually wear jeans and stuff to go to canada or not the best , you know .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and that's so ,
uh-huh .
usually nice summer or gas , then like , something like that ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
yes .
to go out to meet people and shoot people and stuff like that
None
yeah ,
i know my , uh , i just recently for a lot of the company here in the world
and ,
and ,
uh-huh .
and it , it was a big ,
and say , i said , like the most of the people at , at least we wear a year .
uh-huh .
wow .
that must be nice atmosphere then .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
oh .
and ,
so anyway i love this space
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and , uh , just kind of ,
how shall i say it ,
they know you're there
yeah .
and they don't have a lot of money ,
there's no notice at all .
or maybe when you get a truck that was , uh , it was that people who don't know whether i was a musician or a manager .
wow .
uh-huh .
None
that's interesting .
it's like a little , children's rights that are ,
yeah .
that's really interesting .
and ,
right .
uh-huh .
huh .
that's interesting .
yeah .
how shall i say it ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
that's neat ,
that's neat
and , uh , i think that ,
now , i know , i don't know ,
now the other thing we do here , of course , is a single , not quite a single pet .
and , uh , we have a lot of snow in the fifties ,
and ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
i lived in the midwest for a while .
oh .
and that i know , that they can , you know , it can be cold in the middle of the ,
and , uh , and , uh , the united states .
uh-huh .
we don't have that much .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
that's good for the clothes budget , i would imagine .
yes ,
it is .
uh-huh .
the winter hasn't been bad this winter .
yeah .
yeah .
low twenties , let's say ,
uh-huh .
None
you interested in woodworking ?
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and said , in fact , i'm in the middle of a month now for a while my son .
and , uh ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i guess he's young .
the law and whatever goes up , it will be the option of then ,
yes
he's about five and a half years old .
uh-huh .
and ,
uh-huh .
now i just have to finish it though .
and , uh ,
and , uh ,
because i've got it all cut out ,
yeah .
i've done most of the same
uh-huh .
did you do it with a little
or ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
um .
uh-huh .
and do the , uh , the news , the cut turn .
and , uh , how do you think about it ?
i mean i'm , i don't know if you're going to do it .
i don't have lots of vegetables .
oh .
our local schools , i guess have a new card and , and the other countries have deer code , oh , some of their , uh , some of their minds .
i'm an engineer .
uh-huh .
and ,
that's great .
and , uh , if you get it , i guess it gets more into something , though .
i'm , ]
what , what type of differences do you get on ?
uh-huh .
i have a v degree
and , and my projects had to do with painting ,
yeah .
socially huh .
i make such brothers .
i've done some sun beef about
and , uh ,
yes ,
yeah .
kind of jack in all of entertainment , because they don't .
yeah ,
yeah ,
actually , i get good enough to sell it or have people say oh , wow
you didn't buy it ,
you made it .
that's great !
and then i , i like the feeling is gone to the same
so ,
right .
you know ,
yes or , or something ,
yeah .
i , i'm signed up for a class in making because i've never tried that yet ,
huh .
yeah .
and ,
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
and ,
i don't know how long that's going to last time
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , uh ,
yeah .
huh . ]
yeah ,
yeah ]
and see the , stuff in my office for five hundred dollars
and i say , oh , no
and , uh ,
and , uh ,
yeah .
that's how i started making catfish .
and , i love to cook .
uh-huh .
huh . ]
uh-huh .
and ,
yeah . ]
and you get the trees you don't feel like buying .
exactly .
and ,
it took me a lot of time
yeah .
uh-huh .
but ,
cousins and then i ,
and your time ,
then you're that much ahead of me
yeah .
then i saw a , one of these country looking effects from a country .
it was a solid worker with a lot cut out of it .
right .
i've seen them
and then the hell , the red with the , the cardinals are in maybe ten years .
i ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
that's neat .
i went there ,
we have home out here .
i don't know if you've heard of it .
i went
yes .
we have one .
and , uh , two hundred dollars a couple of water pump got a new car .
i had to cut into and build up this big door and make it on the top
socially huh .
and pour them out of no book
uh-huh .
a band saw ?
yeah .
what ?
i did it through saudi carolina again .
uh-huh .
and the teacher was one of these odd things ,
oh that's great .
we can't do that ,
we just can't do that .
and ,
and , i want to do that ,
that was the plan here
right .
a requirement for it .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
and then , you used a bit of a diet or something ?
yeah .
right ,
right .
uh-huh .
i said i'm not that mild ,
it's not going to happen .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and , uh , once i was turned out , we got a ball , one kind of finish the table on , on the saw ,
by getting the other one out without the hook now in your face you was just watching you to think about
right .
god so ,
god now would you cut a quarter in this stadium ?
and they said , it's like an inch of the same .
people you know i've seen ,
uh-huh .
and then , uh , what kind of seen this is kind of the fact that you have , the , uh ,
and , uh ,
if you're looking at probation you have ,
yeah ,
i think grand canyon was one .
uh-huh .
yeah .
and that is the effects of acid rain .
right .
illegal , coming basically from canada and sisters in ohio and france and the ,
and stuff , that's true .
uh-huh .
mainly because we don't have anybody to th- , to either side of them .
and , uh , which helps a lot of that goes as far as .
and ,
yeah .
and ,
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
and that was quite a difference as far as opposed up .
i mean you couldn't really see that much
and see what , what do you think about the , the news , the , the world ,
nothing ,
every once in a while we have the golden retriever , the weather that they were
yeah .
yeah ,
we don't have a big problem with it .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right .
and ,
and , uh , i know that there's been the same ones in there .
so , uh ,
i remember when i was in florida ,
the only problem was that it seemed like it may ,
it wasn't really pollution , just the whole door .
oh absolutely ,
yeah ,
just gorgeous .
uh-huh .
i think ,
yeah ,
i think you're right .
our most thoughts are down here is just the water .
yeah
it ,
uh-huh .
and just you got a lot of , you know , a lot of pollution with those
and , uh ,
and ,
and , you know , i was in the sixties ,
and i believe some of these things that are gone at least together , with the father .
absolutely .
and just , the first thing it was like , twenty-five dollars and all that they want to do it and then there's the air conditioning for the air .
i mean , yeah ,
i think that's definitely it
because i think in the morning or it's been a way , it's , you know , from los angeles to san antonio because it's all the time .
right .
and ,
uh-huh .
but ,
that's , that's very true .
and they know , you know , of course when you're , you're having , you've got any problems and everything , that can give you a real hard stuff in the back .
but , uh , i guess , you know , you've got the kids ,
you've got that ,
and you got the children .
i think the cars are where , at least where it's right as far as weather , you pollution .
yeah .
uh-huh .
i , i think that , the other day ,
uh-huh .
right .
and , uh , you know , we have been and the greatest rules .
yeah .
you can smell in the air force ,
it keeps the details better i guess .
i guess so .
uh ,
and they , they have to be happy with the kids ,
yeah .
but , uh , i think it's a very expensive house .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right .
and ,
so , uh , i don't know , i haven't been any major program here that i've been , you know ,
uh-huh .
my grandparents live in texas , well ,
and , uh ,
and that , that's some pretty good stuff they put up in the air force .
and , uh , i don't know how to do that ,
and there's a difference in what you can think and what you , uh , you know , what's the same thing .
uh-huh .
uh-huh ,
yeah ,
None
oh .
when you think about it , that's really not a very long time , of course .
yeah ,
None
yeah ,
yeah ,
a lot of them would have to get out in a couple of years .
that's right , yeah ,
that's ri- ,
wow .
that's a pretty short floor on any .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
of course they play their , cards and do some good things here , they do all these good things .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
a lot of them don't , unfortunately .
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
what do you think of the , l a nurse ,
used to the playoffs ?
yeah ,
they're always opposed , as a bunch of people like
so .
yeah ,
that just may be , not ,
ye- ,
i don't know .
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
yeah .
apparently he's kind of a big movies ,
i don't really know for sure .
they've had some excellent teams , though , that ,
yes ,
they have .
None
they talked about running , in that ,
okay .
okay .
i'm not exactly sure
None
it was , basically your name of them , whether you thought on the schools that are always changed that , uh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
right .
i don't know ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
yeah ,
how do you feel about it ?
i believe in it , too
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i'm twenty-six
we're not supposed to ,
i feel that it ,
like you ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's the cases like , sometimes you , you feel of people that they say they went to jail to have ,
they really didn't do it .
you got that point well , what a judge is made and put you know , someone to really didn't do that .
right ,
exactly .
there's always that chance ,
i don't know ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you know what i'm saying ?
so .
right .
if the evidence wasn't right , he ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that .
i think that should be considered saying by the jury , because , i don't know , i think a lot of jury would be less likely to just a man to get a bill to just , uh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i don't know a judge might be a little more about it .
exactly .
i'm not sure about whether , i mean , we have not that .
for some reason i was thinking that we do ,
it's not very often .
yeah ,
i don't think we ,
None
i don't ,
do you know if they've lived there ?
no ,
huh-uh .
no
we don't .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
i know florida has it .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah
they're always in florida .
florida and louisiana , i think , and some of the ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
other southern states .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
yeah .
so .
get that category checks up
then people , tend to stay in that ,
they start the alternator .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
it's funny that ,
i said i think last year was the first time in like eighteen years for pennsylvania .
i'm not even sure of that ,
for some reason i think that , it was something like that .
it surprised ,
even florida , i know they have it ,
None
in florida seems like , two or three times a year .
it's constantly on the ,
yeah ,
you think that ,
if you think of how many cases are convicted are ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
compared to that and how to many people are being able to , that doesn't seem like very many .
no ,
that's true .
course they have a career that every single appeal doesn't be able to .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
of course , the israelis ,
everyone would appeal .
take them through the whole week .
that's true , too .
even if the case is open and keeping them ,
yeah .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they almost always get thrown back right out there ,
they have to have every single health trip open to them .
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
some of these guys are really , very successful of the children and stuff like that ,
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh , i , i , i , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , because i don't know if they have a lot of people that are going to be able to do that .
they get out .
everyone knows they're going to get out .
yeah ,
they get out in three years on the mail ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
they do it again ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's like a minute on the topic for them .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i don't ,
i think that it should be ,
if it's beyond a doubt that someone was a murder , i mean , then that , that will be their life doesn't do it .
None
i think so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
a lot of the other crimes very important i don't think that that's really important .
although , march of plastic and the people made care of ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
these guys are certainly not going to , to be ,
they can't ,
they're getting into drugs and stuff in that and all prison in the country .
i don't think the justice system is still that much more
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
i think that's only its purpose is , to , to discuss the violence in the prisons and people themselves a little bit better if they think they're going to get off earlier .
some of these guys just don't care ,
so .
so .
i think some of them would rather be in there
yeah ,
right ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
they probably have it better in jail than they would be out in the streets .
that's possible i guess .
i don't know ,
i was just going to say something ,
i forgot what it was .
i don't even remember what it was now .
where do you live in pennsylvania ?
in fact .
i live in minneapolis ,
i'm at college .
i'm at brookhaven university .
okay .
i don't think i really know that .
yeah
because , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
that all depends , too , on where you are at .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
yeah ,
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
i'm in kind of ,
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
we only have seven thousand students in the entire house .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
that would be pushing it .
this is definitely a college town .
we're about two hours north of that way if you could use it out .
two hours where ?
north of pittsburgh , i think .
okay .
near ?
i've never heard of them
so .
that'd colorado .
it's , an old , university of five minutes to be a student for the death penalty .
i never heard of that .
very old , little place there .
it might have a new name .
ye- , line with this .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
we're probably about an hour away from it .
okay .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that .
most of the kids here , i ,
just from utah and stuff , they'll say that they don't do in it ,
then after i would say my point of view , then they'll say , yeah ,
but ,
in that case , maybe ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
i think people can be one way or another one .
yes .
anyone that is so against it that you couldn't make them in any more .
right .
that's true .
yeah ,
it ,
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
you just
i don't want that person sharing the best with me ,
alright ,
yeah
that is just terrible .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we had a case like that here
None
uh , i , i , i , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , because i don't know if they have a lot of people that are going to be able to do that .
there's less that teachers are , turning themselves in , or , whatever , because they know that the judge , if they find them that they ought to be the opportunity to sentence them , for the death penalty .
yeah ,
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
so .
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you can go toward what you're guilty ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
but not how they're going to sentence you ,
that's something ,
whether they volunteer to be , whether they are so many of fact , they ,
right ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i don't think that they deserve anything much
yeah ,
right .
it's just ,
i don't know ,
i just
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i was just saying that way ,
uh-huh .
None
uh-huh ,
that costs money , you know .
perhaps we can
perhaps we can't
the guy might get off .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
so .
there's always a few of those people that lost their own house and all that .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
yeah ,
we just had a terrible case in where some girl are younger
the guy , like i said , he just said , that he took her ,
None
None
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
what do you read ?
i read everything , i guess ,
wh- ,

i like , children's books , i think , newspaper , how to do it ,
i am not much into magazines .

None

i will buy car magazines ,
course i am an engineer
i read the engineering magazines ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
and the money magazines .
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
what about like those books that they try to put out , about aids ?
th- , i think , i think , i think , i think , the , the , the , the , the world ,
uh-huh .
stuff like that .
you mean the bulls are things ?
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i have read some of that .
i did not ,
some of that
is very interesting , without talking to that .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i do not really know that they have the same problems in those books .
yes .
they , make speaking in that may be not may be able to ,
oh .
they are very interesting .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that , they have ,
what they have seen .
i like far out facts or whatever .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i like to read stuff like that .
i am a former buff .
i cannot take a day i just ,
you are what kind of lax ?
yea- ,
okay .
i like it if it is fun .
i do not get too into it .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
right .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i am kind of a problem
i read all those things that ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
so .
i am one of those crazy people that had the speed .
it always make my wife mad .
and , uh , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
because you read it
when she ever there is something , i say , have you read the alternator ?
another question ,
i hate reading the streets also .
you are an engineer ?
i say , we , are we are the people in the world that read the differences . um ,
are you an engineer for t i ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
i worked at t i for a little while .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we have got a book that says , how do they do that ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
it isn't everything .
really ?
yeah
and , uh , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
not everything
a lot of silly little questions .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
that , uh , i , i , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
like what makes a light ,
so .
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
those are , interesting .
you like science things ?
i have not gotten them in a long time .
what is that , one that is on t v ?
that book , national rights is really a tough thing ,
so .

that , do not ,
i have not gotten them in years ,
they were kind of expensive .
i know people just collect them like they are ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
they have wonderful and just amazing it and they have done that .
we used ,
my little sister was going and picked up to school ,
None
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
yeah ,
it is .
that is the best book to go through , those national rights .
it is .
uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
they are great .
the key just got fantastic pictures in those things .
i do like national beds and stuff like . because i said , i like reading about , i don't know , animals .

oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
the door and stuff .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
the actual , it sounded me .
that's something that scares her
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
it is just weird .
i have not ,
of course , it was all books and things like that
was it any ,
did it say anything about newspapers ?
i have forgotten what the question was exactly .
so .
so .
what do you read , i guess , in general ?
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
we can talk about anything we want .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i teaches at all those areas .
i do like ,
yeah .
to see if the ,
for me there is no ,
wh- ,
uh-huh .
like i said , i do not keep up on that all .
i have only been more interested because of things are doing so bad and everything .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
the , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
i thought if there is anything in there that would be , you know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
uh-huh .
to see if there is any prisons ,
with everything going down ?
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
it is ,
hopefully , we will predict here ,
yeah ,
i know i heard bush else that , they are out we seem to be .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
that is bush saying that
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
right
he ,
yeah ,
i know ,
i do not know why , any of the person believe ,
what some of the problems are .
there are some interesting things in the paper ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i like baltimore attraction
yeah
no .
i like getting the paper and reading the time i'd get
just ,
i do believe it up .
it ,
mainly i am a very tired person .
i do not go into the details .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
no ,
i teaches at it .
i
with the , so much ,
you sound like you have a family too .
yeah .
not more of a radio buff
it is easier to do when i do some needlepoint ,
or yard work or anything , put the radio on and listen to that .
so .
so .
i know at t i they have most of the stuff on the , they don't , the computer on where you can read the daily news ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i do ,
every time i come in , i will pick up ,
they call it t news and all that .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i do get ,
it gets a little bit of everything .
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
when i gue- ,
you can read it in one minute ,
so .
when i worked at t i , i read that more than i read the regular newspaper .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
because i would read that every day because you would find ten years here do you not have anything to do .
i know you do , being an engineer .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
there are some times when you have got ten or fifteen or not even an hour off
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
not much ,
not in the area i worked in
we had an engineer in there every ten years .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
it is , interesting , with the computer to read the computer and the news ,
all that .
i guess that is a source of reading .
i hadn't thought about that in that respect ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
it just finished me to read it .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
it does have a good , simple ,
again you can read it in a lot less than ten minutes .
it is usually ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you can believe it in it ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i do not read everything on ,
some of the stuff is pretty boring .
i served about some of that .
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it is ,
that is me with the newspaper .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
especially totally types .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i do not ,
so .
i read it so much
i watch so little t v , i did even know what the whole problem was with that ,
i cannot remember his name now .
him and his wife are getting into ,
he is or something .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
what is his name ?
uh .
that'd be .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
uh .
uh-huh .
i guess because he was so rich ,
yeah ,
oh
he had a young son .
he is well into his forties ,
i guess he got a young section of that ,
every time you take ,
you are that rich , you just get , in the news media ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
immediately .
which is tough .
that is all it was ?
he was just having an expert on his wife ?
that
his business is going down the future is the best ,
so .
he was , besides like you said , a lot of .
yeah .
he was high tech for about ten years ,
he is now , essentially , uh ,
oh .
h- ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
that has got to be hard to go from those rich to me .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
which i am sure he wants a reasonable .
no ,
right ,
who knows ,
what he has really got .
he was kind of an alcoholic who ,
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
None
she was actually somewhat of a business of her dad's , did it very well .
so .
luckily ,
yeah ,
they have been on all the news and everything in the , and papers on the , and whatnot and everything else .
that is like i said . i do not watch much t v any more .
so .
i have got three kids
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i can imagine .
it is hard to watch t v .
right ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
except for the cosby .
i know what you mean , really .
i have enjoyed talking to you .
okay .
yeah ,
hang in there .
good luck with those kids .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
have a good belt .
right .
bye-bye .
bye-bye .
basically , my husband and myself use the credit cards in the morning to be independent .
we really don't get into small homes .
if we're going to serve such one of being old it would put on a credit card ,
other than that it's not something that we use a lot of .
we may have only two or three , i know a lot of people have up a lot of half a hundred or , to a bit with credit cards ,
ours are just major credit cards that we have , and use a lot of military than we have a big purchase .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
is that like visa and aluminum .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
do you have department store credit cards ,
so .
yeah ,
one problem .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
so .
so would things like that .
they're real good with their minds and stuff like that
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
we try to avoid them with a lot of the savings because there's not set of the world .
yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
right
None
so .
my husband and i do basically the same thing ,
we end up a few in that there would give us .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
we do it mainly for , the local day ,
what is that , isn't .
that's the word , ]
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
sure ,
sure .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
sure ,
you know .
sometimes just ,
sure .
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
especially around you bet ,
exactly .
oh .
exactly
if we go out to a restaurant , just to disneyland it ,
i don't know .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
yes ,
my husband has a ,
if it's a business a lot of times that's important , uh , too much to keep it a better amount of it .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
if like a commercial look , uh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
even if we have the ,
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
sure .
sure .
for the month or whatever .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
the reputation for more than a hundred dollars for something real nice for that thirty or whatever .
exactly .
so .
we have a new one from a t and a
we haven't used that one too much
uh-huh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
be interesting ,
that's nice , because you can use it for a calling home but also .
exactly ,
sure .
it's a handicap , too ,
so .
sure ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
it's kind of fun ,
you get a lot of junk mail about them .
yeah
you always get these cartons , credit card things coming through ,
your credit is great ,
let's send you another credit card
yeah ,
it's amazing for ,
you're such a wonderful person
that's to you , to get more credit cards .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
we'll give you five thousand dollars down in the front
uh-huh .
you always constantly getting those stuff ,
so .
right .
do you have , an annual fee on yours
do you get yours through a little while
so .
ours is through a bank , yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
we had it a long time ago through the bank
it just a
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i can't see paying an annual fee for it .
i almost
None
yeah ,
that's exactly it
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
okay .
it sounds like i'm being wondering against this .
okay .
so .
all right ,
thanks a lot .
good talking to you .
bye now .
okay .
did you want me to go ahead ?
i'll let you go ahead and start , you know .
okay .
one thing ,
i guess both of us are very much aware of the media .
yeah .
None
ha- ,
yeah .
they went to work
they took care of the family ,
so .
i think that's changed in the last three years .
exactly .
just in the last little while . because i know my wife doesn't do that much ,
exactly .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
of that kind of stuff
my husband is wonderful .
yeah ,
that's the way my husband is too .
it doesn't bother him at all the time to do twelve years .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
yeah .
there is that ,
if you did that you were so careful of that .
so .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
men are starting ,
there are still some that aren't going
so .
yeah ,
those are very few .
None
they're not fighting that anymore .
right ,
exactly .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
None
uh-huh .
it's kind of a , neat thing to see as far as the deficit in the ,
i think that's even going to get better .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
even more so .
i think it's just going to be where men will do as much as women and do it that it won't be your job instead of your role of this environment .
it will be ,
hopefully for my daughter who i took in , you know , we'll be able to drive a truck ,
it doesn't matter if you want to be a nurse ,
it doesn't matter if you want to be , the president ,
it doesn't matter if you want to be a lawyer or a doctor ,
it doesn't matter .
it's what you want to be .
i have always noticed off to the ,
None
you don't have to be a secretary ,
you don't have to be ,
you can be whatever you want to be . whether it could be a danger or whatever
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
yeah .
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
if they want to , right .
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i also think it is important for them to be with the children .
i do too .
there's a certain part of me ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
there are some things that men are allowed to do better than you do .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i don't think it should ever be totally equal .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
you know that's not ,
we're not made like that .
think i think ,
that's right .
women do a little bit ,
i think the same trees is getting closer , because i , i've seen all of having it ,
it seems that men are now starting to get into issues for our kids ,
they get together
yeah ,
so .
are more picking up , what learning do that are .
yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
yeah .
some of the men are very , good too .
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
and not by order .
if you want to stay home and take care of the kids , that's , fine .
i will go out and take care of the , making money .
it wouldn't matter if it's a woman or a man like that .
on one income ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
it can be done ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
you make them .
yeah ,
that , uh , i , i , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , because i don't know if they have to do that , you know , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
it's ,
kind of like , what my husband and that are doing right now .
my mother's cut , even at this area where we come in a month to get involved with ,
she's an only child .
i don't know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
if you've only got one ,
all righty .
okay .
what type of home do you have in the dallas ?
we have a , four bedroom mile over the winter in texas
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we bought it back in like nineteen eighty .
uh-huh .
good
yes
it's probably typical of your neighborhood .
yes ,
yes .
it looks like all the others .
it's ,
i'm in plano just , north of where you live .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
i know that where is . yeah .
my home is typical .
it's a brick home .
a two story cat ,
it's typical of the other homes in our neighborhood too .
yes ,
None
yes .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
those are lovely .
yes .
the one thing we did do instead of having a while or walk three weeks ago ,
we're from the north
we just couldn't stand the whole book ,
we had them ,
we have a high tech number
None
oh .
nice .
None
we don't have so much space .
yes .
we could get more per se it's a big percentage that way .
uh-huh .
mine are actually the middle of the neighborhood .
are they ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i would expect so .
i have wondered about the professors and the ,
yes .
especially the water .
right ,
i know .
uh-huh .
it's over three fifty a month .
wow .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
just to just mention it ,
so .
how many bedrooms do you have in your home ?
i have , a bedroom and a master on the main floor ,
good-bye .
i have ,
i'm a writer
i work in my home
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
in the garage is a lot of i have ,
how nice .
it's not really a bedroom .
it doesn't have a closet
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's the size of a three car garage .
that's where i work .
that's a pretty good size room .
yes ,
yes .
that's neat .
we ,
this is our dream home ,
we just absolutely ,
love it .
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know ,
it sounds like a real nice one .
yeah ,
we're really proud of it .
i just hope we never have to move again .
this is uh ,
right .
where did you move from ?
detroit this was a long time .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we were there two years
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
do you like the dallas area ?
we love it .
None
yes ,
they're much ,
aren't they , than they are ,
much better down south dakota than they are up north carolina .

the , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
that's interesting .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
the quality of the relatives , we noticed a whole lot of money .
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they just didn't care .
if the trim work didn't up just what you get out of the kids
yeah .
oh .
that's interesting .
yes .
yeah .
they'd say just look at this ,
so .
they seemed so proud of everything they did .
that's good .
it really made a difference to us .
i know as i said our house is about four years old
we've been very pleased with it .
we've had no major problems with it .
turns on wood
yes .
it is with the , two children growing up and three o'clock and everything called it ,
oh .
all the time .
we like our neighborhood .
it ,
yes .
has grown
the majority of the people , keep up the neighborhood .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's important too .
that's very important
as i said it has in effect .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we bought back when they're so forth , we don't have any ,
oh .
now i- , i- ,
uh-huh .
yes .
it seems to have dropped off and actually picked down a little bit ,
yeah ,
we're still fine .
ours is pretty much in the house there's a lot of
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that we've been there .
we're hoping it takes off again ,
yes
i don't know with the e d s and building and everything is going on in their forties , we're hoping that are in other people .
it should bring up your eyes works a little bit .
that's what we're hoping because ,
your masters .
we're just real close to where that is .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
i hope so too .
right now there's a lot on the market for sale because of people having lost their jobs ,
yes .
and everything
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
that keeps prices and down and value
i'm sure the longest , or
would like to look for it up .
yes ,
i'm sure
for that reason it can stay the same ,
that's right
so .
that's right
we love being where we are .
okay .
basically i am a mother of a year old three ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
right .
None
i've been pretty proud ,
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
like storm or whatever time , or because of us they try to are ,
when i bring my daughter into such a system like that , they only have one thing going on
that's frightening time .
everybody is into ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
on a quilt .
home day care has been an option .
i've looked into that .
the only thing is you raise the question of if it's safe , you can trust the people ,
that's right .
so .
you never know .
i have , an employer that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
definitely ,
sure .
sure .
sure .
that's really scary .
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
right .
right .
yeah .
it depends on the age of the child .
uh-huh .
right .
home day care works well if it's in the dallas .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
the kids have ,
right .
bye-bye
they're sick all the time
the- ,
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
i don't ,
do you have an opinion on that , on the u s ,
the ,
i think i'm about the whole thing . and still a little bit worried about them because of the history of the history .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
sure .
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
sure .
None
they've always invite it
sure .
that's why they put a lot of people in prison for years and , and that
that's why they put a lot of people to death .
sure ,
that happens .
yes ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
sure .
None
they are responsible at this point in time to keep their country together ,
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
yeah ,
there might be a rule within the people .
sure .
None
i guess i really have no concept of all at the u s s ,
yeah ,
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
sure
they have occurred to us over and over and over and over ,
to them that would be a shame
uh , i , i , i , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , because i don't know if they have to do that , you know , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
the public people are just aware of your kids .
yeah ,
yeah ,
i think you're right .
there's a little more down there at the moment
sure .
the wood i are not think that are much different from us .
you know i think
sure .
that it would be the equivalent that i , i guess .
uh-huh ,
sure .
i have a daughter that's called .
she's on a law that she can get up on the country .
i- , i , i don't know if i would have to do that , because i don't know if they were going to be a little bit more than that , because i don't know if they were going to be able to do that .
uh-huh .
it was really good talking to you ,
you have a good weekend .
you too .
thank you .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
thank you .
bye now .
bye-bye .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
i think it's time that we start looking at , getting into that .
health cost has to receive it
i think , there's people that to me it's the ,
life of a person .
it doesn't matter if you have money in the way or all the money ,
you would ,
you should still be
yeah .
None
the expenses right now for health care , are just unreal .
they really are even when you're talking about not around .
if you're just talking about basic care ,
yes .
we've got four children
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
sure .
None
your constantly ,
it just can your budget ,
exactly .
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
the only ,
i know a little bit about the , a traditional , health care is
there's some aunt and science .
one of the things , of course , is there , health care is ,
yeah .
how can i say it ?
over like in , where my son's friend there had been in the years that their health care is ,
no financial colors are available for him .
they may just go into a doctor just like a doctor to be a doctor for the summer ,
uh-huh .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
they say , jeez . if i get into this area of the , i don't have to do this ,
i can do this ,
i can ,
can still make big bucks
yeah ,
plastic expenses
if i become a , heart worker i'm going to make this kind of money ,
there's , financial colors to find that .
in a larger system i don't think there is a financial worker for the doctors .
do you think that the quality , it would be as high as they ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
the quality i think goes down . when you have a kid in the future .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
the only way they could do that is having a real good quality and , you couldn't say some kind of ,
None
right .
i guess that's the last big feeling to meet here is going to have ,
more harder
yeah ,
i don't know if you can have that with a system .
maybe , there's a way of working that they want ,
None
that's what they look at it .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
there's no ,
yeah .
right .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
that might be one way of one of us that are out the same for those and those that really want to help .
that's true .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
so .
and , uh , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
i think we have to pull all else .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
it's just ,
i'm wondering if i get older .
sure .
None
you no longer have insurance .
right .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you're sixty or some fifty years old you know what's going to be worse .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i mean you're missing .
that's right .
unless you want to pay five hundred , six hundred dollars a month
i know people that are paying two hundred , three hundred dollars a month for years .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
yeah .
i know working for small schools
health insurance , it , i would cost for a family
this was back three , four years ago to put my entire family up
this was working for like a senior center , health care .
it was like eighty dollars out of my paycheck .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
so .
ours is three hundred for our family
we pay that instead of a car payment .
so .
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i'm driving a piece of junk ,
we do the same .
it's , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
i think , people are changing their own ,
it's getting harder and harder to that .
right .
right .
that's why , if they don't go to a necessity , is something going to happen .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
we're going to have , a larger amount of people dying .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
what do you all do for camping ?
we don't do so much now ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
when , i was , a child , we went pretty old camping , uh-huh and everything like that .
with our children , we had a pop up tent .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we used that to go camping .
where do you go ?
years ago we lived in oklahoma
oh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we went to , lake shore all the time .
when we did it with our children , we lived in , ohio
oh .
we went up to the gulf . which was just absolutely fantastic .
i bet it was .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
around ,
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
along the ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
there's a doctor that goes down from pittsburgh to houston , and into china
i think it was called , white or two different issue .
and went up on it .
did you all sleep in sleeping bags
did it get real cold at night ,
so .
it got real cold ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
the , pot , seen in it , when we had that one ,
we had our money's .
we didn't have to go with sleeping bags .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
the when i was a teenager and growing up , that was sleeping bags and sleeping bags and jacobs on or farm ,
that got kind of rough sometimes
we only did that once .
since we've been married , we go to wait to colorado to the mountains ,
do you ?
we'll stay in france .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , call that way go off ,
we're really not .
the one time that i did go camping when i was about , i guess , fifteen or eight feet with the first ,
we drove up by arizona , colorado springs .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and went back forty-five miles back in the back where you couldn't even get a native traffic if you tried to the tent for a week .
oh .
at night it was so nice , you thought you'd feel your ,
feet again .
the smell ,
the interior were just five feet above you .
they were just right there .
just beautiful .
it was the most outstanding , most good thing .
we enjoyed it .
yes .
yeah ,
yes ,
i understand that
i got enough of it right then .
yeah .
yeah my husband and i , he says my idea of funny it was in the meantime .
i know that
i agree with him .
i agree with him , too .
our children are grown ,
that's true .
i know that we liked it when our kids were because recently we got away from the t v and the phone .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we got just driven by ourselves .
we , uh , we , we have a , uh , a , a , a , a , a , a ,
no .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's , uh , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
we could , get back in touch with each other
they can't believe that they could handle it .
i know .
once they're there they think it's kind of cool .
i know .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
they just press
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
enjoyed it .
we would share some day .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yes ,
yes .
yeah ,
couldn't believe ,
yes ,
yeah ,
with goodness .
None
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
yes ,
it would just absolutely wonderful .
yes
yeah ,
one .
one , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that ,
yes ,
yes .
one .

None
i'm thinking , how could you stand it ,
you , you know , i , i , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know ,
we didn't notice it back then ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
that was back before was mad and guess they're all .
yeah ,
yeah ,
that's true .
we didn't ,
it always rained on us .
i don't care what weekend ,
we went and when it was , it always rained on us .
i like that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
especially in the tent every afternoon it would you think you would get your name and just kind of up .
up here , uh-huh .
i thought that was fun .
i don't know ,
i remember one time , some cousins are in a tent
it was married mornings ,
they had the tent
this , construction cents where we used to call them ,
came through
they had put their lunch kind of over ,
i don't know what ,
it wasn't a creek bed ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
the water pump down

they said they looked down there and went there and made
so .
no
there went several things down here the water ,
we just used to have been .
golly
it was more fun .
yeah .
so .
my folks had a program at one time at lake
we went up there ,
it was never quite the same thing .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
so .
yeah ,
i understand that , too , because some of the places we ,
uh-huh .

it does .
so .

None
my family is , real into camping and four and four ,

i , think , maybe , four minutes in a row , we spent , our vacation in the summer time , four through , in the , of half the southern area
every time , my mother had ,
i have two other sisters
my mother had us , do some of the area , the fact that we got to visit
no
None
it was really fun .
we , each got to write your kids .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it had added on an interest ,
my youngest is a very good size .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that is what she had originally gone to school to do . was i was , i'm looking to quit my child in myself , as well , as my degree ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
right .
None
that would be quite a project .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
it would be it is our big house .
it would be a lot fun .
there is good and there is bad
yeah .
so .
n- ,
really ?
i prefer to teach .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
my daughter is , a physician player has to be she left over there
we had to fly into it
sure .
oh .
None
None
finally , we saw a day .
he put us on the beach .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we sat there ,
we did not know italian .
we looked at each other .
we said things like twenty-five years
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
things like that .
yeah .
we rented these kids with , uh , newspapers
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
when we needed to go to the bathroom there was so much a little in the ground .
wow .
it was kind of a pain .
that was our experience
i guess all of atlanta is not like that .
right .
where we were , it was certainly
the population that we stayed in ,
we stayed with our english friends , their team in the street
it was beautiful .
it was very expensive .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it was very far away on a t v .
oh .
it was interesting .
you always learn something .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
you always have a fun experience

oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
the reason i am curious , i ,
the other place i would like to visit ,
i guess you heard our topic for today was smog ?
yes ,

i am a speech student little
i do a lot of work
when i do work then i have to , i think it's very good .
look professional
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
unfortunately .
yeah ,
i understand .
i am a ,
i own my company .
i am in the , eastern forties area how many people are ,
my office is a small office
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
yeah ,
sure .
suits and sports can , grow up the only and the whole thing .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
i will tell this real significant story when i graduated from college ,
my first job ago years , thirty years ago , ago , twenty-five years ago , in fact , was selling physics .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i worked for the , michael dakota by pieces of foreign schools
i sold it .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i would go out and put on everybody
None
i was calling on guys that add up cars .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
one day i got up and i thought i can go ahead and i know that you called on a guy that are really , jewish ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
really ?
None
even the farmers .
wow .
you bet even back then
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
here again i dress quite a bit of
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
certainly .
it gives you faster .
yeah .
if i call on just , a normal little bit of mine , i might be like seafood .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
it depends .
yeah ,
it depends .
sure .
you don't ,
None
probably no .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
probably , no .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
because , it again i can get away with ,
then it depends on who you are calling on .
who you're ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
although , he shouldn't be on that .
right ,
right .
bye .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
that , uh , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that .
if you wanted to , really get into a hot issue ,
None
yes ,
it is .
unfortunately .
i am , a catholic
the people that go to my church ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
bye .
people in jeans and whatever ,
yet the way i was raised ,
i am a senior fisher ,
the way i was raised ,
i was raised a lot
yeah .
i guess that has changed also .
uh-huh
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
i go to the church of eighty-four .
i have been raised in the church and the university of
right .
i , too many times you hear you hear a lot about what you're supposed to look your best sunday and dress and ,
uh-huh .
sure .
people just don't have that
so .
they are afraid to go to church or let them look easier because they don't have the clothes to wear .
that is a very good point .
i am from west virginia
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i understand what you are saying there it's a very good point .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
uh-huh .
certainly .
yeah .
i think you have to dress sort of things .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you certainly should not admit a judge by all his own , and say , or a person by that .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
what about season to season .
does ,
i guess your dress changes .
yeah
a little bit .
yeah .
that's it .
run around here ,
no block and things
so .
okay , unbelievable .
okay .
prior to the door
what did you do about your last auto repair ,
might you say what kind of cars you have and so forth .
yeah ,
so .
a couple of wal-mart ran by a new restaurant ,
the wind weren't working out ,
it wasn't their fault ,
they didn't run it .
we both had green ,
yeah ,
so .
my goodness goodness it's ,
that was a huge repair bill .
uh-huh .
i know ,
i hated that .
it's a very expensive automobile .
it wasn't enough to total it ,
yeah ,
so .
do you buy one every two years ?
i travel a lot ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
this last one i went ,
i don't know ,
i realized it on a three month program .
first time i've ever done that .
i'll probably go back to buying them , because i don't care to have them ,
did this car have one of these were a smaller ,
just are there quick safety in it , that you had it .
no ,
it has the same wheel .
did that help you ?
it ,
they didn't go off .
they didn't go off .
no ,
i guess we weren't going ,
that sort of upset me ,
we weren't going fast enough ,
when i called the dealership about it and called her weight about it ,
no , sir ,
didn't go off ,
we were it was a bad , late , doctor , fourth ,
the street .
you were hit in the side , you weren't ?
yes .
that may be the problem .
yes .
you may need to be hit sixty-five to the purchase in addition to it .
took off my whole front and forth and everything .
my goodness .
i tell you , just took it all off .
it was
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
right .
it was a ,
yeah .
that's another twelve hundred dollars worth of time
my goodness .
i'm going to get ,
None
i would think so
this doesn't sound like you've got very good luck with that one .
my name's .
how about you , ?
i'm relatively fortunate about that .
yeah ,
None
realize that they don't have to drive that way here .
i understand .
yeah .
None
i understand .
i have a connection and a customer professor on the future ,
i have to ,
i drive a honda most of the time ,
like hand over the telephone i have to make sure that , is so much and teachers are doing it off ,
sure .
once in a while we have to replace some of the expense of the bottom of it because it's away .
i understand that because i'm from west virginia ,
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
sure .
None
winter got here
None
like hand over the telephone i haven't had a chance to drive it very much ,
are you going to buy this next car
you going through it again ?
no ,
i'm going to buy it , i ,
i don't like the latest ,
i think , i'm getting ready to retire myself ,
are you ?
None
i usually drive a car for three years ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
last couple of cars i've only been able to for two years ,
i'd forgotten this one for two years .
i'll probably go back and buy one ,
this next car will probably be my own car .
that's an extremely big one , that one that you had , that was one ,
no kidding .
None
not really ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
not really no problem at all .
my wife and daughter ,
we have , two minutes in the family , one of the ,
we have the lincoln
so .
the
not really ,
no problem there at all as far as finding elected ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
it's convenient in that regard .
yes ,
it is .
yeah ,
i travel ,
i'm like a traveling professor ,
don't travel a lot any more ,
when i do take it , it is very comfortable to drive .
yes ,
yeah ,
yes
it's ,
it only has gone on thousand miles ,
is that right ?
it's very quiet and very rainy about virginia .
my wife's toyota is to be soon a year old ,
it doesn't even have thirty thousand miles on it ,
gosh , been in such good shape , probably we'll be an old or three year old .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
do you feel that ,
i don't know .
my personal rights of government and , the way things are at this area , that comes to be really interested .
None
None
they just stand out more . especially more and more pressure with their stuff
it's really ,
None
court systems ,
None
hm ?
yeah ,
hm .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
the automatic trend , that kind of thing to just see our government and that little things to have that little bit where they have got up where people have taken on vacations on these things and stuff like that .
None
and send them into government or people don't that are rich .
it's always the rich person that gets into that government . uh , the money to solve the money , to do this .
there's no more realistic brushes out there , that can get into general , if they were taking a new car .
i know that's my personal feelings of things .
yeah .
they've already put through the health bill
yes .
it just went through
it was passed
that is going to be a fairly tax amount on the united states and a lot of the little bit more on to the medical .
None
you know what i'm saying ?
it's ,
right now your second around here is just teaching for me to see the health , which is going to be .
yeah ,
it's kind of like we're the first to do it .
None
right .
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
sure .
sure .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that is , we become so debt and this piece of them are , uh , and spend something of being sick or something , that puts a lot of pressure on software , whatever and federal n .
it sure does .
i think it is .
like you said i think society as a whole , you can't expect ,
yeah .
right .
and come into government .
down the line it does hurt .
yeah ,
so .
what is ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
exactly .
yeah .
yeah
that's exactly what happens in all these other things .
they pick the character on each other .
i hear that you're doing this ,
i've done it
boy ,
it's not going to get out .
ex- ,
yeah ,
exactly . it's ,
yeah ,
we just had ,
so .
there's no hills in the government . i don't think anymore .
right .
the mayor of dallas is , uh , god .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
he also , was a hacker .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
to congress .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
he had been in that position for years .
sure .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
he was unfortunate upon dallas .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
however , if the vote was taken today , the whole thing is because he made out of the world , that check out of somebody who have ,
sure .
so .
okay .
i just got back from taking my little girl to her brother ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we had a bag ran more of our cans for us at this time .
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they were filled with beer cans
hm
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i hated to take a big old trees , like a lawn bag full of them .
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
no ,
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they had tickets at their school that they recycle them fast ,
i think that's all .
oh .
speaking in the navy ,
they're taking the money that they can't lay to plant .
that's a good idea .
yeah ,
they've got their bins that you stay there ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
they're getting into it .
i don't know what they get for the tickets , though .
None
yeah ,
that's good .
it's not bad , though .
i know ,
we are kind of getting into recycling now .
i'm in college ,
i live in a dorm ,
we recycle paper .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i know that there's a glass plant up here ,
they recycle glass ,
uh-huh .
in each of the children you have a place for that ?
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's really good .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
when our church ,
gosh .
we get money for that .
for the israelis ,
who knows what you do with it ?
yeah ,
we just keep it with the israelis .
what do they do with it ?
None
None
we buy , like , cooking equipment and stuff .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we play games , like inside games .
we buy board games .
it's just different things , whatever ,
we vote on it ,
whatever the husbands would want , that's what we buy .
i graduated from college in nineteen eighty-four ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we were just , not aware that this was a problem , that we would need to read .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
of course , you just threw it away .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
a little different .
None
i had my school do it ,
yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
the whole school ,
it was just this big project ,
she didn't want to get into that .
i could do it in the center ,
i just never got around to it .
it's like a club ,
you know about that ?
no .
a little boy that had died of was , i think ,
he had started this , save the environment on the club .
oh .
his mother is carrying this on .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you can get the information to set up and , it was ,
you don't have to carry it as a group or anything , i don't guess .
that'd be o- ,
you could start your own anyway .
get a lot ,
is that what this is required ,
what you're ,
do you all have bible up there ?
no .
no .
huh-uh .
that's a department store .
oh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
kind of like k j stores if it has a little better than what k w is , i think .
oh .
i would like ,
let's start up a cart .
no .
i don't really know any other recycling that they do .
no .
None
no ,
huh-uh .
we have to take it to a recycling place .
so .
now in some of the rooms got me , they're already picking up the newspapers .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
you have to pull out all the recession ,
you have to remove them up with the yard .
oh .
i think that's all they're picking up .
uh-huh .
i didn't know that .
yeah ,
my brother-in-law lives in minnesota ,
they're are just nice , plastic bins ,
you fill them up and put them out with your other trash ,
they pick them up .
i never heard of that in background>> .
do you all have can choose ?
not that i know of
no ?
no .
in i get ,
a big old bin ,
you just feed your cans into the window ,
yeah ,
if you keep saving it until the light goes off .
my gosh .
you get cash .
they had one that i was putting my stuff in ,
i went to take some today ,
it was gone .
so .
i don't know .
None
yeah ,
we have places where we go
what we do is we our cans .
it's like a former belt ,
None
they lost , your aluminum cans ,
you get money for your aluminum cans .
they don't give you for the other .
no .
now they're going to start giving us money for the other ones , too .
before , they didn't .
i know they're going to start now .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they're certain places , where down there you can take your cans .
i don't know where they are .
they laugh barrow it in the same time to get into it .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i don't know .
i'm trying
so .
i just can't recycle everything .
yeah ,
yeah
i'm not that careful .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
so .
that's all i really know about recycling .
me , too .
if they would .
i know , we're saving our grocery bags now .
really ?
yeah ,
they're taking those up .
you can take them to the stores you know .
doing it .
i think .
do you have those up there ?
we have , but , not a little bit .
we , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
they're taking our milk cartons and our plastic bottles there , too .
oh .
so .
so .
that's pretty good isn't it .
you guys are getting into it more than we are .
it sounds like it ,
you'd think you would be .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
huh-uh ,
i've never seen any , places that do .
i know , we are our flower bags now .
yeah ,
you can like ,
if you have grocery bags you can take them and use them instead of getting new ones .
you mean where you can own your recycling .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
yeah ,
we don't have any place that the grocery store .
so .
i don't want to go with those types of cliff now , i think .
i'm not that european
they do that like ,
i went to europe , nineteen eighty-four .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they go all the time .
it's like they would go almost every day to the store .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they had their little bags back then , and then it turns up .
they had the three little old industries .
my .
that's why .
they couldn't put anything in it hardly .
so .
so .
what are you going to do when you get out of college ?
i'm a finance major .
that's why i did what i did .
i went into teaching
here in texas it's a real mess right now .
really .
definitely .
there's no .
let's see ,
we've had the t v ,
we've run out of money .
we've enjoyed the money .
right ?
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
right ?
yeah .
yeah .
what do you think the witnesses will be ?
i think they're maybe going to give us a state income tax .
do you have one ?
yeah
i'm not looking forward to it ,
bye .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
yeah ,
we've had one as long as i can remember
it's going to hit us .
yeah
i don't know ,
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
doesn't seem like it to work take it away from it by something .
maybe ,
i know we're not using it so far .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
we have too many noise in some of those big cities .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
other than that . you can think of anything else we need to talk about .
i can't think of anything on recycling .
me , either .
anything else ?
no .
what about people from , pennsylvania .
what do they think about bob ?
what do we think about them ?
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i don't know
have you thought about that ?
no ,
i never really thought about it
what you think about .
uh-huh .
really
i would hope so ,
you've been together a little bit longer than we have .
i don't know ,
i really don't know anyone from texas or anything ,
no .
i've never been there ,
i've never ,
let's see ,
i think i have too been to pennsylvania .
whereabouts ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
yeah ,
uh-huh
yeah .
so .
alright .
child in what are you saying , huh ?
right .
oh .
child in is what you say it is , in advance ?
yes .

but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
right
did you hit one .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
i just hit one then .
all right .
so .
the savings and loan processing .
it ,
i , got to ,
this is going to be fun .
are you educated or democrat ?
kind of interesting .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
i'm a nightmare
None
i do have some innocent chips , and ,
i am fortunate one ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know ,
yeah .
they're the ones all over the money .
None
i get a kick out of that .
the subject , go ahead .
you first .
i think it's a shame essentially that funny that you have capital punishment for our family that are .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
i don't think it's over .
None
i think it was just plain augustine ,
i think it was really when they said do anything you want to do .
go ahead differently my little bit ,
i agree with you .
i think it had something to do with ,
i believe , more of it was just ridiculous .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
i was talking to someone ,
i can't remember who it was ,
he was a small writer ,
he said that the banks were calling ,
he uses some money
the banks were calling and just looking for people to give their money to work .
they just got totally carried away with buying their own credit cards and the ,
yeah ,
there should be thousands of people in there as far as i'm concerned .
so .
not just a couple of years .
None
right .
so .
the list goes on and on .
i agree a hundred percent .
of just the crimes are .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
much less for that criminals should be .
it may have started with wolves .
i noticed that teaches in terrible and very interesting
that was property
they lost a lot of money there ,
some of these big , these rich people are to ,
uh-huh .
this was several years ago
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
not all of it ,
i don't know how much he lost ,
they were just buying property and buying all kinds of real estate and thinking that there was a lot of
it always would be ,
it always would , be more than what you paid for it
they just never even got crazy with our money at all .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
it ,
everyone from somebody to go it .
right .
yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know ,
yeah .
None
you spend your way to get
None
just keep spending until little city are ,
i thought , that's not going to work ,
i knew that it wasn't going to work .
so .
it hasn't worked now .
in fact , a healthy budget has a lot of spending money on .
right ,
no doubt ,
no doubt .
if people are making money , you know , making money ,
it'll give them ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
i agree with that ,
there's got to be some control
apparently there was ,
the problem is ,
the problem with is that the people at the end of the water ones are very lucky .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
for what they would cost
we weren't picking them .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
we , as americans weren't not anything .
it was all directions .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
i'm sorry we don't get into a real threat over it ,
we agree too many ,
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
i know ,
you can't say that was right .
no ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know ,
no doubt to assume that we can have any way our lawn care .
right .
remember all we're doing is to gain my own one .
not high quality ones at that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
so .
i do have a lot of thoughts in the american people and the economy and everything else .
None
i think that the ,
it still ,
yeah ,
it is a life and a lot further ,
right .
with the japanese .
i know ,
when i ,
of course i'm in town ,
i work with a lot of pressure
i just cannot understand why they're just happy to spend their time here rather than here ,
they think that , i'm paid anyway
it doesn't matter ,
None
right .
right .
i'm not .
yeah ,
really ?
you don't sound like a , jim ,
what ?
you don't sound like a minivan .
what does a sound like it ?
you're too educated .
they're very , not interested .
they wouldn't even talk about probably some of the things we're talking about now .
so .
i guess i'm dealing with too many texas instruments here .
i don't know really .
that's , uh , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
i'm being a , i guess i'm , i'm making my masters out ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
now maybe i'm not the , typical that you deal with that .
the worst is written .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i am , though , it's a lot .
that's good .
no
that's not good
so .
no ,
right ,
that's good that you're missing ,
your time will come .
we , uh , we , we have a , uh , a , a , a , a , a , a ,
i know a few people ,
no ,
i do not wish my time to come .
really ,
what , uh , i think , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
are you in a tech ,
do you do work or something ?
no ,
no ,
no .
and , uh , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
government doubt control is my own now .
i did p c x end out for ,
quality , okay .
about ten or twelve years ,
right now i'm just trying to solve pictures and forth .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
times are bad .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
is , really terrible .
i'm , management level time ,
when the cuts came , three of us got , back ,
we're just ,
i'm calling you from work .
i'm pushing suits , and stuff on that .
i'm one of the manager there ,
there's three of us to cover in dallas else
just we're expecting turkey and , more papers and all nights .
that's my ,
i only get one weekend off a month right now .
i call it my husband again .
it's , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
uh-huh .
there may actually be any work going on .
they turned all up here off .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
they told mexico they could not work .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i don't care what the jobs are , you will not work .
yeah ,
it , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
yeah .
uh-uh ?
the recession isn't .
i think that , not only t i , but a lot of it , when they talk about ,
there was one point i was going to make .
i think the last i heard ,
i , i have to admit i'm not as many calls ,
there's something like about eighty six years they didn't have that .
i always forget that .
uh-huh .
if that's true , it may be a hundred dollar that two months down the buffalo that went through .
it really hurts me ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
it's amazing really .
it's amazing that ,
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i know what you mean .
one of our senior ,
yeah .
here they're not really that high ,
are they pretty good up there ?
no .
really .
our economy in colorado springs doesn't go loose .
we're in the metroplex here ,
so .
right .
it , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
i die every time like general companies like one ,
they lost several time
i don't know if you noticed yesterday , you probably don't pay attention to the grocery stores ,
they were going to have big , gross ,
None
yeah ,
it's frightening .
i don't know how ,
hm .
bell didn't get it .
ye- ,
also , they do some of that in category , uh ,
i don't ,
they were following it here that was a t v , i guess .
t i was getting the , northern williams as ,
it was a double .
one that bell is in the navy
two , that t i was doing the elementary for them .
so .
they assumed that it was t i a voice of all of a sudden , it got , yeah .
they're going .
have , she ,
gee .
something ,
None
i don't know if t i has lost as much as everybody else ,
general motors and l t v and such an inch or call here ,
you realize
there you go .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
kennedy , what the economy is they ?
should the jury market , you know .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
my personal opinion ,
i don't know .
here lately it seems ,
up until a few years ago , i guess , there just too many times and too many ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's just not right .
i think i agree with that very much .
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
do you ,
yeah .
do you think a lot of people , when they are listening to a trial , put them in a job like that and say , i would never do something like that ,
it's for them to believe that somebody else could do the things that have been done ?
yes ,
very very expensive .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so many of us have been taxed that lives , when we sit in a , on the jury ,
i never have either .
i've never done it myself until ,
i wish i could have .
is there a reason why you have ,
i've just never been called up .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
my husband works as a police man ,
None
that's possible .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i was called up as an article ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i never made it to the jury .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
do they have such a thing now as a single parent ?
not that i know of .
yeah ,
i had never heard of such thing ,
i wondered if it was true .
uh-huh
i've never heard of it .
i never had either ,
i just wondered .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
there again , i suppose it should be .
exactly .
that would mean they all have to decide one way or the other one .
is it guilt or something .
then again , so many times you get one or two ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it varies the criminal to get a lot .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
there , you know , i think , uh , i think , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
bring some of these things out .
yes .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
apparently there are .
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i still have a little bit of a problem with that .
i would suppose there are , you're in the wrong place in the time , uh , the wrong person at the time right .
that's it ,
you just might mind anything .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
out here in texas we had a , great of justice of the moment .
after nine years , it was finally , taken care of .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we had ,
oh .
yeah .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
even though he had him that said that he was , at work
None
they still found him guilty ?
they found him guilty .
when people said he was at work ?
they said this happened during lunch time .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
he could have gotten away at lunch time and the trim .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
after nine years ,
yeah .
for him heat .
there's nine years of that my wife works back .
exactly .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that just was not fair .
no ,
huh-uh .
so .
yeah ,
i guess that's where a lot of the problem with ,
uh-huh .
yes .
unfortunately , that's what happens .
yeah ,
it's not the best system ,
it's the best one in the world .
yeah ,
it's the best one that i think , huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
unfortunately , we just have to put up with a lot of things ,
they try to keep them and everything ,
i don't know ,
the pro court ,
uh-huh .
i think a lot of people are .
None
it ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
the first definitely says really freedom of speech and not research of that .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
that just happened me
no ,
None
that bad ,
i wouldn't like it ,
i don't know if i'd go that far .
i happen to be a flag worker .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i was in the service i was in i saw what i was the red in the office .
yeah ,
None
it's important in so many of our lives .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
yeah ,
what they ,
there's nobody holding them here .
how they'd like it under another restaurant .
right .
they'd soon be back ,
i'm sure .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
hello , we seem to be of the same opinions here .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i hope they get something out of this .
yeah ,
i don't know about the judge making the decision , if that's ,
do you think that's good if you like a jury ,
brings raining ?
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yes ,
i think the jury should be able to have ,
make a nightmare ?
yes .
do they sometimes make a deposit ?
yes ,
yes .
that's what i was thinking they do sometimes .
i don't know if that's a regular basis or what .
i know i'm always hearing that ,
the jury came in with a guilty verdict
they pick it ,
they recommend .
twenty years or something .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
yes .
yeah ,
of course , the jury may not be completely aware of all the united states .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they may not know if that you give him twenty years he can get out in five .
i think that's where a lot of people think , boy they're getting away for a long time ,
actually , their chance , when , they ,
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
yeah .
yes .
they just go out and their minds .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
there , you know , i don't know if they were , you know , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they
they say after three weeks simply automatically life in prison ,
i think they ought to make it a lot easier .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i always thought there was wrong ,
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it seemed like sometimes there's a good ,
the balance isn't right .
it doesn't make sense .
yeah ,
very true .
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
or fry they even .
uh-huh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
like you said , it's not the best system ,
it's the best one we've got .
yeah ,
right .
let's put up with it , i guess .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
bye-bye .
sure enough .
so .
an- , it's been awful nice talking to you .
it's been nice talking to you , jim ,
i hope you have a real good day and week .
None
i hope not .
take care now .
you , too .
bye .
bye-bye .
okay .
where are you from ?
just here in dallas .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
okay because i talked to a professor in , what was it , north carolina , who got the t i system ,
he gave to all his students .
my father don't require to ,
i've talked to several people from north carolina .
i was just curious .
that's , uh , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
yes ,
yes ,
that's true .
have you ,
i've talked ,
too ?
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
people from virginia and all over . yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i talked to the professor ,
i asked him about it ,
he says , i think i'm the guy that , gave it to all my students .
that's why so many people are from this college .
go ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
ahead ,
you first , ]
okay .
the subject we're supposed to be talking about , let's see , is , food .
food .
what type of foods do you cook ?
what would you , cook let's see , if you were giving a dinner party ?
the only reason why i may know a little bit about this , that is planning and we got on pretty having a soon .
great .
to me , that's the type of thing that i like to put , in cooking for people .
yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
we have them too ,
None
right ,
we haven't served out very much ,
None
the man always gets that chore ,
you , you know , i , i , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know ,
have to make it perfect .
i've made corn till , which i like .
it's fairly easy and fast .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i guess i'm thinking of the easy thing to do for having , dinner .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i do cook ,
not , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that ,
i'm mostly the easy time .
yes .
the actual and the weekends ,
although i would like to sign with , the fact that my dad made ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so to speak ,
i haven't gotten around to that yet ,
what kind of show make it was that you liked ?
she was picking
she would make very seldom do that .
we were very poor .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
different rice and whatnot and things that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
she would throw things together and forth and all that .
i would like to try that one day .
yeah ,
my wife ,
so .
yeah ,
so .
no .
sounds interesting , um ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
yeah ,
that's great .
dinner parties are a lot of work ,
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
that's why i like the enemy stuff a lot better .
yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
uh-huh .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
that , uh , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you get it ready ,
you have to do a lot of work , i agree , and buy the special stuff .
far as getting out there and putting it on , it only takes a few minutes ,
right .
i'm thinking of the easy way , rather than ,
my husband , i guess ,
so .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
i think you do a lot of work .
even if people do bring things over , you know , still do the ,
right .
uh-huh .
right .
my mother used to make an inch rice and also .
uh-huh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
i'm thinking about , special music ,
yeah ,
it was made out of rice and rice and uncles , and onions and forth .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
you'd think it all day long .
right .
it would ,
you'd get the previews of it , yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
it was just wonderful .
that's something that i would really like to try to find the amount of cooking .
we used to have that at thanksgiving time .
uh-huh ,
yes .
because you can put it on top of the time , and do this ,
there's so much easier and in there are ,
great .
that it has to , up to pull up the rice , all day in long , order to come out to come out and nice .
that was ,
yeah ,
that's what i thought about , was that rice and shot .
yes ,
we probably ought to try this .
it probably will never be good as much as we did .
i guess it gets better and better as we remember it ,
that's true .
back , as we get older ,
that's true .
we probably should try to it , that would be a lot .
the recipes are really interesting ,
we're probably going to lose them
we'll probably forget all about them ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
since we're trying to make everything so forth ,
here i am talking about trying to make everything easy ,
right ,
right .
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
you talked about dishes , there are so many times at all .
something , s- ,
my wife's from texas ,
i remember we were first married
we were living in new jersey .
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we were on the way over ,
we were just married that very long ,
yeah ,
i said , you're d ?
i said , we don't have bible at christmas
oh .
i said , we only have turkey on them .
i said , we're going to have a jury .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
she said , what did you ?
yeah ?
i said , yeah .
i said , no , is only funded for those .
she had a pontiac ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that was born in the east ,
we always had earned ,
right ,
right .
a- ,
that's one thing that's ,
that's another consideration , i guess we could talk about .
the interior just kind of , go out of a sudden or a can , um , type of ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i'd like to try that too .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
you know what i found was , at it , stores .
what they have is this double pie center ,
yeah ,
i saw them .
uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that ,
that's good .
have you had any of those ?
no ,
i know about it .
my wife i think she's
so .
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you cook it in the bag that they send it in .
really ?
all the door and everything are all in lewisville .
None
i haven't heard
of that , yeah .
and just gorgeous . because i don't normally like them , because it's so it's .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
None
it is absolutely delicious .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
i'll have to ask her about that .
it stays so interesting .
because we have a guy that comes out that , under the ,
i'm trying to think of his name of it .
i don't know ,
i see a can here , a box of here going too .
he can ,
what is the name of this thing ?
i got a box , box , on it ,
it doesn't say , it'll be .
he ,
it's a company that has , a truck that comes around .
they recently had been .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they have cable and , and all that stuff that ,
i wish i could tell you the name of the company ,
i don't know what it is .
they recently had a bicycle , that was supposed to be ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
it was we tried it .
it was real nice ,
it was fully cooked and everything .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we had it for awhile a little bit more .
it was really great .
wow !
that sounds like it .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
that's the only i am trying that i think we , i understand .
i would like to try the old recipe of cooking , though ,
None
i would like to put one in the old , the old way and put it in there and put for hours and , and hours ,
None
wow .
i remember that when i was a kid ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
yep .
right
that's it ,
in the old days , were the kid ,
i don't think we ,
right .
really have it as a main meal .
that's true .
right .
i don't think so anymore , not with more becoming , more conscious of , and cholesterol and all those good things .
that's an interesting point .
how have you changed your meals now ?
have you ,
into that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
looking at those things ?
my parents actually started it ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
getting ,
parents , that's unusual .
it's true .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
yeah .
yeah .
that's amazing .
it really is .
they actually , they collect them through , you know , teaching them , the points .
my mother has really high fishing ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
it was one of the reasons which started them off .
they started doing this , like in the middle of seventies .
that's amazing ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
they'd go ,
that they have started .
usually it's the younger people doing it .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
it's true ,
it's true .
i agree with you .
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
so .
it's really neat .
my wife's mother is the only one they wanted to ,
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
she has high potatoes .
of course , i have too , but not like hers .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i always get after her about salt and everything else .
yeah ,
that's right .
her whole life .
uh-huh .
right
i like to ,
i'm trying to do something about my husband's trouble in the same time .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's not the
i listen to , on this weekend .
he's a fisher worker
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
makes away go ahead and did
the things not to eat , ever .
i think the laundry and dried and he would throw away for her .
he's got me into making trouble with the rangers .
wow !
try that sometime .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
my wife says she can't stand it .
when i make him thinking about , huh , maybe a couple of years ago ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
if i have four sons , not for me ,
yeah .
wow !
it's fine .
you don't miss it ,
so .
yeah ,
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you don't really miss it .
you get the breaks of the longest ,
you don't eat it at all ,
you don't ,
they're hard .
you get a bite at the most .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
for cholesterol , i'm trying that .
it has worked .
my neighbors gone down with sixty bucks .
although ,
wow , that's good .
None
i don't know , whether any of that is true , huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
whether the or your ability ,
okay .
okay .
what can we do about crime ?
i don't know .
the one thing that keeps coming to mind to me that is they don't have enough space in the prisons to put people in
they keep wanting out that people have , these horrible things .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
that's one thing i guess i could think of that
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's definitely a big concern ,
every day it's , all voluntary ,
we live in a little small town ,
there's just unreal and murders and everything and all the time .
you just can't get away from it real far where you live .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
it's pretty scary .
i'm from maryland ,
i can't say that there's too much of that there .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i know the bigger cities have problems with it .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
i really don't know what we can do about it .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
it's rough , because
unless they start the ,
None
that's the only thing i can think of .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
yeah ,
even some of the costs just anything humid .
yeah ,
they're still , only six months in the garage .
that's definitely something .
they could have a more monthly sentence instead of having the judge having the choice of like , from one month to ten years or something
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that would be one thing that , i think is help is having the laws that have changed is that they were more intelligent and more automatic weapons , for certain crimes
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
i don't know what they're going to do with the problem because it just gets worse as worse .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
one things that they're saying , now ,
are you going ,
are you a student
are you in the work force
so .
i'm a senior at university of maryland .
okay .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so .
they don't really ,
not only that , a lot of not even had changed in .
you know ,
wow .
what i mean ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
a lot of times the girls don't even report it .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
i've heard of a few case up here ,
i can't say that i've heard of , any kind of significant issue .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
then again you don't know how many girls are doing them or not .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
they say like only one in ten minutes are some thing .
i believe it .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's awful .
one thing they could do is probably support people more than it also .
None
i'm sure it's still terribly costly , for people to report it .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's probably something else they could do .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
i don't know ,
it seems like something else in terms of crime is certainly going to be involved ,
so .
that's like as long as ,
None
these kids are saying why i should go to high school
None
that's certainly a big problem .
i don't know what the solution to that is .
having more drug control players up there .
jeez , i don't know .
yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
i know a lot of people that are that in .
i'm not saying they're bad people ,
i would say that's a bigger problem .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
it ends up ,
None
huge .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
on drugs ,
it's definitely got to do with crime .
you hear about people after their lunch , you know , to get some organized .
just ,
gosh , horrible stuff like that .
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
their rights are picking up .
that's , another way of looking at it is as the woman is being a , for an employer to her child .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i don't know who's the boss there .
yeah ,
it's a very complicated problem .
i don't think the government trying to compare it . with it ,
no , i don't either .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
i guess that's about all i have to say .
so .
is there anything else you would want to ,
no .
okay .
i can't say that i just know that it's really bad in some areas
None
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
i don't know what they can do .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
it's frustrating .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
okay .
so .
it was nice talking to you .
thanks for talking .
have a good day .
you too .
bye .
bye , bye .
basically i'm at home
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i have two cats and my husband ,
my husband's great .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's wonderful ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
so .
i'm about forty and whatever ,
uh-huh
around there ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
you're just a vicious professor
yeah ,
i passed the fifty .
i'm just a spring chicken , i guess
None
so .
it should be real interesting .
um
you think we're ready ?
i think i'm ready
okay
okay .
you want to start off ?
let's see ,
the changes i've seen in those regard ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
since i am in the forty age , i'm a baby-sitter with lunch
from my mother's generation to my generation it's been a big change .
very much , yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
very much ,
i think you'll have to agree
yes .
yes ,
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we didn't really know what the bulls was going to be
i think , it got off to a really hunter ,
it has a yearly estate to it that , i've sort of kept away from .
i think all things get started doing that and then got that .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
they come in that way .
to make a change , you have to make a baby-sitter .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
it's okay
i think , on the other hand , i don't know that men have changed that much .
in addition to the corporate changes , the men stay around ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
the women change around .
i hadn't thought much about that ,
that is true .
that , uh , i , i , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i think men are trying .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
some of them .
they don't have a national organization of men ,
no .
to , help them out
no .
what's changing them , though , is the economic situation ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
very much .
where it has to be a team team ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they both have to work they both have to raise the children ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that , i think has been the same of the last ten years .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
the me ,
i don't know ,
the rest ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
the whatever it was , the , women didn't know how to go about doing the deficit
they wanted to try with men ,
they wanted to be like men ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's wrong .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i think they finally discovered that they don't want to be like men
not , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
no ,
they hurt themselves a little bit in that way .
absolutely ,
that's , uh , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
they sort of threw the thing back in another ten years ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that they've had to , uh ,
i saw the greatest significant the other day ,
i got to get some for all my men friends ,
it says , let us do the best , women do have more important to do
there you go
there's a lot of truth in that .
right .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i think men and women have both conscious of men to offer a lot ,
we were made differently ,
that's right .
however you come to that stage ,
we were thelma , made , differently
there is great tips ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
in that ,
we should respect that in each other
so .
yes ,
it shouldn't be fantastic .
right .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
just sort of all into one channel sort of thing ,
it's on his office
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
None
yeah ,
depends ,
that's kind of makes it exciting .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
so .
that depends on what day of the month it is .
yeah
i don't know ,
i guess we've gotten more of a ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
it's still a challenge being in a farm and trying to figure out those things
so .
None
yeah ,
that's a very different way to do ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
the woman doesn't start off at home ,
right .
raising the kids and goes back into her career ,
right .
twenty years later .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
so .
because you get set in your ways
it's , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
you do .
really hard to really get to help .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
to get the work market automatically .
are you married ?
yes ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
our , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
do you have children ?
we have five children ,
so .
my goodness .
they're all grown on their own and
so .
my .
they're ,
how did you do ?
how do you mean that ?
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
did you have boys , no ,
how did ,
how ,
we have , two girls and three boys
my .
yeah .
my .
last week was her first baby .
how cheap .
it's been real exciting .
i tell you what .
i don't know what i would do without my friends having all these time .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
have you been that way ?
just eight years ,
just eight years .
just the most important of my life that has
that's a long eight years , though .
yeah ,
it has been .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
there have been major , major ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's another story .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
my husband has
that makes a big difference .
i couldn't ask for a better life .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
if this is the way it had to be ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
this is the best way ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i could possibly do it ,
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
yeah .
yes .
of thing
so .
probably your role
the way you are also changed , though .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
compared to what it would have been twenty , fifty years ago .
yeah ,
that's true .
boy ,
i would have had so ,
i had so much to lay up with something
the changes that had to take place ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yes .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that was a major change ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
the best you can , yeah .
people we think are a whole , sort of into the bible ,
they're got a little bit of a little seventies there ,
i think the future of this whole thing is going to be the way with the day care of the country .
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
yeah ,
that's the only thing i worry about is the same and love sixty .
that , uh , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
i think that's being done ,
i think ,
a lot .
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i think ,
i do , too .
i think ,
some women can do both .
they're very protective of working
so .
yeah ,
i wish they weren't so many ,
i wish they weren't role for everybody ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
because it's so dangerous .
it really is , yeah .
it's dangerous for the woman , too , to think that we can do that
when she can't , the penalty of that is ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
her life sort of falls apart
she doesn't know who she is
she's ,
many have to work to make a little bit of it , it seems like ,
absolutely .
they say they do unemployment ,
i think ones that don't have to , the ,
it's not as much of a democracy as not to work it was for a while there .
i think it depends on what part of the country you're in .
that could be .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i would almost just say that , because down here in the south dakota ,
so .
a whole role ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
sort of thing ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
so .
you mean it's the humidity ?
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
much better .
i think that , career women still have a lot of problems here ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
with the good old boys ,
right .
here in texas sort of thing ,
right .
making career works
so .
right .
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
since the days of the , around here , though .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
that's the whole role ,
yes .
None
then i'm not there ,
i don't know that .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
i have women that do both
i see a little on the part of the , uh , woman for the two boys
yeah .
so .
yeah ,
uh-huh ,
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
all the time .
i see i little bit of that
i always wish there was a balance ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
with the one and wish she could spend more time with her kids
the other hand i wish she was just kind of relaxed and ,
right .
for a while
they're both ,
get some peace and quiet .
yeah ,
they're both different people , too .
yeah ,
definitely ,
you're right about that .
that's where the trouble goes .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
some people can have and both , are not much , uh ,
that's , uh , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that .
others can't .
that's true .
that's so true .
how did your daughter do it ?
i have one daughter that works full-time .
she has two little boys .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they seem to do fine .
she has talked about , and staying home for a few years .
then , it's real hard because she's got an excellent job .
right .
so .
all right ,
what type of things would you fix if you're having anything else ?
i have a really great one that i have in the summertime because it's cool
it's just really pretty easy .
it's pretty much held in things and said .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i like that .
the only thing you have to do is cook the newspaper that goes in it
you're supposed to do chicken ,
i just use those little cans of chicken .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it makes it so much easier ,
you dump the rice ,
you dump the chicken
you put in march like it and tie up and ,
now are the ones that you have to pull all that off ,
i get my kids to do that ,
so .
oh
i don't have to do that .
it really ,
you mix it all up with wycliff ,
there's a little bitty character that goes in it to have you ,
it's so simple
yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
you serve it cold ?
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
that sounds good .
yeah ,
it has to sit in the library over the night ,
it's really good .
so .
i like that one .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
usually when we do we something do really simple , because i like to visit with my company ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
and not be around the kitchen in the ,
so .
exactly .
a lot of times , we'll wear
like , for the day we had some friends that are
we just bought a salad and jacobs it in one of those dark containers that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and put it on the ceiling and look everywhere .
that sounds good .
it was real good .
you can buy a fairly large piece of meat that way
people think they're eating or something
yeah ,
yeah
these days that helps , doesn't it ?
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
it really does .
i know what you mean .
None
now such a continue one on the world .
i do that a lot .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i do stir them a lot .
yeah ,
it seems like most people like twenty-five .
yeah ,
i don't like to do that if it's real hot though .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
i don't know ,
i have a real thing about being in the hot summertime .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i guess .
i think when you heat your kitchen up it really makes a big difference ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
in your own mountains .
yeah ,
i think that's right .
we don't recognize that often ,
when we do , i'm like you . i like it to be fast and easy .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
and something so that we can talk and not have to worry about being in the kitchen all the time .
most ,
we don't blame people from work or something like that .
it's usually friends from church and stuff ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
it's usually kind of like , you want to come over , and they say what we can bring .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
it's real easy because you just make one or two things
everybody else brings something .
that's exactly like us , from our church , we just do it ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
so .
it's a lot more humid .
None
you see all that on t v
i could never be that person .
huh-uh .
i'm just not ,
i'm pretty close to pull .
yeah
w- , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i know a lady in my church
she does her own bread and start that pretty little bit
when she does , food she doesn't really come out all the time
i don't know how she can do it and be able to
yeah
i guess ,
do you work ?
no ,
i don't .
do you stay home with kids ?
uh-huh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i've been working ,
we're going to have a baby this summer ,
i'm not going to work anymore .
how exciting .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
hopefully , i think i'll enjoy cooking more , i don't have to work all day .
None
by then it's eight thirty or nine o'clock at night ,
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
cook at five and eat at , six or ten .
eat at six , yeah .
yeah ,
my family and i , i'm a down there straight together .
that's good .
yeah ,
i don't like the run in and out in the morning .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i like to be able to sit down and school after have them come and talk with me my husband and what's happened with
so .
yeah ,
that's neat .
i think that was blowing in me at this time , my first time .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we could learn to talk about things
i think that's good .
yeah ,
that really is .
it keeps the family in touch with what's going on with each other .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i think ,
right now we eat in the front of the t v
since it's just the two of us , it's ,
yeah ,
yeah
that happens to us sometimes too .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
sometimes if something is , on that they want to watch i leave it on ,
we eat in the kitchen
their opinions is generally in the past year .
uh-huh ,
to see what's happening .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
food is , a real kind of thing
some people don't like to do this
i like to cook with my kids .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
if they're going to have other kids over then , they do .
we make real simple things , that ,
None
i've seen those in the magazines .
yeah ,
they're so simple .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
the kids love to do that .
pop .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
yeah .
it's just really hard
if you have to work with a lot , i don't like that .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
that's ,
they like to eat it ,
it's a hard one to have to be able .
yeah ,
they like that with the cool games that goes along with that .
yeah ,
yeah ,
we like that .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
that's a good way to get kids to eat it too .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
my son's getting to be a real good deal
so .
neat .
sometimes he took me off
wow , that's great
yeah ,
i like it ,
i like it a lot .
how old is he ?
he's eleven .
eleven ,
wow ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's good .
yeah ,
uh , i , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
do you cook a day by three weeks
so .
not every morning ,
mostly during the summer and hit by it's done
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
we usually have cold or something like that .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
because i like
they like it all right .
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
sometimes we do something ,
it has to be fast because they're on their way to school ,
we do recognize and stuff like that ,
so .
uh-huh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
yeah ,
i try to ,
sometimes we do eggs if i get up to go last week to do that .
i used to do them in the microwave ,
they don't like that .
do they get totally ,
so .
so .
i've never tried it .
it depends .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
you can tell if they've gone to long because she will come out a little bit
they will be a little harder ,
i don't like that .
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
you have to just let it cook a little bit less than what it says in , if you have a microwave book ,
yeah .
oh .
let it afford .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
stir it up .
so .
yeah ,
that turns out okay .
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
it's really funny ,
None
yeah
so .
yet if they don't ever see it , it's like , it's finally not that ,
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
so .
we had ,
my grandmother used to do that to us with things like twenty-five dollars .
yeah .
yeah ,
yeah
we'd go , this is really good .
okay .
None
it may be an idea to think about , what's going .
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
trying to find a jury so you can get a jury as far as , they may say they're not ,
smoking are going to say last certain people who are ,
i don't think it's such a bad idea to think about .
so .
right ,
that it ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
exactly .
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
i certainly haven't thought about this much
so .
stop you off anyhow , it doesn't ?
yes ,
yes ,
some of them do
some of them don't ,
this one ,
i was trying to remember back .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it seems to me that , when i lived somewhere in that area , or the kids that being involved in the sentencing wasn't so much .
yeah .
i didn't think they were either .
i thought the sentencing was done by the judge .
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
it's either guilty or not guilty .
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
i guess ,
changes .

i don't know whether it's by state or whether it's been some significant way that perhaps that , that , that , uh , as the part of the trial by that had to the sentencing or not , uh , or whatever .
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
yeah ,
i certainly wouldn't be , worried about that .
sure .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
None
uh-huh .
exactly .
exactly .
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
exactly .
so .
uh-huh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
that's kind of how i ,
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
None
it goes into the court case or whatever
it's not smart .
yeah ,
whatever .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
it's the idea that person might have this idea , how did this other animal that's really ,
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
yeah .
also there's heard of men
yeah ,
being that i'm not in that area i really don't know .
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
None
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
None
whether it's ,
i think it's with pay .
if i remember , jury duty is with ,
so .
it's not ,
i'm ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
i'd , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
i know it is where i work .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
paid , right .
None
i suspect that's a benefit of a bigger company .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
some that may decide not to .
there are certainly some that way ,
yeah ,
i don't know if there's going to be able to u s the same company .
now it's in pretty shape for sure .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yes .
it's only getting worse than it was .
exactly .
so .
there's , maybe some of those things that they can do
it hurts everybody's dark , of course ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i know that state has , has , a lot of year to help , the , state or whatever you might want to say to get better in a better field .
that , uh , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
which state is that ?
state of minnesota .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
right .
it might have to be something that they might consider doing is just to be very short term .
right .
yeah ,
yep .
yeah .
right .
it was just ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
you can go to buy them and buy for , eight dollars a couple of dollars i think here or whatever for instance ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
it gives you a woman , well ,
wow .
sure ,
sure .
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
than we think .
sure .
i think that maybe more than we'd like to have to think .
sure .
then it's something that's hard to be doing too i'm sure .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it sure is .
the , as far as ,
None
the interior were nothing
they're getting paid for this ,
it was something more than just the air pollution .
they were using it as eating out ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
the rest of them taking these team and doing the money for using it .
right .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's a real big suburb of , of course , when they get caught then they're guilty of ,
None
so .
that's right .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
sure .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
a pop for los angeles .
exactly .
i don't think , it's ended up being ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
it gave people jobs i think it also cost , quite a bit as far as because i'm done with the war , a lot of things were no longer put into the problems .
it was kind of like , we'll do this during the time and stuff
right .
after that they didn't want to do it anymore .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i don't know .
right .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
it was good talking to you
okay
have a good evening .
all right .
you too .
uh-huh ,
thanks .
bye-bye .
bye now .
okay .
what kind of pet do you have , uh , ]
i don't .
i have children
you have children
i have little children .
both of my kids are under two now so we don't have pets ,
we've had lots of them in the past .
have you ?
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
what have you had ?
we had a dog before we moved here .
we couldn't bring her with us .
we came from colorado ,
we've had concrete and stuff , huh .
oh .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
i've ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we had a baby-sitter that we lost this summer ,
he was fourteen years old .
we've had two sons
before that we had all ,
i think my husband wants another one ,
we're trying to imagine because our children are grown up
i don't know whether we really want to be tied down to a another dog .
we do have a very badly cat that's , kind of our baby .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we like pets .
we like them around .
we have grandchildren that run through
they think we should have a dog ,
that's because they have a great spot
huh .
yes .
they're just huge
definitely .
we , uh , we , we have a , uh , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a ,
if it were just more aggressive , with the little ones , we would definitely have a pet .
i just think it's nice to have around .
we had a cat that had never .
yeah .
yes ,
yes .
i did .
that experience was awful
yes ,
i have never wanted to ,
that's why we've never gotten a female , in anything .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
our male cats , we had ,
to baby very what you doing ?
huh right away ,
of course , he doesn't know it .
he's still out of maryland .
oh .
i do think that maybe we'll get a female time and just have her husband ,
so .
yes .
yeah .
yes ,
yes .
so .
which i think is a good thing .
yeah ,
so .
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it ,
you know the safety and roll out .
we enjoy having pets .
i think they're a lot of company ,
yeah ,
he was kind of wild .
our daughter found her and brought her to them ,
that cat walked in and walked right up to my mother and up and signed up and her in miami .
oh .
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it was like he knew
he would sleep with her ,
he was a lot of company to her .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
and just love her .
cats are usually so independent
this one he comes up
he builds up next to my husband , i guess
he's ,
uh-huh .
the cat would sleep on my husband's side ,
yeah ,
my husband that's one thing he was recently our cat was used to sleep with us .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
our cat would sleep with us
he hated that .
did he ?
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
he just thought that they come up ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
None
i think it would probably be a dog ,
it would definitely be an animal .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i think that's one of the reasons they ,
because as i said our oldest was never .
he was becoming pretty .
then i would just have in the house ,
i think that's one of the things that both of us are not wanting to start over with ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
it was new york
it just really , upset me no end up .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
that would , uh ,
my husband's grandparents have a dog
they just ,
it needs to be put to sleep
it's like dog ,
he's really getting too old to take care of it .
yeah .
oh
my daughter is just nine months old now she can get the carpet on the
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
the smell it's just really awful
that's one real interesting ,
None
yes ,
you will .
you will .
we were trying to decide about putting him to sleep .
None
yeah .
again going through that because our animals are almost like our kids in some ways ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you bag just as much over when they go as you can go a child .
our son and his wife and our daughter and her husband and the first , say , get a dog , get a dog ,
little thing .
be quiet ,
be quiet .
i can tell my husband , deep down he has ,
huh-uh .
hi ,
fine ,
i'm sorry .

great , well .
i'm in plano also

i'm a nurse

i find that it makes up for what i pay for years and the
i make enough money by the back to make up for that .
right .
to wonder with some of the benefits .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh .
yeah ,
None
yes .
i have my opinion .
None
that's an excellent ,
that is a difference ,
it is to me .
most people prefer the dress of a hundred to four ,
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
and weekends off and letting that their insurance is paid and their own ,
right .
yeah .
right ,
i guess that's a good point ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i do belong to a large student
that where i'm never employed
there's some different things , that one has not their boss is responsible for that .
right .
None
that got to be somewhat expensive ,
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
i think one of the benefits i do is that the rangers .
right ,
especially if you have a family .
yes .
then i think it makes a big difference .
yes ,
that's one thing i do have .
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
if i didn't have a family , i don't think i would have , as a male or for an hour or something in my life ,
i don't think i would have insurance ,
right .
i don't think i would go through that area .
one other benefit that you mentioned is the world two hours
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
right .
right .
and make my job waiting in that one .
None

yeah
i had to do , that , the same , for about three weeks of the year .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
i think that , that was an excellent benefit that i really enjoyed
i don't have that in my current opinion ,
you mentioned , flexible work and stuff
that's good .
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
what other benefits do you think of the ?
i guess ,
retirement , that kind of thing which i don't worry about much about it
yeah ,
yeah ,
that's true .
i just prefer to worry about today ,
probably not a practical thing .
that's who i am
so .
that's an individual thing .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
None
right .
yeah .
uh-huh .
okay ,
some of the t v shows like to do , uh , buying a different time
for instance the one i'm looking forward to him is twenty .
i usually watch those prime time programs .
right .
i like to watch forty-eight hours .
never miss that and , sometimes prime time up there .
the week goes by
i don't think i ever watch anything else .
yeah .
i have a few , favorite shows that i try to find like .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
l a law is one of them .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
although this was , it's a little easier to miss than about last year .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
with the new york and everything .
yeah ,
it's hard to follow .
right ,
i like randy augustine .
i've never seen that one .
the trials of economics with wycliff flowers .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
she ,
i've seen the previews for that .
it's very good .
it's probably very much a lot of our benefits .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
there's a new language on that is , messing on , northern .
that's not what ,
home anyhow .
we never miss that ,
we try not to miss that .
it's hysterical , isn't it ?
we think it is ,
so funny .
did you catch the christmas ?
just part of it
i thought it was ,
it had such a good story , too .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
did you see the end of it ?
no .
the little boy , the little one was trying to decide if there was a cordless phone .
uh-huh ,
that's right
the neighbor ,
they thought it was the neighbor .
they thought it was the neighbor .
he gave the two bucks a single pet and a paper band and a half .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
i thought that was wonderful .
it seemed that it wasn't probably the same company .
used to be on sunday nights , i can't figure out where we wanted out of it .
right .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
uh-huh ,
i've never seen that program .
it's , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
unless you're really into computers , and , you probably wouldn't be interested in ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i don't know ,
it just really gave me kind of an invasion of what was available out there .
oh .
oh .
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you could see what the new orleans were and what to look for
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i enjoyed that .
it was just a thirty minute show with no kids .
okay .
public television , course , doesn't have the expense for the show
so .
yeah ,
right .
i like the cowboys never .
i do , too .
i do , too ,
i just seem to miss a lot of these programs .
i don't know why .
i just ,
if i can catch them , i do . or if i remember .
there's very few that , my life would stop if i didn't catch it .
now i do ,
before i go to work , i guess her to soap opera .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
i watch one
so .
i watch two ,
one's a lot
one's an hour
they lead into each other .
oh .
that's the key and the beautiful and as the world turns .
okay .
i've watched the , as the world turns now i had a little girl
yeah ,
that's been on for years .
it's just ,
it's , something i've done for the last few years probably .
you get to come home and watch them
yes ,
i don't have anyone else at home ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
i have freedom to watch whatever i want .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i like
i like the comedies
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i do like good movies .
i subscribe to b y u .
yeah
we , uh , we , we have a , uh , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a ,
i can get some of the movies .
yeah ,
that's a good idea .
we did have h b o ,
we just missed it last week because it was like it was so much ,
it is .
it's just ,
i don't sleep a whole lot
and , uh , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
at two o'clock in the morning , there isn't anything on the regular t v
oh .
so .
yes ,
if you're up then
that's , uh , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
you don't get good for chinese schools
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
right .
yeah .
right .
that's primarily why i have it right now .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i thought when i got my v c r , i'd probably keep it ,
that was years ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
helped my wife took some issues .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
some that , she had to , pull everything
she had to rebuild everything .
yeah
so .
what was she driving ?
it was a cadillac .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
they quit making it .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
they want it
it never did run right again .
yeah ,
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
what were you enjoying the block and so forth ?
a cake and also , a former station before that came out .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
None
the , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
i'm burning the , two or three months on the nation .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
the ground kind of are .
yeah
the , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
especially if you need a minivan .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
yeah ,
if they start real easy , you just hit the key
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
it starts up when it's remarkable up that , will be a reunion for a long time .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they built that so quickly it would be every mother's miles and the all that they've had built in a years .
right .
they all take the same exact coverage .
they'll always eat .
i mean completely .
one will plan not out of all .
they've got a whole lot of watering ,
to do that , they did it ,
use an inch system ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
it's kind of tough on the moment .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
usually what goes is the same .
right .
you take a little time , replace the time , you still got a good master and stuff .
most places don't mess with them that's good enough .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
what are you driving now ?
my son's van
it's pretty slow off the ,
right .
it didn't give me any trouble at all .
that's good .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
it was a late model ,
is that plano city ?
it's a sophomore .
yeah ,
one of the little mini culture ?
uh-huh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
is a ,
do you like the way it and whatnot ?
apartment or runs ?
robert de ones ?
it , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
it rains us ,
it runs good .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i kind of ,
it took me a while to get used to a four eighty-six engine .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
you have to kind of wait for it , especially when you get on the highway .
yeah ,
right now , without getting some of the differences , the big rules are real strict .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
uh-huh .
you pulled american cars ,
yeah ,
i've driven one of the ,
i drove a yearly fee for a while , about a month .
None
go- ,
right .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
i've been a bicycle ,
i starting working my money's service station when i was about , twelve or five .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i've been around cars a lot , but , uh , don't spend a lot of old .
right .
i had a couple of weeks .
had a super b for a while with a three ten it in .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it was a lot of fun .
so .
not much gas mileage , though .
i don't know ,
gas mileage wasn't too bad .
it got about seventeen .
wow .
till you got crazy with it .
you get the four pages all worked on the time
why
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
yeah .
didn't have to work too much going to move the car around .
do you think since they started with our company that it would be the way the car runs ?
yeah ,
yeah ,
definitely .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
the , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
my last p o a car was pretty close to a consumer game
it still had the points and in it and that .
when i think the engine on that , about a hundred and thirty thousand dollars on the car .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
None
i really enjoy reading the newspaper ,
we get the daily , dallas morning news
i try to look at it .
None
so .
do you have time to read the paper in the morning ?
not in the morning ,
if the ,
i have two children
yeah .
a lot of people don't take newspapers at all .
we took the morning news for a while ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we've been taking the times for christmas purposes
dog just ran off with my ,
went outside , picked it up and over a week .
we listen to his news
we found we couldn't read enough of it
None
i guess the issue is , the world's newspaper , do you take any news magazines ?
i don't take , or time , or anything like that ,
i do like to watch , c n n .
i have several pictures and things to do ,
it comes on at , nine o'clock for a while
i will turn that on while i'm doing some of the work
None
None
None
no ,
yes i did hear that
None
any , time magazine and even the news that ,
sometimes that ,
that's why i like some of the patio that , we have time which we take from what we want to go
we , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
yeah ,
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we're taking that
we also hit the garland , uh , special cars ,
i guess it comes out like , eighty ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
twice a week or something ,
None
i had the chance to hear me if they're going to do a lot of ,
it was interesting that they think they were basically right .
so .
that , uh , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
None
yes .
news stations always tell the story from the last certain time
that's why it's a good idea to get a wide variety of things that you get so much of a lot of different things .
you may never get the truth ,
you'll have a variety to choose from .
yeah ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
which was ,
i find that fascinating that ,
yeah ,
i do , too .
do you ever listen to the radio
any ,
i listen to k r l d , and , l m i , the news f b i .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i actually listen to c n n n .
do you know it was on radio now ?
no ,
i don't .
it's on eleven ninety .
None
so .
when i go to work i listen .
yeah ,
my husband does
it's how come he usually calls me sometimes ,
and says , i just heard on the news that such and such a chance , if you're really interesting
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i'll know to keep an eye out for it ,
i've got out of the habit of listening to the radio .
with your ,
None
they start exercising .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's kind of a ,
that's what's interesting is the c n n ,
i'm trying to think if it's much local .
i listen to a little of that
i listen to a little of ninety point one .
i'm afraid of that .
uh-huh
that and feeling for seven point , she is waiting .
do you have a big cooking card like that you watch ?
i watch channel five years ,
that has to be ,
that's another frightening .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that has to do with the weather side .
i'm not sure that ,
i think channel eight is probably ,
i know the governor ,
he goes to our church
so .
we're fairly new to the area
we're still married
the , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
for a favorite channel .
neither .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
from oklahoma city
bye .
yeah .
they've been some people move around
john leap is , the ,
i don't know ,
do you seem to ,
None
i really think so .
None
they all seem to be , fairly similar
i kind of prefer some remodeling ,
i don't recall that they have any female
i like the to be different kinds of people .
i think that belongs to the israelis ,
i think that , i like that .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
there , i know , some late organizations ,
i don't know if you kept up ,
he's been telling ,
yes
i have
None
yeah ,
i think he has an investment .
you can ,
i grew up in alabama
i have some opinions .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i think that from a standpoint , because the majority of people have gotten in the world of that respect .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i'm totally in favor of action in some of the programs
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
None
i think that , dallas , it turns out , though i can understand , what has been in ,
i occasionally go to saint louis .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , there for a few days and watch the news and the dallas really does have quite good news .
i think channel eight is the number one , a b c r s in the u s .
i think you notice saying that he was ,
really ?
course he his own one
we , uh , we , we have a , uh , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a ,
all of the stations seem to be pretty good ,
it's just we haven't found one that we've taken into .
give you move from ?
houston .
we had a big ,
i did , have a favorite channel that i usually put into for local news .
i guess because you get to use , you know , like the ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
you feel comfortable with them
so .
it is interesting though ,
it becomes a little bit of others .
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
twenty years or so , even longer than that , twenty-one years ago . so far from , uh , twelve time ago
fortunately after we got married six years ago
they had him , because he was too , uh ,
he didn't have the software ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and wasn't burning the first
that's interesting .
that's what the t v stations do .
they're trying to get rid of it .
that's true .
i think ,
their job .
if we remember that they're out after the library .
that's true .
that really surprises they report the news .
it's like the israelis on channel eight o'clock a little too late
so .
is he the sports ,
i wonder if we're coming up on ten minutes .
have you been on the conversation when they come in ten minutes ?
yeah ,
None
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
good talking to you .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
alright .
bye-bye .
are you a t v ?
no ,
no ,
i work there as a result .
really .
are you at t i ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
you have to do the random drug testing .
yeah ,
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
in fact with me , it's not a hard to talk about ,
i'm so much for it .
i don't really have much to use it about .
yeah .
how many times have you called ,
have you been participating in this ?
about ten or eleven days .
you got ten ,
right .
you've passed me up .
this is about six times .
oh .
yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
it doesn't bother me .
i don't feel like it's really a tremendous invasion of privacy or anything .
no ,
i think it's good .
in fact , i don't know what the husbands were ,
i think that they were surprised to find it so low .
i think they were expecting to find , the national number to t i .
i think it was playing down .
as far as the number of drug testing , you mean ?
huh .
yeah .
i think that when i was on at t i of course , we had all the information before they started .
right .
None
yeah .
None
right ,
yeah ,
that's real beneficial for the company and the employee .
yeah ,
our numbers have been down there .
i don't know what they were .
when i worked for the giants as a result of a person ,
we had ,
when we sent to t i , i had to have a drug tested .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
None
their test came back positive ,
normally we didn't live them .
there were a couple of people that we really thought that they were telling the truth
we die the next day ,
really .
they came back negative one time .
that's the only thing , i think , that might be a little bit of a problem .
you're ,
that's a good point ,
None
yeah ,
they don't make everybody .
right .
that would be terribly carefully for someone to really come back off
they were not .
i haven't heard of any ,
i'm not in spite of anything .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
yeah .
in other words , there's very few ,
that , of course , has got to be tempted .
None
it's got to be with a very , very good suggestion .
you don't just have some local group do it .
it's got to be a very competitive option .
right ,
yeah ,
not just some central radio somewhere .
no ,
you don't want to do that .
None
i think that t i is themselves up with our church worth up .
that would be good for any company that does it , and not have to just a very competitive thing .
None
ours , i think it was in the south dakota ,
it wasn't even in dallas , the one that did us .
really .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
do they have a policy where they have people that clean back , you know ,
do they fire them right away .
no .
they're not welcome .
they have one chance to go in a program .
yeah ,

it's , definitely trying to encourage people to have .
yeah ,
they won't say anything about it .
right .
i think that's really good .
sure .
None
yeah ,
no ,
that's not right .
uh-huh .
it's a bit and all ,
all of us have one of these kind of news .
i think that those people have that because they didn't have to control it ,
i have children ,
None
they sell it to them .
right .
you know the classical thing is to give it away .
None
they jump it to them .
i don't know ,
None
that's a real difficult .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
my husband is a lot ,
he works , mostly with it .
you know a lot about that .
yeah ,
i hear a lot of horror stories about things like that .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
most of the time it's they get into the wrong spot ,
they start a drug problem .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
it's usually not a one time actor , i think it's going to .
yeah ,
i know ,
i'm glad of that .
None
that's my dad's call ,
i have one daughter still at home .
one's at u t
one's at home , gets a kid in football .
i'll let you go if you want to go ahead and take that ,
no ,
no ,
i don't care about that ,
she'll be on the phone all night .
yeah ,
right .
it seems if you watch what kind of job that start running around and kind of keep up with their friends who are looking to best things from support , to what can i start .

no
not yet ,
great ,
we're expecting a baby in july ,

i've got two , as i said , i've been at n t e and now , one at home ,
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
it's a fantastic experience .
we're really excited about it .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
uh-huh .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
None
the key thing that i think , that we try to do , is that bring all the time over here .
right .
uh-huh .
they're always over in someone else's house .
None
uh-huh ,
yeah ,
i think that's a really good thing to encourage .
you can make chicken and make whatever and then you want .
at least you see what's going on ,
you always have your house systems , then your children that , then you're cool and that you're always ,
right
good luck with your hair pet there .
thanks .
my wife was talking in my knee ,
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we have one , of course , i say , in college driving and one . going to go to christmas summer ,
kids cost you nothing because , you always get so many things from your friends and everything .
you wait until they go and get a car , insurance , that's when they get expensive .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
yeah .
so sometimes there's burning up to him when they take up to visit ,
it's well worth it and everything .
yeah ,
yeah ,
i think it'll be neat .
be a great experience really .
you still there ?
oh . ]
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
i thought i was cut off there .
i don't have much to say about drug testing .
no ,
i can't think of anything else to say about that either .
you've done this ten times ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
None

uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i may have killed a little in that habit it was just been out on the floor or something
i personally haven't done anything .
maybe i've , changed or something besides the
None
he would rather do them himself than to pay someone else .
None
he'll do it .
he wrote the time that he takes ,
he has changed , the brakes
he has done all of the things
the like that
recently he changed the same house in the car .
i was really impressed with that
we had to have it to get the car repair ,
it wouldn't pass onto
he sold around
everyone wanted several hundred dollars for it
None
he did it
i guess , he's been pretty good about keeping our cars up ,
what's your experience like been ?
i have a long experience with cars .
when i was younger , my brother had a couple of weeks
i bought a baby-sitter
when you have a baby-sitter more or less you do all the work
yes .
yeah ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it just , to me it was really odd no world to that .
right .
in fact , i , this just past weekend put new york in , both my car , my wife's car .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i pretty much try to eat and things like that i can do myself
i've gotten to the point in my life , where i don't want to serve the hole before your car
that makes sense .
i don't know whether i've just reached a point ,
it's real rough in the winter time .
yes .
i try to make sure that , by the time fall around here ,
right
that , the in pretty good shape for our office to get through the top
uh-huh .
it's like i had the press go out on my car , before it was required to go to ,
in maryland they have , whatever cold .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
yeah ,
i had to do that job ,
yeah ,
yes ,
i'm sure it was .
the thing was that i could do the job myself ,
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
if i'd taken it someplace and have it done it was going to be three hundred miles .
right .
who's got that extra two and a half
i know i don't .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
that's exactly the way he is that , he really is to spend the time ,
it takes a lot of time
if he thinks it's going to be two hours , it's four , if it is always twice as far as twice .
then when we lost her thing he says , you know , me eight hundred dollars
he thinks that he has the money that he can spend on something
he hasn't given it to someone else .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
he gets some kick out of that project , i'll do it and he doesn't seem to be playing for ,
there's some people that enjoy around here and things .
there's a lot of people
he just isn't one of them .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
i don't mind it ,
there was a time when i had my kids ,
of course , i loved it ,
if , uh , i think , uh , i think , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
i've got other interests now
there's a lot , other more important things i think they should be doing with my time .
i have the same problem ,
you can tell him from me
it doesn't matter ,
i've had cable there for years
uh-huh .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you want to make sure that it's done right back and put together the day ,
yeah .
right .
None
right .
those kind of things ,
yeah .
no .
None
i only have one guy that i know that i can't listen to work on my car .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
he's about sixty miles from here .
it ,
if i have something that's really major that i can't handle or not have the time to handle , i'll take it to him to do it .
right ,
you know , that it's , really , has a really bad reputation to is that people feel in general and feel like , uh , i think they're been many times ,
uh-huh
yes .
i know once when we had a ,
we usually try to find out we haven't done something with our health insurance
once the pool just made to be
he had looked at him else
None
he said , that's really , really good
he went in
when they drive that they didn't spend a lot of money or something .
yeah .
they had a big hole in a hole in it really would have been just been or whatever ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
yeah .
yeah growing up , he felt like that was a good way in like that he developed a good relationship with his father .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
None
it helped him to have a close meal ,
that's one way he looked at it .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
that's probably , something that , is good for both of them .
i know that , my older son was i never get him in high school
i couldn't ,
i just like ,
you sure you're a boy ,
your not interested in cars ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
he just would not have anything to do with them .
huh-uh .
he couldn't even check the oil .
that's how old's he was and .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
None
maybe we could have been better .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
i think that's great .
yeah ,
it didn't always work .
yeah ,
i don't feel the need to , be a native on that issue and i can see all of my own things .
yeah .
i haven't tried to do a lot myself .
None
in fact , when i , first went down to texas , where i retired in nineteen hour ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
when i left here , she had to change a set of the car on the car
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
because she was up here for a month or so , after i was in a long
it was an interesting experience with her .
she'd always want it all some week and other things
for her to actually get in there and do it herself it was something , a little different .
it's a good experience ,
yeah ,
i know what's going on
so .
yeah ,
yeah ,
i think it's important that everyone , um , how the government works in it ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it helps you figure out what's wrong with it ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
i've been out with my sister before when my dad went out on the highway
i happened to be with her and able to get her to the other side of the road because it was dark and all ,
women ?
yeah ,
the changing roles of women , how much roles
what do you see coming in the future .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
that's not a broad enough topic
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
sounds good .
i'm ready when you are .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
hold on .
okay .
are you there ?
yeah ,
i'm here .
my goodness ,
i can't believe i did that .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
hold on .
that's okay .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
but .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
i don't know ,
are you in your thirties ,
so .
no ,
i'm twenty-three .
okay .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
then i can tell you that many cases are doing .
i'm envious
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they changed quite a bit .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
this was my high school reunion , in chicago .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
basically , the decision ,
you probably heard that in the fifties where women will stay home and all that .
right ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's kind of , the opposite of what it was in the sixties and early seventies .
right .
it was sort of just to go somewhere ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
just , everybody be dying and be with some one ,
so .
uh-huh ,
i know that , th- ,
social error
uh-huh ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
before that a lot of people that wanted to handle these groups like , black people , or , just large , large , groups of people ,
the , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
right
it was more civil rights ,
right ,
or race rather than they don't ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
None
you had maternity choose ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and just the smaller groups of people .
it did .
i think since then is when a lot of the soviet roles have started to change .
it did
uh-huh .
you were not selected and not that .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
who are in , in arizona ,
exactly .
in the fort worth .
uh-huh
i think that's good .
i think that , you can just look at home and see it , i've been talking to a lot of people about education and things ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and what is the school system
i think that a big thing that covers it is that the other area is not home ,
right .
like she used to be .
she used to be kind of a rock ,
the rest ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
in the house ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
uh-huh .
and so , when , uh , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
the mother's not there anymore
the children are ,
i think a lot of society is realistic .
None
i think that ,
right .
None
they're not quite used to it yet
that's i ,
the schools or the parents ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
yes ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i'm trying to think of what else .
i have a lot of opinions on this except a lot of all i went myself
a lot of the things , the company's saying ,
there are more ,
i don't have the numbers in my head right now ,
yeah ,
right ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
in the united states , in terms of being ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i'm the typical baby fan ,
i hate that term ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
in terms of women going out , twenty-three , i think that .
what's it like to be treated as a woman today ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
those were the general issues .
speaking of getting married , i was talking to someone yesterday on this , on the project ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we were talking about child care
he asked me if i had any kids .
he was about forty or fifty years old
i said no , i'm just twenty ,
he was on ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
i said no , i'm just twenty-three ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
because i don't think of myself as opposed to have children
the first thing he says is , you don't miss that part of your life .
i just ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
my mind just went ,
you didn't know what you're going to be done .
i went , what i ,
so .
it really doesn't even occur to me right now to have children ,
becau- ,
i don't have any either
i've been a married for eleven years ,
so .
yeah ,
it just ,
i think that i'll probably have children when i'm about thirty , a pound , something like ,
yeah ,
when it's time ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
just because , i'm not sure if it's just me , or women in the cities that are right now , because i'm really into my career .
yeah ,
you want to buy ,
yeah ,
None
uh-huh ,
i don't need anything kind of throwing it back ,
right
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
women don't feel like they need to get married anymore .
right ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i was twenty-seven when i got married
i just at the time ,
my husband actually even feel about it .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
he was twenty-two when we had
i was at a point where it was like , i didn't watch it ,
i just , went out to have a good time ,
right .
i didn't have to have male de niro .
right ,
right .
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
which i also had done , they were very sad .
then by the time i got married ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
yeah ,
yeah ,
None
yeah ,
yeah ,
their opinion is pretty .
it's just really not there anymore .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
that has to do with , the women getting out and put the other women and seeing ,
right .
out in the world .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's like , i can do that .
maybe ,
right ,
i don't know
i don't need to get married .
how old your mom is ,
she's probably ,
let's see my mother's in her early sixties ,
so .
she's , she's about forty .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i'm glad ,
your mother's minute ,
i just turned out .
yes
i'm telling you ,
my god .
it does start to discuss up .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
no ,
it's okay ,
don't ever let age ,
i don't thi- ,
okay .
nobody talks about it for women except other women and other men .
i just turned into ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
good-bye
i'm still going , my god , i'm getting so old .
i just ,
me , myself , i just like to move really , really quickly .
yeah ,
an ,
i like to ,
anything i do ,
i got out of school too often .
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i'm working too .
i want to move up quick .
i want to make money quick .
i want to retire quick .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
anything ,
when the age end up , where i'm twenty-three and twenty-four ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i'm thinking my time is running out .
i'm actually very , very young .
yeah ,
you are , because i was what i said is going to , do you know , is my background is in , in richardson and corporate communications ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
what you'll find is ,
i'm just now finally to a point where ,
i don't know why i didn't do it ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
this is probably typical of the public issues have a ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
i'm seriously considering going to school back for that .
so .
which is a complete , i wouldn't say that series , it's a real pain ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's still is a different trend .
if you think about it , i still have to be raised this .
i've worked for over fifteen years in what i've done .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
when you're saying quick , i think that's probably one thing that your next generation who's up to me ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
right .
i call it a drama named .
they have to eat real fast
uh-huh ,
exactly .
they have of speech ,
they have to just go through everything .
exactly .
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
something will slow you down .
do you know what i'm saying ?
yeah ,
yeah ,
it's just , you find out that you're really not , reliable , the judge is .
i know that sounds true ,
yeah ,
and all that .
i think a lot of people , probably feeling that way ,
i know , i'm probably feeling that way because they're losing with their job .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
whether i want to realize it or not , on television things now ,
it is .
young , young , young .
you can't be a model after thirty ,
you can't do this after twenty ,
so .
that's right .
everybody that's in the country music is just starting out at fifteen .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
i feel like i'm old .
it's like i sing
i would really love to become ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
a professional bowl ,
i think i'm too old now ,
you're not ,
no .
i'm twenty-three ,
no .
everyone i've seen coming up , they're like ten .
that's true
it's , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
so .
i'm going , i'm so old
i really have to always tell myself , no , you're not , you're very young .
no ,
you're extremely ,
yeah ,
it's ju- ,
it's , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
it's like us , we're getting ready to do , if possible , for an emergency
i have friends that say why would you do that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
if you know you haven't been able to children , which we do have a lot of ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
why would you do that now , at this point ,
it's just individual people .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
None
in my family my brother's children ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
he just turned forty ,
his children will be out of high school before he's nine .
wow .
that's like your mother ,
how soon they're good , you know ,
uh-huh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
compared to where you are out of school and everything .
right .
it's just , it ,
yeah ,
it's all lovely and whatnot .
uh-huh ,
yeah ,
very true .
what i was going to say about mothers , is some of my wife probably just say it ,
my mother and her sisters are always saying , to my cousins and i , my female pet ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you girls are so lucky because , um , when you have all these days ,
you went to school ,
right ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you can do this ,
you can do that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we couldn't do that then .
my husband and i go , why i couldn't
yeah ,
that's why i say i really feel lucky right now , because i'm not married and because i don't have children .
i'm out of school ,
i'm twenty-three ,
i can do anything i want to do , anything .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
even some days i'm looking for another job now ,
None
that's normal ,
so .
yeah ,
i think that's the world today .
i thi- ,
yeah .
i have so well ,
right
that's true ,
so .
not a lot of people ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
it's too depressing .
so .
what do you that you're ,
what , i'm right now .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i'm a writer fan right now .
oh .
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
for their company newspaper ,
oh .
right now on the side ,
i'm also ,
None
huh .
somewhat red for them .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
i'm a news reporter , now ,
you are ?
yeah .
i would like to stay in ,
we- ,
i've been looking for something like exactly that , uh ,
here's what you ,
d- , i , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
this is off the topic ,
those people probably weren't ,
uh-huh ,
okay
did you go to baylor by any time ?
no ,
i went to u t at austin .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
that's even better .
i just happen to work at a tour room , because i don't
i went to ,
you in radio , or television or news .
sports news , t v ,
my degree is sold in ,
are you still there ?
yes .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
it worked out fine .
okay .
we just ate out , had a big lunch because we both have been working late
we had italian ,
have you ever been to the bay garden ?
no ,
i haven't ,
is that good ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
do you really like italian food ?
it's not my favorite
so .
then don't ,
i like it's okay .
then this will probably ,
this isn't really excellent food ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that sounds terrible to tell you to go somewhere where it's not that great ,
it's , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that ,
you're not going to believe this
i have to tell you this if i don't because you're in plano ,
that's okay .
my , french center here is like he's dying of his arm or not
it wasn't that bad ,
it's very good it's all of these big sources started ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
which i'm not new ,
no ,
it's , all the tree and all the children ,
oh .
yeah .
that sounds really good .
it wasn't too bad it wasn't really
i was more in the mood for french scouts and all that
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
i really like italian food though ,
do you have any favorite ?
are there just the two of you ?
yes ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
when my husband and i go out we have four children .
you're kidding .
that makes a difference .
yeah ,
the fast food are probably the ones they have the best thing .
sure .
we don't like to go there because that's the most expensive ,
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
and like that .
you can usually get a variety of what you're looking for ,
right .
at least of them like that .
right ,
yeah ,
we usually head on what's , down the lake here ?
six inch ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
all along that tickets are there ?
one of our favorites is .
yeah ,
alright .
no ,
we love to go there .
we went there on my birthday since it's gone in this .
it always me feels because i don't think the old and all that
it's too ,
too much like a sequel took ,
yeah
and mexico ,
yeah ,
i know ,
i've seen it .
i love the food ,
the food is probably ,
the food is great .
i'm not a fairly low story if you're using this ,
it's probably the best agent ,
i don't know you would recommend that a year ?
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
the transmission wore the type of ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
videos or they have more .
uh-huh ,
i like to get that ,
it's a shrimp dish ,
really .
i don't remember the name of it ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's held up into something ,
it's really good .
i've never had anything there that wasn't delicious .
yeah ,
they are really good .
uh-huh .
it's a little bit with the same trip especially ,
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
uh-huh .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
i'm trying to think of what else we like to eat .
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
just to cost any more ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
lunch today was eighteen dollars .
yeah ,
it's very expensive .
yeah ,
i don't know how you feel about that
i think that some of it's over recycled .
yeah
i'm glad i'm talking about food being something that are young
sometimes it's hard isn't it to keep a ,
yeah ,
it is i don't know ,
no ,
sometimes outdoors and , i think that's my husband ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
go to the economics which is down here in the morning
it's a chinese ,
yeah ,
my husband likes that .
everywhere with the kids in the front ,
yeah ,
off of half down there ?
yeah ,
so .
yeah ,
august came ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's pretty good as far as chinese ,
chinese isn't my favorite
so .
i don't like it at all usually
so .
he likes it kind of
he drives us up a good way
me i'm like i said i'm seafood ,
i like that .
yeah ,
i love seafood ,
so .
i like a lot of different foods .
i like japanese food .
there's a place on called probation or
so .
we haven't been in that near down here ,
i had a truck down there
i saw that
None
oh .
or american or piano it's ,
i remember when we went
None
i had never had gone .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it made all fish per se
if you're looking for a very ,
it's very pretty inside ,
is it ?
the girls wear peppers and ,
how nice .
if you're ever looking for that .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
what other kind of foods ,
i don't know
we went to a place called in concert and ,
i don't know that place .
which was really over priced .
was it ?
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they had a great desert storm .
so .
that's what we need isn't it ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
no ,
there's a lot of nice places instead of camping ,
i like okay , y- , it's wonderful .
yeah ,
i like ,
it's good .
barbecue ,
have you ever been to i think it's called spring creek ?
yeah ,
so .
that's real good ,
they're real good .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
they are good .
there had ,
my husband's going downhill ,
he says free ice down
yeah ,
free ice cream ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
i didn't know they had that .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
i can't talk i had chocolate machines , in los angeles ,
oh .
today , which i never eat at lunch
it was wonderful .
just to die for exactly .
it was ,
oh .
in terms
yeah .
how are your kids at an apartment where they can contribute to what they want to do
do you still order for them ?
my two grandchildren ,
i just had a baby ,
uh-uh .
she's six months
my four year old he still ,
my other older two they can .
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they're kind of ,
my mother's schools she still needed her , well , good
yeah ,
right .
i'm telling you .
uh-huh .
it's kind of funny sometimes we got all of things like the ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
there's a senior down here ,
uh-huh ,
i know where that ,
and along are these fast food down there
right
that's all ,
None
yeah .
that's all right as long as ,
that's on the nights we can't afford .
i was going to say because with six people how do you ,
cause with two we have a problem ,
i can't even imagine , trying to ,
you sound like you're doing pretty well with four children .
five of them , they're good ,
that's the way the ,
kids .
yeah ,
we're getting ready to
i shouldn't say this on this conversation ,
it's just on my mind ,
we're getting ready to go to date .
how nice .
yeah ,
we're excited ,
it will be neat .
i think it will be worth it
somebody said to me in terms of ,
this is food so i can say , this is
you have to bring a baby-sitter ,
i said what's that
they laughed
i said i'm .
ye- , food .
thirty something ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
i think that that would make them any way .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
None
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you have to be careful if you go to a restaurant that really is more important
sure .
with the atmosphere and everything ,
uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know ,
if you're ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
like we could probably take our son and our oldest daughter .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they know how to act ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
i don't think i would chance it with my younger ones because they're just too much of a puppy
uh-huh .
that involves kind of thing , yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
so .
i've been in some places where they say they take children ,
i've just seen where the wait goes the bit significant boards ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
that always just bothered me
right .
yeah
i don't know what other kind of restaurants
really we love we ,
we went to one new orleans ,
back on the italian , we went to some place from across the past where everyone really runs for the food .
oh .
i can't remember the name of it
it's on ,
is it , not ,
no ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
i know which one it is ,
i can't think of it .
i can't ,
yeah
it's in the middle , yeah ,
it had white people ,
i think it was paper where you could write on them , or something with the bible
it was just terrible .
dear .
i was shocked ,
the dish was dirty ,
it was one of these you have bad experience and ,
yeah ,
where you felt
say i don't think i'll come back here .
like when you're in a bad part of pasta or something .
dear .
so .
oh .
boy ,
yeah .
oh .
cheap to pay the rest of
yeah ,
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
i don't like strange people coming to my door ,
i've got rid of ,
one of my favorites were ,
i can't really think of any other , places .
no ,
except that this makes me fat .
no ,
i'm just kidding .
yeah ,
you have to watch it if you go out to eat
that's true .
yeah ,
that's true ,
you can always blame it on having children ,
no
yeah ,
there you go .
i enjoyed talking to you ,
i guess ,
good luck .
maybe we'll see you in the restaurants somewhere .
yeah ,
maybe .
okay .
okay .
bye-bye .
bye-bye .
we're just starting a family through front
i don't really have a lot of , milk , opinions .
just what i know out of my husband's group , has gone to lake .
none of it has been good
really ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
the ones that can afford to have to produce ,
huh .
they seem to be having an fun time .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
a lot of the other ones that have , are professional ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
right .
there must be some good service out there if you really look for and pay it for .
what age child are you thinking in terms of ?
in terms of what they're talking about .
no .
for granted
oh .
jack .
okay .
jack .
you're starting from the last .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
after eleven years of marriage . we are .
it's happening now .
we're just going through the process .
i see
the question is , very difficult .
yeah ,
they tell me it's going to be strong
right .
do you have children ?
i have one son .
did you put him in that
is he older now or younger
so .
he's now eighteen and sixteen . and not had a couple of years ago .
sure .
he's out of that
and , uh , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
right .
that , uh , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that .
you , you know , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i was working anywhere when he was , i was born .
i was very lucky because i was a college professor .
oh .
i was able to ,
so
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
it was walking distance from my apartment .
i went up there
i sort of left him with a kid .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i left him in a carry meal when he was very little
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
don't pick him up and this sort of stuff .
i was gone only an hour at a hundred or an hour and a half .
that's wonderful .
i was able to , get , his schedule just , i think .
right .
so .
that's wonderful .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
i guess , because of your , huh .
i'm in junior utah .
i've done writing with the past ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
what we're hoping is that ,
my husband thinks i can do it .
i've just never worked out of a large area ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i've always been in a relatively , fan .
yeah .
if they don't have that ,
my husband ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i think that's th- , something that i need into going in this .
right .
i don't know .
i do think there's good out there .
what part of the country are you in ?
i'm in maryland .
you're in maryland .
i was out of the country when , my son was little .
the thing is , if you have this is that , you might be able to do something similar to what i did .
right .
that's what i'm hoping .
which is that three times it's
later on when he was ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
this ,
yeah ,
my goodness .
so .
you were fortunate .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
that's when i was saying , don't pick him up and stuff .
then later what i did was i brought a woman in the house .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
sure .
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
right .
it was constantly , i don't want him ,
to complain with that .
he might hurt him
uh-huh .
that's not a correct english
, in a sense , you see what i'm saying though .
from a small one , in a way , it was a teenager and just good .
i think it worked out very , very well .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
see .
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
he had asked for a paper and , sort of reminds them
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
he realized that there were quiet times
there were ten bucks .
right .
yeah .
we're getting ready .
None
oh .
that's , just
did you say or expert ?
uh-uh .
okay .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
None
good .
through professional people
it's private
it's paul .
we're just very excited
so .
great .
what's the word i'm looking for .
yeah .
that's silly .
issues are being raised in my mind .
None
what i've learned to do is just out everybody's opinion .
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
right .
maybe after two or three years old .
i don't know .
in my opinion , it's even as .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
your kids need to
they need a schedule i think .
i don't think the united states ,
what country were you , in europe when you were
no ,
i was in the middle east .
that's
that's the same thing .
i don't know how they are there
in the europe ,
my son's from england ,
it just seems the united states is not even for dinner either child care or anything , i call it .
right ,
right .
we're just not set up for that .
with the
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
go ahead .
no ,
i was just going to say , i guess , my wife are much more with the , to be at home .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i had my grandmother with me from the time she was eleven years until she died at nine .
i think that's wonderful .
that was recently after my son , was going off .
yes ,
in a sense , i went to work
yeah .
to .
still , it was much better than being able to stand a lot of town .
right .
which is much my feelings on kids and the elderly .
we switch off .
i think we're too much into somebody that was pretty good ,
right ,
right .
th- ,
i'm that way .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
i want to work .
yeah .
right .
it's easier
i agree with that .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
that's why i mean ,
what is amazing to me is now your son is already grown
you can probably have to stop that .
None
right ,
right .
in terms of what to do .
i just don't think there is a good system .
yeah ,
i've been at companies where the , is whether or the only differences is , we had given it together not to have any children .
that's sad .
so .
in , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
a couple of men like married through , there , it's almost a lot of people to .
right .
uh-huh .
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i agree with you , that it's just , i call it in okay ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
i
no ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
then , yeah ,
it's in saint louis .
yeah ,
yeah
i just ,
there are too many i think .
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's just , it's so low
right .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
some people that are not making more than a hundred thousand dollars
there seems to be an article in my privacy .
really .
is there are several , who does her home .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they take ,
it's probably not completely legal
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
maybe it's legal to school or two one little kids .
sure .
they take care of another child
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
that's another possibility
you might want to stay home one year
uh-huh .
so .
i haven't thought about that .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
my neighbor has an four year old
she's at home repair .
i'm thinking ,
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
we get along
i'm thinking ,
that's the way you have to ,
how wa- ,
i'm just real curious .
how was the middle east in terms of that with children ?
is child care of that type of word will go to death ?
no .
actually there was a comedy center , where my son did go for a year .
i think when he was from two to three .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
then he actually started kindergarten at age three years .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it wasn't like you're ,
it was real kindergarten .
really .
he must be smart .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
they do have such problems .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
also there aren't that many women who work .
the professional .
yeah ,
i was wondering about that .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
there , you know , i don't know if they were , you know , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they
i'm in dallas
there was just a very big , series about women
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
there were things that broke some of the day of my friends .
i'm here
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i was just real curious when you said middle east , if you didn't make me organized .
no ,
no .
i didn't mean anybody .
you wonder what
no
that's okay
even if you did , that's okay .
i think
no
yeah .
right .
right .
they fight ,
they work .
are you a vietnam veteran , i think ?
no .
no ?
do you have family who were in the vietnam war ?
no .
my father came in every world after baseball or two .
okay .
he was too old ,
you were too young , right ?
i am too young , yeah .
all right .
do you know some folks who have been there ?
yes .
okay .
a couple .
okay .
how did it influence them ?
the one guy i worked with down in austin .
he was a vicious down there .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
while he was there , he caught some kind of a strange thing .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
all his hair fell out ,
he had a hundred and five thousand for a while
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
what about long term articles on the weekends ?
is he still from houston ?
i do not think he was in maryland ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
i have talked with a number of vietnam ,
i had no one worthwhile related to me .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
my husband was going in vietnam .
it really made a completely different level of him out .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
then , another friend of mine went to ,
he was in lewisville .
he came back ,
he said , yo- , that is that it is behind . i am going on with my life .
much like what i'm helping you .
right .
he was a vietnam war .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
so .
he was in the navy , though ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
he was
that is true .
it makes a lot of difference .
right .
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they really do .
i really do not think that we did those young men right .
huh .
i think that , desert storm ,
shows a lot of learning that since i work .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
so .
the ultimate concept did so much to , uh , cooking the other ,
they did so much to their own people all over that time .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
that is true .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
uh-huh .
if you come back and your wife is able to move ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
or it is hanging by a tree , they still can't put it back together now .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
what they do afterwards and how they do it .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
not so ,
much that i say ,
i do not want you here .
there is just such a of a tie up .
it has to cover this of the country ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
very much .
it's about nine or ten percent now .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
the culture is changing .
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
for example .
even ten years ago , there were not that many .
uh-huh .
that's true
a lot of people have handled in the schools .
there is a culture change there .
the original tastes seem to be very bright ,
there seem to be very prevalent .
yeah .
no .
not really .
it might be in the long run you can see where , period ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
that is all a result of vietnam .
you see a lot of men that were there about visiting these kids , left .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
that is ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i would be concerned to find yourself to find out how they are doing now .
they are probably not doing very well at all .
i know that there ,
i know there is still people even in the dallas area .
there are still people trying to get some attitude of their family back from , vietnam .
so .
so .
you are talking about p d or eighty or whatever in the market ?
robert de people .
robert de people .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
okay .
they were lost , when they were little ,
they never did get back
so .
i had not .
that had not occurred to me .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
so .
that would be an interesting concept .
None
they didn't receive any of the land that they had .
it ran over into , i mean , let's even think of the country .
so .
uh ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
uh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and to extent ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
all they did is run and together .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they were not really fighting ,
it would have been the same as fast since they all had been to raleigh was a vietnam .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i am not even sure who was involved more . whether it was a kid or whatever .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they were hitting us out there and pour them for them .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
there is no way that they could ever catch them .
i think the movie had a lot to do with the educational city of opposed to this country and going in vietnam .
yeah ,
that is right .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
there is incredible inside in this movie .
yeah ,
you can't find much cover in a motor home
yeah ,
all they can do is in ,
uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
that is right .
so .
they try to admit the top .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i think even now , in fact and they could probably have a lot better than it .
they could kill all those plants , which would the country would be able to play from as far as then .
None
so .
they had ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they had to blow them up or something .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they had to fill in little bitty all way where he had the best had them .
what world war do you think they found the experience for that ?
so .
don't you think they learned from the city in vietnam ?
w- , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
but .
part of it is that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
part of it is technology .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
part of it is technology , yeah .
all , uh , i think , uh , i don't know ,
go ahead .
yeah ,
you say , more realistic ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
you death penalty those ,
you are prepared next time .
i think that is one of the reasons they have pretty much equal getting right in south america .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
they lost him for four hours when they were right on top of him ,
right .
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
sure .
sure .
sure .
None
we did not actually lose them .
they did not lose their lives ,
they lost a whole lot of the life they might have had .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
that is right .
being somewhat different .
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that is a long time to drop .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
they really need ,
everybody that has gone there ,
it's , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
when i- ,
in vietnam i think it was much nicer .
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
or blow their head off ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that has to try if you are very honest ,
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
i can't ,
they had to work all that they want , and the entire day that come along with it .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
you bet ,
you bet .
i do not really think that anybody can ever forget that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they can reason and try to tell you who were there to have .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
you see that is what the trends are so mad about now .
they say , we're ,
None
that does not choose the ones that were done .
that is what makes the block payment .
right .
i cannot blame them .
i do not know a solution .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i sure cannot blame them for being happy .
right .
you can say , that is the way it is required and go on with your life .
so .
right .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
it did .
so .
that was in the gulf trial in the president that they were afraid of everything ,
that is right .
so .
they got into it because of the past place .
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
it just opened up into the war .
yeah .
i can remember when i was in the sixth grade ,
that was many years ago .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
french , yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
the demand i'd have always had any kinds of pressure going on .
right , yeah .
there has not been a lot of peace of that part of the world .
uh-huh
i do not know ,
we should not have maybe gotten involved .
if we did , we certainly should have increased their people who were there .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
really so steps that they got when you home .
right .
i am afraid that they were treated as for the most part .
exactly .
i saw the movie ,
born on the fourth of july ,
i think it did a good job the whole penny of the times .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
more than , now ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
like , have we pretty well the story today ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
i think so .
i think so .
i enjoyed talking to you .
yes ,
it was nice talking to you .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
bye-bye .
bye-bye .
okay .
are you a t i
no .
no .
is somebody in your family a t i
no ,
my mother's works for the computers , for the government
that's how he got it .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
who do you work for ?
i just graduated from college .
you don't have any benefits at all to talk about .
no .
None
what i'm looking for .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
okay
None
no ,
huh-uh .
didn't get that far .
no .
you normally just try to sell them on your , and not how much , vacation we do not know
so .
so .
i'll tell you a little bit about what t i has as benefits .
we do have ,
like most companies , we have the medical insurance .
yeah .
they call it brooks .
they're stupid ,
yeah ,
i've heard of that .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
now they're going to start to do the same kind of thing with him .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
it's almost like an h m o kind of thing , that most older schools are just going to be allowed to go and get the full time .
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we have some dental coverage now ,
you have to pay a little more to really get something worthwhile .
like , i've had a couple of weeks ago
None
yeah
it can
i pay ,
yeah ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we do have either , although i've owned the choice that they never seem to be too good
i know when you first start out working you're thinking about that ,
i like to think about that .
None
i don't think it's going to pay too long when i get out .
we do have a new thing that they've started a few years ago ,
it's not an i r a ,
it's called a four oh one k plan .
it's kind of like wild .
you put in so much money
t i , she's talking about you go to school and some more .
i put in a dollar , they put in fifty cents .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that grows pretty good
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
that's not always a real , for sure kind of thing .
ye- ,
not always safe
yeah ,
especially with this one , it kind of goes up and down .
i don't know if it's any different than other companies ,
you hate to have it
last year it was forty dollars a pound
now this year it's thirty dollars a six hour ,
you go , i'm losing them
doesn't quite feel as good .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
we mean , right normally after you're here for six months
you start to get five days every six months is kind of how they were to it .
it's , one nice thing about t i is when you've been here , for five years ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you get three weeks .
that's nice .
which , a lot of places make you like ten years or so ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
before you get that much .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we get , two bedrooms .
right .
right .
they notice it on this stage around here and the other christmas week on the ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's nice , so you always get two days at christmas .
a lot of people just take , that ,
i normally take that week sometimes ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
you only have to take three days of vacation
you get the whole week at christmas time .
yeah ,
i can just tell you like ,
from my dad and my uncle , like we ever ,
there's twelve kids in my family .
whoa , okay .
the french was very important , to my dad .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i think they took the dental away now .
he worked for an inner system ,
so .
so .
it's just another , big data base .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they took the dental away ,
now i think they're going to start getting into eye .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
yeah ,
i think ,
i don't use the services
i think sometime last year , or just recently they started to have some kind of eye up .
you get hooked on ,
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you can get attached and stuff and dump your stuff in particular neighborhoods or something like that .
yeah ,
now for his williams how much he just has the honda .
my mother's ,
so .
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
yeah
like if he puts in a dollar they'll put in a certain ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
uh-huh .
they'll learn it .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
he works for the ,
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
he works for them .
they changed their name now
that's where he works
his vacation is really nice .
he's going to be there three years at the end of this month
he'll be getting three weeks later .
gee ,
that's pretty decent .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
uh-uh ,
of course , it's for the government
he has all the holidays off .
right ,
you get some extra ones .
federal aid should always get ,
you get sick and , day and then ,
right ,
right
and those ones that you couldn't really care about so much but you get the day off together .
yeah ,
uh-huh ,
he has it really nice .
it's nice where he works ,
he seems to be very happy ,
like his mother-in-law
he has all that
None
it only costs a long as a commercial as that they go to colorado .
yeah ,
okay .
i think it works the same way with his hands and stuff if he needs any .
you have to go , to certain ones
still that works out really nice .
it , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
yeah ,
we're doing an h m o right now ,
when we go to get it's five minutes ,
so .
that's not bad either .
sometimes when you go , the company's ,
yeah .
you
that's a shame a little bit .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
None
you pay five minutes .
it isn't a ,
hi
you want to start first
of course .
we are talking about the elderly and ,
right .
whether or not we have their office back
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
as a matter of fact , i can tell you something about that .
you apparently have somebody there , in one .
no ,
my grandmother teaches and a nursing home for a while
her mother ,
you are kidding ?
no ,
she did .
oh .
my mother also owned and a senior in the nursing home ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
for years .
i will be darned .
and then , went on to school and be pulling the fact of the nursing home at a nursing home
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
my mother and my older sister are both of his hands .
for him heat .
i do know something about that .
you are very , very much aware of what goes on .
absolutely .
that is great .
the motivation for grandmother the business ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
was that her mother was very old ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and couldn't seem to find exercising .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
she was disappointed .
right .
she needed company ,
right .
for her mother
sentenced .
i will be darned .
it grew into a ,
uh-huh ,
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
very business from that point .
then they ,
that is a nice attitude to go into .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it seems like they must be waiting until it is a necessity there is no chance of , good or doing anything .
that is not really true , either ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i think that is a tremendous and a organization has come from some sort of bad restaurants .
those who had bad talk about them .
right ,
right .
those who do not add up ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
a letter to the nursing home and say you did good ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they do not talk a whole lot about that .
that is true .
what i mean is instead of maybe a nursing home ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
when you are still able to have good ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
where are ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
sure .
now , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that .
yeah .
that is right .
that is because they wait until the children make the children ,
right .
they choose to not make those ,
right ,
right .
choices themselves .
however , my father is also a senior in a nursing home .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
these , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
tennis lessons .
would you , call down and have the van come around and take ,
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
us for our own trees ."
they are very active and very envious
they have ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
some significant center you really likes to live .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
their dining room looks like , huh .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
that is great .
or one of the lovely stores .
they have , dress code for the grocery store .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , uh a salad there .
yeah ,
that sounds great .
i am certainly very much for a nursing home
i think when the parent gets old enough ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and with taking care of themselves ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
anymore . that is a wonderful alternative .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it is expensive .
it is delicious .
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
now my mother lived , in my england ,
she and her sister had half through side ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
one bedroom drives .
she still had her ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they were there close
they did have , the button that you could push the central office if you got into trouble
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
there were plenty that you could flip on and so forth .
they have security .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
no ,
i am very much in favor ,
i have heard stories ,
you have that with anything .
i know that the united states can be able to ,
yeah
i would be willing to bet they are much older money in a nursing home than they are in ,
in the homes , yeah .
homes of their own children .
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we used our nursing home as ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
like when my sister was real bad before she died we took her own a month and a half ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
into a nursing home .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they were super with her .
absolutely .
they were ,
now , my grandmother ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
when she was in her late seventies ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
she went to the doctor ,
she had grandchildren ,
she got the house
during ,
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
she got better ,
she got well ,
she got out and went back again .
a lot of people do that .
uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
left them yesterday maybe they had a ,
that is right .
broken windows and something ,
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i think it is a wonderful place ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it is a place that you do not have to plant with finding ,
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
problems
yet it is not ,
you have ,
it can become home to them .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it certainly is .
it depends upon the individual .
it certainly does ,
we have had excellent experience with that .
None
so .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i would not object to going to one .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i might like to be , wait enough to make my own choice .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i would not particularly think i would want my kids to say , i think this is what i need for , and ,
this is
so .
then dump me there .
i would like ,
there has to be taken consideration on everything .
that is right .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i think you would shop for a nursing home , just like you voted for a couple of church ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
or a doctor or anything else .
that is right ,
you would look into it and it's ,
uh-huh ,
sure .
do the best job you could in in there .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
when you get to the point where you are in trouble ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and you have got to have that help , you are in a neighborhood to make those people .
no
you do not have the time to look ,
that is what ,
that is right .
i am saying ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
most people will not even look at that until it becomes a necessity .
absolutely .
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and to actually get involved and participate in a big community level with the community service .
yeah ,
whatever their minds , yeah .
and work with ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
those senior lab .
yeah ,
i have a friend who is ,
yeah ,
he did fine ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
at home ,
they lived on a farm ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
she made raining so , that when she was gone ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
she did not want her other children with his experiences with it .
that is right .
she has made mine that when he was gone , that he was not going to go into the home .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
he writes very well
he has been there quite a long time .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
he don't know me usually
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
yeah ,
somebody else , is helping him out ,
that is right .
so .
so .
he has been particularly well .
one of the things , i think that is most important for the elderly is learning .
uh-huh ,
yes .
yes .
soon and ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
bye-bye .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh
the only real problem with that in a nursing home is that the nation payment type .
i do not think they pay ,
the nursing home staff ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
to get the expense
to keep them there , uh-huh .
that they have in some other areas ,
true .
that is sad , because , i think the health rate is the most of the questions ,
yes .
,
so .
None
that is right .
it seems to be a chore .
care for the elderly and care for the children ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i cannot imagine a lot more and a , more old ideas to do ,
right ,
right .
your money .
there seems to be a surprise .
you are your brother's and your eighties there .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
so .
yeah .
around here , we have some , the police ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
take the children
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i know our kids look ,
the children we open ,
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
my name is donna .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
my name is precious .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
this ,
they said about magazines .
i've probably personally take just a few boys .
that's because my boss takes one every penny they wanted to share it ,
a month later
i get all of them .
the one that i really especially enjoy ,
you may be familiar with it from wisconsin , is called country .
yes ,
there's country living ,
there's country ,
so .
this ,
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
this one is the one they have all the pictures of discipline from places we live , we like wisconsin
gorgeous leaves and trees and all the lakes and the mountains and things .
sure .
i get that , it has tried it in ,
that's my very favorite .
that's great .
what do you take ?
i actually take country living ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
uh-uh .
it's a country magazine on vacation here , like i , that kind of stuff .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
listen and , getting ideas for a garden .
are you ?
uh-huh .
oh .
i'm really into that ,
and so as what we do to .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i really get into magazines that are kind of basically , to meet those kind of , information type of things , and gardening and stuff that , that kind of stuff .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
i'm pretty much in the same category as what you're looking at .
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
sure .
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
None
i think it .
yeah ,
yeah ,
i've had time before .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
that's right .
yeah .
so .
that's exactly right .
i did the same thing .
we saved the ones from the past lot
we saved the ones from the war and one from the summertime .
yeah ,
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's pretty similar ,
you sound like you ,
None
that's the thing , you sound like you have the ability to do that .
yes ,
we do .
oh .
None
you're right , the leaves are beautiful ,
they are falling now ,
so .
oh .
it just happened , last week ,
it was just gorgeous out here ,
so .
i bet it is gorgeous .
yeah ,
it's beautiful .
i agree ,
the other thing about magazines , the only thing i don't like , is they really get into prison
it's fine ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
right .
None
there's been some magazines i've looked at ,
every penny .
it's a real turn off to see some other step ,
i do the same thing ,
some kind of reminds ,
yeah ,
nobody is ,
i think i opened the other day or something it was just nothing , you know .
falling into that .
i thought , why buy this ?
yeah ,
exactly ,
what's the point ?
that's right .
it's almost you could go into a store and get the same way ,
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
exactly .
uh-huh .
come out just the whole thing .
exactly ,
yeah ,
they're really getting into that
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
now i need a switch ,
oh .
yeah .
None
i understand .
you need to try a change .
do you take out of your friends , your paper
do you keep it ?
yes ,
i do ,
and most of the time i hold them there .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
type it out , uh-huh .
what i usually do is i'll try it out in the magazine and , first , without it out and , then give it a ,
see how the family liked it
yeah ,
if we like it becomes part of the recipe ,
so .
that's a good idea .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
back when i think the house with the little of the time , there's the little dogs , the little bitty stuff , and that , that was the big canyon here , of years ago .
sure ,
sure .
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i had forgotten the river i'm going to ,
i'll have to check that out ,
yeah ,
that's what i just went through , we just recently moved from minnesota to wisconsin .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i went through all this ,
None
i had no idea .
you don't want to part with any of them because there's one of each thing
it was hard ,
that's good .
None
i just said , there's one picture in there that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
right .
right .
it really doesn't , it's got to have more than that it's got to have some good ideas it's got to have .
i just kind of went through ,
None
i know ,
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
uh-huh .
i really can't get into that
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
i pretty much have a wide range of , what i like ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
yeah .
i can even take the news
it's pretty neat music that they came out with ,
so .
i'm pretty much the same way ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
there's certain types of country i can't think that could handle stuff ,
uh-huh ,
sure ,
the old , old stuff that came out , i think , it was ,
you talk about eight minutes .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
my opportunity to listen to the kind of music i got
yeah ,
the old , old country ,
the old , real old , yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
other than that , i like pretty much everything .
yeah ,
yeah ,
that's the way i am , too ,
other than ,
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
lately , with the new music that has come out , some of the really good , music they have the clock get ,
None
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
talking to my daughter just fell .
do you like g m ?
yeah ,
a little bit .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i can pretty much ,
it's all wet , huh .
talking to i just did the floor ,
she loves .
on , uh , i think , uh , i think , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
no .
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
yeah ,
the heavy metal ,
yeah ,
i have no interest in that ,
i don't have interest of losing my children ,
let's just put it that way ,
hearing , anyway ,
yeah ,
i saw peter thesis on t v last night ,
uh-huh ,
sure .
yeah .
so .
uh-huh ,
exactly .
so .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
it was good talking to you then .
same here .
okay .
you all have a good day .
you , too .
bye-bye .
bye now .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
do you have any ?
yeah ,
do you have any kids
so .
i have some children .
i have three boys .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
we're saving right now
yeah .
how about yourself ?
do you have any kids ?
no ,
i'm in graduate school right now
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
yeah .
yeah ,
definitely .
in fact , i'm finding out for my p h d .
it's a close subject right now
very good .
so .
uh-huh .
i have used , several bucks don't go out ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
for instance , my sister was much different than a graduate school for the .
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and what i thought would be easy to get through .
yeah
what you thought ,
yeah
yeah .
just the degree itself .
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
that's good , because i did quite a bit of the same thing in my lifetime work .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
None
where did you go ?
okay .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i went to utah state university which is in utah , the nice thing about it is too , i knew that i wanted to get into business and that their business of college , was doing
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
faintly>> .
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
uh-huh .
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
so .
right .
hopefully we are the one that was best for us ,
i felt very comfortable and about it .
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
do you worry any about , being able to ,
obviously you've taken , or something , to build and , try to pay for your own education ,
do you think that that's going to be enough ?
i don't think so .
no .
i don't know .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
None
yeah
and that your children can use the benefits that kind of science .
that's an excellent idea ,
that's an excellent idea .
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
what the could not consider i was able to work for and get out and save .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
also , my brother , he's a little name right now .
he had to ,
yes .
he's working to pay those off .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
the student itself are good options .
yeah ,
that's the biggest fault right now .
yeah
yes ,
as you're well aware that way you have ,
what do you think about a year or two of public service ?
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i know it's hard for young people to think about giving up their people that they have that i have known that have , that done from other countries , especially ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
from germany and whatnot , they have such a better , more mature , on life
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i think they're better people because of it ,
they're much more responsible .
i know , the church that i go to , the young men are a couple of women who get my life when they turn ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they're honest to do that , put that time ,
None
society better .
i really agree with you .
yeah .
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i spent a year teaching there i think it was probably one of my biggest experiences of my time because you're two from best office out then i did for one , i guess i wanted ,
i was working on a degree desk
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
it probably changed my political opinions
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
None
huh .
so that was one reason why i never did it
now that i'm further along and , and still i'm paying your college ,
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
and in the
None
i would have thought of that music
i probably would have done , just like , is that the church ,
yes .
that does that ?
yes .
one of my neighbors , did that in a while , texas .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i thought , that really ,
now that i'm thirty years old , i think that one or two years of my life would have ,
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i think it would have been a very good experience , for me .
i think so ,
it puts you out on your own
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
in a time after high school , there's a lot of ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
teenagers in our country are kind of a year that don't pay me to talk and things like that
i think that it would help people to become ,
yes .
less strongly ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and to be more responsible when you're out on your own
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
thinking less of your own needs to , but
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
of other people .
i think , we have such a need now ,
i taught ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i think i was paid , about nine thousand dollars to teach the morning for the year i worked in a very school district
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
no .
many of the boys in the room had some children
they were high school .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i just ,
there , they came from illinois ,
they were going to protect anybody in
it was , the school district couldn't hire people ,
it was very difficult for them to hire ,
right .
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i think it's a really good idea . and even if it is .
i never ,
None
yes .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it would really ,
i don't
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i don't exactly recommend
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
still they have been ill from it .
right .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
although i wouldn't want it to make people to go off to the military ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it has helped them
they are just a lot more humid ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
than the average student
like she's driving lunch ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
i think it would also help them if they did on the house to play .
i know that my first couple of years ago , were not too many , at the moment
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
beginning
at the end i had to be too serious .
that's right .
a lot of people they want it
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they just get so excited to be away from home ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they just spend all time there
yeah ,
that's true .
they do a lot of things to solve that the kids we really want to be young people to do that
so .
uh-huh ,
that's right .
so .
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
be- ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
that's true .
None
our ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
like in our church , it is , your local to do that or not you're willing to do it , because it helps you ,
of course , we think it's helping other people .
i think it is .
so .
i really think ,
i think , people ,
you should ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
the kids today i teach ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
they don't understand , how other people are ,
they don't understand ,
they're disappointed with ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh .
yeah ,
i think that's , just a good time .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
a friend of mine is a lot
he always enjoys it to have a kid come home .
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
yeah ,
that's true .
everything has to be an automatic ,
it has to be fun .
that's really true .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
i don't know how that would ever happen here
at least ,
they say ,
i think i , have read recently that , the fact that dan has been the deficit for the peace corps .
really .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
i guess it's some of the peace corps in the sense ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
when they're some of the military that they use ,
so .
some of that money has gone into the peace corps
some of the are the bible programs .
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and friends , that , i know when i was in high school i had an idea of what i really wanted to do with what i was going to study
at least i had some interest in ,
yeah ,
why ?
they make a lot of money .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
yeah ,
that's true .
they don't have a lot ,
they don't have a lot ,
they don't have an interest in their own field of training .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
that's very true .
how many ,
is it they say we have so many people doing this country ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
in the washington ,
area .
area , are lawyers ,
yes .
i just sort of think that's ridiculous .
yes .
yeah ,
there's just too many people .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
that's right .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
right .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
yeah ,
you saw ,
be rich .
statistics that lawyers and make the doctors in the long room in the long time .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
that's true .
that's kind of sad .
so .
that's interesting .
i guess i better go .
okay .
hey ,
thanks so much for the conversation .
good luck to you .
i enjoyed it .
thank you very much .
bye-bye .
thanks .
bye-bye .
okay
was i supposed to do something ?
no .
i had to press one .
good
let's see ,
were we right in the middle east ?
sure .
should we have been there ?
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
did we do what was correct there ?
i think we should have stayed longer .
should we have access to us ?
used more weapons to build their values that you weren't used ?
i think what we did was good ,
i think we just should have stayed there as much longer and did what we do .
yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
i think we should have stayed and kind of helped the people in the same areas now because it's kind of like a civil war going on now .
it's almost like they're killing each other day
there is not going to be anything left of this way at all of being .
would that be so bad ?
was there anything there to begin with ?
i don't think it would be good if we were to completely upset ,
it wasn't ours .
no ,
i just mean that , the world in general
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
i don't know ,
i think we should have helped the other people out there in the sense of little bit ,
i agree .
rather than just assumed where we did .
right .
yes
i think that's almost impossible , next to seven .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
other political stuff is going on .
i heard president bush said that , i had to do the refrigerator and stuff .
i haven't really been keeping up with them
i really don't know what he said .
what did he say about it ?
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
we don't have the money for that .
wouldn't it be wonderful .
it would be really nice because i'm kind of interested in driving in terms of driving
and back east ,
you all drive at the magazine , don't you ?
what's that ?
i came the phone
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i say back east you all drive at the commercials you don't have ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yes .
really .
yes .
is
i , last weekend , went home to visit my parents .
my dad's in the hospital .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
between here and west texas , there was probably four and three hours at an hour .
i didn't realize that .
uh-uh .
have you ever been out here ?
no ,
huh-uh .
how far west has you been ?
only in ohio .
you've never ,
i've never been past year .
you've never seen the great regular business .
no ,
huh-uh .
i never seen the great ,
i've seen ,
the mountains ?
i've never seen ,
i've seen pictures of it
so .
nope ?
i've never been there .
i've seen pictures ,
i'm a student
i'm paying for my own education
i come from a large family
we're never able to take vacations because there's twelve kids in the family .
so .
so .
my college grows ,
worked for texas instruments for eighteen or nine now .
my .
virtually nothing else .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i got my b s in general science .
really .
yeah ,
i know ,
it's a funny degree
anyway , i know nothing other than the west .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
it's really interesting .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
tell me about where you live .
i'm originally from virginia
that's about an hour away from where i am now .
i'm at brookhaven .
it's pretty , reliable and a lot .
how high is the highest ?
i couldn't even tell you .
it's not like a mountain .
it wouldn't be like a mountain .
it's , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
probably three thousand feet ?
i don't even know .
i have no idea .
close to their level ?
i would say it's closer to the university of shape .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
right here in colorado springs where i live in six hundred dollars .
so .
yes
when i lived in texas , every year i had to drive ,
i drove every year to the gulf
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i could have a few of salt it nineteen six , twelve hours , twenty hours .
so .
just for fresh .
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
how many hours have you been from home ?
the pressure from away from home ?
yes .
i'd say five or six .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
now when i was growing up in the mornings of texas ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
yeah .
my
my gosh .
when i was growing up ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
now things are different
people buy jeans in town ,
yeah .
yes .
for me , that's a long ways .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
it is i imagine .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
even , i'm in a little town right now .
it's smaller than the cowboys
yeah .
that will give you some idea of where i'm at .
okay .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
i'll look at my paycheck later .
i'm about two hours north of east texas .
wow .
how neat .
just this little town here is basically a college town .
None
it would be absolutely dead .
it's completely made up of food fast restaurants
in the summer when we laughed ,
my family lives up there ,
we come up here in the summer ,
it's , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
there's just no one around .
are you working your way through college ?
i go home in the summer
i work in the summer
between what i make in the summer and student that's , how i go to college .
how neat .
what's your major ?
alright .
alright .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's interesting .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
what do you plan to do with it ?
like i said my mom's ,
savings and wine ,
no
no ,
no ,
no ,
my wife works down in d c
None
i'd rather work for a company and , their financial opinions or something like that .
that would be great .
that would be neat
let's see , we're all excited in colorado springs .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
b y is coming to town .
really .
yes .
the , new york is in the city .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we're expecting our local car to
take a lot a little bit .
maybe not a lot , but , at least , active at least where we can take all the lead mile christmas trees .
what would be the press rate out there ?
faintly>> .
that's what it is here too .
now under involvement i would suspect to run to thirty-five or twenty thousand dollars .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
it's even getting hard for the four year to find people .
yes .
it is .
i know people they are out of school for two or three years
they have a job that has nothing to do
okay
i'll let you go ahead
okay .
i have five children all together .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
my oldest two are already out and about the world in the world
oh .
i , have a set of twins that are a third year and my favorite .
that's great .
i always thought it'd be great to have to participate .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
if you like doing everything else
yeah
right .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , was a problem with having five children to work to work a lot better than that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
was more than a full-time job .
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
worked about seven hours a week , and i took one hours every week in the morning .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
your first ones you mean , it ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
the , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
was this way ?
yeah ,
the f- ,
it was with all of them ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it was , more an impact , i think , on the oldest two .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
i don't think they noticed that wasn't around that much .
oh .
with all the children around the house , it's ,
right .
kind of hard to notice that dad isn't around ,
very much .
what i've tried to do , now that i've ,
went back to school and got my degree when i was thirty years ago ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i came out and took as much money once a month to save years i did not once ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
a week .
i've tried to spend more time with , the children since then .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
i'm helping the kids more with their cards in the evenings .
we just started a thing where every other week we go to , um ,
there's a movie theater that you get into herself on monday nights .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yes .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
movies .
it's working out pretty well .
we're spending more time together .
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
in fact , i found that i'm a lot nicer with ,
i have one son who's gone
i don't even know where he's at .
huh .
he's taken off for parts of maryland ,
that's difficult .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
a- ,
my daughter has moved out of the house .
her and i get along a lot better now that she's moved out of the house
uh-huh
it happens that way
it's been difficult to try to find the time ,
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i noticed parents not spending time with their ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
children and going out and doing things .
i knew the kids next door were all into their hands
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it just ,
i saw the family falling down on ,
texas is ,
there is a lot of people that have , uh , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
much worst for the drugs .
it was bad enough every place ,
drugs in texas , are very expensive .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
i think it's kind of important that i , i think the old thing with my children .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i'm doing my best to keep that up .
that's all you can do .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
what's been your experience ?
i was going to ask , too , does your wife work ?
she didn't up until the last , six months .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
she just recently started working then .
she just recently ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
started working .
yeah .
she quit that job because it was too old .
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that sounds great .
we also have five children .
huh .
ours are all out of the fifties
yeah ,
yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
None
those activities helped a lot of ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
giving us things to do with the children .
yeah ,
our youngest is , expecting her first year .
they're all out on their own .
they're ,
we have one to get married yet
they'll all be married .
they're all doing pretty good .
uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
t v lives in september , you don't know where that is .
certainly do .
okay .
two of our children live there .
one , like i said , lives in lubbock , we live in d c .
he works right on the border of d c .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
one lives in tennessee on when you're convicted
yeah .
so , we'll get to see her a little more than , what we do the other ones .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
that sounds great .
bye .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
so .
they have to .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
he worked a full-time job and a single month ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i never saw him .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i didn't have much of a role against a little bit to look .
to go , to follow .
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
know , to learn how to be a father and ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
a parent , and that kind of thing , because ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i can't ever remember playing ball with my dad or ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
catch with my dad , or doing anything with my dad .
that does make a big difference .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
it , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
if you don't have ,
i don't ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's my feeling that if you don't have a role to expect to mean it's kind of tough .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
everybody's not father knows what .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
so .
that's , uh , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
none of us are .
let's face it ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
None
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
amazing .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
so .
so .
uh , the trend to , children are not necessarily mean you have the , the original to handle them to raise them
right .
right .
so .
our daughter , she's our second oldest , she's the only one that has been children .
she has two boys .
she works full time
i have mixed feelings about that .
she's able to do that
i don't know if you'd be happy to stay at home .
yet , on the other hand , i've got the mixed feelings that i think you should be at home with your children .
i'm kind of old i , i guess , that way ,
yes .
they seem to give , quality time to those children when they are together .
it seems for them that it works out all right .
i don't know .
None
,
yes .
and , uh , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
it's not easy .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i've helped out extremely ,
i can't say that ,
i've helped out
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
as best i could at home .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
as you know , with five children it takes a lot of work .
yes .
it does ,
so .
it , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
if , even if all her home all the time , there's still a lot of things that have to be done .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
what line of work are you in now when you went to school
]
now i work for texas instruments .
so .
okay .
i'm in computers .
okay .
a lot of the people i've talked to work for , for the same .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
so .
i've , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
prior to that i worked in a food store .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-uh ,
which your income would be a lot better ,
]
now .
right . ]
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
it was a smart move to make .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i was more towards the issue when i was holding .
right .
so .
it's ,
it was ,
kind of a waste of a person .
yes .
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
you know .
felt that it certainly was ,
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i was responsible than most of the people that i was working for .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
every time something came up , i was like it to her .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
had ,
you hear this and ,
no
was able to ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
do something about it .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i , started back to school .
in fact , i was going to school while i was working out a week ago
that's why i ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
it puts a row on everybody , your wife and your family .
yeah
the only thing you can remember is to try and stay home and much as you can ,
yeah
because it's very easy to , go to your own direction when you're working so hard to start , uh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
it all paid off .
that's wonderful .
i got my degree and got the better paying stuff ,
uh-huh
i think as a family we're a lot better off .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it sounds to me like , you're doing it .
my husband's retired ,
he's been retired for three years now .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
that's quite a change .
yeah ,
my opinion to try to be somewhere from the same time i'm brown .
he made it at fifty
great .
it was a beautiful number for him
he went at fifty ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh weight calls , uh , i think , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the water ,
i'm envious .
did you want to go first , then ?
i can .
i don't own my home .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
right .
i live in a nice area
i rent my home
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
sure ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
in , texas ,
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i think as far as , our home , it's in , a small area .
we're out of the cities quite a lot of ,
it's kind of more of a country planning
it's just a typical , three bedroom type of home .
it's nothing , where it has to , this or this ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
None
there's a bridge across their minds where you have more calls
and yet there's ,
yeah .
uh-huh
it's , pretty much that , type of ,
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
so .
uh-huh .
he lives in france .
uh-huh ,
really ?
he's recently moved here
sure .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
he's eight or nine to eight months now
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
the houses around here , there's five houses on my street for sale now .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
which is just , in trouble to me .
they're not very expensive either .
it just seems like ,
we have a three bedroom house .
ours is one level only .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
it's the consumer style .
yeah ,
we have two living areas and a little room and a big kitchen
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
the bedrooms are a little bit small except the doctor a little bit more .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
so .
it's kind of like what ours is .
one of our year is not really small
None
that was our best way of going to , with the small schools because they are at least smaller and smaller .
it seems like they get small
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
okay .
that sounds great ,
i don't know if we need to talk any more or whatever .
have you done this before ?
the t i ?
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yes ,
about three times before .
have you ?
i'm fairly new to it ,
it seems to be going too .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
are you in texas ?
no ,
huh-uh .
no ,
yeah ,
no ,
i'm out of state .
i'm in wisconsin ,
so .
really ?
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
oh .
it's ,
sounds interesting .
other than that , sure , yeah .
is this your first time ?
no ,
huh-uh .
i've gotten several calls .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
None
yeah ,
yeah ,
i've talked to some people from january
uh- ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
that was kind of interesting
yeah ,
sure .
they're sure getting their people out ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
it was nice to talk to you , anyway .
so .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
you take it easy , i'm ,
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
thanks .
bye , now .
bye-bye .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
for as far as , i would think probably the biggest problem , that's probably ,
started to say the ,
probably so ,
yeah ,
so .
yeah ,
it'll be hard to get people to give up their minds .
yeah ,
that's exactly it ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's what we're finding , here , where we're in , at minneapolis area , that is not to choose that you don't know there by that ,
yeah .
None
i think so too .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
exactly .
yeah .
uh-huh ,
they just feel they need their car .
or if somebody gets sick .
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
if somebody gets sick , and it's not the other person and they want to go home , and that one person's got the car then they're stuck ,
that's right .
you're definitely right ,
]
yes , ]
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
sure .
sure ,
that happens quite a bit ,
yes ,
yeah that's very true .
yeah .
other than that , i don't know ,
okay .
my other line is i'm going to colorado to me
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
we'll try to be real quick here .
i'm sorry for these are ,
the other thing then is , because i don't know how long they want to us talk ,
close to five minutes , i believe .
five minutes , okay .
you're in minneapolis ,
minneapolis area ,
is the pollution really bad up there ?
no .
we have , quite a bit ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
yeah
those are brick and starting to live ,

right .
sure the other time when you're talking about with them , uh , college , i'm sure that it's a necessity over there and not even have it off
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,

it's probably happened to many of people ,
i was thinking how many people go into one ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
if you take it into a service station ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh
yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
i think it's like three or four dollars a day it can do is a good size to watch them up a little bit in college ,
i thought about that ,
so much of the problem ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
right .

yeah ,
of course in the ,
uh-huh . ]
exactly .
None
ye- , yeah ,
okay ,
you want to tell me what they're doing you think about the ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i know , the first term , they have sent them in a long area ,
the boys not the girls , the same thing .
the boys yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,

i thought it would be good , too ,
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
sure .
there's a lot of the other public schools are that done .
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
right .
right .
yes ,
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
i think it would be a problem .
yeah .
are they actually ,
why did they call it a lot ,
that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's what i thought .
i think they just gave it a year not this is not one , or something in the work or some good stuff ,
no ,
it's not ,
it's just a topic ,
it'd be good character .
i think so , too .
i think so , too .
there's so many , kids who have , so much money and so much more time , and nothing to do , and nothing to give their money .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they don't even have a threat to keep their money to ,
right .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i think it would be really good for people to be able to give their kids in , some of the public service , even in our government , to , aids ,

yeah .
right ,
right ,
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
something that was outside of school yeah ,
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
right .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
having that , add stories on , what's my cousins who goes .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
kind of an incredible time .
uh-huh ,
yeah ,
right .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
huh-uh .
as for its being required it's not going on , any of that type of system .
no ,
like i said , now all young people should be able to do something ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
right .
it's amazing if they don't go ,
right .
some of them are not ,
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
it'd be good
like i said , it would be able to ,
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
it's unreal .
are you still there ?
i'm ready
okay
what's , things that you look for when you go out to dinner ?
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i just like a nice , quiet , nice course and kind of volunteer stuff ,
so .
that sounds pretty .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
that's always a concern , but just a nice quiet place or something hard to relax or something , because i don't just go out to dinner that much ,
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we don't go out to dinner that much either .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
i definitely want to go to a place that's nice and clean ,
right .
i've been to some that's been terrible .
oh
you see note around and everything ,
i try to get one that's nice and clean
i like good food and no same .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
so .
yeah ,
yeah ,
right .
right ,
right .
right .
is there some nice places to go to eat in plano ?
nope .
we're almost in dallas .
we're just north of dallas .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we have quite a bit between us and there .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's about ten miles there is all kinds of stuff
i had one that was a favorite for a long time ,
it changed hands and the prices and stuff
it finally went out of business .
so .
it was really nice .
it had a lot .
that sounds beautiful .
yeah ,
it was really nice .
they had entertainment sometimes
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you could just really sit there and enjoy it .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
it's gone
this is only a little small city .
we have ,
i didn't think my wife would come back .
we have only one , restaurant that's kind of nice .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they have prime rib on , weekends they have about six miles from here is called , a little city called ,
they have a fixed that there they call each week ,
yeah .
that's nice .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
right .
we don't have any fast guns here in this small city
that is probably very fortunate for you .
do you have kids ?
do i have kids ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
i have a son ,
he's grown up .
i have a twelve year old that would take a meal every night ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
you're happened here ,
yeah .
i hate these places .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
all the kids seem to love about cats ,
uh-huh ,
they do ,
i don't think there's an invasion of value in anything they have to .
no ,
no ,
i'm sure there isn't .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we have all kinds of fast programs that fall down here if you come home from work
you're tired
you just are able to give in to that ,
it costs a lot of money to do it too .
i know .
it adds up
it's not healthy ,
i really got into that habit for a while ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
let's see , what else we can talk about ?
how's california ?
it's horrible and color here .
is it ?
that's what i've heard , yeah .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah
it's .

but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
we used to have a lot more attached to go there to
then i quit work and everything
i bought a house .
i had a microwave in between ,
that would be fun .
right in terms , uh , we went to a lot of restaurants ,
they were really good ,
i really miss them .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
do you miss living there ?
no ,
no .
i really don't miss living there .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
i just like to go in there and have a nice dinner party until a while ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
as far as equals around there , no .
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
None

oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i have a golden retriever one year old in college there , i think , a lot better media will be able to do in .
she went there for six years .
so .
i went out a lot with her .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
i know california pretty well .

i have my twelve year old in school here .

i have too much to lose ,

and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
personally i've been very until grade school for the last .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,

None

None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
it does .
people today are very busy
yes .
that is an excuse because we are always ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,

unfortunately they are not .
no .
uh-huh .
right .
i kind of just have taken a step back away and , maybe that will clean up the mess that's there .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
take it ,
it is a task that is , to me , kind of reminds me .

right
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
it's kind of ,
it's awful ,
it's hard to feel like one person ,
i know that it's important ,
None
i know that , people can make a difference ,
None
it makes me feel bad that ,
i'm glad ,
i am aware of the ,
yeah .
so .

i'm glad that that happened and everything
i hope that i will make a better difference
i haven't done that so far .
i know that when you're in a smaller community ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i live in ohio when we have , a local last , our area for their reasons and so forth , they really give a lot of information in the local time , not in the spring city ,
they just give it a small portion of the newspaper ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
there's a pro and a half not one of us , feel comfortable in , that , georgia tech , that is .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i feel pretty strongly about the way it's put it's .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
right .
right .
uh-huh .
right .
i'm sorry ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
right .
without the lord , they can't do it .
yeah ,
it's not very likely .
it seems like th- ,
you want to go first ?
None
yeah ,
yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
yes ,
i would be comfortable to that , except ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you would be in favor of it ?
definitely .
yes .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i know that there are many countries that are , very successful with the enemy of the government , that require that plan .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
do they have options on like occasion of homes and that kind of thing ?
do you ,
i'm not sure how their program is ,
i know it has been successful .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i would really have to , read the history of , the country that has very well ,
i'd like to see the data on that .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's the way with me ,
i don't know a whole lot about it .
i guess ,
that's the only concern i would have , because i think there are less of the doctor is it has a lot of the place to do ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
if you didn't have any choice in who you go to ,
yes ,
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i think that's , is if you have a good relationship with your son that you can feel free to fix with anything .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
or to change even , if you didn't think or you didn't have any money were far .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
absolutely that , the choice would be yours if you ever feel she is , being given the proper fee for your health that you should be able to make , a choice .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
there , that's one of my main advice .
i have a friend that their boy has been sick for several months ,
they just have found out what's the trouble .
they have gone through , one , two , three , four , five months ago and then a team of them ,
they finally laugh what was the problem .
it took that long .
yes ,
the expense of that , yes .
that , something like that , i thought , if you couldn't change or look for , huh ,
i don't know how that works program , you can do that .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i would think that they would have that as part of the benefit to the health care program , that you would have a choice that you could allow that your country .
yeah ,
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i guess that's not was one of my friends , because , you know , how is they say
yes ,
those containers but have to be set up ,
i think they should be voted on by the public .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
for them to have a choice on if they're in favor of it or not .
right ,
yes .
it would .
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i think that's why , if they were going to have a health care or health care .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that , they would have all the facts and the wife and , what it would mean to each other individual or anything like my p c .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
dental , eye care , and our , our body as a whole lot of years that are because there are so many that needs to be , uh , program in a program like that .
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
he said ,
does he have an option if he doesn't care for the air ?
only to the point that he could go to somebody at his own area .
i see
otherwise he has to take the ceiling and the hospital that the company has been the best time they have to .
there again , he's gotten good service .
he took the less expensive one of course .
if he's pleased with it , i guess that's the , bottom line .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
i would be afraid of what would happen if you had a choice or something .
right ,
right .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
yeah ,
there's always that opposite story there .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
it's quite different from when i was , under the same care , that's for sure .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
if you have your health , you're familiar with .
that's right
you really are ,
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
yes .
we live in a rural area up here .
uh-huh ,
what part of , california you think of live ?
are you familiar with any of the area that all ?
i have a brother that lives there
where ?
near , air .
that's a ways away .
we live in minneapolis .
okay .
we have a cousin that lives in the seventies ,
so .
are you a native ken ?
yes ,
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i'm a former student
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's a nice state ,
that's a real nice state ,
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yes it is ,
it's very lovely ,
it's a very lovely state .
uh-huh ,
uh-huh i'm sure it is ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
of course we have good here too ,
we've been pretty fortunate .
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we've been pretty fortunate .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that has been so much also .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
that is , the israelis , that are dirty up , just are honest .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
look at the aids , that's kind of a whole situation in the field .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's an inner r it really is a good area to be .
it sure is .
i still wish they could do more with the enemy , though , anymore .
yes ,
i do too .
they just don't seem to be ,
i know they're making looking , but like , i don't like that i would see , yeah .
to it runs how , you know .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
there's plans that people have to follow ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
i guess you ,
a lot of them don't do these things ,
it doesn't seem to matter .
that's true , too .
it ca- ,
it's , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i really believe our environment have a lot to do with it .
they say second hand smoke and that , is that worse than smoking
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
what do you do ,
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
you just have to follow the smoking to their little room that they want to ,
take their rights away from them , they say
i never had the ability ,
i haven't ever had that problem , as far as that goes .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i can't take any credit for not even smoking .
so .
it's a bad issue in america ,
it's hard to break ,
it's a hard one to quit .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
yes .
it's , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
they say that it is .
it was nice talking with you .
yes ,
very nice talking to you too ,
you have a good day .
you do the same .
we'll be i guess talking about the past room .
right
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
you , you know , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that .
bye-bye .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
bye-bye .
a , where do you like to eat out ?
yes .
we really like the mexican food , here in texas we try to go around and different restaurants through them ,
uh-huh .
i think they have one of the best services that we really like it .
do you ?
have you tried mother ?
no .
where's that at ?
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's at least eight and l b s ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's where it's , into penn t i just take any good mexican food .
uh-huh .
oh .
they're both very good .
really ?
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that , uh , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
no ,
we haven't seen , too many places .
i , i , i don't know if i would have to do that , because i don't know if they were going to be able to do that .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
right ,
we've tried places , down by the , the creek mall ,
the , you know , i , i , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know ,
None
yeah ,
yeah .
uh-huh
something like that ,
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i like to look better than i do know or its peers .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
much better .
mother is one of our favorites
then breaks some of my own ,
yes .
yes .
i like it better than just about anything they make very good there in their own apartment , they just use any absolutely just .
oh .
especially with wine and don't know them
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i know ,
i tell you what .
they're excellent food .
i wish i could make them here at home .
yes ,
yes ,
so do i .
just can't make those decisions like .
so .
what else do you like ?
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i love seafood i haven't got your hook ,
yes .
yes ,
i haven't picked up there .
have you eaten there ?
yes .
i have eaten there .
now the only problem , ]
i love the food .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's a lot of mexican food and he had a family ,
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
mostly it's been at lunch time i hear at night they do like , uh , the ,
that's it's really , kind of disappointing .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
that sounds great .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
]
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
the service is great .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they have every kind of fish that you could imagine if you want the ability to make sure is the whole thing .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
i have children and work ,
we can eat a lot of fast food
fast food , i can understand that . ]
i can remember when our children were small .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
yeah
we had a lot of when they were first coming out .
i know .
i can't look a lot in the face now .
i know ,
i'm so sick of it ,
we used to eat there all the time .
now we realized out at this point or some different things like alcohol .
robin hood
and cheap too .
and cheap ,
and cheap .
yeah ,
the kids , they've got those expensive anyway
they like
yes ,
they can sit down and all that kind of stuff .
yes yes .
sounds like my grandchildren .
yeah ,
i know .
they're just spoiled against ,
so .
no ,
we love to eat out ,
yes .
of course , it's just so much easier and stuff .
we usually eat him out two or three times a week .
it's just my husband and i ,
yeah .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
i would much rather go out to eat with t v which
me too ,
me too .
i know that i just work
i'm just tired when i get home
i just don't feel like cooking .
no ,
no .
right .
we like to go out to lunch on saturdays especially .
i like exercising out .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i like the dallas can in plano .
yeah ,
oh .
yeah .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
now that's surprising because they're normally real good .
yes ,
i love .
i like because even if they're hungry , they're fast ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
don't have to wait forever for a table .
uh-huh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
family restaurant .
we also like , national music ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
we think it's good .
i haven't been there ago ,
i went to one i think in ohio or somewhere up there ,
i've never been to that one here .
i know it's just down the street .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's good .
have you been to the .
yes ,
yes .
yes .
we like to .
yes ,
i really like that too ,
that was ,
yeah ,
it's fun .
i like up there in plano , that , this country house .
oh .
have you tried it ?
i've been there twice ,
uh-huh ,
yeah ,
so .
we like it because it's fairly reasonable
we go for the salad and quit .
salad a- ,
yes .
down , do you have any children ?
yes ,
i have a twelve year old ,
i've been very lucky .
i haven't needed child care except for my mom .
so .
oh .
i've been real lucky .
i'm a nurse ,
i go to work early ,
that's nice .
my mom comes over in the morning and gets her ready for her school or just was close before she is ready to jump her school ,
then i'm home to pick her up .
i'm very , very lucky
that is lucky .
yeah ,
i could do it now .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
she gets rid of the morning ,
i feel better .
yeah .
you never know .
it's nice for them to be not alone .
yeah ,
yeah ,
she feels that way ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
we just feel better doing it this way .
so .
not after yourself ,
i don't know what day we'll stop .
None
yeah .
no .
we didn't stop .
you realize that it only takes one second for something to happen .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
even though she's twelve , she's still a kid ,
she is .
you got to be careful
i'm glad you have that , opportunity to have your mom .
yeah ,
i'm glad too
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i have two kids five and six , a girl and a boy ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so far i haven't had to make a lot of child care for them because i'm , at home now full time .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
yeah ,
it's really scary ,
i would really hate to be in a position to have to find child care of the time
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
no .
i would , too , because even though a place can look pretty good on the outside , we're finding out now that it's not always on the inside i just don't know what i would do if i had to do that .
i know the hospital that i work in is a big hospital
they provide child care ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
of course they charge for it at all the least the week older and their children ,
they're always watching them ,
they can eat lunch with them ,
None
oh .
they feel a little better than if they voted them off and get the way on .
]
that's nice .
yeah , ]
it is nice .
i know that i have , done some of myself ,
so .
when i was in school and needed a few money .
right , right ?
yeah .
that's right .
None
yeah ,
right .
and , the family
no one will look out , after you ,
so far i think my boss would be rather than have a big day care
right .
what is that flat care and things like that ,
rather than having one where they would have the next year to school in a week or something ,
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
i would prefer to have in home care , either my own home or a neighbor or something .
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
just never know .
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it was hard to shoot her with our child .
they were the same age ,
they played together ,
they were good friends ,
right .
you said , you tend to go more for the other day which is just because you don't know
it is hard .
it got hard ,
my daughter got weird
it just wasn't the same when they were just playing as young , because she had to be there every day .
no .
no .
None
so .
i know , when i pick my kids up from school they want to come home .

i know , i know . ]
None
yeah . ]
i think , my movie if i had to find something that four hundred dollars a lot , someone that i knew
yeah ,
well , i would rather do without some things like that .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i know that some parents , they do have to work , or something like that .
None
i would never do that .
no .
i never have done it ,
i just never would do it .
i would rather do without some things that really aren't very important to have to dress with my child or when they're growing up .
so .
yeah ,
in the day .
no there isn't ,
there isn't any time ,
that's true .
None
there's just not enough time in the day to do anything good quality for them ,
that's really ,
okay .
i really haven't thought about the topic of drug testing .
just off the top of my head , i don't think i see much wrong with it .
yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
i also haven't thought too much about it .
i suspect it very much depends on the world .
huh-uh .
maybe .
there are some jobs where i guess it doesn't really ,
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
if it's not as simple then we just do not think it's a problem .
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
if it's a position where it could be able to , ]
that's true
i didn't think about that ,
like for instance ,
if ,
if you're working on heavy metal ,
right .
or say driving trucks or whatever they had the newspaper or something like that .
then that is something that the rolling is .
None
right .
None
i think ,
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
that maybe it's not necessary .
yeah ,
None
huh-uh .
it's just where society is right now ,
something we have to cope with
None
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
in that respect , i think it may help a lot .
i think it may be raised ways to use people from a new car ,
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
if they no , that ?
yeah ,
i think that may be .
if you use drugs , you won't get the job .
]
that means one of the points of it .
of course i'm not sure , what the time is ,
if i used drugs last week and i had a , job in a job who would have access to the day before or something
they wouldn't even see it .
you know , what i'm saying ?
yeah . ]
i don't know ,
they may not be able to fix it .
i don't know how far they are .
i don't know what the , are offering .
i don't know
that would actually be an interesting thing to find out , i think .
i don't actually know how long those things are in the same system .
i've heard some things will go around there for six months ,
some stay for less ,
some stay for trouble .
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
things like l s d , i guess , will be doing good .
]
in some ways ,
you get for me , for awhile .
really . ]
i guess so .
something like that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
there must be something ,
people get these little things here ,
so .
of some sort ,
i don't really know .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i don't use any drugs .
i don't really drink or anything ,
i'm pretty , i guess , about that ,
just the fact that since i don't use drugs , i have no problem with taking a test .
right .
if you actually used drugs at all ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i'm at most a social dealers ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
it's never a problem .
the only thing i would hate is if i were to go and ,
it's kind of the same thing with the church test .
if you don't have anything to hawaii , you're not going to mind it .
people that , ]
right .
don't have anything to hide .
there are some things that just aren't extremely well ,
right .
that , uh , i , i , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
that come out at that point
i think that a lot of people have trouble with that .
so .
i can understand that .
that's a fine line to draw .
huh-uh .
huh-uh .
that's really
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
do you worry about , this or that ,
what about the rights ,
huh-uh .
to privacy ,
what if they're doing something legal ,
they would rather have it private ,
right .
so .
right .
especially in the case of , uh .
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
so .
i took a steak once
i didn't mind it ,
i was just by some of the questions , i guess .
there was one question , do you like your mother ?
you know ?
i said , yes .
do you hate your mother ?
no .
have you ever killed your mother ?
i was going ,
those are just ,
yeah ,
what in the world .
those are to get the deficit value out of you .
just to see , ]
is that what it was ?
shock .
i'm a graduate student in texas .
okay .
we sort of , figure out ,
i know a little bit about that kind of stuff .
huh-uh .
what they're trying to do there is , they want to get a lot of line is losing you for ,
how is it that when you see these things
huh-uh .
so .
so .
kind of get something to my grandmother's at it .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
with them they have no idea if you're just sort of bored ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
around and being ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
maybe
it can be
so .
yeah
shock you .
they ask why i was going ,
what in the world are you asking me about here .
]
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i guess , i don't know , some people have probably killed their kids .
i don't know
yeah ,
i guess so ,
i guess , i don't know what actually if you have killed your mother
yeah
big jump there .
]
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
yeah ,
i think it's their way of saying how well you do ,
huh-uh .
in a shock situation without reading ,
huh-uh . ]
stuff like that .
]
i never thought about that ,
that makes me feel a little better
of course , that was years and years ago .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
]
yeah ,
i don't think that you killed your mother though ,
i wouldn't worry about that .
i don't think there are some people ,
in society a lot of people are taking drugs .
there is also people that are getting off and ready to do with their job with their lives .
they take a foot test or a drug test , or whatever ,
the stuff that happened to them , five years ago up next year
it turns their doctors for just for her a little better .
when they might be actually trying to ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
improve their lives .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
that's , it could be rough things back for them ,
huh-uh .
they could walk in and say , look , i did do drugs a year ago ,
huh-uh . ]
i'm off them for a year now .
huh-uh .
i'll be happy to take the test ,
it will show up positive .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
but ,
i would probably do that .
i would probably bring something in showing that i had to been such and such for intelligence trade and ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
whatever the twelve month program .
whatever it is that they do .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
although then , they can't afford it , uh , i think on the ground
huh-uh .
i don't really know .
i don't know what the laws are willing to this .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
my wife probably does .
i'm not sure what they are either .
i don't
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
it's an interesting topic that i never actually thought about it
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
the other day we had talked about , capital punishment .
i
i really , really hadn't thought about it .
i think about it because i hear about it ,
i hadn't had to sit down and say , what i do think about it
that's kind of like today .
i'm not real sure what i think about it .
i'm kind of , in the middle of that one .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
these are tough .
i sort of like that stuff ,
it makes you think .
huh-uh .
really ,
really .
i think that's real good .
okay .
it was very nice talking to you .
nice talking to you .
okay .
take care .
bye-bye .
bye-bye .
i think we pay too much in taxes .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
how about you ?
i think they waste what we pay .
excuse me ?
i think they waste all the money that we pay for
yeah ,
that's what i think too .
i don't know how you feel ,
we moved here from another state .
yeah ,
that particular state had an income tax , but not sales tax .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
here there's no ,
it's a heavy sales tax .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they get you coming and going .
now it's even higher in dallas county ,
so .
was it . ]
yeah ,
i know , it's just ,
it's eight and a quarter i think .
yeah ,
it is .
i was shocked .
i went ,
we bought a new orleans
the man said , and that's eight percent .
i said , eight percent . what
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's really kind of sad ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i don't know how , in terms of when you do all your own ,
it just seems like , if you're middle income , it seems like you get hit the worst .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
is that what you think ?
yeah ,
because at some point it goes up to the pound part
yeah ,
sometimes they have to pay even less taxes .
doesn't seem quite fair , does it ?
no ,
it isn't .
because they have the money to solve different things
i don't know , somehow get a ,
what ?
i thought you were going to say something .
huh-uh .
they somehow seem to get around these ,
the things that we can't ,
don't make that kind of money .
right .
i don't know .
if they're in business , and they're making money ,
i could see if they're losing money ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they're making money then they should pay taxes then .
i know ,
just somehow it doesn't seem ,
you
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i was reading about him in the paper i said , he was going to stop their kids .
he didn't look that stupid .
why didn't he pay his taxes ? ]
right .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
right .
uh-huh .
do you follow federal or whatever it tax ,
]
i just prefer federal income tax every year .
do you feel like you get hit by , too much ?
yeah ,
i just got older ,
i'm single now .
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
right now , we don't own any property .
we loved .
we're in the same ,
we don't have children ,
we're in the same kind of ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's not as bad as being single and our children ,
if you have like x point five bedrooms and you , kind of get rid of ,
it doesn't even pay for me to take a good meat , because ,
doesn't that sound stupid .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
right .
it's kind of hard .
uh-huh .
excuse me .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
right .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah otherwise you're just ,
if you have kids , you get seven hundred dollars or something like that
it's two thousand dollars .
it is .
yeah ,
for everybody .
my .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's not too bad .
then you get a child care of ,
it's not enough , you know .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
my goodness .
it's not even ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
i guess that's my call .
i guess i better go
okay .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
it was nice talking to you .
nice talking to you .
uh-huh ,
bye-bye .

place that needed this . ]
federal company ,

that's okay .
i guess it's an easy thing to do .
you have a big ,
do you have a house or what do you have ?
that's a ,
we have a big old motors that we've been .
those are beautiful .
it had been , of course , a little girl .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's a farm community ,
um .
yeah ,
is it a working machine
is it ?
ours is not a working farm
more ,
i can understand that ,
that's probably what i would ,
yeah ,
i have a garden
so .
we have a garden .
we don't farm .
yeah i can hear the accent now
i hear the western pennsylvania ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we lived in minneapolis for about five years .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we originally lived in dallas
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we met and got married actually in school area ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,

it's , near a little town called school ,
it's not going to any more .
yep ,
do you know offhand ?
yes ,
that's out near the airport .
that's about forty-five miles from us .
yeah ,
my brother has a home there he's trying to sell .
he's living now up in , plano
he ,
it's , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that ,
yeah ,
lived in march for a long time .
that's why we're not sure we want to , buy down here , because we lived up north long to pay the best , ]
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
in terms of housing down here , you really have your foot ,
it's just everything's becoming for the economy .
it's terrible .
and , uh , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
it really is ,
we're in a vicious town home ,
it's nine hundred a month .
i'm not surprised .
you know what ,
right ,
right .
right ,
right .
None
yeah ,
yeah ,
it's not good
no .
i mean , ]
the people think the income is really great in some of those areas
that's right .
yeah ,
they're , done up fairly nice ,
yeah
the town home we're in i , i don't know how , we ,
it's like a shame ,
a two by two they call it in like pittsburgh .
right ,
uh-huh ,
right . ]
it's nice
the girl bought it for a hundred and ten ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
now she can't sell it .
our neighbors ,
prices have come down on the homes , the ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they paid for denver .
my name's .
that's how bad it ,
i know .
i know in up the same thing i've been married ,
]
that's right .
people are responsible because they paid so much for their home .
uh-huh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i have some friends that live in and
it's really , really bad .
i mean you ,
we like our area .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's an old house and everything
where is maryland in minneapolis to get ,
we're moving to church to it
that's not too bad .
we're about a hundred miles from pittsburgh .
that's north .
yeah ,
it's really not that far .
are you going up toward ,
None
bye ,
north carolina .
you're not that far north then ,
okay .
no ,
no .
you're really not too bad .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
that you've ,
we've been here since seventy-four .
then you have ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
do you have a lot of land
so .
we have fifty acres .
my , uh , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
then .
pardon me ,
we have forty ,
we gave ten to one of our children
there you go .
did you have a hard time getting to go ,
do you feel like you live in an accident area
so .
no ,
not really ,
turn keep him closer and whatnot ,
yeah ,
i think that that's ,
i can remember in pittsburgh when ,
this has to do with homes ,
i can remember when i'm eating up until i was in
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
the justice of working ,
now it's a terrible storm .
yeah ,
it's ours up here .
we have ,
our justice system are real bad
that's okay ,
we live about ten miles from probably three or four not , um , big cheap but ,
they've , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that .
yeah ,
and , uh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
do you like living in an older home and like it that they did ?
yeah ,
we're tired of doing it though .
we don't want to do too much more
how big is it ?
how many square feet do you have ?
golly ,
i really .
how many rooms do you think ,
oh , yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we have , four rooms , and a storm , we have a female ,
we , have a half bath code , too .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
so .
a wood topic ,
yeah
i understand ,
we have that too .
yeah .
pardon ?
yeah .
it really isn't too big yet .
we li- ,
a lot of people say that
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's , uh , i , i , i , i don't know ,
we just like it real well
]
it's enough space for two people
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that .
yeah ,
we had five children ,
okay .
they've all moved on .
they're all out on their own now .
yeah ,
right .
that's okay .
we've got ,
this town house is pretty big .
it's about eighteen hundred square feet .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's got three bedrooms , two and a half baths it's really nice .
it sounds like a good buy .
yeah ,
it is ,
i would never buy it ,
snow it is fine .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's just again , the privacy ,
we had a house in minneapolis that was on three acres ,
uh-huh .
that makes a big difference .
right ,
near north , ohio ,
he said ,
he's getting me to not , not necessarily worry when we feel to be able to war more .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you really aren't aware because it's ,
the witnesses ,
None
right .
yet you can have your friends ,
you can have them in ,
you can go out .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you have more of a choice ,
you're not fond of by bad .
that's kind of what ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
it is too far south for me ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they have one of the ,
when they said depend on , i just guess it ,
that they retired to ,
they built one of these .
it's just beautiful .
]
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's like a dark , it's not like what i would think of when i think of old guard sandy .
it's frustrating
it's , uh , i , i , i , i don't know ,
more luxury .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
right ,
right ,
it's frustrating ,
it's beautiful ,
right ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that .
it's country it's
i don't ,
what else about housing except it's ,
bless housing economy , i think it's , it's own .

what mainly are they in ?
in the middle event area .
yeah ,
that's nice .
the one boy , the house has been higher is having the kids .
they didn't have to do much to it .
great .
the other one needs more work done .
it's twenty years old , i think .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they have two children , too ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they bought what they could afford .
that's , uh , i , i , i , i don't know ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
it's a beautiful home
so .
they are beautiful homes .
my brother lives ,
is it called or cafe ?
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
he lives all in that same area going from mount angeles ,
it's real pretty up there .
it's just ,
it is ,
it's real nice .

the violence are familiar

yeah ,
my
you do when you laugh .
when we first got married ,
my husband works for the state ,
we moved once a year usually
my goodness .
after they had to start paying to us ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that wasn't necessarily particularly wrong
that's what it is here ,
yeah ,
that's why we're at a point now we're going to
we have been married ten years or whatever
yeah ,

right , yeah ,
you have to stop some place ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
that's kind of like where we're ,
we're saying perhaps ,
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None

i disagree with that ,
but .
i do too ,
i've heard too many people say , i hate it here .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they buy a place
they just hate the area .
i know ,
the economy here in dallas , it's ,
it's still not going up .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i just laugh to buy it , if i know i'm not going to be there for at least five years ,
yeah ,
my brother , they're having trouble being in their home ,
i'm sure ,
yeah ,
there , you can go down a day ,
right ,
so .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
here , he told you this , every other house , if it's been on even large motors and really ,
it's hard to sell the .
people from c j d c is about new york , here at a couple of years ago .

oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
uh-uh . ]
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it would make you to see this .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
i mean it would probably be like your house on a , a half city in a block or something .
i couldn't handle that
yeah ,
i know ,
that's , uh , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that .
i can look outside right now and look into the next generation .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's across the way ,
it's so where i all with that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's still not that private .
None
yeah
you have a privilege .
i do get tired of that
i don't know ,
i don't think i'd want to change it .
no ,
your kids have ,
None
hello .
hi ,
i wear pants .
i'm a real small position
when i'm at home since ,
yeah ,
i wear a hundred percent of the time .
not a former ,
i guess pants and a former
in the summertime i wear recycled fish .
top shirt in
in the winter i wear , potatoes .
i like sweaters a lot .
i do that .
when i go out for williams then i will think eighty years , or a dress ,
i have a couple of months because you're in those real well in about this time ,
that's basically what i do .
i think our tastes are fairly similar ,
although i am i currently , i do tend to ,
i'm , a fan .
oh .
that age ,
i suppose , i could get away with extremely clothes ,
for the most part i don't .
i wear fairly independent way
right .
a hundred one of each sort of
None
that sounds nice .
right .
it said the seasons ,
do you change much through the season
so .
no ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
no ,
i tend to use the same things because our actually are very cold in summer .
i don't know whether they think by , them up somewhere , they can lay by the line during day or something .
maybe .
no .
you wear a heavy seed in your office ,
all summer .
right ,
yeah ,
i'm not a clothes in the sense that some of my friends that are .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
None
right .
yeah .
you know ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
then you ,
yeah .
i don't have the ability to just go out and buy , buy , anyway
right .
if i need something new , i will go and buy it .
basically i'm a pretty much the same
in the summertime i can wear the light
in the summertime i change to the sewing .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's not a whole lot of change for me either .
especially when i go to the fitness and wear the house
i enjoy that ,
it just wouldn't be , smart for me to do that in my home with my children .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i have to , think about things like that , too .
i have given relatives in that tour and letting things like that .
i don't know if they consider that a job .
i don't really get paid for that , because ,
when i do that i think then i become more conscious .
it doesn't really change my money's often .
exactly .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
you can look forward in a very estate car you could think , you know , for other things .
yeah ,
yeah ,
oh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i used to have a problem when i was working in a while i was in college and had to dress up and , uh , laid up and stuff like that , would just give me a terrible thing .
dear .
so .
that's not right .
right ,
right .
otherwise , i guess we're both pretty good
yeah ,
i guess so
it's been great talking to you .
okay .
have a great day .
have a good day .
bye .
bye-bye .
what do you think ?
this is about drug testing right ?
right .
yeah .
i do see this as something that we will take enough to be in that kind of thing .
yeah ,
i- , i , i don't know if i would have to do that , because i don't know if they were going to be a little bit more than that ,
uh-huh .
i was drug tested when i came to my job at here in the t i .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
i think it should be more by the private group .
how about you ?
yeah ,
i think that the should solve , do all that .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they should , have drug dealers before they hire your government
any time that an employee ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
yeah .
sure .
then they need to be watched *[[ slash units

oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
i agree with you .
None
this is why , drugs are the biggest problem , i think to face it today .
i mean it's what drives crime ,
it's remarkable automobile fuel has been in a lot of , in the world or whatever i think is , absolutely made up by drugs

None
i don't know .
right . ]
course , that might be up , people , when you go in and do your own education and , and sell it just because they can't work in that anymore ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
you got to have a safe work place .
that's all there is to it .
definitely ,
you're definitely right .
that , you can't have it any other way .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
in the case that you brought up , though ,
if it's a bedroom and he's working with the , and public a gun in his own even , if it's a guy at disney company a lot , i think , it's in dangerous to find a business .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
what do you think ,
what percentage of oil and , do you guess use a budget , you know , drug testing ?
i think it's more realistic now .
it's probably like forty , fifty percent .
really ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
because , all the jobs that i've seen in , except for some kind of drug abuse .

what kind of work are you in ?
i work at n .

i just do find money .
uh-huh ,
did they give you drug testing ?
not ,
they hired me in nineteen eighty-four

oh .
yeah . ]
okay .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
now they quit a newspaper about that , because of three months ago .
are they going to , begin , everyday or drug testing ?
not that i know of .
it was more about , all the other states .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they've been laying off a lot of people .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
None
sure .
family problems ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they kind of covered everything .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i know they have a lot of drug testing
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
what do you think about ,
something that kind of concerns me is , you know , and i are tested for taxes i do .
do you think there should be drug testing for political services ?
yes ,
i do .
yeah ,
i do , too .
because they're up .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
they talk against drugs they get caught ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
in missouri at washington .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
whether it's drugs or any other kind of ,
like the money you know all . that was drug related .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
that cost us , the country , lots of dollars .
sure ,
sure ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
so .
i would agree with you .
None
just doesn't make sense to worry about whether they're doing that they're concerned .
hi , you want to start ?
sure .
you don't use any credit cards , i don't imagine .
no .
of course i use ,
credit cards .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
i have a couple of credit cards and , use them .
uh-huh ,
do you use them a lot ?
we try not to .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we're on a pretty strict and tight budget .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
that's an idea ,
that's a thought ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yes ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
do you use credit cards just ?
my husband loves them
we do use them .
we try not to ,
he's one who jumped in that long ,
he uses them quite a bit .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
yeah ,
he likes that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
well that's a good thing , because of people don't pay at the end of the month they just pay the minimum pattern .
that's when you get into expenses .
yes ,
you get in over your head .
right .
it'll ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
say , i'm going to buy this when it's good and on sale
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
when i'm being paid .
right .
sometimes you do come on and that ,
it's really useful .
that's true .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
no ,
right .
how are the laws in pennsylvania , as not , the laws , but not the credit card , uh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
right .
yeah .
are they the same there ?
we , uh , we , we have a , uh , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a ,
yeah ,
we have the same thing up here ,
we don't deal where they do that
we go to places where they don't charge a lot .
some of them charge five cents a gallon , even ,
the gas stations get more ,
that's pretty well .
we just try to avoid , the ones that do that ,
yes .
we just don't , go there because there's enough other ones around that you charge you anything
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
extra to me , credit cards are the same as cash ,
to me they are , anyway ,
yes ,
because you make the time at the end of the time
right .
right ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
yes .
so that the end of the month or when you get your credit card bill are you saying that that you're way to never fall and giving and dry
yeah ,
right .
very good .
None
i can't say we never have .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
now we have , at , had trouble on our grandchildren ,
we try not to .
we try hard ,
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
right .
yeah .
right .
i think that there's a great deal to a credit card in those situations .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
because sometimes , there's times when you couldn't take advantage of something with a credit card you can .
so .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
do you have , credit cards ?
so .
do you find that fat
so .
i think we're pulling it down ,
like i said , my husband likes them ,
we have quite a few ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
right .
we're actually in the same boat .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we like to use three , an hour credit cards .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that way we're not registered
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we don't have an awful lot of expenses or how station it comes in the end of the month .
do you find that you get an awful lot of credit card ago through the mail ?
yes .
once a week ,
twice a week ,
three times a week .
it's not every week ,
you do get them .
they make it very safe .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
almost too much so .
i really don't like it the charges that ,
we try to look at that also ,
right ,
the actual dish .
right ,
right ,
what they charge per year to use our money , they're giving us to spend our money ,
i'm not real crazy about that ,
we try to look at that also .
yes ,
uh-huh ,
right .
yeah ,
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
miss , we should be in business in the world .
good .
did you hear the questions that the most mothers , brought up ?
yes .
such as how much time ,
i'll ask ,
how much time do you spend with your children ,
how many do you have ?
we have two children ,
they're both grown and married
we have ,
our daughter has three sons ,
yeah .
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we also knock quite a bit .
we're a fairly unit right .
we're together a lot on the video than
of course , with the holidays and everything .
you're very fortunate .
my , uh , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i have two girls and a son ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
my oldest daughter lives in , ohio ,
oh .
her husband teaches minutes ,
it's kind of hard for us to visit with them , as much as i'd like to .
yes .
because one thing we do have done is we're both eastern countries .
i play in several dakota now
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
she is a concert , it's ,
oh .
and around here a lot of five minutes .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
her husband added really in ,
which are kind of alive ,
yes , uh-huh .
that's why they're over there .
i have a son who lives in , in , pennsylvania .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i get to see him once maybe every three months .
we've lost ,
None
young , my youngest daughter lives in dallas ,
you don't get to see any of yours very often .
i don't hardly get to see any of them .
she works in these , type of sudden ,
she and her husband both do .
yes ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
plays and things that go on .
anyhow
yeah .
most of the time ,
right now it's football season ,
our daughter is a big cowboy fan ,
as is our husband ,
my husband ,
she loves that
i play with the grandchildren
i enjoy the grandchildren .
like last weekend , there's the soviet union out there in texas ,
it ends ,
oh .
in january ,
she and the three boys and my husband and i went over into fort worth to see the space
this sunday ,
the soviet space they ?
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
my goodness .
yeah
]
i am surprised they would bring them down there for ,
it's been here for quite , some time .
i think it came here in either category or something
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's very interesting ,
i'll bet .
it's been very well done
right .
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
when our house wasn't , we have a pool ,
he was his wife and come a lot of their friends ,
we have opportunities on sunday
that sounds like you have really , wonderful activities that you keep together .

we like being with our kids ,

uh-huh .
doesn't it ?
it does
i'm worried about christmas .
christmas stuff they pass all through ,
they all end up having the night christmas night christmas , so that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
beautiful .
yeah .
they're all ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
with us ,
uh-huh .
we see a lot of them .
we enjoy christmas eve because , i would say they're all pretty close about eleven o'clock ,
yeah ,
morning ,
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i go to the kitchen and cook ,
my sister and her husband are coming down ,
there's going to be eleven of us for christmas .
that's great .
there's a ,
yeah .
you seem to be making out all right .

sometimes i'm a little student
tell me ,
uh-huh .
i think the teachers are going back to spending more time with families .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i think parents are definitely , spending more and more time .
i don't think they're leaving them with ,
yes .
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
seems like it went through a restaurant where we weren't that big children a lot .
parents kind of went and did their own stuff ,
kids did their thing .
that's
no ,
]
that's exactly what i was going to say .
yes ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
of course , i find now that i spend more time with my grandchildren in my hands .
i know more about them and watch their minds and how they think and learn much more than so many kids .
yeah .
you go ahead and do your thing
so .
okay .
do you have any children ?
yes ,
i have a daughter .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i don't any children
i'm going to have difficulty with this topic .
okay .
what kinds of things do you and your family do ?
we go out and fly fishing
we go fishing .
]
we go to movies
we go out to the farm .
uh-huh . ]
she likes to pick flowers and look at all .
None
i don't see a lot of families fishing and doing things like that .
that's great .
i'm divorced ,
when she's on me what we do .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
we color a lot
i read her plants .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's great .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
i think a lot of families now , they probably don't spend enough time together .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
whether their parents are together or not yet they don't spend enough time together
None
None
i think that when you spend a lot of time with each other you a lot .
the correct might have shot your family .
uh-huh
even when i was , living with her with stuff then did that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
]
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
to me that's pretty challenging .
yeah ,
i know .
i like that .
yeah .
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's good sometimes because you need to , get away .
i don't think you should spend too much time outside at the end of usually the family unit .
yeah ,
that's right .
then you never get to know them either .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they're all grown up
their , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
as i understand it ,
i don't know ,
i haven't experienced it ,
]
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
kids these days are growing up so much more . ]
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
once they hit ten or eleven or twelve , you know , almost eight years old
yeah ,
they're out doing stuff by that time .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
i really do because i don't see many kids
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
not usually on the weekends we don't see very many in it .
yeah .
what kinds of things do you think ?
i think they can turn off the t v for one thing .
yeah ,
that's true .
and go out and do stuff ,
]
she always likes to do things whenever the t v off .
she'll forget about the t v too .
i think that's the first thing a lot of people do
i know i'm guilty of it .
i came in from work today
first thing i did turn the bike on them .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
because i was the fat from this night today .
right .
i like to watch w
i think that's that is a big problem .
it's too rich ,
it's something that you can do
there's no name that's , no choice ,
i think that's another reason why people are , so much right now is because it's very strict a lot whose justice system .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
people aren't doing anything just sitting around , no matter something
i think people are trying to get out of that .
at least
there's a lot of
it's becoming really good conscious
yeah .
that's probably good ,
None
yes ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
when she was here last summer she played her
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
when , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that .
how old is she ?
she's five .
she has ,
we just been hitting the ball on the ground .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
she can't hit it in the air force ,
then we walk the ball .
we play like soccer .
you've still have a lot of time before she gets up in years
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's good .
that's good .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
okay .
it was very nice talking to you .
nice talking to you .
okay .
okay .
bye-bye .
bye-bye .
you like to fish ,
yeah ,
i like to ,
i don't have a boat ,
i like to fish
there's a lot of lakes around here .
are there many lakes up there ?
yeah ,
actually there are quite a bit of lakes around me .
we have the great lakes ,
nowadays ,
lake springs is right near here .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we're in what's called the lake market of new york
where there're lots of small ones there
these are , real good , for , bass fishing and so forth .
they have mostly small vegetables in there
so .
no ,
we have actually quite a lot of variety .
there's , uh , i think , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
we have large mouth , small mouth , sort of , gory , stuff like that .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
all sorts of fun stuff like that .
we have a pretty large bass tournament just depends in general place on this lake .
yeah ,
that's right ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's , a lot of fun .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
how about you ?
what do you like to go for ?
it's , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i fish for h m ,
i hardly ever catch one ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
they have a message over in lake in the war they can pick up the refrigerator and everything , they try up the basement ,
you catch that white beef and crafts out of there .
so .
every once in a while would be known .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
right .
right .
usually you pull up , this old to have nine months .
wow .
yeah ,
it's a real enjoyable experience to go there and catch him in that , uh , lower up
]
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
during europe is well , you know , the wind up a lot of ,
probably during christmas season the will take care in the old ,
what they'll do is m- ,
you'll be sort of boating around ,
these people own a little bit later ,
they'll be elected around
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
they just keep it in .
they can't pull it in fast enough .
what do you catch eggs on ?
uh , i , i , i , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , because i don't know if they were going to be a lot of people that are going to be able to do that .
according to them , when the expense are running , you can get them on just about them .
huh .
they tend to use , i guess or female or some kind of stuff ,
i've ,
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they'll ,
corn or thirty-five or anything , uh ,
they'll hit out of these just sort of , uh , high school system .
yeah ,
it's ,
sometimes i use her ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
it's a big problem .
yeah ,
the other day i was fishing with bread ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
there's a college across the street ,
None
so .
it's huge ,
its dad's was full of them .
wow .
he was in a bad way .
it's ,
he was fast .
he ,
a big one ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
it's , it was sixteen years old .
that's a nice size .
yeah ,
i think it was about a pound and a half ,
all they're good for is the fight .
boy they really don't want to come out of the water
they automatically write through the water ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
it wasn't hooked very well .
i got it that far ,
i figured that ,
that counts .
yeah ,
that's what i said .
that's what i told the guy .
the guy was standing there
he laughed when it fell off
i said , that's a quick area , right there .
do you actually like the taste of f- ,
do you , eat the fish that you get to ?
are you more of a sport like ?
yep , yeah .
i haven't learned anything else ,
there's some ,
my dad has a farm
there's ,
he has two acres up there
my uncle has a minivan
there's a lot of vegetables in there now .
i think he's the only one that's , that's caught a big deal to eat .
uh-huh .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
right ,
you can just ,
i don't actually like fish .
it's sort of ,
when i fish , it's more for enjoyable than anything else .
yeah ,
if , uh , i think , uh , i think , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
right .
yeah ,
be careful you don't get .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
yeah ,
i know it .
have you ever tried , get italian fishing ,
not yet .
my brother went off the coast of the street ,
when the ,
i don't know ,
what they ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
that school system is that ?
it's
he said that it was just like that .
they were throwing hell or , some people that are sort of like a bottle system
each time they bring them in at least if they have one ,
sometimes they've had one on your hook .
yeah ,
i was out in florida with a friend of a while
yeah .
we just drove it down there
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
the transmission had , some kind of the boat in the wall drives us and put a care of the trees
you just keep it in it ,
you get one or two at a shot ,
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
it's a good deal , too .
it was a , like twenty dollars for six hours of fishing in some big bus boat .
wow .
yeah .
yeah ,
down here it's like two hundred dollars a day .
this is ,
yeah ,
this was for a , large ,
a group party .
there were maybe thirty of us on the boat .
we weren't all related , just , thirty people off the shop in the boat there .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
if you want to go on a boat , it's like two hundred dollars a day .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
this is great , because i think it was nineteen dollars for five dollars and twenty dollars for six hours or something .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
yeah ,
it's really nice
it's real enjoyable .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i don't know if it's been five minutes yet or not .
i think we're probably close , though .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
it's nice talking to you .
nice talking to you , too .
good luck with fishing this season .
good luck .
bye-bye .
bye-bye .
like in a room sign with what you think about the benefits in your jobs ?
i'm relatively satisfied with the benefits i have .
i think that , our health insurance is extremely expensive .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i'd rather be we got a bit more coverage for a lot more than the money .
that's my major fault , i guess .
what about you ?
yeah ,
yeah .
that leaves you pay for all of it .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
maybe that it's not what should be covered and what is that .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
right
yeah ,
]
the health insurance i have is met life ,
if , uh , i think , uh , i think , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
it's the type that if you go to a certain character then , you just pay ten dollars
the insurance pays the rest of the bill .
if you go outside you get , thirty thousand dollars .
i see .
now we ,
i have just the regular insurance so that it's really covered in our lawn
uh-huh .
they have what they consider a problem for the area where the children is based on your act on voting .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
recently , when we had a pet , they didn't pay the quality for us because we paid a lot of water
when i called they said , oh , well , that's your doctor is more available to the united states for the area .
None
right .
they're probably doing it to their benefit , though .
so .
yeah ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's difficult .
what about other benefits ?
are there others that you're with ?
i work for washington ,
that's about the only real benefit you have , is going to health insurance .
you have vacation ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
everybody gets wrong .
t i and some other places , they have a new machine ,
they have a driving bit nicer , we had one
huh .
i think they even have a swimming pool i don't know if they have any damage their vehicles or anything like that .
yeah ,
i'm not familiar with that sort of thing ,
to me vacation is an issue ,
different places have different kinds of vacation , i would assume .
right .
the with fact and they let you take testing for , um , perhaps , i know , i suppose , sick .
some places count the number of hours
some places just sort of believe you .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
ours is based on number of days ,
yeah .
right .
right .
otherwise , i'm not aware of any problems with the benefits around here
maybe that covers the topic then .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
None
some places aren't very safe to work .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
no .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
right ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i suppose some places are more about that others than that .
yeah ,
i think so .
maybe i'm french or something like that ,
how they are northern exposure .
uh-huh
other than that i don't have much feeling for the benefits ,
since , like i said , i don't have a big problem with them .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
yeah .
None
i didn't know that somebody could avoid her and garden .
they still have to pay it
they buy their own instead of going through the state .
i see .
apparently it costs more than that .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
i would think they would get a much famous show
that people would be able to
working for them . ]
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
that's what i think
they should be able to judge their benefits on how many friends are their life
how much they're called
instead of trying to cut everything down there ?
uh-huh .
right . ]
sure , the sales is lower that way ,
i would assume that the fact is going down , also .
yeah ,
the future and the training costs ,
if they have to train a new year's shop in texas , i don't see how they can do money .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
once they once they get good somebody , they want to hang in them .
that's right .
no ,
i agree .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
it was nice talking to you .
thank you for calling .
bye-bye .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
bye-bye
like a room filled with that .
bye-bye .
all right .
she lives in utah ,
so .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's the way we always were .
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
i guess we're going to talk about children today .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
let's do i- ,
you ready ?
my children are all gone .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they're all out on their own .
do you want to start first
okay .
do you work ?
no ,
i don't ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i stay home most of the time
i know that it's very difficult to find good help when we want your children to be taken care of .
right .
there's a ,
my neighbor she has gone too much
there's a big threat whether they can have , to have a law to have them to be an automatic ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
right .
there's cake and they are totally on one of these things that they were , then you kind of know that they had to go through some kind of work ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
or some kind of something to , get an expert can really .
yeah ,
most of the problems we hear ,
yeah ,
that's right .
that's right .
uh-huh .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
the individual or something .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
usually when i have someone tend ,
my oldest tends to me now if i go for him
so .
uh-huh ,
how old ,
before ,
is your oldest ?
he's almost a lot
he's plenty big enough then
yeah ,
he's very good .
before that i would use , kids from our church ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they did a good job ,
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
for me .
i've never had to leave them in a day care center ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
or anything ,
i've been very lucky just be able to stay home .
that's the way with me .
i worked four years one time ,
my last two children were both , a big high school age .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they were , of course , gone while i was working
it wasn't a problem i saw ,
i stayed home the rest of the time .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
i didn't have that problem either .
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
my oldest daughter she has two children
they've been in day care ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
she works full time .
yeah ,
that's hard .
it's difficult
huh-uh .
some people aren't .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
she surprised me though .
yeah .
is that right ?
yeah .
i think that's really important .
they've used the day care of the most time .
they tried one once .
they had a lady come in .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
it did not work out at all .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
she thought it was going to .
yeah .
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
in the morning ,
the lady called
her baby wasn't very old at the time and she said was having them .
yeah ,
she was having problems with her ,
None
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
my daughter decided to call them and check
things weren't okay
oh .
her one son was watching the lights
which she doesn't allow them to watch the newspaper .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
dear .
the baby-sitter was in the kitchen with her baby .
oh .
that ended up ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
alright ,
she was most upset , over this way .
yeah ,
i bet .
they kind of decided that had the day care was better .
there's , uh , i think , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
more people involved ,
more than one grade , they ,
the age groups are changing now .
]
bye-bye .
i know that at day care they have more of a sequel like maybe in ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
jeez would have where they have lessons and ,
yes ,
so forth ,
story time ,
and so on .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
this one has been particularly nice .
it kept track of what they did ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they would tell the parents what they did that day .
if they said anything or did anything .
it kind of kept them ,
gave you an idea of what your child ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
was disappointed in or doing .
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
right .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
they wouldn't have nothing to worry about ,
if there was a problem they would be i think more ready to tell you what it was .
i think so , because if they were still there , they might not have ,
they may not say anything .
right ,
right .
yeah .
you can't really .
you can't really unless your child would be old enough to say something ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
usually they aren't at that age .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
]
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it would be real difficult to find one and decide .
i know about three years ago i don't have children .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i wondered if i would have to be able to
whether they'd just bring them
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we got to where , we were just friends
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they said , no , don't do that , maybe we bring them to just .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
if there was a problem
we'd sit down ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and talk about it
it never happened ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
to be a problem ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
things worked out okay ,
their kids played with my kids
it worked out well .
it worked out good .
i've decided i'm going to visit my two weeks .
oh .
since they'll be going back at the end of the month .
so .
that's great .
i'm going to give it a try .
i sell sporting and whatnot ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i've got that worked out .
my husband , he's retired
he's going to buy my products
i'll do my dad's and that by phone .
that will be great .
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i'll be able to keep that up a little bit .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i think i'll enjoy doing ,
i bet you'll have some great experiences with them .
yeah ,
i think i'll enjoy .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i guess i kind of miss having a baby in
a kid around or something
sure ,
why not .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
uh-huh .
right .
that's right
]
they do say you enjoy them more ,
that's right .
yeah .
my husband's mother lives right over here ,
she takes care of them sometimes ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
for me ,
just is a lovely lady ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i've always noticed when you build them up .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
my daughter ,
so .
oh
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,

the ones that complain a lot are the first
i know they have a waiting list and a lot of women on birth .
i've lost track .
i don't really know .
i do have some opinions ,
go ahead .
yeah ,
None
so .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
i hadn't thought about that ,
what all do you know about it ?
i just have an opinion ,
i thought the dog was causing that ,
there was nothing over here .
in fact even ,
this is not our subject , i guess ,
maybe it is or isn't , i suppose .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
my wife when she talked about the middle east
None
i told her , no ,
it's just not going to happen .
there's not going to be any italian restaurant for them ,
there wasn't ,
they just didn't have an organization ,
i'm concerned that we don't have enough money .
i think that , the diesel rules that we've seen in here
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
the last ,
right .
that's right .
None
this guy's line is go out of all of these days .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i don't even know what our policy are .
None
i always thought that we did ,
i don't know what they are right now .
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
the , ]
None
None
yeah . ]
because we ,
it's almost the same thing from canada , because a lot of them are put out of business in the vietnam war ,
so .
i do have some remodeling with ,
of course we have this big mexican problem ,
not a problem ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
i don't know what the answer is ,
i'm amazed how you can , that they want to come over here
None
if they have jobs , i hear the one that they're taking away the two jobs .
i don't know ,
i don't know how many american people now they are really taking away .
right .
i'm wondering ,
i don't have an answer .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i think that we should have good reputation with him ,
that's not really exactly common .
it is
it isn't .
i don't know to what degree we went to the people who come across before they're ,
None
although , the idea of education is the biggest thing to get in a lot of world .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i guess it's what they ,
the mexican kids get a good education along the way ,
maybe that's a benefit to everybody ,
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
like you said , a lot of ,
i run into people every day that can't speak english .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
most of them , are working in terms of running
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
that , uh , i , i , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , because i don't know if they have to do that , you know , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
i don't know ,
like you said , i don't know how much they were from the world work ,
yeah ,
i never thought that they were much .
i do remember when i hear some of the problems we've had .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
of course you mentioned the n .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
that is a shame that we have this big board of mexico ,
in europe , they speak my husband's and all the things
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we don't really even make an effort to speak in colorado ,
i feel bad about that
go ahead .
that's ,
i
yeah
i took spanish in school ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
that's , one reason that i did it is because then you beat this fall out , the more and more people think there .
yeah ,
i guess it's never too late .
i do have some smoking books ,
i've always ,
right .
i don't know if it's costing us any money
how much money they're putting into it ,
that's always a factor ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
it's basically on the ,
i think it's mostly toward the end of the country ,
it's more ,
the immigration is tied in with , drug testing .
they have to watch out who comes in ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
uh-huh .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
yeah .
yeah ,
i think that certainly is a problem .
None
they , didn't say to talk about that ,
that is ,
on math groups , they ,
you know they're going and that can make it a national unit .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that certainly was interesting ,
since all of us had , that was the way over that way .
not all ,
None
a lot of us have grandparents ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
that's right .
]
we all kno- , one way or another ,
we certainly are , coming from europe .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
those were laws are unusual .
yeah ,
then they'll catch the back home
that leaves the children without any parents .
yeah ,
i don't understand , whose rule is that , too .
they just follow the rule quite a bit ,
that doesn't seem to fair to the children .
yeah , ]
yeah ,
yeah ,
right .
that's a law doesn't sound like it makes any sense at all that you would do it that way .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you would think they could at least get a visa or something , until they get , you know .
i'm sure they want to .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
they figured them could if they could allow him by three years .
i heard something about that , yeah .
a lot of them had been ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
some of them moved back and forth ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
most of them don't ever want to go back to mexico ,
no .
especially the way it was then .
no ,
you could see why .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i don't know how much immigration we have from europe and everything .
what the trends are .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
None
most of them have mandatory opportunities .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
i guess you can get work easily wait ,
as long , it's like
it's a kind of a bad example ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
yeah ,
really ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
so that ,
that's the thing with the jobs .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
of course no one beat him .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
he just brings his own career ,
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
yeah
yeah ,
None
yeah .
i guess now is it
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
maybe not ,
maybe immigration from europe to here will be , change ,
maybe it'll even know like trade ,
so many people will choose here at the year two hundred ,
so many of the people will go back to say .
maybe it will average out ,
i don't know .
yeah ,
i think so .
it doesn't seem so far .
there are other job sharing ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
in europe that there aren't here even ,
like players could find a job going through when they've done when they took one of our life .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i'm a christian program .
are you a teacher ?
no ,
i don't any more .
i just went to school
i was a music major for a while .
really ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
i had a substitute teacher that played in the city they mentioned the year .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
he had to have a local paper there .
oh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i think , three of the three other people in the local end of college are from this morning .
really .
i think i don't know , one of the worst from me is from a new coast .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's like any other symphony .
yeah
trained from mexico
he had to ,
i haven't really lived in a lot of big cities .
i'm living in dallas now .
plano is outside of dallas ,
i don't really have a lot of experience with air pollution .
huh-uh .
None
huh-uh .
None
huh-uh .
there would be just , dry one up for front of them ,
huh-uh .
into the air
it always seemed really bad .
None
what have you got up there ?
i live out in the country ,
huh-uh .
that part is good .
we're maybe one hundred miles from pittsburgh ,
which has a lot of pollution from their plants ,
huh-uh .
right now in our area were fighting to collect a lot of maintenance reports .
no .
it won't be too from where we have . ]
yeah .
we don't want one any place
sure .
None
]
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
it's just so bad that there is so much going to be air force
huh-uh .
the little bit there that you say there are in there and , and everywhere , it all comes up . ]
huh-uh .
all the problems in the middle east .
with all that smoke and ,
that has to be terrible over there .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
it's just , why are we doing this to death
huh-uh .
i just don't know ,
uh-huh .
huh-uh .
is that there would be houses and people go home just pretty good to it .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
between the minute and the oil , i would see a guy in background>> .
huh-uh .
you just thought , it's that there's a lot of the kids that are in the air force ,
what comes up , must come down
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
we're qualified it all the time .
yes .
how , if they have all of those ,
yeah ,
here you are living
huh-uh
that just doesn't make too much sense .
no .
i figure we're paying to take care of this country , some significant problems is it .
]
huh-uh .
they have been , some of the gangs have been real good at , at least in the middle amount , they have that they have ,
huh-uh .
they've collected some of it ,
it can be recycled , a lot of their things ,
huh-uh .
uh-huh .
huh-uh .
once they get started , it turns them in the time ,
it cuts down on the end that i've seen it has to be able to find some other way .
huh-uh .
if they would all ,
that's what we want done .
None
individual companies and things are so independent ,
huh-uh .
their roommate a hundred dollars to be one of them
they don't care about the soviet union ,
huh-uh .
that they make .
they're nearly .
it's money , is what is .
it's the money
yes .
they're making fantastic lines on the things that
even the size , the money and the income that they're going to make off this , is , just unreal .
huh-uh .
yeah ,
we've never been ,
we went as far as , civil rights ,
huh-uh .
and yellow park there ,
huh-uh .
we should have gone the whole way over ,
we didn't .
i understand that ,
we have an aunt that lives out there
so .
huh-uh .
when she was visiting here , she would look at the school and just
yeah .
huh-uh .
yeah .
huh-uh .
because of the house and everything .
that's so awful .
what about in new york .
i guess you've gone that way , maybe .
no .
never been in new york
i don't want to go there
pretty funny .
have you been there ?
i've been to new york .
i have relatives that direction .

we have ,
it's ,
where you are ]
is it close to , pennsylvania , ]
no ,
i never heard of that one .
i have family there
so .
we're near pittsburgh , university .

it's pretty neat .
it's kind of relaxing on b m .
that's beautiful country up that way .
i know ,
it's , very reliable and ,

back in the east .
it's really ,
you sound very young . ]
are you a young person ?
i'm sorry .
uh .
you're young
seems kind of old to me .
no ,
you're young .
you have a lot of life yet ,

None
huh-uh .
older people ,
they think they're far away from having things ,
huh-uh .
that it's ,
they don't realize these things are going to be able to ,
if you're older it's not going to you that way you .
you have grandchildren ,
you have children ,
yes .
uh-uh , whatever , some , friends .
everybody is going to be doing it by .
that's really true .
we all , need to be willing to help a little bit ,
i've heard some people , about , their cars who have their minds tests ,
huh-uh .
and things ,
how it's more expensive and things .
huh-uh .
i thought , it's so much better .
they say it has really made a difference , though .
huh-uh .
we don't have that here , yet .
you don't .
no ,
we don't have that testing in that down here , yet .
huh-uh .
uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
None
huh-uh .
that it has made a difference .
i really think it must .
i think every ,
what about how many recipes there are .
huh-uh .
huh-uh .
each is putting out ,
we have a car ,
one of our cars is an older car ,
huh-uh .
right .
huh-uh .
on the trim ,
huh-uh .
you know that is a sign .
something is coming out ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
all cars are doing that .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
it's really noisy the air .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
if you have to put a price on it . which is more realistic , or something without a little more .
huh-uh .
it's causing of the kind of real competitive stuff like ,
huh-uh .
and things ,
huh-uh .
we sure wouldn't want ,
huh-uh .
so much more people recommend from that .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
like i said , i think you have to pay for it no matter what you do with it , because it's industry .
we're paying industry to make the jury
so .
huh-uh .
None
huh-uh .
medium wise .
then , we have to pay for them to pay somebody to carry it together ,
then they put it in the dump some place
they find out , this doesn't dump work
we have to clean this up and move it back or something else .
we end up paying for it again .
now we're going to end up paying for it again by having it in colorado and such a different .
huh-uh .
we're paying to have our air conditioning and our water pump track .
pretty sad .
the , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
the one area they want to put the area is the right in the middle of the two water that range murders .
no .
it just our mind that they need so can even consider it , because there ,
huh-uh .
if that water gets fat , it would go on to down to school .
it will ,
it feels so many people .
huh-uh .
uh-huh .
no .
no .
it's scary

it's scary .
it really is .

it's really awful .

it is really a concern .
huh-uh .

thank you .
huh-uh .
bye-bye .

uh-huh ,
i have got two .

this is my first year of staying home .
i've always had them in child care .
then you are familiar with it ?
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
i have grandchildren
i know , two of them have gone to preschool .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i know what the experience my daughter has owned that with .
why don't you tell me what you have found .
the , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
yeah ,
i felt that i need to move on with them
i found another baby-sitter
she was wonderful
bye .
it just seemed like it was so hard to find , really good child care .
she was wonderful ,
it's just that i felt there that were too many in the home .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
]
it was in home child care .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
it was in home child care .
you took them to her home ?
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
both times ?
uh-huh ,
right .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i worked in the child care centers
None
i just always had a fear about , child care centers .
that's why i put them in home day care . ]
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh . ]
i just decided that i was just a lot of their friends that they were so much
None
i just decided it was probably best to just stay home for a while they were a little more , uh , national
i could go back to work .
i know that in raising my children , i was fortunate ,
i didn't have to work ,
we didn't necessarily have a lot of things
yeah
that's how it's going now .
i know my daughter ,
she has three
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that is a lot of money . ]
it's so expensive .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
you have to really make a lot of money .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
uh-huh .
no ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i know that one of the day hand it's a boat , it's not , she was not at all happy with .
there was too many children per se .
they were just kind of left to play ,
there was no structure to ,
the middle grade there were a lot earlier .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
not just there ,
i think he went , five mornings a week , if i remember .
wow .
it was supposed to be a base ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
starting to learn the colors and learning to have children to sell with everything that he went to , and school ,
she was most of it with .
so .
there was no name ,
there was nothing to it .
yeah .
it was like a little kindergarten .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they had hot prices
they had classes that , one class they'd do .
they even lower you with the children .
oh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it was really a very excellent one .
how old was he ?
he's now five and a half .
he's in kindergarten .
oh .
this was last year .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
the church or nine now .
oh .
the big one
it was a excellent ,
uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
very good .
my little boy goes to the , in garland ,
does he ?
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i'm real happy with that one .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
i've heard that the ones are excellent .
really ?
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i just assumed that most likely , going , by dallas , there , that they were good .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i didn't know that ,
i'm not that familiar .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i just know that , first in the middle of richardson was just a great program .
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
this is first in terms of garland that he goes to
i'm real happy with that .
yeah ,
it's a pretty good size church , too , isn't it ?
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
so .
that's a ,
are you enjoying staying home ?
yes ,
i am
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
i really enjoyed it ,
it was taking a lot of my time
i noticed i was spending less and less time with them
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it just seemed like they were sick more often i just couldn't get the time to get off ,
so .
yeah ,
it is .
None
it really is .
and have teenagers .
yeah ,
it really is .
i felt ,
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
None
it's hard to say .
yeah .
what do you think ?
you talked about , fifteen years .
yeah ,
i think probably the greatest cause is , uh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
especially around whatever .
do you live right in the city itself ?
no ,
i'm more out in the suburbs ,
i certainly work near a city .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
how about you ?
can you notice ,
it's ,
i live in a rural area .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's mainly because , no , the worst things .
ye- , huh ,
i live in arlington .
i see .
it's in the north ,
i live in the , down here they made
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
where t v says is ,
there isn't a lot of heavy industry .
there's the mud
we get an indoor ,
yeah .
we'll pick up that .
i've noticed over the past , maybe like five years or six ,
we live about twenty miles from the rain ,
i notice that the fly classes now of the ground are getting more ,
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it seems like , we're all that took all that .
i'm not sure if it's or what i think that's .
other than that , we don't have the ability to .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
from the power plants .
you mean from the same .
yeah ,
yeah ,
we don't ,
right .
so .
keep weights .
there doesn't seem to be much software for the kids ,
i'm not sure about the rest of the country .
yeah ,
i notice a major problem is a lot .
it's interesting
None
people get up ,
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
is that right ?
yeah ,
people get up in the morning that in general
they've got this black on their cars ,
which , seems to be ,
yeah ,
tell , humid ,
yeah ,
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
there must be , some of the , their quiet ones around , uh , three hundred dollars .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we've got elected that ,
None
right .
the victim , for ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they do that at night too , because ,
right .
employees .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
you're right ,
they could do something about that , i guess .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
that seems a little ridiculous .
how are your lakes ,
so .
they've been getting rid of .
they have ?
sure .
yeah ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
how's rain ,
yeah ,
that's what i was ,
yeah ,
ye- ,
i'm not an accountant .
yeah ,
no .
didn't they just have an article , on ,
they were missing busy .
so .
into new york they ,
i haven't read that .
over huge areas ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
they thought that was more beneficial because , some of it does have been in
some of it runs off right away from the grocery and eighties
some of the fish were supposedly at a lot .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i can't remember where
i read that recently somewhere ,
i can't remember where .
yeah ,
that's true ,
i thought it was up there .
that's interesting because new york ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and parts of tomatoes , they showed lots of plastics around weekends that they don't allow to the rain .
so .
you kind of think it's something else then ?
that's what the trends were in this case .
that , uh , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that .
they didn't say what though ,
they just said they thought it was ,
they didn't say what ,
yeah .
natural tired ,
yeah ,
it's less than clear .
like i said , i don't remember the judicial system that's that .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
i don't know ,
what do you think we can , i guess as as they say as a group , do you think about air pollution ?
we can share , more efficient interests for the family thing .
i still think that's , one of our major rights of raising people .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
yeah ,
None
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
if you can get those types of stuff .
do you really think that new vehicles is a lot big problem .
i remember reading an article that was just , uh , the older hand ,
the twelve and fifteen year old cars , which is ninety ,
yeah ,
of the pollution rate
the new cars is , hardly anything .
yeah ,
they're better ,
how about all the politicians and all that are out there .
when was the last time you saw a truck that didn't , smoke ,
yeah ,
doesn't that just mean they're out of coming .
i'm not really sure .
you think that the industry is really put that , that , they wouldn't have the ,
fuel is one of their biggest problems .
right .
you would ,
diesel engines .
yeah ,
diesel engines .
it ,
they do give a lot of vegetables
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
None
yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
None
yeah ,
only because we got to used , single , person , single car ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
driving .
a lot of people don't even like to see .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we could that .
that'll help ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
air pollution ,
the , united states and canada is , going into , some types of meal to do , keeping out what's being concerned by their plants ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
yeah ,
sure .
that's helping .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
that's an idea .
None
None
you just buy one of these things
it ,
yeah .
the less you can the wind that the doors
None
you couldn't start your car anymore .
that's an interesting concept .
is that your idea ?
yeah ,
it's , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i guess the difficulty would be that somebody could just take everything right off the window of us again
you probably would have to build it right into the mornings or something .
i was going to say ,
right .
it could be like a blessing in a larger .
right .
i guess you could take those off too
so .
you could take ca- ,
yeah .
yeah ,
if you can take a deck off and only do ,
not unless it was built into every semester .
right .
that's
None
None
that's quite a challenge .
you should , i think that , or i think ,
yeah ,
ye- it ,
that's a good idea .
if you could come up with a whole thing that's the same thing .
right .
it shouldn't be too hard to do something like that .
that's a good movie .
no ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you're right
that will be , a lot of problems .
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
a lawyer to , i guess the original penalty ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
the rap rules or anything .
you might , but some of the stuff ,
you might follow some interest in it .
that's a good idea .
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
what are your music ?

i've never played an article in my life ,
i've always wanted too ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i've always noticed the parents want me to bring me through the car or something ,
yeah
so .
i was one of the forced ones
i could never do that ,
None
i was never that true
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,

but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that .
it's not exciting at all
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that .
it doesn't give you faster ,
you can't blame it to ,
you can't do anything to it
right .
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that .
i like music too . like the ,

so .
no ,
i never have
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
those go back quite a way
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
None
it's hard to ,
my mother and dad use to , uh , a car there
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
they had a , of course , of the restaurant , in the morning ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
that wou- ,
that's neat .
yeah ,
that would be great if they weren't too much out ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
at the time .
of course , there's not a whole lot of market for nineteen m p r s .
is there not ?
you'd think there would be .
uh-huh .
that's true .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
you have to have that , particular kind of they call ,
just won't play on a day , on this evening .
that's a shame we go to solve a lot of women
you see soy ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
a lot at record stores ,
you'd ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
think that'd be a market for ,
i'm sure you could find old players for them .
that would cost a fortune ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
if you could find that time
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
oh .
of course , they , just don't have the quality of expenses companies either because ,
no .
you get that sound .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
those things were big and thick they weren't ?
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
you could kill somebody with them
yeah ,
th- , i think , i think , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that'd real easy .
the ones you buy ,
go out and buy one now
they're just so friendly and ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
so
they're not meant to last ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
at all ,
neither are things .
we buy m shirts ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
it'll cost us a lot ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
the best cities , are these days are grown up ,
those things are practically fed
i guess , the old country and western music you ,
back then when i was a kid , there wasn't that much t v ,
no .
that's all you had to listen to the ,
radio .
radio ,
so .
that's just what you had ,
we- ,
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
i think it was better back then to ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
there's too much t v now the next , more is exciting ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
really , than television ,
but , i , i don't know if i would have to do that , because i don't know if they were ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
your hobby there's ,
yo- ,
it just didn't consider your mind like anything else ,
yeah ,
i remember mother and dad always turned on the door of washington .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
was it on the radio every week ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
what day was that on ,
can you recall .
seems like it was on a friday ,
so .
friday or ,
okay .
okay .
uh-huh .
do you think it's a
i think it's a pretty good idea .
i think they should either do that , or so many time to the military , or helping elderly people .
yes ,
yes ,
y- ,
None
None
that's true .
i'm not sure that that's not a bad idea
the military for a year or two ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
wouldn't be bad for ,
i think it teaches kids how to grow .
how about yourself ?
i agree with you .
yeah ,
yeah ,
they did , do a lot of public service activities ,
these days they're not ,
yeah .
yeah ,
yeah ,
i've , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
that's really great .
None
they are
parents ,
kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that ,
yeah ,
they do .
they don't follow it at all ,
there are very few stories go on ,
no .
and become mine yet .
i don't know what the high structure is for the
so .
and , uh , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
jack .
oh .
senior ,
okay .
there's not ,
they're just not ,
once they get into junior high it just ,
yeah ,
they lose interest .
not done anymore
when they young children ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
there's even less interest there .
they're more for , i mean ,
me
not , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
knowing ,
knowing ,
knowing ,
walk out
yeah ,
you're absolutely right
yeah
i think it's a really good thing .
i like to see ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
there's a lot that can be done right here in this country ,
i think ,
too .
we ought to start right here at home .
i'm ,
yeah ,
None
no ,
it , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
since there is that much needs to be done here .
i think that we need to really address what we've done here
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's been really good .
we talked about this for a few minutes ,
hopefully , we'll have other topic just maybe four times maybe ,
None
no ,
i agree with you
i guess we both agree that it's a good thing ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
that they should do sometime .
okay .
you take care ,
so .
you , too .
enjoy the day .
you , too .
thank you , gee .
bye-bye .
bye-bye .
what would you say your opinion on your gun control ?
i don't know .
yeah .
i'm against it
right .
ye- ,
i have a native in the house .
the difficulty is probably so old i'm afraid to use it .
i bought it for turkey and also because i wanted a problem .
how do you feel about it ?
None
so .
i think they need that .
i have a minivan .
it's a little dark
i have a nine or a twelve mile now .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i do like to have my guns .
i don't know if i'll ever use it ,
like you , my brother's to my little son probably , about three years old
my gun hasn't been shot in a year or two .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i like to have them handy .
up in new england where i'm from , you had to get a restaurant before you could buy any time .
i thought that was really good .
i think if they ,
yeah .
you have to get a native to fund the police station in your local area to do that .
i've never heard of anything like that .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
that would be nice .
so .
a- ,
the criminals that are going to get their guns one way or the other .
i agree .
i think , one of the things that needs to happen is , to stop the deficit in , buying it to do aerobics ,
maybe putting a waiting period of something or something on it .
if it's really strong to pick up a lot you can pick it up any place .
yeah
you can get them really cheap .
i know
i had a waiting period on my dad's because i was down in , tennessee .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , they had a waiting period
we bought it there .
so .
how long was the waiting period out there ?
about nine days .
so .
that wasn't too bad .
no .
no
None
you're not going to be quickly that .
uh-huh .
th- ,
somebody wants to do that ,
at times i think they ought to have a waiting period on all day .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i do too . because it doesn't make any difference , whether it's a gift or a lot of , i suppose .
they both do the same kind of job .
yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i suppose .
i never got shot with either one .
i don't know ,
i think you could jump from a lot of being a student and not
no ,
a hundred dollars almost in a new york .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
at least ours does .
it's ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
you can make it either or tight as far as can start doing .
oh .
the spread changes .
i've got a single pet to catch
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
uh-huh .
the closer that i get , the penalty that it gets .
it's got a hell of a kick to it .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
my husband had a gun control at all time .
i shot that one time .
almost usually come out .
it just a song ,
i forget ,
i think it was a three eighty-six .
i'm not sure .
do you belong to a gun club or you ?
he uses a lot one away .
since we moved ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
no kidding .
None
i'd love to get used to that .
we collect his lips for that .
the , education we've got around here and kind of are expensive
it's well worth it .
you can go down and shoot up into a church bag and some of them have , and forth .
uh-huh .
there's an annual fee that's , it's pretty high .
there's an hour that you want to have to pay all of time , because i found .
yeah .
you have to pay for the jury in any afternoons that you would receive in .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
that's what my husband ,
None
it ,
he went mostly just to , shoot at it at least die .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they used speed and all that .
i think that the gun serve out a hot stadium .
yeah ,
that's a good ,
i've never thought of that .
that's a good point .
it ,
None
you give him a baby-sitter because he teach him eight days .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
that's ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
he could not only , shoot himself .
he could , a perennial drive it and leave it at home and a few times a day .
it ,
we was living on a base just early down in the past ,
this one guy decided to play , um , i'm tired of doing it .
he was his gun around and shot her in the kitchen and take everything .
wow .
he was fortunate .
he could take in something else
None
wow .
yeah .
san antonio .
i can't remember what the same was going around .
it was about four or five years ago .
i guess that would be a good idea
about , private trials are a power ?
if you wanted to sell your wife to come out .
how do you feel about that ?
do you believe there ought to be responsible machines , the same and the enemy ?
do you believe that you ought to be able to sell your system ,
because you own it ?
that's a hard one because we did that .
i think there ought to be some rule against it .
i'll ,
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
so .
isn't there a way to yourself with them voice a week ?
i have no idea .
i've only had one gun
i have ,
i've kept it , the one gun that was in my name .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
is it registered ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i- , i , i don't know if i would have to do that , because i don't know if they were going to be a little bit more , because of the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
the government that i've got is not registered ,
i don't know why i never served it
the , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
i don't think you have to register a lot
i think it's right
the , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
my husband has a lot .
if they go to , all right , bring them now .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
this ,
my kid is coming on me .
i can't hardly talk about .
my husband feels that they'll come and collect guns .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i guess that could happen .
it's just like the social security system
once they gave everybody a number
now they're making you , get one at least .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
once they have your number , they have your waist .
if you try to do anything , like , not allowed to yourself the government , they know who you are .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
and everything about you .
, that's true
and , uh , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
they know how much money you make a week , probably to ,
my kid is in maryland .
i was seeing what they was on .
i've lost my train of thought .
i'm sorry
that's all right .
the judge ,
you were talking about , what the federal government is about people who are .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
they probably know everything from , half the time where you go to the bathroom .
they probably do .
no ,
that's a little bit extreme .
they could know anything about everything and you know .
i'd like to have my gun .
if they go to them tells me , i'd lose a gun
we wouldn't lose our , you know .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i don't ,
do you find it difficult up picking up , that are not available ?
no .
no .
i don't either .
i can buy some , today if i wanted to .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
w- , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
just put up the money .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
you can look in the ,
we got a thing down here called a year .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's a deterrent thing .
you go and always see guns in there .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
five to seven bedroom a day .
it comes out every penny .
there's no waiting period on that .
no .
none whatsoever
you call ,
we sold a refrigerator through it
it took us all of twelve hours .
to sell the refrigerator ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
yeah .
i think the federal government is really far away from , control .
i don't believe in ,
i shouldn't probably say control .
i mean .
control is something that i wouldn't want the federal government to have .
i would like to see them have a tremendous attorney that they have who know what has committed .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i agree with you there .
they do have too much control over us already .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
None
unfortunately , we vote for the people who spend the money ,
i can't complain too much .
yeah ,
i guess so .
i don't know .
they're
i haven't heard anything about the bible that ,
so .
no ,
i haven't either .
i don't know if its actual license or something that's being good for eating out .
uh-huh .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
so .
most countries require that now ,
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they have , it mandatory for at least the young men ,
i don't know about the young women ,
i don't know if they have to serve in the military ,
yeah ,
a lot ,
yeah ,
too .
you take anybody everybody does .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i don't think it's a bad idea ,
teaches a lot .
i went in the service when i was eighteen ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , stayed in for ten years .
is that right ?
yeah ,
did a lot of growing up .
i bet .
you have to .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
yeah ,
my father had been in the military .
i didn't do it myself .
my father had
that's , how he put himself through school basically .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
he came from a poor salary , right ?
he didn't have a chance to ,
the family wasn't beyond ,
he had to do something to ,
do it himself .
put himself through school ,
he did .
he was very successful .
my parents wanted to send me to college ,
i was dead set into it
i had forgotten ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
i got in ,
None
i started to work on my education .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
that's pretty good .
i've been in school ever since
that's good .
yeah ,
i guess .
yeah ,
that's ,
i don't know .
there's other kinds of service to the country that could be done ,
yeah ,
if you don't like ,
working in the national parks ,
sure .
exactly .
working , clean up i've given the money i've really kept on that person they should be hooked on .
yeah ,
None
absolutely .
so .
so .
uh-huh .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
yeah .
yeah ,
sure ,
sure .
None
i'm ,
get something out of that money .
country would benefit ,
yeah
i've ,
so .
yeah ,
yeah ,
right .
None
so .
that right .
yeah ,
he had all kinds of stories .
uh-huh .
back in those days they also use to give you , you know , good for this and , you know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
they get all this stuff together and sit down and have some games
i have a hard time with them .
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i was on .
i don't even make that .
no ,
i know .
yeah ,
yeah ,
somebody's taking that away .
there's easily probably six or three times a week that came on and walk .
yeah ,
no doubt .
it's totally ridiculous ,
i , started out when i first got in school ,
i was going into public administration ,
None
is that right ,
yeah ,
this is the kind of thing you look at .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
you sit there
None
you need x number for the money ,
you need x number to do it is the other hand .
just ridiculous .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
this is ridiculous .
it's sad .
it is ,
it's god's .
there's got to be a different way .
there's got to be a better way .
it'll never happen .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
these people out here getting that money are big voting machines .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
yeah .
what should they get in touch , i think .
so .
None
i would limit it to something like the tuition would be .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
give an hour .
yeah or self treatment or anything .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
something that's going to help them along the way .
they'll help the country eventually , too ,
sure ,
so .
because rather than having a bunch of people we can have no ability to ,
this ,
that's only going to help .
look at the street ,
it's sad .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
one in five americans like a- , all that , you know ,
uh-huh .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
what are we doing ?
we're getting a service country .
as opposed to what we were twenty years ago .
yeah ,
we were an electrical engineer ,
now we're not going to do it because everybody is bringing them at the game .
we taught them how to do it ,
they did it better than we do .
yeah
simple as that .
because they have the ability , i guess .
yeah ,
simple as that .
yeah ,
which is good for them ,
on the other hand , we kind of lose out .
yeah ,
it's terrible for us .
i think that if , young people had to service the country was probably little times more .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
because they learn that other people are a good thing .
yeah ,
it can be good for them , too .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
even the military ones that we've got now
god , you go to the mall
i know .
yeah ,
i know .
give me the money
i'll teach them something good
you know why they do it is so they can get them out of the house .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
yeah ,
that's my other question .
parents aren't parents any more .
no .
they've already up their .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
one of the other subjects is do the , you know the public school systems are in ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
None
yeah ,
i talked with somebody else about that one of my time ,
yeah ,
i just love teaching .
that's probably the most fun i had .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
for what .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
i don't want to live in a little one bedroom , the rest of my life .
exactly .
that's a sad thing to think ,
that's kind of depends on my best ,
i admit that ,
in a way it is ,
yeah ,
that's right .
you have to look out for yourself
that's true ,
when we pay garbage men than the more we pay teachers ,
that's wrong .
yeah ,
gosh ,
so .
i'm not saying that men should be totally paid for something ,
i saying teachers should be paid more .
no ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
they do an absolutely necessary job ,
i have a great deal of these for people who can go out there and do that .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
there's a sense of priorities here , too .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
we need ,
what's more important , picking up the whole or these kids .
yeah
they both have their place .
yeah ,
uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that ,
sure .
when it gets right down to it ,
one's ,
yeah .
that's pretty good .
yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
my other pet shirts is that .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
it's ridiculous the way have gone .
there was a time when you were needed .
they served a good idea .
they served a good idea ,
there are enough companies on the program that now are registered with ,
they're only there to their minds have the power structure .
None
it was a mini skirt place ,
uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that ,
this was during a time when the whole s was so cheap ,
they were having a hard time .
they told the doctor , look ,
we need to you come back and get this stuff done .
else we're going to be out of business .
they wouldn't come back ,
they went bankrupt .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
they all lost their jobs .
sure ,
it's like ,
that's really what happened to the grocery store this area .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
so many times , you had the own arm and truly had a living at the same time .
that's right .
yes ,
detroit worked real hard on thursday car in this country in this country .
they're trying to do that now with the grocery store .
yeah ,
we've never caught up ,
i don't think we ever will .
it'll be a tough road , though .
yeah ,
here it is ,
we've got to go into with the expense of the masking tape here .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
None
that's about right .
gosh .
yeah ,
back to the original subject ,
yeah ,
i think ought to go out and do some of the public service ,
i don't care what it is .
it teaches them rough in their country .
yeah ,
and pride in themselves , too .
that's right .
you could try something within the day .
yeah ,
same old thing .
so .
that's right .
that's like detroit scouts .
sure .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's a great idea .
i think they ought to take them and , i don't know , just have sort of a struggle like a diet and say , okay ,
we need somebody
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
we're going to talk about the public school system ,
okay .
what's wrong with it , or if anything is wrong with it and what we can do about it , what should be done about it .
fantastic .
one thing that i beat me into my real large , is , of the , the wind system on the school system .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
yes , that's a big problem .
yeah ,
it's amazing ,
None
right .
to be doing what they're doing ,
when i was in college i enjoyed teaching ,
i did some teaching computers
i really enjoyed that
i wouldn't want to go teach high school or junior high ,
it just , all the problems .
lord , yeah ,
you talk about stress and pressure ,
i tell you what ,
it's ,
yeah ,
they're putting in fifty , sixty hours a week ,
None
do , uh , i think , uh , i think , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
right .
they're being paid , probably what half people are paid for the kids .
exactly ,
so .
we're paying him better , instead of a year for dollars a lot ,
that's right ,
they ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
i
yeah ,
it's ,
i just don't understand that .
yeah ,
it's ,
do you have little kids , or what ?
no ,
sure don't ,
my wife and i've just been married about two years
i have a sister that's a , school teacher ,
so .
yeah ,
yeah ,
my wife and i have a three year old , almost a four and a half year old .
okay .
yeah .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
it's getting close .
yeah ,
he's going to be going to kindergarten ,
so .
right .
we're thinking about that .
what's that going to be like .
are they going to be taught nothing ,
they going be taught something ,
we're going to be involved in our own education .
None
right .
because , i guess we don't trust the school system , which is very sad ,
exactly .
if it doesn't start at home , it's not going to go anywhere .
right ,
that's true .
so .
yeah .
exactly .
so .
give me a break ,
that's unreal .
right ,
right .
one thing my wife and i've talked about , uh , private schools are .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
whether , we would want to carry in private schools as they're growing up , because , just in the dallas area , we're not real comfortable with the public schools .
yeah ,
right .
i couldn't believe that .
right .
that's one reason we bought a house here in plano .
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
so on and so forth ,
None
yeah ,
you talked before , about the school district .
None
None
that's the only way they're going to make if , because i could do for putting her , uh , are going to be a threat .
that's ,
yeah ,
that's ,
taxes right now are political events .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
so .
i don't think any loss of going to do that ,
so .
yeah ,
the only thing , they would think of would be able ,
if it works at colleges it will work down to hawaii .
right .
yeah .
it will be hard for those people that , that have in school because they have to pay out even more .
exactly .
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
because , they're the ones that will probably have to carry the penalty of the nation .
that's right .
so .
most of the problems with kids in school and carrying guns and everything ,
good grief what's the way ,
yeah
that's just unbelievable to me ,
i can't believe that .
when i was in junior high and high school that never happened .
you never heard about that .
yeah ,
we didn't even think about it ,
no .
now , what do we have now .
got kids that , either got a gun school ,
good grief .
right .
i'd be afraid to b- , teaching , or even a student for the kids
uh-huh .
what's going to happen ?
i'm afraid for him to go .
exactly ,
right .
there again , you can't hold them back .
another reason , yo- ,
you want to encourage them , to be able to be raised in school ,
None
yeah ,
and lot easier than it was when i was going to school ,
that was ,
i graduated high school in nineteen eighty-four ,
so .
okay .
that was what , twelve years ago , i guess .
right .
it's lot different now .
right .
that's right ,
that's right .
i'm afraid to even think about it .
yeah , that is a scary thought ,
i don't know ,
None
that's all you can do .
yeah ,
so .
you got to be your best p rights , i guess ,
right .
even when they're a teenager and they , are kind of ,
uh-huh .
exactly .
so .
yeah .
that's right .
yeah .
yeah ,
they don't teach them good values like drugs are bad .
maybe i'm wrong , because i haven't been , in that kind of environment for a long time ,
so .
right .
it just is amazing ,
need to teach them good values .
that's true ,
that's true ,
so .
yeah ,
the c a l u is going to get after them and have a minivan .
right .
which is going to take twenty years to ,
i think , you know on it ,
you've got to start them at the home .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
so .
that's where they get the upper fee area
that's all you can do .
that's about right .
uh-huh .
so .
that's right .
i got to be going ,
so .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
hey , i appreciate the call .
nice talking to you today .
you to .
have a good life ,
hi , is the oldest last year .
how are you ?
i'm doing fine .
where you from ?
i'm from new england .
massachusetts .
okay .
i'm from minneapolis , ]
wow !
this is quite a long distance .
yeah ,
it certainly is .
do you have any pets ?
no .
use too .
use to ,
none right now .
how come , you don't have any now ?
you get tired of them ?
i live in an apartment building
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
it's just not realistic
i'd love to have a dog ,
i've got a little bit , that i've had quite a long time .
None
so .
so .
is she ?
i beg your pardon ?
what is she ?
she's , a half ago .
a regular penalty
she's ,
ah .
ah ,
i got my mom a little bit higher ,
not too long ago .
this is a little bigger than a lot .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
it's funny how i , this is known .
None
the woman needed someone to
this is what she had told the kids
she even told me that .
None
for sure .
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
i've had this dog now for sixteen years
she's been a lot of company
she's , we- , getting a little bit
things are starting to .
i live alone now
she stays in the house all day while i go to work
yeah .
i find a little present on the weekend when we come home and stuff .
she's usually pretty good .
yes ,
my mother has one that's ,
it's ,
it's made such a difference for her .
just , i , uh ,
the way my mom's stands just about , is having a puppy for him
having this dog
she's had it for , i guess three years now .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
possibly four .
it's really made such a difference for her .
i really would like to ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
if that weren't so , i would have one certainly .
i just ,
it sounded like somebody also have to get a dog
yeah
you might want to get yourself , an old that doesn't allow him for a lot .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
yeah ,
i am not a group person .
i have a friend that has , had on occasion who come out there for the kids to keep from time to work
this cat is like no other one that i have seen .
it would sleep on my dad's ,
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
it's just a great cat ,
so .
my personal opinion is a dog .
i don't know that i would ever want a cat .
i like cats .
i just wouldn't want to own one .
you don't own cats .
they're raised
uh , i , i , i , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , because i don't know if they have to do that , you know , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
yeah
i don't know ,
i can't seem to have a brand with the other day i like with my gosh .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
yeah ,
right
they own you or ,
gun you up with their wife ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
right .
that , uh , i , i , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , because i don't know if they have to do that , you know , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
yes ,
we're supposed to appreciate them .
yeah .
i don't know that a cat would do that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
i used to have ,
yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
i could just walk in the door
yeah .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
uh-huh .
it was , amazing a lot .
i think , in a way we're able to read each other two now , because she knows when i'm ahead and i can't know if i'm not sure it's a good job .
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
i know when she has an accident , i mean not have any way on it .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
yeah ,
some people might not believe that
i do
sure
absolutely .
yeah .
really ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
that's the way ,
i had that cat i mentioned , that was pretty well
yes ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
the next morning , when my roommate got up and , did not get it away , it seemed to be that way .
it jumped up on my bed and my husband ,
for me , looking at something we need to be honest .
all the time while it was doing it .
all right .
yes .
animals have a way of it
was helping .
None
i don't know that i'd ever watched my husband in the world .
it was about two years ago she got sick on me
None
she , lost all her activity
she stayed there for one day
the doctor called me up and said , she had a low ball and more thick and that , she was dying and , and that take her to a hospital
i took his ears
i , took the dog to the dog that was able to ,
they said they'd keep her there for three years .
yeah .
it cost me over five hundred dollars .
ouch .
None
then she enjoys it .
she was okay for a couple of years .
she got sick on me again
i brought her to a different star trek it
None
he gave me the same time that i gave her a new car for the
she was okay
she's been okay every once .
it's been about two years now .
that's great ,
it really is .
yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
yeah ,
what do you want to do ?
i probably would have had one goal .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
of course , you would .
what they do is , is they say , it's going to cost , twenty dollars for twelve dollars and forty dollars for this
it builds up on .
you don't know that ,
you don't know what it's going to until it's all over .
None
the cat got sick .
she took the cat to the grocery store
she had the cat there for two days
the cat died .
the doctor had called her and said , her cat was done your truck
you lose me this bill ,
by the way , do you want to me to avoid the cat
it cost her three hundred dollars ,
she didn't get the cat back .
yeah ,
they had to pay for all the medical , that bills the cat is taken the roof or whatever .
uh-huh .
really .
uh-uh .
that was kind of a surprise
at least ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
you kind of wonder what really happened .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
even the ,
they leave they did the best that they could have
then the cat , no .
my goodness .
i'm looking for another cat for them .
i've got a little bit , that's still , just being a right now .
uh-huh .
that will make their day .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
i think it will
uh-huh .
i think they enjoy that .
only work tonight .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
for cats anyway ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
listen
it's been a pleasure talking to you .
the same here .
you take care .
okay .
bye now .
maybe we'll talk again sometimes
okay .
what is that sound ?
that's my husband's at the door
okay .
i'll let you go .
okay .
right
thank you
what do you do to exercise ?
s- ,
i , weight train , three days on one day and off .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i , ride , fifteen , twenty , twenty miles , i don't know , maybe three times , maybe four times a week .
i play basketball , couple times a week .
i play french one night a week .
that's what i do .
so .
what about yourself ?
that's pretty interesting .
i guess i ask .
the amount of
as much as a hundred and fifty miles a week .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i guess a play night one day .
i suppose a lot over the summer .
really ?
yeah ,
that's about the extent of it .
i don't do any of those things particularly , for exercise .
i guess the door is one thing the only reason of , do if i feel like i need to go exercise
i do it mostly for fun .
yeah ,
what do you ride , a bunch of inches or pretty flat ?
it varies .
out near my house is pretty much .
sometimes i can't belong to what else is , uh , a hundred mile trip each way .
that's mostly flat .
yeah .
about forty-five , fifty minutes .
how does that work out with , your yard and your bike and all that ?
yeah ,
it can be a pain .
basically , i work on a cruise
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
i would lay every day ,
it just became such a pain .
we're talking , fifty , twenty minutes for ,
right .
and sometimes if you had longer . *[[ was still on another hour and , an hour to move and a half all of those and all this kind of stuff .
it was a big portion of the day
of course another hour to get back home .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
do you ride a lot of repairs of a lot of those around there ?
not so much .
i guess mostly i bike on my own .
i've got a bike with it .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
how about you ,
what kind of perspective do you have ?
actually my wife just got me into it
i did an internship at the moment for any research in dallas ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
the longest thing ,
i learned all the health benefits of ,
i was a solid weight fan ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
all i did was weights and the exercise
right .
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yes ,
i tend to find a game i'd probably get four or three weeks ago
i did my first bike this year .
i did , forty miles ,
so .
that's the key i've ever done so much ,
i usually , fifteen or twenty .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it was kind of weird
it was pretty tough ,
yeah ,
i see .
i kind of held her back a little bit this weekend .
she wanted to go , go ,
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
she wanted to stay with me
it's good to have a microwave .
yeah
it really is .
are you think of doing any , of ,
yeah ,
that would be cool if i didn't , when i work up to that .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
None
oh .
thing .
i mean people seem to get into different kinds .
one is more of a distance ,
one's more , just ,
yeah .
i've never really looked into that .
that's ,
my wife would just love that .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i may do that sometime .
there again , i'm just kind of a into this area .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's kind of funny .
i called this number
i was just reading through a bicycle and put all the trim on the different restaurants coming up .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
around texas , you got about five or six ,
None
that's nice .
because they're really into it .
so .
is there all big here .
i didn't know that , until i came down here , and ,
wow .
kind of caught the button .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i lived in indiana all my life
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you may say one or two things on a gun student in the house or fifteen or something , that there's more like it there is like it down here .
yeah ,
i'm not sure why that is .
generally in the midwest it seems to be much less .
maybe it's because of the reasons .
probably .
or maybe just because , there's a lot more hot , because we get in the west .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
it makes a better for a cop for that .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
there's a lot of restaurants around here .
it's really neat .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
there are a lot of buildings , a lot of magazines , and stuff ,
yeah .
so .
it's free
just go to the bike shop and pick it up ,
it's got all the same cleaning up ,
i guess i'm going to be busy about every summer this year ,
that's true .
going to a different ride .
yeah ,
see a little bit of texas i've never seen before .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
how long have you been employed ?
None
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
yeah ,
i guess i just never really thought about it much for a while , until i did know my friends were all friends were a lot .
i thought i'd try it , too .
uh-huh .
no ,
i haven't ,
no .
to see if it ,
so .
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it gives you last church and senior the same house and l d .
that's great .
yeah ,
so .
yeah ,
i've definitely noticed it's a good movie on my arm on the last .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
it gets it down to about forty .
really ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
that's good .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
man .
that's .
on average ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
when do you get to begin with the enemy and all that ?
yeah .
do you ride inside if you can't ride in ?
no ,
i'm not that at .
there are some people ,
in fact a lot of people will sell him in the front room .
they've got a , right near a while ,
with the big harbor .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i don't do that .
i pretty much lay off for the winter .
None
so .
i just , more or less , human exercise and a little bit more experience and that kind of thing .
yeah ,
how'd are kind of a problem
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
up here it's only stopped down before then .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
yeah ,
it's pretty good .
it's , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that ,
yeah ,
right .
you , change up a whole lot with , and keep a lot of
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
i try to go someplace pretty much , uh , every week .
i watched around , about four different areas , from my house
i'll sometimes come in the school .
it's nice coming ,
None
it's along the sun up here .
what school is it ?
university of rochester .
okay .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
it's fairly casual .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
it's a good ride
yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
that's true .
sounds neat .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
it's kind of ,
None
uh-huh .
that's , that's .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
that's really good .
it was good talking to you .
good talking to you
keep up the good work .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
you , too .
all right .
take care .
bye .
bye .
okay .
yeah ,
probably the biggest thing we've got going now is the longest thing
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and innocent and probably are the murder two more than we have that .
how about you ?
i don't actually live in the city ,
i'd probably say that's right .
crimes against property people to budget against them , uh ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
probably right , if you look at it from that point stand .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
what , uh , i think , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
uh-huh .
where i live now it's not so bad .
None
i do have friends that live in the city
i think that they get a lot of from this war of drug testing just on thing . because there are , houses on street , on their street and stuff like this .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
do you live in a real small town or in the paper or something ?
i live out in the country ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
how far out from the city , do you ,
i'm about fifteen miles out .
about fifteen miles .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
we are considered in the country ,
so .
it doesn't really feel like you're in the country .
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
however , i'm sure they're there .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
right now our neighborhood is running about , eighty percent of the lakes have been there ,
wow .
sometime during their , that neighborhood in the case .
that's huge
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yes ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
properly and things like that .
it's cut back , hi ,
it just happened to our neighborhood from another neighborhood to get another neighborhood ,
it still , city will stop a little , ]
are there any thoughts on this company is all this ?
i would say the majority of it's happening during the day , even between the first ten years and in the morning .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
most ,
why ?
why is it happening ?
most families are young
both people are working .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they're happening during the week they're gone from the morning .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i would say that's probably their favorite problems .
they'll pick your house and , look at your paycheck and then go from there .
they're kidding ?
they showed most of them as chosen .
so .
you get a few of them that are a little bit , just taking , just fifty dollars that they can just get , ten to twenty thousand dollars for real quick .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
the , mercedes , things , that they can get , big for the schools and the biggest are the major machines ,
guns , that sort of stuff .
so .
very few , finding stuff .
uh-huh .
the police force , for one ,
i think they could , definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use .
it's , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that ,
right now i think , we are about thirty thousand people
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
there's only eight inches that for that amount of people that are well very many .
right .
so .
that's going to tend to ,
it seems to me that sort of helps to drive will just be able to make the cost of the crime
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
the , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
course in our state , we have the prison system , whatever ,
they're giving the early twenties ,
right .
they're doing that in our state , too .
yeah ,
it's , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
None
for the ,
you think that would be a deterrent ?
that would certainly be a deterrent .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
not necessarily , give in their to , human rights ,
uh-huh .
what about an innocent person who just do have been guilty ?
i think they'd have to go to extra to make sure a person's , in a group of cases .
course , i know you can't be a hundred percent of texas .
right .
so .
you'd never see it harder to carry it .
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
to carry somebody
those convicted , especially , of murder , and major ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
to answer the hole floor , and the ability and roll with that .
so .
right .
especially , in the case of murder i know in my case , my wife and my wife were growing up ,
wow .
my goodness .
during a house else teaches in the back we got caught ,
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we went through the court system and all that sort of thing
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
right .
uh-huh .
wow .
he was out within two months because of the parole system .
what , uh , i think , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
did you blame him under the state of the school ?
do what now ?
did you blame him under the state of the school ?
no .
i'm not real familiar with that .
you could probably compare him for a second or something , right ,
oh .
and try to get money from him
so .
the insurance companies and all that tried to go after him
they said , he has no job ,
he has nothing ,
there's nothing that he has you that could go after .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
very protective ,
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
they don't do that here .
course they pay them ,
you don't ,
you or the insurance companies never see any of that money .
yeah ,
that's too bad .
right now they're going to go after him because they're convicted ,
they , been in jail before
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they've been written , several times , which is another ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
deal i hate to see .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
basically the guy plays , some major things
yeah ,
i think that's re- ,
and car helps on top of it ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
after my car ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
we're out , fifteen thousand dollars
so .
that's awful
the guy gets out in two months
he goes out and took it again .
fact , he's back in jail now .
what , uh , i think , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
gives you ready for the saint .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
what budget does he really have ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
yeah ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
my god .
None
uh-huh .
they'll save one house ,
yeah ,
right .
yeah .
right .
ye- ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
right .
you can get some of us ,
you can't get all of us .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we're beginning to see more and more of that .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
that's a deterrent , too . if you think the home person might be right , and , well , you cry there to sell ,
you're going to get shot .
yeah ,
that's certainly a possibility in ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
most of the people are from beginning to watch the state of the state .
so .
None
wow ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
right .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's a problem ,
i think that the court systems need to be more in their minds ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
would be a definite deterrent
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i tend to agree with you .
right .
i think , what i would like to see is , number one , completely getting rid of these crimes . and worry about things that people are getting into .
i think one of the big things that you can do to contribute is , if someone is guilty of , a lot of foreign countries , they say , their money's responsible .
they lose their rights .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
uh-huh .
i know in my husband's case , they had something very much as their privacy .
i know ,
i think that's ridiculous .
they went to all
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
have you painted something lately ?
yes ,
i have .
that room i couldn't .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
since then we have painted the street .
yeah ,
another bedroom .
yeah ,
i showed them that one too didn't ?
the brown one .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
yeah ,
the one that looks like a lawyer .
yeah
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
uh-uh .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i forgot the outside of my house and one bathroom .
i have that problem with the ceiling , the wind , uh .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
where you get around the edge .
that is hard .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
how do you get the edge though ?
how do you get the edge ?
the straight edge ?
you just have to be real careful .
i see .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
so .
are you going to paint the outside of your house too ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i think i am going to do it this spring actually .
really ?
yeah ,
there are six houses .
the people that the house they pay for , you know , anything like that , that we do .
nice .
as far as the materials .
there are three houses on this street the same grade and everything has a big chance of shopping .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i am thinking i am going to change it , to , something like that ,
the brick is still negative .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
mostly earth .
i think i am going to put something like a brown on it , on the outside .
that will be nice .
and maybe , a little brown pie in the way or something and it will stand out a little bit .
so .
what color did you paint ,
or two .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
so .
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
what color did you paint your house ?
white .
on the out ,
i have a problem .
i can't get up high
we can't paint the way
you have got to get one of those things .
we have one of those .
we are just not willing to get up that high .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
yeah ,
that is what he ,
i was out there last week
he has finished everything except the , the same .
we did too .
we did it in the fall
it's just too high .
it is really scary ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
the only thing i would consider a professional , maybe not that ,
it
other than doing our own car i think it's a little better .
our house in new mexico , it was so nice ,
we had all this trim to paint , and lots of it .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
we did basically wear percent of the house
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
he came with his own ,
what do you call those things ?
the accuracy ?
no ,
those where you built a whole thing .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
uh-uh .
i know what you are talking about .
that's it
he came and did it that way
i think he won a pound me to build up on .
so .
its ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
yeah .
he knew that
so .
my .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
that was worth it getting a professional for that .
he loves those down here .
i think that is what we might have to do with this ,
other than that , it was pretty easy doing it and it and everything it was .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it wasn't too bad .
you think ,
how much did it cost you for the paint for the outside ?
shoot , maybe a hundred and fifty .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
since , it is a one story ,
we did , two heavy mileage over it .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
my word .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
anyway , when he checked out
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
my word .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
he had already carried a bottle out and selling that her
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
my word .
he saw
that was really worth it , new orleans water .
yeah ,
it was over two hundred dollars worth of free stuff .
my word
my word .
he really teaches in that way .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
yeah ,
i think we are going to do , another bathroom ,
i think i will probably do it , just in a hurry .
i want to do it about the same color . and just be a little ,
are so independent .
we never any more .
i know .
it's the ultimate wall .
a little bit ,
so what do you think ?
uh , the causes of crime ?
um , i think it was horrible of company in the united states .
it's causing the lower class to be .
that's why there's such , high school ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
and , uh , there's crime in , uh , young people because they don't have , role up doing one too much more on television
and they think it's the way to go .
i don't know .
what do you think ?
what about ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
plus there's nobody for them to look up to .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
okay .
but i also blame some of it on their parents because women are concerned .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
because i remember even when i was growing up ,
okay .
i'm x engineer when i was growing up ,
and i had friends ,
they used to do stuff like , you know , go over to a store and then come to see .
my mother drives us , it's like , i don't care what your friends do .
if you do it , then that was it .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
from anybody else .
and i knew that i would get in more trouble from my mother than from anybody else .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
and i think that's the basic , is they have no economy any more ,
so they don't care .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
so .
yeah ,
i think i can agree with that too .
but now , as far as what they can do about it , i don't know .
you can't make parents be going
that's true .
you got to kind of make people to do want the right thing .
you know .
i don't know how you do that .
i guess if you gave the , gave them how you said ,
that's another problem with the united states ,
there's no jobs any more .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
but .
well , i've heard this one theory , that , if that if a kid gets a crime , that , uh , instead of the , the kid , they were the parent .
or both of them .
that would work to a point ,
now , to put the blame on the parent .
well , i'll work to a point because some kids are just bad out .
i don't care what you do to them .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
you know ,
so i think it depends on how much that trial has been in it , you know .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
because a , a , a child can get into anything ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
i don't care how you good , they are .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
precious , at least one time ,
but now if this is a thing harder ,
here with this child in wisconsin ,
and or to , you know , no , both of them .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
because that means she's still not doing what she's supposed to do .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
because i just watched it on t v one night on one of them , um , twenty twenty , twelve hours , of them shows that one night had been dying to test .
um .
i don't know if you seen this .
no ,
i didn't see it .
it was a little , it was a little bit of trouble them at cars , you know ,
i understand .
and then when they caught him , you know , his mother had gone there ,
now they don't take me to go away from that .
that she was filmed .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
but see , by that , i think it's also a little late .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
you know ,
but i'm sure there's something can be done .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
what about with adults ?
anything do any about adult crime .
yeah ,
start they
but really good instead of having a kid on the door field and the house .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
well , for one , a major problem with that is the teachers are overcrowded .
well , they should start with , the ,
if they would get rid of .
seems to me , i know there's a lot about that court people don't understand .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
there's more people in jail right now for child care , then you don't have doing there for people .
um .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
you ought to take all them little bitty stuff let them go ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
let them go you know , give them a fine , whatever ,
make them do an ground then ,
yeah ,
i mean seriously ,
put them in your house ,
they ought to put those people to work .
i call them all for , tomatoes , things .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
little rock degrees , all of them in there .
um .
you know , the , the police , the drug dealers , in terms of them ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
jail you know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
and let all the normal people go out , you know , okay ,
if you write a bad check , you go to jail , right .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
let them go to .
well .
not let them go and get out of it .
yeah ,
they , they still have to prevent them .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
yeah ,
that's ,
let them go and pay their crime or their way something else like you know , like the wind up or whatever they do their community time , you know , whatever that is
but , they don't , put them around because they're not there rather than the answer .
yeah ,
and they're , they're still , they can provide for society ,
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
i don't know ,
some people , boy , they got ,
i think the united states has got too many problems to be tired about everybody else .
yeah ,
that's true .
now how they going to fix it , i don't know .
i don't think there is a ready way .
no ,
i don't think so either .
uh .
because the economy is down , people , you know , the , the , the low man is on the wind is more of the , i guess , the rest of it .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
and he's got to work extra just to make it right loose .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and they keep taking more money from people and are people ,
and they don't have any incentive to work if we're just going to take fifty percent of it .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
might as well essentially ,
then they don't have to pay taxes on it
that's it .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
so , you know , they , i , i , i know it's bad , uh , but just , you know like texas now .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they could have had a microwave .
they don't want a button .
why not ?
they'd have a ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
i would rather pay for a jury a two , three , two dollars , whatever i'm paying , you know a week or whatever , and never see that any of money , than to have them take a amount of my paycheck .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
because , you know , they take ,
and uncle we'd go by the ,
um .
the social security which probably will be available to get that when you know .
because we're paying for social security they now are using .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
who's going to pay for mine ?
i don't know
but it's , it's
i'm not speaking on it .
no ,
you don't count on social security .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
but , it's , it's ,
that's what i'm saying ,
they need to do something else .
um .
but .
crime is going to go up as long as the economy comes out .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
and it's going to get worse .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
that's just like last night they killed them in that store .
where you at ?
i'm in raleigh , north carolina .
oh
no idea you don't know that .
well , where are you from ?
i'm in dallas .
okay .
but last night , they killed , uh , uh , four people in a million dollars .
oh , man .
and killed them ,
well , it was two dollars side on the side .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
one was a store and was one like a , a fast food area ,
chicken or something , i don't know .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
anyway , they cross schools just , don't put them up all , the women ,
i mean , they just beat them .
stuck them in the refrigerator and then shot them all .
shop .
why did they do in the nation ?
why was , you know , why you know , why you didn't have to ,
if they was going to protect them , just built them in the refrigerator , take the money , you know .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
they didn't have to kill them or hey , them or anything like that .
um .
um .
that's awful .
yeah ,
we still get some in raleigh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i mean , not not too often real bad ones ,
but .
it's just getting really ridiculous down here .
i wish i could move somewhere where , this , you know , you got to like in the country .
i don't think there's anywhere where there is going to be important .
well , i think , if it's ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
yeah ,
where is ,
and , and , and see that's the way i've seen .
crimes aren't amazing any more .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
there's nobody is next to door to ,
you don't know your neighbors , and stuff like that .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
it's just , why , you know ,
because i moved out some lakes before they were because they were pretty traditional with that .
um .
and you didn't even ,
and what the manager , the doctor will even do anything .
he's probably a drug license system
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you never know .
you don't .
and so i moved ,
wow .
because i moved the day probably a week after one of the lakes up here you know ,
and this is like across the street .
um .
um .
this was a nice part of town and there across the street one of the lakes out of these days we were saying that , that were making , um , the time i saw the other hand , he voted down the other hand , he owned the library .
i say , see , this is it .
time to go .
that's it ,
and i moved .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
and , you know , now i live in a like , a neighborhood in a town house ,
but it's nice .
i don't , you know .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
yeah ,
but , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that .
it's pretty nice .
i don't know how they can live , a neighborhood or , person or something .
that's what happen , that's what wrong ,
you know .
i don't think , don't rent them to
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
or rent to them and them because they can't testing .
put it on the oven .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
if you deal drugs , you can't have them here .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
most of them are too scared to do anything about it .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's it .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
all right .
well listen , i got to go .
all righty .
nice talking to you .
and i thank you .
all right .
bye-bye .
bye-bye .
um , all right .
i've , uh ,
yeah ,
and i think that comes from about their being a very threat person in the market now .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , well , i tend , i tend to agree .
uh , in some ways i think it's , uh , i think if anything , a lot of , uh , the changes that have occurred , uh ,
in some ways for the teachers
because i think women should have a choice ,
and i do believe in the , being able to have a choice to , as far as , what you would like to do with your life .
but by the same token , and i know this for myself because i've worked and i have worked , um ,
that it makes it , uh , sometimes it makes more life instead of a long .
i think when the roles now are less as , as far as , you know , what , uh , women should be not or doing that , it , it , it could make life more difficult .
there are more things to work out .
i know when i was working , you know , you have all these problems with , with the child care and , and with , uh , you know , your boss , on the job
so you have added equal from there
and then you still have all the things that , um , you need to do that at home
and that doesn't change , you know ,
just because your going out of the house for so many hours a day , uh , doesn't make things those go back
and the other hand are still important .
um , i , i , i , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that .
so , um , have you , you have worked outside , you mean , also and , that , it , that ,
well , how do you feel , as far as , uh ,
what would be a happy buff
or , or what would you like to see ?
i would like , uh ,
yes ,
i have worked outside of the home
and , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
yes .
i was in one of those safe .
i was a school teacher ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and we had one child when i taught for my two year olds .
uh-huh
uh , we ,
uh , then i stopped teaching after my husband's , um , same company was in .
and we had two children
and i stayed home with those children ,
yes .
and raised those people
and now that my husband has retired , i was a small home ,
yes .
which if anyone has been involved in that , some days it's more fun
and some days you wonder why you're going to do ,
right
because your fighting for your life .
but , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
but , i am a little
and i've always been a shame .
uh , i'm , i'm not real sure that the young girls of texas are having to look into the job market as many of them .
i think they're going in by choice .
oh , i think so .
yes .
yes .
and , and i have no problem with that ,
but i think the male needs to be the first person .
and i think too many of the young women camped in our small town of five thousand , uh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
are not telling that happen .
they are very friendly .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they're , uh , they almost have what i would call a letter so , lots of aid .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
and they have to be in charge .
and , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and i th- , i think they could be a lot what i think they call their husbands .
so .
see , um , uh ,
i don't know .
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
the , the one problem i guess i have ,
and maybe what so many women , younger women are now from to go outside is ,
i feel that in general , in this society , that being at home is not looked at as , um , a job in itself .
whereas , you know , you hear a lot of women that are saying that it is a job in itself ,
but i know when i was working ,
and i was a- , an engineer and so i was always with them ,
uh , and they were single , many of them ,
and i tried to explain them to , well , my son must be growing when i leave ,
i used to leave at three ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i keep going to eleven at night
and they had , they used to look down on women that were home ,
they'd say , oh , i bet you go home and ,
you know , at least you get out of here at three
and you can go home and put your feet up at least watch ,
oh , sure
and i used to be called ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
because they really had no idea what was involved when i got home .
now taking care of them , running them everywhere , with them helping the , uh , the fish , the whole , you know , everything .
um , and i think that one reason that so many other reasons aren't bad , i- , to speak , go into a base is that they feel that they stay home they are not welcome ,
huh .
and that being home is not a little , uh , position in society .
and , there's a lot of truth to that
and i don't know how you feel .
i don't know how you felt when you were home and what kind of sudden you got ,
but i can see with the younger men that they are definitely looking at getting along that women are home .
and yet by the same token , i think some of it is ,
you , you ,
once in a while , you hear them say things like , i guess the judge has been ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you know .
i wish i was the one ,
i would stay home with my kids if my wife would go out and support us ,
uh-huh .
and the only value i see coming out of the ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
this is that children now in , in a little home parent , now they have actually two ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
because i see my wife ,
i have a daughter who's a nurse
and i have a daughter ,
right .
who's a former .
and i see ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
my dad teaches by ,
right .
None
right .
right
men smoke up from school and ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and having a much better relationship with their children ,
that's true .
than my husband ever did
because he ,
that's true .
left home at five thirty in the morning ,
and he got home at six fifteen .
yes .
and , uh , he took his dinner
and he was raised in our money because he was visiting .
right .
so , now the young mothers are having a chance to you ,
and i think ,
and they enjoy it .
that's an advantage .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
and they do enjoy it .
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i see ,
you're right .
i see many more men in the house ,
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
in the suburbs with their children ,
and i think that is healthy because they ,
and i think it's a , a wonderful advantage for the young , for the , for the , particularly for the , for the little boys to have ,
right .
oh , yeah .
a relationship with their father ,
and , and i don't ,
yes .
uh-huh .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
but , uh , i don't understand why the young girls would have to have bottom when you ,
and they have to ,
um .
that kind of job , uh , to go out there and that requires and , and run there and big trash .
and we just recently finished a long through the thirty , the under a three hundred thousand miles ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and at one point we sat down , uh ,
i didn't realize it ,
but i sat at a table to have a couple of inch that you go to bought this morning truck .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and that's obviously young i went with a lot
and she w- , has just had , just driven a portion of it from canada to almost in some place ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and she'd have ,
and i ask her how old he was
and she was the biggest , between the age of our daughters
and she had been driving ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
a truck for seven years .
and i thought , gosh ,
i mean ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
why would a woman that choose it ahead and such when ,
i guess i'm s- , i'm a- , maybe i was in a student , i was in a , in a , in a while ,
and my husband is a little bit of a male fan ,
in that ,
he's a very wealthy person ,
but he also works a woman should be taken care of , and in the home ,
and she should vote ,
but after she talks to her husband about how she ought to vote .
oh , boy
uh-huh .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
too ,
but , uh , i like two hundred care of .
i like my wife ,
well , i , i , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
broken and , my door opened ,
and i think the young women are doing that ,
and i think that's sad .
well , that , that's true .
there is that part , too ,
and i guess we also have to talk though
and although your husband's probably been as much as you know , uh , it else ,
he was raised in the south ,
um , i , i , i , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
i think that's a little war buff ,
i guess ha- ,
both .
oh , oh , yeah .
and , and you have to , i guess you have to agree about , too a lot of men , especially , i think middle age and older men , why they feel that way
and , and i think it gets scary for them to see , change also .
uh-huh .
and they come home
and everything's done for them .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
huh .
and their meal is that
and i think it's frightening to them to see the roles of folks .
sure .
and i think , i think this guy's name comes out of that .
now , my husband is , um , he's ten years older than me ,
and , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
but he has , his wife are very much successful , which , is kind of interesting .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
um , and yet , um , he's the type that he has to have to take on more responsibility , um , that meant ,
i'm kind of more ,
so .
i'm kind of more middle of the road .
None
there should be some , a lot more part time ,
but i think it's , uh ,
i don't believe in this career , you know , this day drive when , when they're small , because i think ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
i think that's very , um , hurting , to mexico ,
like , uh , kids usually look ten or sixty hours a week ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
huh .
huh .
i tend to work more than thirty .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i was part-time
and even that was a rat race ,
huh .
but i think you have to put in perspective , that , you know , when the kids came home from school , i wanted to be here .
i didn't want , i don't want a job where i'm using my yard and , uh , away and , uh ,
so i think you can have both .
it's more humid ,
but i think you have to put into terms of your ones to have ,
i think a lot of ,
first then
my problem with the young mothers i- ,
talk about the activities that we don't do
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
i , i don't have any children ,
so , i , i , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , because i don't know if they were going to be a lot of people that are going to be able to do that .
but i , i have a lot of friends with children
and i know they spend a lot of time with them .
which is good , you know .
that's good to hear .
yeah ,
an , i haven't , uh ,
well i've been around a lot of people lately at my truck , at least that don't have a lot of values
so , it's , it's always nice to see that people like each other ,
and like families that get along with each other and like to do things together .
yeah ,
ye- ,
ha- , have a lot of values ,
i love that .
do they have children ?
uh , the one , the most grade girl doesn't ,
but she's married ,
and i , i'm not quite sure why .
i , i think he said that he'd give her a big bit of town and she got married to me .
oh , that's wonderful
but , it , it's kind of depends on me
and then the other day my husband and i had a friend who did , uh ,
they're just going to have their first child
and they really like each other .
and they're real happy with one that's an
and she says things like , i'm really glad when he comes home
and there's not enough time to spend with him in the evening
and , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
oh , that's neat .
i'm like , really .
that's good , you know ,
i like to see that .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
you know , i have , uh , some friends that , uh ,
first of all , uh , the girls are very ,
they have two girls ,
one of the girl scouts
and the other was in the navy
and then the mother got involved as a teenager
and then all of a sudden the father was getting involved with doing drugs related by them and with working and the girl scouts drive here in ohio , and then in dallas going to say , uh , uh , camp and working and camp with the moon and stuff
and they're gone a lot
and they take their girls
and they go away for weekends and in the winter time even , you know , to do work with the girl scouts
and i think it's neat .
oh , yeah .
you know , they've really become very much involved in , in that just one organization ,
which the organization can use the help .
right .
so , i , i wish i could see more of that , you know .
at getting it we mentioned , uh , a family ,
we were thinking about getting that
and we went over to , uh , lady that them didn't fit in one of the country
and , uh , her daughter was actually ,
he- , she said that her husband said to her daughter , you need a hobby ,
so , she does the cats .
oh .
and you can tell , it's a family hobby .
the- , they're all a part of it .
and it was really neat because they were all interested in each other and , and the cats
and they raise him why .
so , they've done really well .
ugh ,
those are neat cats , too .
yeah ,
i've just learned about that breed .
they're really nice looking cats .
i have seven cats
but they're all used
well that's what we're going to end up getting
well they're the ones that need the homes .
oh , yeah .
you know , mine were just all , uh , motivated in the neighborhood .
little baby box and things
and it just kind of built .
one at a time , just rained ,
i couldn't , you know .
one time two of them came at once
and i can't turn a wood game going over .
oh , i know .
so , you know ,
and the last one that i saw , was here , uh ,
None
and it was winter time
and i said , i just can not have another cat ,
i just can not have another cat
and i looked out there
and he was just laying on my lawn just all and ,
oh !
and i said , i can't stand it ,
i brought him in so .
those are my children .
we don't have very many activities
but , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
no ,
i know what you mean ,
our cat league at other ones ,
and , th- , we've tried to get her to like other cats
and she just , uh , she wants to be around human events
and she does not want to be around other cats .
so our next , uh ,
None
ha , ha , lots of luck .
is she envious .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that .
oh , yeah ,
real well
we're hoping ,
it's our last week
she'll eventually ,
i mean , mine , you know , i have five and two and x .
everybody's retired ,
everybody's served
and we still have a pool every now and then .
nothing real bad , you know ,
a bit here and there ,
but , uh , they put up with each other
and they will eventually .
he- , her life will be out of bed for a while
and she'll want to and sell every now and then ,
but they'll , she'll finally accept it .
you know , they really don't have any choice
they h- ,
in my knee , we have a little bit of , uh , a fight for whose boss .
i mean a male cats are , are re- , you know , real well
and so that's the big minorities here , you know ,
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you know , but , uh ,
we- , i don- , i don't know ,
i don't have a problem with it .
i think they just learn to accept .
and i have two dogs too ,
and they've the dogs around the tent too
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that .
every now and then ,
so .
that's true ,
they've got to keep them in line .
yeah
but she'll follow home many juries .
as long as you make me feel , uh , like she's still loved and everything ,
so .
yeah ,
well those cats were great .
they were fourteen pounds and ,
and whatnot ,
oh , they're just gorgeous ,
but , yeah ,
it , uh , i , i , i , i don't know ,
three hundred and fifty dollars for a while .
oh my gosh
and i think of those ,
i think of the orioles at the pound .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that .
three hundred and fifty dollars
yeah ,
yeah ,
and they are lovely
but , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
so .
house payment
right .
that is a lot of money .
yeah ,
and then she's saying , you know , you can't let them outside
and you can't do this all stuff
and i'm like , ugh , you know .
i don't let mine out here ,
but .
None
but my cats are thugs ,
i'm afraid , you know , the neighbors will ,
people throw pictures at them ,
and people run over them
and , i , i just , you know , i just don't .
i know rome ,
and , and now they've lost the kids .
most of them don't even try to know , you know , to go out .
i just have two that drive me crazy ,
that i let out in the back , you know ,
but i won't let them get ,
if they start going in the front and stuff , i bring them in a while .
oh .
you know , i just worry ,
i guess i'm too thrilled ,
but , you know .
i see these cats that are missing around the neighborhood
and too they can catch yours really easy ,
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
None
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
we know we try , try real hard to keep them healthy .
uh , we just bought , uh , tested , a house with an easy to try to , so i'll have some room to walk around ,
oh , how neat .
and not off of a busy break .
we're , we're having our house for our cat .
isn't that bad
people do it for their children
i mean , why not .
oh , them too .
well you know , why not ,
why not .
we- , because i , she loves , she's one of those that he said , outside ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
and , and she doesn't go get
but she just wants to be able to have that freedom .
yeah ,
well if you're off , off , you know , a lot of away , uh ,
and i think that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
you're off of the main road , you said ?
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
away from a road , you know , and you keep an eye on her , it's probably a pleasure .
i'm just real ,
i don't know , i guess ,
i'm in a neighborhood
and it's , it's just real tough on animals here , you know .
yeah ,
it gets hard , especially with the cars .
uh , i , every time i see one run over i just , you know ,
it makes me sick ,
so , you know ,
oh , i know .
but anyway , we kind of got off the subject of children ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
except that i consider my children
yeah ,
our cats are our kids
or , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i , we , we got married a few months ago
and i'm like , well why can't possibly be at the army
oh , no .
in , in her little dress code
yeah ,
you know , if i could have , i would have .
well i'm sure it's been done .
i'm sure it has been done .
well they have got dogs for now and cats
and , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
oh .
you know , they have all that incentive for them where they dress up .
yeah .
oh , my .
i haven't gone that far .
i'm not that good .
no
you know , my cats do not wear them ,
an
i , i don't think they'd like to .
no .
i put a blank on her one second , one day
and i'm always calling by you are saying that the ,
i took a picture of her
and that was all it , all it had interrupted for .
we- , d- , do any of your friends have , uh , have older children that they do anything with .
do , do you have friends with older children ,
or do they just all have young kids .
um , yeah ,
all the ones i know ,
my house has three kids pretty well down and on the
and they , they go on family vacations
and , uh , they go , like to go skiing ,
we- , the , the middle girl doesn't get a whole lot of attention ,
but , uh , this last eighteen minutes they took , uh , uh , she had alzheimer's out , bermuda wallpaper
and then she works to her it , you know , her younger and sister that
and they got it just at the beginning of the year , where she got better .
so , sh- , not only is the better she , but so we got all the attention , because she got to go out .
i think she planned it .
she's only five ,
but i think she planned it
and she got all the attention from her dad .
oh , see there ,
she needed that ,
wo- , i think , i think , i think , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that .
oh yeah .
didn't she .
you know , it must be hard when you have a lot of children ,
i , you know , to ha- , i was an only child ,
my mother was an only child
so , i , you know , i wasn't raised with brothers and sisters
and i always got all the attention ,
so i wouldn't know .
i think i would be extremely bright , or would have been , had been there another child in the family .
yeah ,
it's , it's , we can see it work with her ,
tough ,
it must be tough .
she's broken .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
we- , she , she's the middle one ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
so she's never been the only one ,
so she really doesn't even know what it is to be the only one .
right .
yeah ,
that's tough , you know
so , what do you ,
what's your opinion on the , our policy down there ?
i don't think we have one .
i didn't know we had one either
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i was going to say it's kind of hard to have , have an opinion .
we seem to , uh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
uh-huh .
i don't ,
wow .
yeah
the only thing that i pretty much about is the old student from the apartment , you know , they're just trying to , you know ,
military action in panama is the only thing that comes to my husband's mind right now ,
well , uh ,
and then ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
and then , of course , there was , there was the , uh , in the meantime , with the drug dealers .
right .
but we just talked a lot .
we didn't actually do anything .
right .
well , that's , that's what i was about to say .
we didn't do anything .
i'm actually surprised at home in the military , with computers and over there .
i'm just kind of surprised we did that .
yeah ,
but , uh ,
that is , that is pretty , uh , that's ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that .
especially ,
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
after our friend of mine was it pretty well .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but i guess they had to finally do something .
actually bush has been better at that because i thought .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
he has a little more d- , a little more of a stand on policy than i thought he would .
i always considered him kind of a bit .
he takes more efficient .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
gosh .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
he was .
but , but i guess most of the policy that we're using now is , uh , a lot of foreign and , and how much , you know , policy .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
it seems that the , the americans of pretty much anywhere , just not in your office , just in our office that is , now is , you know , more action than just , than just done .
but , you know , if we , we back up what we s- , what we say with .
uh , yeah .
we have so far ,
but w- , we , uh ,
i don't know ,
really haven't ,
how long it's going to last .
yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
i'd be interested to see if we do that .
well , i don't think it's possible because , even though , you know , we're against them , i don't think we can go into another country and do something about the other problem .
well , we did in their apartment .
we did in ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
but , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that .
saudi arabia .
no ,
but the movie thing when he was , uh , the , uh , that , uh , was , uh , was , uh , was , was wanted either the , f b i by the , i b m ,
and i , they had a lot of ,
but , to go in and take out the whole world would be still totally different because ,
it could be an interesting , interesting problem with .
right .
i don't know if they could do it or not .
None
uh , no .
i didn't .
i think you need to pick that up and read it .
it's quite , uh , it's , it's quite interesting .
it opened the problem .
oh , the drug problem ?
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
actually , he , he wrote that prior to the , uh , something , uh , tied up being able to do .
it was on the present prior to that time .
it , it's quite unusual .
and either he knows somebody
or he has a real good , a real good citizen
because its , it doesn't take close to him .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
but i don't think we're going to have a lot of choice in general , either in central america or the best .
i don't think , uh , i don't think , the , the , uh , problem about drugs is going to be safe any time .
i mean , you know , it , i think it pretty much got with , uh , with the , uh , with the trees and , and with the lake , middle , east ,
things that , that are important about , you know , over the drugs , i think .
i think , i think the big thing is trying to stop here on the front home
and tha- ,
you know , it , it'll take a little bit of time before they'll realize that this is ,
so they're going to have to go the end .
um , yeah .
i think we realize it's hard .
we just don't , we just don't ,
nobody ,
don't want to admit it yet .
None
right .
we still , there's still t- , there's still too many and roll and all that they are down .
yep
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
that's true .
there's too many cases in each house .
they can't agree on anything .
and they have on how far as the policy is the chance .
yeah .
but , but the minute it hit , the paper store , of course , the course and the ankle and the river and the , and , uh , the from georgia , all from new hampshire and roll up and what about a horrible thing .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
of course , these are the same people that also voted in the , uh , and stuff like that , you know .
huh .
but i guess it sounds ,
i guess it's automatic .
depends on how much power you have ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
you know ,
and who you know .
the people have a right to know except about it , what about what it wants to .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
and these are the people that make the sales tax ,
and it , it's probably basically , uh ,
i would not be surprised if the kennedy district of those or some of the kids have a lot of , uh , financial beings in , in central and south america .
probably .
yeah ,
huh .
yes .
i don't drink stories .
good .
don't ever drink stories ,
it's terrible .
None
but , anyway .
but , uh , as far as , as far as , you know , and central south america , we , our policy pretty much , uh , it depends on what we're , who am not having down by the past time .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
we , uh , we , we have a , uh , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a ,
think we're trying to stay , uh , stay friendly with , uh , the , uh , the and , and the interior and because they're overcrowded and so much , uh , inner harbor .
we , uh , we , we have a , uh , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
don't want to them off and have them over with them
and then , because then our economy would be pretty bad .
although we do need to do something about , you know ,
yeah ,
but then , sometimes , there's probably still going on long after we're dead .
it'll still be the same thing .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
those people down there don't really ,
i mean ,
None
you know ,
well , i think basically ,
the same old concerns .
None
right .
uh-huh .
right .
and they'll just pick him again .
and then people , the , the wrong people will just fight their money to do up the top ,
and it'll all ,
it's all righty .
be for nothing .
it's all nicer .
they have to ,
you have the class of
and you have everybody else .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
well , i guess that's about five minutes .
appreciate talking ,
it was very pleasant .
to you .
all righty .
good ,
hey , what was that book ,
talking to you .
what was that book that you were saying to read ,
tom ,
again ?
uh-uh .
it's called a clear and present .
a clear and present .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
he has , it's the one who wrote , uh , red , uh , a bass for a boat .
okay .
all right .
and i think i- , if you read that , i think you'll get a real kick out of it .
all right .
thanks a lot .
all righty .
bye-bye .
bye .
um , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
hi
one thing you know that i always think about when i think of public school
cause i went through the public , um , school system of the community ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , uh , i always felt that i graduated in high school
and i still didn't even i , i couldn't put together a lot of the state of the .
um .
you know what i mean .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
no .
and i , i did well in school
but you tell me to name , you know , five minutes
an i ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
couldn't do it .
None
uh .
and the people are , are leaving there not even some sense of common things .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
one , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that ,
well , talking about public education , um , i'm , we're doing a lot of ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's , we're doing it at n c n ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
we're trying to think the computer science machines ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so that's kind of in a larger field
right .
so it's interesting that you deserve that topic
yeah ,
um , did you do through a public school system or private ?
yeah ,
well , i went through an private state until i was married .
uh-huh ,
did you notice a big difference ?
oh , yeah ,
a big difference .
like in what sense ?
well , um , in , uh , public schools i guess there are , uh , a lot of , of , you know ,
you can take several houses off an hour with us .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , um , private school you couldn't do that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you had to learn .
yeah ,
i work in a temporary category
an they're people that come in , you know , every day to fill out an application ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and they'll have to bring somebody with them ,
and they will show that they like , um , four years of high school ,
yet when it comes to even the magic that's a month on that's ,
uh .
they can't read enough to be able to fill out the weather on themselves ,
that's bad .
it's just incredible .
yeah ,
uh-huh .
really .
so they're making all kind of odd
in college people cannot , i mean , the teachers can't make any tests more ,
and th- , the library all of them was so much .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
it's pretty sorry .
i know ,
um , they , uh ,
i forget
i think it's , um , some place in new york because they're having problems that budget ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they're different i can .
i mean they're not getting rid of any of the sports ,
uh .
or anything like that ,
they're not cutting in any other countries
they're different i can .
that to me try a little , uh , switch in france .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
you know .
so do you go to college right now ?
are yo- ,
yeah ,
it's my last year
you're a , so you're a senior now .
yeah ,
i'm working on my projects trying to graduate school
oh , good for you .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
that's great ,
um , is , is c n university is that , uh , state
n c state .
what did you say ?
n c state .
n c state ,
that's a state university then .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
i see .
and you're from there also ?
well , yeah ,
i was , uh , i was born in a while
and then i lived in ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
most of my life .
i see .
and now i'm back here going to school .
well , pretty soon it's going to get to the point where no one is going to be able to afford to send their kids to college or to do go to college .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
it's just a real expensive .
luckily state is one of the old things .
oh is it .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
well , still though
i mean , you know , thousands of dollars ,
yeah , you're not that bad
oh , well , that's good .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
that's good .
i went to a private university
and , um , i don't know
i look back now
and i , i think that i probably would have done it differently if i , um , you know , could do it over again .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
but , um , i have a lot of friends that went to state or didn't even go to school , some of them ,
and i still feel like they came out just as much as i did .
i really do
and that's probably a pretty sad thing to say
but , um ,
yeah ,
i don't know ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
where did you go ?
i
what ?
where did you go ?
i went to university .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's in garland .
and , um , i really felt like i've been working now for about four years ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and i , i feel like what i've learned is a hundred dollars a lot more times then northern transportation .
oh .
and i know that i'm a member of what i learned in school , you know ,
i , i just probably admit it's a little bit on , on the .
but , um , i don't know
my husband's a blank at the school ,
and one thing she's trying to get in kids , um , let's teach just and writing and just some , the golden retriever ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
she calls that just about some cartoons , um , you know , you don't take what's not yours ,
uh , and if you want to , you know , you don't touch anybody else or whatever you have used .
like no busy , you know ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
no male he'd have anything like that ,
and , uh , the school that has in a , it's , um , that's basically for instance ,
um , there's a large percentage of taxes .
and , um , she's really noticed that even the most of the teachers that work there
i think they don't abuse that type of business as much as you get ,
yeah
that's , uh , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that ,
in some .
sorry .
that they , that they like about pick through the jury and , um , women are more enough to them ,
yeah ,
it's true .
someplace the others .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
and i don't know if it makes them feel good
i mean the teachers do get ,
i mean personally i would get more tired of taking out of someone that wasn't as successful .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
and seeing what they could do it somebody that did in atlanta , uh , in terms of just watching them , you know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
that's not much of a challenge .
that's true .
but he's , do you have any any way you're into when you were graduate .
um , graduate school
oh yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
do you know where you're going ?
i think i'm going to hill .
where's that ?
that's in minneapolis
that's the name ,
oh is that north carolina ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
oh , okay .
never heard of the , uh , weather ?
no ,
i don't know that area .
the c a c n , u s c ?
i just don't know it .
oh , uh ,
i don't get down there very often .
they won the whole s ,
oh , really ,
in fort satisfied too .
well the way i pick the old was four , um , by the state that had the clock go .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so that's how i am all mine ,
so you can tell that i really didn't have that much to do with any of it .
but , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
so obviously you're into education .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
if you can be going ,
my husband went to , is in graduate school actually right now .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i don't know
i give you a lot of credit .
i couldn't do it ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
yeah ,
i know .
i couldn't wait to graduate and have ,
oh .
it be all over .
i can't wait to graduate either ,
i know .
now .
i've got all of this stuff due
oh wow .
bye-bye .
yeah ,
i kind of know what you mean .
well , it was really nice talking to you .
all right .
okay .
good luck .
all right ,
thank you .
all righty ,
take care .
all right ,
bye .
bye-bye .
so .
well , as much as i'd , uh , i'd like to say that i'll be looking for a cop or , uh , or a four or four by something ,
i guess the next car i'll be looking for is a lot of a old door
what kind of a car do you have now ?
oh , we've got a , uh , an older son , uh ,
and then , uh , our , our own a car is , uh , a minivan .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
and we'll probably be looking for something about that , uh , that same style .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
that same kind of four door , hard top style .
you got kids ?
uh , no
but we're planning for it .
okay .
so , uh , in fact , uh , our is a , is a , like a old metropolitan c runs
but it's in pretty good sh- , in really good shape .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
and we've been really pleased with wolves .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
so that's probably where the first place we'd look .
huh .
but , uh ,
well , we've always had , uh , seen that .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh , mostly because my wife's husband will be a fisher teacher ,
that'll do it .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
that'll do it .
um , but , yeah , we're , we're in the same shape .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
i think our next car will be a , you know , some big old big door , uh , something that can flip to the kids baseball and swimming lessons ,
and we've got a lot ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and that's great .
and i d- , drive , uh ,
well i used to drive an inch ,
but it died on me .
so i , i mean i , i , i used to run it , i , uh , where we used to live , i used to live a hundred and forty miles a day .
oh , that's .
and , uh , this is a couple carpet for it .
and it , it , it got up to , uh , uh , i was at sixty-five miles on it ,
and the engine just went .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so i , i , i bought a used , uh , dodge jones ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
which has been okay .
really ?
i , i mean i've haven't had it that long .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but it , it , uh it's been an eighty-five ,
but it only had fifty miles on it when i bought it .
oh , that's .
and i just , you know , i just drive it to work .
so it's just a ten minute miles every day .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so , uh , it doesn't get much of , uh ,
i mean , it's not like i'm putting it through its own .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
but i think , uh ,
and it's a four door which is nice ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but it's still a little bit .
i've got three kids ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
so i , i ,
sounds like you , you need at least like a doctor member ,
yeah ,
that's what ,
or something like that .
i was thinking of ,
was a divorce .
uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
i , i know a lot of guys at work ,
they , uh , the ones that have , uh , families , uh ,
and they still want a kind of sports car .
they've been , uh , a lot of them have been getting these internal s e b y .
oh , really ?
that i guess it's the sports of the population ?
yeah
in fact , it comes with a standard center
and , uh , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
ooh .
and a lot of those .
and it comes with a bigger engine and the things like that .
but , uh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
and usually they're in like black ,
and gun abuse and those kind of sand .
you're not going to see too many , uh , you know , green ones or blue things or anything like that .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
they , they put them in fifty-five colors i guess .
but , uh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
well , my wife wants a lot .
oh , well that's good , i think , i think , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
that's what , you know ,
until , until you look at the price for us
right .
and then you go , what ?
right ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
what would i , besides around and stuff really cool and having a lot of fun , i really would do with this car ?
i know ,
i know .
it's like i , i guess i could fit in it
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
maybe
i went , i went through that when i first got out of , uh , college .
None
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
and when i got there , the first thing i did was trade it in on a microwave .
oh .
and i , i knew that was going to be the only time i could afford a two , uh , sports car .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
but that , that just does not make it as an only car .
it's , uh , it's like i , i would ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
i bought a set of soy cheese and everything it was one of those organizations and carry them .
i had to take them one at a time ,
with the top down .
oh , no !
and it was winter , so i was like in this little bit with the top down ,
and the street in the clock .
yeah
and i drove that one home ,
and then i went back and got the other one and put that in the ,
french and drove that one and home .
and , uh , funny , ours was .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
and , you know , you kind of be terribly good by the kids because i really watched .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
well , i ,
you know , it's funny .
most people that i've talked to did stuff like that when they were in college ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
or , you know , or when they were single anyway .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
they'd , they'd buy themselves a car because it was their last year .
i never did that .
uh , you know , my first car was a toyota worker .
oh , really ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
and , uh , because i got a good deal on it and , uh , that was a little great car .
actually i met ,
that's how i met girls was , because i find out a girl could drive a lot earlier , i , i had never ,
i , i'd learned on an automatic pet .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and so , so i'd go out on where they would teach me how to drive this year .
boy , that's a good deal .
and , uh , in fact i lived one of those people
ah , okay .
and it worked .
well , i'll have to remember that if i ever get in that situation again
yeah ,
it worked all right , real good .
huh .
because i , i know we've , uh ,
that's , that's something that , that we definitely have to go with is an automatic pet .
my , uh , my wife just teaches , a- , i'm , you know ,
she really doesn't want to learn i guess ,
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
the , uh , the standard shift .
i mean , i , i remember once we , uh , we , uh , went , uh , went on , uh , test a drive .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
and we went , uh , we went , uh , we went to a dealership
and , uh , it , it was , she was , she did pretty well .
yeah
but it was one of those things where we just went to a big large shirt and the , uh , jobs kind of take her standard shift
because that was all it was .
it was , it was the same thing ,
it was like , uh ,
a big skirt you're ,
it was a vicious worker with everything on it ,
wow !
but it had a standard shift .
that's weird !
it was the thing i ever saw it .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
and , and , and that's probably why they were trying to sell them , i guess .
huh .
and , uh , we just kind of went back and forth and forth and forth .
she did pretty well after a while .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
but , uh , it's just kind of hard to learn , i guess .
well , my wife ,
i mean , she'd always find hooked with women .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
right .
in fact , the fact a , a has stick shift .
um , okay .
and in , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
this particular coach is the first car that we've gotten that ever had anything .
you know , it's got a lobster , jury ,
oh , that's .
you know , electric group .
you know , it's like , it's like a long penalty except that it's the dodge
yeah ,
you know .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
so , uh ,
oh , well .
well , i guess that's , i guess that's about all i've got to say ,
about cars
well , you , uh ,
the , the thing about this , uh , th- ,
i will say this about the moment .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we thought that was a big car when we bought it .
uh-huh ,
i would think so ,
yeah ,
it , it ,
because it's so big .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
and , and it was delicious ,
it had a lot his ears .
oh , yeah .
we never had it , you know ,
we always had the a m radio .
sure ,
sure .
and , uh , of course this has , that had this party , you know , that can control the back from the day .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and you can change the channels on the , on the radio from the back seat too
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and put s- , someone lived in that .
so .
now , now , that now used to be a luxury ,
but i bet on the next time you buy a car , that's going to be mandatory .
right .
you've got to have that now .
that's right .
that's right .
you're used to it
and you got to have it .
and you've got to pay for it too .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
that's true too .
it ,
and i bet , and i bet it costs twice as much as , as i bought it
it probably does ,
it probably does .
but , uh ,
we , uh , we , we have a , uh , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a ,
oh , well .
well , bill it's been nice talking to you .
nice talking to you .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
you have a good evening .
thanks a lot .
um .
bye-bye .
bye-bye
what kind , h- ,
what kind of cars do you , do you usually drive ?
right now we , i've got a , uh , four year old and a half old and a honda old .
oh , my goodness .
well , we're , we're , we're sort of , sort of a general motors family ,
i guess that's the way we were raised .
and , uh , uh , we were pregnant with t i for a number of years
and when we came back we find something we had five and gotten immediately in the family .
oh , goodness .
yeah ,
and four cars
and we bought some year old cars from the national car .
really ?
at least two of them .
we bought an inch and a buick would be a .
uh , for , you know ,
they each few she's taken miles or something like that .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yep .
and they can show you the quality they've gotten all their own opinions on everything and stuff .
uh , then we've got an eighty-six car who's that we used to be .
my daughter was a freshman in college when we bought it for her .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and we've got a privilege that she bought that used to be .
so we've got four cars for our five speed .
it's like national areas
i bet .
you're one short .
i bet .
and , uh , i , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
but you know , it's interesting the two ,
uh-huh .
and we were in the milk forties business
and he had all these cartons trees
and , and we bought them and all ,
it was almost like
and a hole keeps our friend
and it was almost like the minute we got and bought something a deterrent and , but a it would be like it and going on his own
but , uh ,
yep .
as we got older and got away ,
and then we thought , well , you know , you still could buy our automobile products
and it was probably not that bad .
but , uh , we lived in for t i in nineteen , uh , nineteen , uh , two , three , four and four .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , and , of course you don't buy any vehicles or the house over there
no .
but we bought a baby-sitter
and i have never had a car that i've made more .
i just can't afford them here .
uh , but i , i just loved that car .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , uh , we bought a , uh ,
yeah ,
and we bought a , uh , ford , um ,
which is somewhat similar to the schools .
it's sold in , uh , in the far uh , the same far , uh , uh , far east countries more than here .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but we really liked that .
and have you had experience with other cars than the kids you have ?
well , yeah
we had , uh , we had ,
these are the first cars that i just have a girl who's going to do .
um .
the others were hand through me the last night .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
and those were always at m w .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
uh , and improved .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , uh , we were real happy with them ,
but all the ones that we ever had the , you know , eight , my son's daughter ,
oh , yeah .
really frustrating ,
the b- , the big ,
g m cars .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
and all we had heard was , was a lot of mexican crimes at the smaller ones ,
and we both drive , well , take course waiting day by three days .
sure ,
sure .
and so we wanted a smaller car ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
when we got ready to buy , we needed a car to get the better gas mileage
and quite frankly , we were afraid of the , the , i b m w on the cars .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you know , as far as opposed .
right .
so we kind of ,
when we had our larger cars , we didn't have , uh , keeping them up ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you know , doing the refrigerator and everything on them as long as we didn't have to do it very often .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
but , once they got over a hundred thousand miles on them , all of them , you know ,
it just kind of seemed to be the magic number for them
yeah ,
yeah ,
it seems that something goes every month .
yeah
it ,
and i'm afraid we're going to be in that in another year with all of ours ,
you know ,
we got three and an eighty-four
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and we'll probably be there with all of them .
you know , it's the same thing , you know ,
i don't know whether , uh , you know the bulls and the pitching and ,
well i guess they're successful .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh , but , uh , we went on a family trip to massachusetts
and there were five of us
and five , five of us never go anywhere together here .
fuel , everybody's bringing off in their own direction .
right .
and i rented a buick belt ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and it's the first big car i had since i had my nine yards station down here to sixty thousand .
and it made all the ,
i , i had forgotten what driving a big car was like .
it's like a penny .
it was just nice .
it depends .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
what , uh , i think , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
we , we sold or we , we did in our own bin for our actions .
oh , yeah .
yeah ,
it was a great car .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
it just ,
we ran the sun off right of it .
yeah ,
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
and , uh , you know i've read ,
i'm in the quality business at t i ,
i'm a bunch different
and we're , we're uh , we know ,
we sell ,
i'm in the past show
and we sell to , uh , ford , and g m , uh , g m w .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and there is a , amazing ,
i am just , uh , really impressed with the , the quality that the world's , the population , these companies have put into their actions
and it's , i , it's come out as a result of the smell from the best .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , uh , uh , i ,
and , you know , we used to think ford products were going to be .
i mean i was growing up ,
i was taught when i was growing up , you know , that , that real people that they've seen general motors products ,
and i bought ,
that's right .
ford products .
but just with the quality that academy lives is even on their kids and the way they come into our ,
and they're really , uh , uh , this old motors in those ,
and you know , at least e and are doing that ,
but i really think we're a got , wondering what happened in this summer now .
and i think it's showing up in their eyes .
their colors are pretty much in the community market right now .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , uh , uh , we went to , uh , austin a while to go a book
and we were going to be meeting some of my dad down there to work ,
so we decided rather than drive one of our kids out , we'd rent one ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and we went up to the local budget
and we were going to get a coin shop or something .
None
um .
and we drove that down
and i guess we'll turn that back in .
i bet
we had that for three days .
and i absolutely loved that ,
bye .
no .
uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that .
i wouldn't want to have to pay for the gas , either .
but i absolutely loved that automobile .
and , you know , it wasn't that they ,
driving around down there we have got oldest and sixteen miles a hundred percent ,
but on the bottom down and back i don't sit up high and all that
so i knew what i actually got on the same thing
and it was about twenty-four miles a gallon .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh , and , you know , we just got it out on the highway and put it in january at least about sixty thousand and let it , let it .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and it was pretty good .
are , are ,
um .
are you planning on getting any of the other cars ?
no time soon .
uh , we're , our , our , we won't have any more fee for gardening for four years .
um .
oh , yours is a good .
yes .
so , we , uh , so we don't plan on any more any time though .
both of our cars are getting ,
um .
oh , around sixty thousand miles on them .
oh , yeah .
we drive a lot .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
you got another , another thirty or forty thousand dollars if you get them .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh , we've got ,
probably we'll get something in the next couple years .
my son will graduate from school this year ,
and , and he's going to go to college one year behind us ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it's right ,
in fact , uh , our house is not to the property and the best .
he wants to go to texas tech
and he's probably going to have to go to a year to get some girl in order to get ,
but , uh , the next year when he goes out to he , i'm suppose to go ,
and i want ,
a pickup
a pickup .
i may get one and not let him have it
but , we have been looking at these red agent ,
they , they're very popular around here .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
these , uh , uh , red p c ,
and , uh , we'll probably do something like that ,
uh , uh , bye ,
uh , uh , i don't know ,
uh , the , uh , the credit union has got a problem because you understand what you want to do
and you call this area
and , uh , they go the same price for you .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , and , or , or probably a guy to get that with our friends and , uh , my husband had a huge purchase ,
and he got three thousand dollars off the same stuff here doing it .
really ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
and , uh , uh , you know , you know , you figure out the necessity , look around at the work and get the best price you can and then go and call this guy and , and tell him what you want
and he'll put you in touch with a certain guy , a certain person at that time .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so i'm going to try that the next time i buy one .
i think that would be a good idea .
and , and , so , you know , i can go around and shop and stuff if i can get a better finish on my own .
but , once , one thing that's a pain in the nation in buying them is .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
i've , we've , we've , we've kind of been the types of that will say this , is what we want to spend ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
this is the car we want ,
huh-uh .
and for that price .
and , and we've had a
we , with our ,
when we bought our , the guy was like , you know , we could do this to me ,
and we're just , like , just okay , fine we , we can afford .
we'll go somewhere else .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
you know .
i mean he's like , no , no , no .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
but , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
and , uh , and i , i think that's probably the way you have to do it .
when , when i was young , i went in and bought a , uh , or made a deal on a regular ,
this is nineteen sixty ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and this guy gave me this deal , you know ,
i told him how much i wanted to pay ,
and for every fifty dollars they have to go in and check for the kids and then
and then i'd have to sign something else and then that he could get this rate , uh , we would go ahead and buy .
uh , uh , if he could get this rate i don't want to buy any
and i left there on a saturday afternoon just totally .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i , i was only twenty-five years old or something i , i left there
and i , i , uh , i'd never done this before because i'd always bought my own one guy from the boys and his dad called those ,
and , uh , uh , so i , i got back
and a friend that lived in the apartment had , asked me , uh , uh , if ,
bye .
he said , well , hey , uh , before you go during the week ,
he says call this friend of mine at least at the point .
there was a guy that owned a hook up there .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and i called the guy and made an inch to come up to twelve days
and just driving fifty miles out of town , it was a nice town ,
and , i mean it was a difference in four of five minutes ,
but this was four hundred dollars in only twenty-five hundred ,
goodness .
is all we paid for cars in those days .
and , uh , uh , so i called the back guy in the dallas
and i told him that ,
None
and i said i want to my uncle and , and don't try to keep the money out and i'm going to , maybe they stopped on it payment
and he says oh , that's high ,
None
and i told him ,
he says , somebody's taking you for a week .
and i said , no somebody took me for a machine for five months
that's right .
and , uh , uh , and i , i find that , uh ,
and for the longest time then i drove up to me because it's
and , and the , and the other sisters since then ,
and , and some of his friends are taken it over the past
and that ,
but
and , since then i had
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
well yes ,
we do have yours in that right ?
and it ,
how bad is it ?
do you have cable or do you like in ?
well it , it
some ,
i think it depends on , uh , you know , what the , uh , the clock ,
and like right now , it's , uh , it's kind of strange , you know ,
just , it's hot ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and the news they needed , used to death or something
but it's , it's in favor of this , this year
and i ,
yeah .
i think so ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
and we have , uh , texas , texas which is sort of between here , you know , the trend toward us ,
i mean it's still part of , it's part of the houston districts .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
what do you think is your career or what it is .
well , i think it's gone
and i think it's cars .
you do ?
you really think cars have a lot that now we get taken out of the gas ?
i don't , i ,
well maybe not ,
but , it , it sure , it really , it seems like ,
you know , it ,
i , i know that i'm when i'm , i'm behind a car
and , uh , sometimes , uh , i really can understand texas reports and things like that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you know , comes right into my air conditioning
and , you know , my head and my wife ,
i'm so standing down there right now ,
um , i , i , i , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
my goodness .
i don't know if it's , uh , if it's really from what's cheap , you know , right now , well , stuff like that and stuff ,
that's part of it ,
but , um .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i think a lot of it's dark .
i also think , uh , that , uh , there is a certain amount that comes from seattle
but it's mostly from their homes .
i don't think the most recent schools are just , uh , organized .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i think that , uh , i think that , uh , uh ,
if , uh ,
i , i , i heard a couple of music a day
something to the effect that if they could just pay to get twenty percent , or , all take the cars off the road that have been , uh , say recently within nineteen seventy-five ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
you mean , uh , fifty percent of gas involved from that i was from ,
from , from cars
that is , not , not total and just get dogs ,
okay .
oh , uh-huh .
so , that i think would be extremely good .
but i happen to drive an old show because you know the same for a half
and it just keeps getting , uh , just gives me a big job
and i don't have an incentive to get rid of it as long as it keeps running and not take it as quickly .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
right .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but i don't have any incentive to get out of it until it depends .
right .
and , uh , that may be part of the problem .
uh-uh ,
do you all have pollution in your biggest , part of the country , uh , from industry ?
yeah ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
oh , uh , yeah ,
it's , it's , uh , pretty heavy up here i think
but i think it's mostly in , and what i really , uh , believe is the , the main problem .
and , and , uh ,
and , uh , uh , people , uh , i don't think are paying as close to somebody in this area for their reasons .
i , i , we seem to have a high , uh , testing up here in maryland and be there .
really ,
yeah ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
like what happens ,
any particular kind of all kinds or stuff ?
well , for instance cancer seems like to be pretty impressive
and , uh , i think , uh ,
of course america don't care of enough ,
but , uh , th- , this was the second , like a second ,
my wife's a registered worker ,
and i think this state was like this second year from the middle of , in terms of , uh , welfare budget for all just kinds .
and i can't help say that's all reason i can pay around from california .
i just don't know exactly what it is being ,
but i just can't believe it is .
um .
now we have a lot of pollution being trained by , uh , uh , what is the , like the twelve and eighty and nine .
they use eighty miles in plano , the trees and in the library and have ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and they use an adult in the car ,
and that's also what's called their idea to handle the oil anyway .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and i can't help believe if it's good enough to say the military amount of itself , they could not be as a role in our company ,
and having all kinds of problems ,
and .
well what can we do about the , the , the , the air conditioning problem ?
well they're working now ,
i know and uncle and , uh , these other countries are working and , uh , uh , to try to come up with a substitute for ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and who ever does is going to make , uh , a problem with .
because if they ever come up with a big necessity in bed with things , uh , then ,
is that also what's in , uh , what , uh , ?
well they used to be ,
but they made them out of it that would be .
even , so , so the majority is still that ,
right .
but it doesn't have anything that's supposed .
no ,
they , they , they passed a law and made them a few more down of the windows and all that ,
uh-huh ,
well that's good .
and that was a move in the right direction .
we are doing some things to try to correct the problem .
but there are more things we could do
and getting rid of old cars , like i said is one way to help the correct thing .
uh , uh , just trying to think i be careful , uh , with the way you handle garbage ,
i notice in this state ,
i don't know if you're doing it in texas or not yet ,
but in this state we have special containers now we have to put all our cans and bottles and plastic and , uh , you know , containers in ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
here , they've just started , started doing that ,
it's , it's , you know ,
you're not , you don't have to ,
but m- , you know ,
i know i am .
i save ,
yeah ,
well we are doing it pretty lax in our area too .
but they , uh ,
uh-huh .
they have a lady that goes around like a pound and
and she won't someplace your little bit .
no kidding ,
really ,
oh .
and if they find a bottle or a can have anything like that in your trash ,
is that right .
yeah .
well , we need to do something ,
we need to get serious about it .
yeah ,
you ,
right ,
you've got to get people to see i- ,
and i've always wait at least of them , uh , can cut pollution , uh , from , uh , uh , from just throwing it in a dump , or , or , or where , ever used to do that with it , maybe used to burn it .
they've stopped that up here too .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but that , that will cut by death penalty .
because you get a lot of out of these programs , i think , and , uh , somebody would have to ,
for awhile and glass , they go to us every time on .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but on , on the other hand , i don't think they're doing .
but plastic things like the , uh , and they may be ,
i'm not sure of that .
how much does , uh , did you pick more trees and things like that ?
oh i think that's very important to do .
too .
i , i really think that , uh , trying to get along with your environment and it does it is a very , very important thing .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , uh , that can help to cut pollution , i guess .
i , i don't know how much trees actually act as well in terms of the military rules , or change it in the air .
i would hope that they would help some , though .
that's for sure .
i think , uh , it seems like there was going on , around here , that , you know ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and some of the stuff that they weren't supposed to do that somebody out , you know , like in the middle of the night , they would go ahead and do it anyway .
i think they got caught .
oh good .
but i wonder how much of that kind of stuff , you know , goes on .
well that , uh , that i think may go on a lot
and the reason i think it may be a lot of go on is just a book , you know , somebody happened to stay at night or anything .
i don't think we have a tremendous subscription , uh , not a musician on television .
uh , we have good at , in least this state and , and several of the states and probably hear these people , too ,
because we have to go down , uh , once a year here in maryland and get out there and collect chemicals for already beat .
uh , we have to , uh , we have to have a state every year .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
do you all have that ?
uh , no ,
we don't have a state brand ,
so , i , i , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , because i don't know if they were going to be a lot of people that are going to be able to do that .
which i ,
i don- ,
i would think ,
but any time you sell a car or a buy it car has to be in this state .
so i'm , i'm glad , that you know , they check , they want to check everything in their office ,
or , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
i don't know ,
uh , that's something that you'd have to check just with your hands .
but in this state we have to , uh , pay eight dollars and a half a half to go to a , an american pool once and a half of our cars are one of these countries that are , have been starting in nineteen eighty .
but that's all they check for ,
they don't check how good ,
None
no ,
no ,
we don't have to say that .
now , i'm in maryland ,
in virginia they check that every two years , i think .
we do that , every year ,
and i think that's a good idea too ,
None
but i think it's a good idea .
None
and it's also required in virginia , uh , a state old to , to this one ,
and that's , that goes a long way to keep saving up .
well i'll have to check ,
i'm not sure if , if our state membership would be ,
once a year has to do , you know ,
if they check the , uh ,
uh-huh ,
well if they don't i would imagine in they'll get a problem with jury , there's got to get it around , you know .
and if they don't do something i would certainly uh , uh , you know , who's not willing to be able to , uh , be in terms of , uh ,
oh , i would
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
i'm for anything that up the air conditioning or the water or , or , or anything .
oh yeah ,
i , i agree .
now that's another area we haven't even seen
and that is water pollution and most of the other types of , uh , of , uh , like food .
i mean you , you hardly ever hear , anybody hear anything like anybody else .
but i think there we have a pretty good handle on occasion of these countries in this world ,
so , uh , hopefully we're not getting too much in the way of , uh , united states now in the food .
but water pollution , uh ,
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i know a lot more people are going to own t v .
well
and that's not necessarily the answer either
because they've found out that that's just comes out of its peers .
yeah ,
an- ,
yeah
so , i , i , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , because i don't know if they were going to be a lot of people that are going to be able to do that .
but a lot of these , uh ,
some of this
well , you know , a lot of people have own stuff ,
in fact in this area too
and , uh , you know ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
and i , i know a lot of people , you know , have that
and , you know , you have to wonder if that , you know , have an expert on them too much ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
if they don't , i- , they don't get it checked .
yeah ,
None
because it seems , uh ,
when i was a kid growing up down , uh , i used to go out in the country where my wife were in
and we had a well ,
it was one of those that are ,
i forget what you call those things ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , and that was some of the best water pump ,
i mean , i can still to this day care sometimes that comes up .
when we were ,
when i was growing up i lived in , in alabama ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
and their water pump came from , uh , spring .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and it was like ice cold , spring or twenty
and i guess parts of the , the city still ha- , you know , get that ,
but , uh , that was , that was really wonderful .
oh , i bet it was .
it was really , really good .
yeah ,
the- ,
once it's been an if it's a deep enough , uh , it's all through the earth and everything that i think , uh ,
it depends of course where you are .
a good well , though , i think is very healthy
the american express situation in ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
the last college i know was of the military and the average of the children for , uh , the drug testing , uh ,
and i support that a lawyer .
i'm not sure we have the right solution to it ,
but at least we're , we're going to the end of the problem .
and , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
the end of cookbook .
uh , the problem is here ,
but the end of truly is there .
that's true .
very definitely so .
in fact i think a lot of the ,
i've been to , uh , israel for t v .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i've never been to other parts of south america ,
but , uh , i have been to hawaii ,
and they need some down there
and i'm sure that , uh , as an hour it's not , they look for it ,
but there is not exactly a lot of , uh , physical responsibility there . ]
no .
yes ,
right .
very proud of that respect .
and i , i think that , uh , they need to be recycled , and , uh ,
but they need to learn how to stand on their own , uh , two feet old .
i agree .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i think that for so long power prices , uh , uh , find this way in the hands of such a few that not the middle class that we , we chose .
oh , no , the , and the only social units is a good .
i know ,
are extremely poor .
that's correct .
i know , uh , some of the areas in , in texas way they're poor ,
but now there's some of those , uh , uh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
and , uh , the worst rules i've ever had i think , uh , someone was eating out of , uh , a lot of garbage on the streets in , ryan .
and , and just very happy to get that .
oh , yes .
yes .
i have a brother who spent two years in january .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and this is very much his , you know , that bothers the rich are so rich and the poor are so poor .
oh , the , there's a joke ,
the , the federal and uh , uh , there are all sorts of oil doing that
and , in a way ,
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and there's , there's a sad day .
i guess all are responsible about really ,
but there's a joke about the , uh , from illinois america that came to visit a degree in the u s and was taken his home for her
and the , uh , home was a couple of years .
they had five or six , you know , and , and , you know , a lot of expensive , uh , and all that ,
and the trim is , but i know what you make a computer is a senior ,
how can you afford all of this ?
and he said , come to show you
and he walked out in the backyard
and the , uh , said you do see that there is stuck in there ?
and the aunt said , yes .
and he came up late
and he said fifteen percent .
he said , you see that school over there ?
and the corner were , yes ,
and he pot , his wife and said five and fifteen ,
so , i , i , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , because i don't know if they were , you know ,
oh , gosh .
so the next year the went to hawaii was the back to visit the was and a half to him in his home
and it was twice as large and one as many times as a variety .
he said , well i know how poor is the country ,
how can you afford this , uh , in a little bitty country , uh ,
and he , he said , come to these guys
and he walked out the backyard
and he said , do you see that over there ?
and the characters looked
and he couldn't see anything ,
he said , no .
and the longest , his brother and then got it in four or whatever
so , i , i , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , because i don't know if they were , you know ,
yep
yeah ,
that , uh , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
it's a sad story
but , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
mama , absolutely
yes ,
yes ,
but it , uh , it is a problem .
i know .
uh , i have a sister-in-law who is from school
and her family ,
her father was a fairly , uh , high relations under the same .
and when that went down the afternoon they had to get out .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and seventeen children ,
um .
uh-huh .
you know , two here , three here , one there , you know , this kind of thing ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
and now , uh , of the two kids are played back or something ,
but the rest of them now have their own american players and all are ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , you can't think .
well , the , the other person i think of their minds to , to say , to do the things ,
yes .
and t-shirts now is in , in the military .
and it shows the , the last resort such , a problem with them .
yes .
and yet they're so ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
oh , the child stories , you know , are just just realistic .
and they're , they're so rich in there or something .
they're very rich in oil and all the food .
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and they're very rich in gold and , very rich and , in , uh , giving as many kids and , uh , as far as the trees and , uh , and , and , and all of types of , uh , containers
but they ,
and the rest .
yes ,
and , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know ,
but they don't have ,
it's sort of like it ,
they don't have the ability to hear it .
the technology .
right .
and they , they're very ,
well , i , i , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
and , you know , they're very willing to be taught in many cases , though ,
but , you know , there's just always this kind of disappointing
i think that when they receive help from us , they want it ,
but , they don't want it , i mean
you're you're exactly right .
it's kind of a catch twenty-two .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it , it's sort of reminds by the , uh , world computer and the biggest department does not afford to do enough
because they offer these , i don't think they're going to do .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
so it's sort of a sudden of the giants , uh , things .
they need it ,
and they need to live up to certain neighborhoods and whatnot ,
but uh , then don't .
of course it's a very mild government , uh , situation , too .
well , i , i , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
and i think that , you know , it ,
somewhat a little student ,
but some of those drugs are , you know ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they , they know that by that they're losing our school that that's the way to bring us to our office , more on their level .
you know ,
you know , that's really , uh , kind of a far bit fan ,
i know ,
and i don't think people probably think those things ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
well the ,
but it's like in any event we're hearing the same ,
yeah .
i think it would be cheaper to buy it and buy it ,
which would still give the , uh , the interior in here and in america and the , uh , the money that they wanted to go , and go to the illegal market for .
in the long run .
and it would save the u s money in the long run in how much they were trying to do ,
and in the short run probably too .
true .
course , then could , you know , at , at some point , you could ever be able to turn around and then that was run in the oven .
no ,
no .
you know .
and , i , i think we're making an article that would be very good .
right .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i mean even , their , even legal guy are going to do that as many income now from the medical areas , view of employment
traditional shirts ,
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
they're certainly legal ,
but they're certainly not healthy .
well , have we come up with a solution yet , so ?
no ,
not that i know
but it's been fun about it i suppose .
at any rate ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
well , one of these days , i mean , i hope he's going to take some way , the answering machine for the only reason .
well , let's just hope that the little that be , uh , have to , time a little bit in once a while to , to , in some sense of lawn and you know when i do it
but , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
i agree .
well , it's been nice talking with you .
yes ,
it has .
i appreciate it ,
and , and tell you another stuff i don't , i have a book back home , too .
this is fun ,
very good
it's kind of nice to , to see why she did , you know ,
all right ,
thank you .
bye now .
bye .
gun control seems to be a rather ,
yes
so .
None
yeah ,
so .
so .
so .
so .
so .
the acid return down and ,
so .
right .
so .
so .
so .
i guess you could put a dollar figure on it if you really want to make that kind of an effort and , like it that .
so .
so .
so .
so .
not the most important city
yes
so .
right .
so .
so .
so .
so .
yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
i don't even keep the gun in the house ,
right .
so .
so .
it's a hard , hard topic , i guess .
None
they do ,
so .
so .
so .
so .
so .
w- , seeing this year ,
so .
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i was going the wrong direction .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
so .
so .
so .
so .
so .
boy .
so .
i mean it ,
right .
it took us rather
so .
having worked at one time in baltimore ,
so .
i don't know if you're in the big city ,
dallas .
are you ,
dallas ?
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's a big city
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
so .
if you live anywhere real close to that ,
the safety is ,
some people cared that they need a gun to make sure that they aren't going to get rid of the newspaper and of break picking up , you know .
so .
so .
once ,
so .
so .
right .
so .
so .
so .
if he's got a customer or whatever that don't want it at all you ,
right .
so .
None
especially myself , now i'm a native ,
so .
so .
so .
None
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
right .
once you're surprised , it's too late .
that's right .
so .
that's right .
we- ,
so .
right .
so .
that's right .
so .
None
so .
it's hard to know the original population ,
so .
right .
so .
uh-huh .
then you have a right to have that way ,
so .
that's right .
i know
so .
no .
they didn't have this way back then
no ,
that's true .
so .
that's unbelievable part-time .
that's right .
they're man given a lot
so .
so .
right .
so .
they can go live in another country if they want .
so .
that's how i feel , too .
i know ,
where's here where i work ,
so .
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
that it's not ,
so .
right .
so .
so .
so .
None
right .
so .
so .
so .
so .
that , to me , would not be an invasion of thing .
right .
so .
yeah .
right .
so .
course , some of them do .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
so .
tends to , tend to only have the best people .
most does think
right ,
oh , yeah .
so .
that's right .
it's very difficult to ,
so .
i got a couple of calls waiting on me ,
so .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
so .
okay , bye .
bye-bye now .
uh , our children are both , uh , basically , adults .
they , we've , we've got two .
uh , one is twenty-one ,
and one is twenty-five .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and they , they still live at home .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
well , that's , that's a little bit for , uh , for children of that , and , have to both of them that age at home .
but , uh , i guess the activities that , uh , we have are with them , uh , pretty few and far between .
actually the , they're both going on their own kind of the time .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh
so , uh , most of our activities are , you know , just kind of type things about what's going on in the family and what they're doing and that kind of thing .
well , we have a , uh , three year old and a one year old .
and , uh , so you know it keeps us pretty busy as you know .
sure it does .
and , uh , most of the time with a three year old we're trying to , to get him , uh ,
well , we play usually in the evening when , when i get home , you know , about five o'clock or so until about eight , you know , with the expense of dinner .
because in the front or playing uh-huh and , uh , like pull me off the , you know , off the ball and let him hit a lot of baseball .
uh , since we just got here we got the , uh , uh , two little two movies with writing with them for him ,
and he really likes riding that for something .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , yeah .
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
so , you know ,
and trying to admit we went to that and everything , uh , and playing them and everything ,
he really likes that .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
and , uh , the one year old just kind of keeps up and everything ,
trying to do everything he does .
yeah ,
is the one year old a lot ?
no ,
it's a girl .
a girl ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
yea- ,
ours , uh , the older one is a girl ,
so .
and the , and the younger one is a boy ,
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
uh , i guess , uh , what i see is so far as , uh , the , uh , uh ,
i don't know what kind of a city club is just ,
but , of course , uh , richardson is in the dallas area .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and i think , uh , the big city , uh ,
activities for , for children now are ,
they're good
but there's so much , uh , potential seem , you know ,
that you really have to watch your children so many now
that , uh , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you can't let them grow up the way , the way i grew up , you know .
i , i'm from a smaller town in east texas .
and i could , you know , go and do , too , much drug afford i have to do ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh , my whole life .
uh , you know , i never , never had to worry about the bad guys being out there .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , uh , you know , i find it's , it's quite a bit different now
that , uh , you know , you have to watch your children so many , uh , then keep up with them .
i , i feel like , uh ,
that it's , it's really a sad way on , uh , you know , a life in general ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that , uh , you know , that old parents be allowed to grow up , uh , you know , without really close to weapons .
well , i , i agree with that ,
and i seem , i seem to feel the same way , you know ,
even just when i grew up and everything .
and , and , the way it is now you get a lot of is , is at least and everything .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh , the only other thing i have noticed is though that , uh , it seems that there's a lot of been more of , days at least what we had done with
and , and the looking , you know ,
just start not even ,
not really looking for a school for him but , uh , like a preschool or something that he would go for a couple hours a couple days or something .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
for , for a three year old it's that , uh ,
there's a lot of pressure on , on , on , on the education and what children should be before they teach him .
right .
and , and it seems like it's a lot more than the- , they need to know and be able to do when we are when the , when i had to go in t- , hey , in wisconsin .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
and it seems like it's more , uh ,
you know , i don't know .
they're making that kind of , uh , or just , uh , you know ,
kids just because of the computer age or whatever , it just , they know more when they get , you know , to be five or six or something .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
but , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
um , i guess looking at , uh , at , at least when our children are talking to , uh , what you know , what i had to go through in school .
the , uh , there i- , there does seem to be a lot more in the army .
it's a lot more complicated .
a lot more available , of course .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , this ,
so much more to learn now that it makes it really more difficult , i would think .
i , i would probably have a hard time getting through school myself .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh , you know , just ,
or at least it would be a lot harder than it was when i went to school .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
one thing is i got a home computer or something
and , uh , i play , uh , with the three year old
i play some computer games and stuff like that .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
college glass like , you know , type games ,
right .
the interior , things like that .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
and , uh , he's , he really likes it
and , uh , i think it's not because the subject that , uh , you know , it gives him the idea with the computer
because it sure looks like that's going to be able to , you know , the big thing for a long time .
huh ,
and given ,
yeah ,
i think , uh ,
given that knowledge and stuff with it
and he seems to enjoy it .
so .
and , uh , of course , the one year old hasn't been there , hasn't gotten home
but , uh ,
and the other thing we try to do is , uh , since the here is here uh , i pick him up for , and , uh , for , different activities like the , at lake like the center or something like swimming ,
right .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
you know , uh ,
or , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
there's a little bitty book that we just don't have to do for a year or so .
and , uh , you know ,
where they go for an hour or so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know ,
because , uh , when he was a baby that we did the same to college
and he really liked it
so we're going to do that with our daughter too .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
that , uh , uh , watching a little , a little boys play is , that is kind of fun .
i can't imagine th- , them having to be much as the kids ,
had watching them
i know .
well , we were just talking about that too .
and i guess it's not really realistic it's just a kind of , well , the ball around the morning for ,
right ,
yeah
see what happens
the , the regular library really was that ,
but , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
but , uh ,
yeah ,
when ours was a ,
he ,
i guess he was probably five or six , you know , when he first started playing there .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , uh , and that was , that was more fun to watch those boys trying to , trying to vote the ball down and the car .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh ,
and it's ,
i guess , that was , you know , as important , uh , as much important to the parents as it was to the children that , uh , you know , to get out and watch the kids play ,
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i guess one of the things that i think about is a , talking about education , uh , i kind of feel like , uh , uh , that , the , the school systems in this , particularly in this area , the area are paying off not control enough .
the , the students have a little too much , uh , too much .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
excuse me .
um , an- , uh , and the , and the kind of thing to do i guess
but , you know , you ,
the , sometimes
you have to be under control so much when they're out
but when they're in school they don't , they have quite , as much as control ,
right ,
right .
over them as , uh ,
right .
as what i would liked to have seen .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh , uh , i kind of feel like there's , there's too much going to say on , at home .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , uh , you know , it seems to , uh , to give him to be not , you know , as you not know , it's not as much education .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you know , they're , they're there for a good time .
right .
and , you know , to , to see how they can get with by .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
well , i know of number of people that are in the , uh , in the school district , uh , uh , in san antonio , uh ,
and , uh , it seems like it's ,
a lot of the problem is to , you know ,
you always have the lack of things
but it seems to be getting worse and worse
and so they don't the press line to spend on , to give them as much as , as ,
right .
kids need .
and , uh , you know ,
but , uh ,
that's just a problem that who knows how much i might , to come out to be able to work .
but , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that .
so .
but , uh , i , i don't , i don't know
i think , uh , you know , some of the thing has to do with , uh ,
with the civil rights program .
not that the civil rights program is pretty good
but that there's ,
it carried over ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
into , you know , individual rights
and it , you know , hang to ,
well , tom , just tonight , i was working on my car out of necessity ,
and i had , uh , uh , had a long problem of my dad's sort of business ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
uh , this is the type of , uh , switch where you flip the , the , the turn out of the pool and when i would , uh , put it in the minimum forties situation and the boat would go out completely ,
which is even worse than just not that they're getting better
exactly .
and i had that , it was the back that ,
and , uh , this is , uh , an older car ,
it's a buffalo bedroom for t i
so i had to put debt the key , uh ,
which i had done ,
and tonight i went out and , uh , at least the library in the only , part to that lower that is apparently the problem ,
it's not in the switch , because it does the same thing with the new orleans .
oh .
so i'll be able to carry with that dog and , uh , that , uh , something that they , uh , you know , that will accept it ,
although it's been back from the box it's always been well , too .
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh , i had done what i could , i'm still by a looking at that regard and i did have the car of , uh , pretty much decided that that had to be the problem .
i talked to one about it ,
and he the paper has been a lot .
uh , but i've not , you know ,
i really don't know what the problem is that .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it , it , the other switch are the same corn room , uh , that turns the value or on , uh , which is the rolling on it or , uh , it might be the illegal policy
but , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that .
yeah , i know ,
uh , when working with the , uh , pressure , there is , uh , usually a , a special bin that the clock .
do you have a separate card for your high grades as opposed to your low penalty ?
i don't know ,
i should look at that .
good-bye .
i don't remember seeing one in the , uh , in the future i'll have to go and look at that back .
yeah ,
i don't even know if my current cars have a separate bit .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i know sometimes when you think there are things running while they're at the same thing , like the air conditioner like to , well , there's one makes the key people ,
but sometimes the extra that a senior teacher was able to make a jury used to be a , uh , the use of a , of a drug rights .
yeah ,
that's a good idea .
so , that's a possibility .
what i've found , although when that was , uh ,
right .
and i hope that that's the case this time .
is this a , a mail order line in front that they're , in terms of for , uh , old for them ?
right ,
who ,
exactly it's out of the somewhere .
um , so it's not , c h v or something like that .
no ,
it's not .
None
but it is not either ,
it's obviously doesn't quite bit ,
so it must be for a different , uh ,
so i'll have to try to return that as well .
yeah ,
have you found any , uh , uh , reliable service people in the block ?
well , i had one person that i used to be years and bought on this car ,
because i've owned this car since it was , this year
and , uh , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
oh , yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but it's over like in the saudi arabia where i'm broken up on the area and computer has i used him for a couple years ago ,
and the last time i called him back out it was that had a million dollars
instead of , uh , all cars , he has to go out where he was only , uh , daughter on the other cars ,
i'll be darned .
None
but he doesn't work on cars don't care as , and the kids were very happy about it then a little bit of looking to it .
so , uh , uh , i may have to check with that because ,
None
so , i'll , uh , i should be able to take it in and check that part in it .
i've not had to receive any other parts , because they were saying that ,
now , i've had , had pretty good ,
i just , uh , did , uh , have to get a , uh , a lot of these old rights , uh , we'd like , uh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i loved it at thanksgiving ,
and i had found that it had a four minute day ,
and i should have checked more money and still on a job better of the nation ,
because i didn't take it in right away , and a half a little bit building .
uh , some of the didn't seem more , you know , when they just had to provide them down to get it to swim or something to ,
and as it turned out , it was a full offense ,
and i could have gotten it forward to free
oh , my goodness .
but i had to take it in ,
yeah ,
uh , but it didn't do me any good , because i had , i had missed the n about a week or two .
oh , no .
so i didn't even , i didn't really , uh , even bring it up when i went to pick it in .
but , uh , that's really my only experience in the past year because i've been to a good example because of a sudden .
well , ours wasn't within the last year .
i guess it's been within the last two years , uh ,
bye .
and it's one with the , uh , electronic o the same shirt and , uh , how ,
i don't know what else it all like , but the fuel corps and stuff around and things of that sort of ,
and we found that the , uh , uh , we were having two problems .
it was fast when , you know , started the way to the war , that i mean at the ground or a hill , under our car ,
and , it , when you first moved it into it is always required to go back up to the playoffs ,
and knowing that , you always had to keep your foot on the long responsibility ,
otherwise it would just be married away from you .
good grief .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and the other problem would have immediately would be , she would say , uh , be driving along , uh , uh , like coming to a stop sign , but not yet at the stop sign and the engine just would quit .
so , we took it back to the , uh , what van and asked them to check it out ,
and at first time he thought it was a real pain ,
so they laughed houses
and the problem didn't go away ,
so we ended up taking it back again ,
and i don't know why they don't look at these things that first time ,
but the second time around they looked at their , uh , perhaps and their own reports or federal region from whatever ,
huh .
and , and they had a tendency to the main problem we were that apparently had a unanimous verdict in the , uh , computer control payment ,
my goodness .
huh .
which they fortunately they under warranty , because it was about a three hundred or three hundred and fifty percent of dollar and , uh , so once they call it , the , the car , the seemed to work fine for a period of time ,
and now it seems to be ,
we don- , we're not the rat ,
but we're still a very sturdy ,
okay .
what do you think about it ?
uh , well , immigration ,
i know they're really strict right now because my husband , is from out of the country
and , uh , we had to go through a whole , very long process to , uh , to , uh , someone that the government was , uh , uh , me are not really good .
and not to be a civilian here .
that's hilarious ,
yeah ,
i think that's , uh , i think it's a little crazy .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i worked with french people for about two years ago
and just , it was incredible to me to see the things that they had to go through when they were really in the best of the world .
yeah ,
that's true .
i mean , you can't just come over to the country because , uh , you want to .
right .
you know , that's not good enough .
you have to have a , have to have a good idea of , so many , who aren't .
right ,
exactly .
not a good , not a good easy way to get in .
yeah ,
i think , you know , i think in a lot of ways the law is good because it to , to protect , you know , the people who are in the states .
exactly .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
my mother , uh , actually knew a woman in this state to be used to men that ,
n- , she'd never been against them
and she'd just get money for it .
oh , you're kidding .
huh-uh .
so , uh ]
sounds like a lot of fun .
yeah ,
it's amazing to me how , how many things they would allow to consider before you , you know , you can come in .
exactly .
right .
but , i mean , with the new way it's , it's tough to see .
yeah ,
it's kind of frustrating , too , for those who are good saying .
exactly .
you know , i think ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
well , and , you know , uh , my grandparents came to this country just made a better life , you know , they got here and ,
but now it's a , you know , it's so strict that you can't do that just .
right ,
exactly .
and i think it's important that they , you know , they allow a good number of people in every year
right .
i agree .
and i just ,
i don't know ,
i have , personally i have a problem with it ,
exactly .
i think , that , you know , if someone wants to come in and they can be able to find their kids and they're going to be a good citizen that we shouldn't spend our money .
uh-huh .
they're going to be a former citizen buff .
and , you know , i , i believe that if you put along on the future , you know , when you send them back to their country .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
and , i think a lot of times we're so busy trying to keep them out that we're spending as much money as we would just put them in
and , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
well , of how many of illegal activities have , have , have been , uh , uh , sent back to mexico just to find their way .
yeah ,
and that's , that's what i think .
you know , i , i have a dog
because , like i said , i worked with a lot of those
and they'd been able to three or four times
and just basically what they do is they get caught when they wanted to go home for christmas .
that's right ,
that's our money .
or for any other time .
yes ,
that's true .
but , i think , you know , i think all in all of our stuff .
i think the general idea is good
but , but there could be some work done in the area .
i , i think
i , i agree .
well good
uh , i , uh ,
anyway , do you have anything else in the , uh , the subject that you might want to talk about ?
boy this is about the moment of , uh ,
but , i , i don't really see any , any changes that i think of really is right now
other than i think they ought to take , you know , on a case by case and not necessarily make it a , uh , political express .
yeah ,
absolutely .
i think a lot of times we take , you know , basically we want to
because if you , if you have , it's a lot easier to get in .
exactly .
money and stuff .
yeah ,
and i think , you know , it should be more of a thing that's based on how consumer , you know .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know , you know , they don't have to be able to do that .
and that it should be supposed to be
and then not like the united states ,
basically , it's not who you know ,
it d- , it doesn't become a thing of who you know , but , how but the type of person you are .
i agree .
and it should be based on those kinds of things so the good people , like probably the children ,
yeah
well , we got him past that ,
well , great .
but , uh , i know there's a lot of other people out there ,
would probably do a good job here .
yep .
well , let's see ,
is there anything i believe in
i think that's it .
is this like a very short call ?
no ,
i'm not sure how long they're supposed to be ,
but , i've enjoyed it .
it's good hearing your , your point of view .
and i think that's neat .
i think we agree a lot on that
i did , too .
and i've learned something from it .
well , it was nice talking to you .
well , thanks ,
i'm glad you're home .
you have a good evening , all right ?
you , too .
thanks ,
bye-bye .
bye .
well , seems to me the , one of the reasons that people don't go out to see they're immediately and look for the whole reunion instead .
well , i agree with the most of the organization ,
but i also , uh , think that people don't realize that their boat , vote will , make a difference .
uh , they feel like that , you know , it's going to go if it's going to go to the war
and their one little vote is not going to make that much money
and it's , just why make the effort .
well , sometimes , except enough one , the vote has gotten in the situation .
well , i agree with that
and i , and i do know that , you know , all those are intelligent schools
and , and they do make a difference .
uh , also i think that people have a tendency to , to vote in the grocery stores and not vote in the , the more local services .
well , it's kind of strange
because in the local elections is the ones that have most the influence on their lives .
exactly ,
and , i , i even have a tendency to do that .
and i have to really make a deterrent to , to get involved with , uh ,
i live , i live in a suburb of d c
and , uh , so i really have to make an effort to read the local paper and see what's going to be because that you know .
but i , i think on the whole , most people don't , uh , feel that way .
or don't look , even at it .
i think they just don't even ,
i , i don't think they're conscious of that .
well , maybe part of the problem is they don't , they have any money .
well , that may be true , too .
i hadn't thought of that .
you know , in some of the european countries , they have had parties that would be able to do
and then lot of more likely come out to vote than this in this country .
uh-huh ,
right .
and sometimes it's , uh ,
well , not sometimes , but many times it's the first has to pay the money on any ,
and , and things get into , uh , the baby down .
well , maybe it's a matter of , you know , pink that is .
uh , i think magic would ,
i , i did some work for the , uh , aids w or , uh , uh , various times in a while
and , i think there are some friends that goes to , uh , do some good abuse , uh , things .
they don't get a lot of vegetables .
they don't get a lot of , uh , activity .
no ,
now , other areas that i've worked in , like in the , they would just have the ability me
and it would just , you know ,
that was not a lot of community women
and those were people that would mostly vote out .
well , i think part of the problem is the biggest problem on order too much .
in , you know , they have a set period of time
and , and for awhile , it's just ,
in this country , it seems like it's a relatively good machine .
it's a , it's an avid gardener
and it's expensive then
and it , it , uh , it's a lot of higher things .
uh , maybe more realistic and , uh , more humid to the issues .
well , the , they don't want to spend the time
or they don't have the money .
exactly ,
exactly
and it , it , it , it , it was , it was a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a ,
i , i can't b- , i just can't believe that ,
i've , i've worked in a couple of local cars .
i just cannot believe the credit cards are just on cable .
well , it's a matter of name of mine .
people aren't going to vote for someone we never had heard of .
oh , well , i agree with that ,
but also ,
and i , and i'm not for sure how much is spent ,
but do you know ,
that's one thing ,
if a , if the time wasn't so ,
if it wasn't such a long , uh , time then they couldn't spend as much money .
and even don't seem to help much more .
no ,
they really don't .
uh , it's d- , you , it's a lot of it is who the best , uh , who , uh , again to say the right thing at the right time , who , not , who would not be the most important and get the b- , uh , the job done .
so we're really recycling for the best hand and the best person is .
exactly .
and it's a , it's a lot ,
i've worked in public relations a lot
and , uh , that kind of thing can make and break , or make someone
as you can remember uh , it's like a teacher .
well , that was certainly a shame or something .
it really was
and it's just , uh , uh ,
he possibly could have , uh , won that one i'm built on it for some of the , uh , the way he himself .
well , he had a classic case of people in lewisville and throw it .
what , is , is , i guess the right term for him .
night ,
fine ,
thank you .
i understand we're supposed to talk about it .
yes .
i hope you know more about it than i do .
i just got through reading , space by , the army .
is that right ?
that , helped out a little bit of it .
i haven't read his book .
None
None
so .
i don't think he was in a lot of what he did in texas
i wasn't sure how he was .
is that right ?
what do you think we've gained from the ?
i'm not sure to be honest with you ,
this going to the moon seemed to be a exciting party
so .
heck of them .
yeah ,
it was nice to go there ,
i don't know that it really brings a lot more .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i happen to live not too far away from ,
is that right ?
i've actually worked for the company that has been , uh , having been the indoor fee .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's been kind of a real negative feeling here
right .
is it was , very unfortunate thing that goes there
it's ,
where do you live ?
we live in , utah .
you live in san antonio ,
am i talking to utah right now ?
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
great .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
so .
i'm in dallas .
oh .
i have a sister that lives in dallas ,
i see .
that's how we got hooked up to the program that was her husband for doctor was there .
i see .
so .
pardon brooks ?
pardon me ?
is her name , carolyn ?
no , my last name is that .
i see .
her name is , his name is a new name .
i see .
so .
you probably know a lot about it .
None
i hadn't heard that .
they were .
there was ,
apparently the longest for the holidays ,
they were not to discuss in , cold weather
apparently there was definitely a crowd that did not ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
if you've ever seen the size of those , that put them into the space ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
yeah .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
this book was interesting , though .
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
talked about how a lot of the problems they have to have to ,
it's a very conservative , situation to go into space .
yeah ,
i would think so , too
they would ,
yeah ,
you never think about that do you ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
yeah
i would think it would be harder to get up than it would be getting back down .
they have to come in just at the right library .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
right .
so .
i saw some of those early space at least .
oh .
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you could see the lights on them ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
they had though you could see how you got it and just really because it was the kids in the gym which was quite interesting .
yeah ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
go ahead .
i've , i've never , i've never seen an actual impact .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i've seen more of the motors that they pass out there .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
these were the ones that john experienced went up in the , and old old ones .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
the very first ones ,
the little bell type things .
people have how , they were surprised how they were at ten minutes .
yeah ,
they really were ,
they just ,
looked pretty neat ,
yeah ,
the whole thing was small
you actually put it on
is that right ?
you put it around you pretty much ,
it was so small .
so .
i thought there was some medical benefits that we have learned from space ,
did he go into that in the book ?
not really .
i guess that's just to sell us on it .
one one's ,
i know one thing they've mentioned that i didn't get from the book , by the way ,
it talked about ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
yeah .
it's fairly expensive .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
that's true
so .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know ,
that's right
do you think we should continue to support it at the level ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
yes .
None
i think they have cut it back , to be honest with you .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
yeah .
so .
i appreciate having the same .
that's certainly made it for four people so much .
i don't know if you have a dream or not .
no ,
i don't .
i don't either .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
we don't know that's why there's a solution in that regard .
okay .
uh , go ahead .
what are we supposed to discuss again ?
aids research is something that ,
more money ,
that , i think th- , whether our company is going to go into that much time
and actually i'm concerned that they're not .
i have a friend who is working with , uh , who works with , uh , aids ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and one of the ones that he's w- , worked with those countries in new hampshire for a lot , uh , utah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and these were from other , people from other countries .
he's a sophomore .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and in talking to the people from minneapolis he said , you know ,
None
and they're letting ,
huh .
the information out we're about how , you know , how big it is .
which is scary , you know , pretty scary when they're so many people get it .
so , i guess i'm , i'm , i'm like to see us spend more .
i don't know that spending more everybody is not really .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
i'm , i'm glad about it because , um , uh , i- , well it is very well scary .
i have no perspective on how it would get to other things ,
and , uh , i mean ,
you mean more money for that means less than for awhile ,
yes .
y- , yeah .
and , uh , whether those are just available , you know ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
some money was such when you made if did you go along in the world uh , research and they didn't , uh , you know ,
but i , uh ,
then t- , part of it's trouble and stuff .
i don't know whether , whether , you know , where our money would be most significant way .
well it ,
i , i agree with you there
because i know every time that they said , comes back to the home and look the money to that
and you don't know whether it's still also going to be the other if it's a limited or the pie .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
or do they both get served ?
uh , that's a good point .
and i'm , i am a concerned about a lot , uh , i'm concerned about , uh , two things .
one is shooting the snow
and the other is for , uh , for , uh , the roots now .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and i'm not certain ,
i , i ,
again this ,
i'm telling you ,
basically i don't have any opinion .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but whether or not it would be , uh , our money would be better spent , uh , teaching , you know , working on the drug problems and the , and the problems uh , rather than trying to the juries that have already .
well , and one of the things i'd ,
and i'm with you that i don't know is , is that really the only way it's being able to be , and that way the easier would tell me to be and find something .
yeah ,
well , you know ,
that's , that's the part that ,
uh , d- , that's what they wanted to do .
that's the part that scares me , you know .
i mean beginning to this is , this is just for instance ,
well no ,
it's for kong and onions ,
well no ,
actually , it's ,
i mean , you know .
did they know that all along ?
an- , and i heard something the other day , this sounds ridiculous , uh , about something .
and , you know , they've been saying oh , no , that's not .
can't get it from nothing .
and , uh , and now they are saying maybe in the right system ,
yes .
oh
and i don't know that's true or not .
i mean , i just heard it in several cases ,
but so what does that ,
right .
yeah .
and how is it really fixed ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know if they have to do that , you know ,
et cetera .
which is , i think , what they also don't know .
i mean that's ,
i think they , they told us what was important and thinking that's safe to say , you know .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
it was nice to gripe to it one particular community that they have trouble , you know , they just as soon as not out of this ,
but , but that isn't how it was in africa .
no .
yeah .
and it's huge over there .
so i , i , you know ,
and it's beginning , uh , other countries
that's what's his point .
this was an italian ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they'd areas people are saying , well , but in my country it's , you know , like this ,
and does that say it's like and everything else , there are all these different interests of it ?
oh .
i mean i don't know .
None
uh , or maybe they understand the ,
None
yeah ,
and , uh , and then the people that have it ,
it does seem that there are , are some drugs that are there , you know , they keep back .
if you , if i were dying , i'm not sure i would take that .
i , i , give me that happened .
i mean , is it ,
yeah ,
right .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i'll take anything you know .
i mean if i'm dying , if i know i'm dying ,
ri- ,
you can afford me on .
exactly .
go ahead .
and why can't you , why can't the f d a say , you know , i- , if these people to be voting to ,
exactly .
research and well , they can ,
let them ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
do it .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
and that's what i think they're saying too .
have you s- , had any snow up your way ?
no ,
we haven't had any since , uh , oh , just before christmas
um .
and , uh we had a lot before christmas .
the ski systems were really
and , uh , i , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
but , now we have , we've had , for example , for three days in a row and they traded ,
so , i , i , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know ,
but no , uh , no snow .
um .
the really stands all off here , uh ,
well , i talked to a woman who lived up in the hills , uh ,
people in , uh , utah , i guess this last weekend
and she had , uh , quite a bit of snow on the ground her way .
uh-huh ,
None
but not ,
usually we have to up a hundred and fifty miles up at the door run
and they're down between and , uh , uh , forty years old .
um
at this time of the year ,
and we've been in a drought for the last five years
and this is the three o'clock
and it's getting quite serious , as far as our water part .
yeah ,
well , the weather , uh , here is , always a topic of town in texas .
right .
but , uh , we have wide have and warm weather when you have most cold weather ,
but we have our share of cold weather as well .
the , uh , this morning was right at mount angeles .
it didn't stay there ,
but it was right at ,
oh , that's , that's different , isn't it ?
um .
we usually have some of our weather going into the , uh , the end of january ,
but this year it wasn't bad at all .
i guess that's because we had so much rain .
i know my son was telling me about the same time there .
he said it was just ,
oh , yeah .
and we read in the newspaper , southern part of texas i guess out there ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
well , my , uh , my sister lives in houston
and they , uh , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they , they
the river there was , uh , in the sixties stage where he lives her son ,
and that , uh , some , uh , kind of , uh ,
oh , boy .
they have a , uh , lake market
oh , my gosh .
and , uh , their brother's was completely under the water on the lake .
so we really had a lot of rain .
yeah .
right .
there's quite a few that goes down , uh , through plano and , uh , it's got carpet on her attitude , a letter truck ,
and , uh , when i've gone down to visit him i've gone on that ,
but , uh , that was clear up to any , and up to some of the , i guess .
it just seems ,
yeah ,
we had a lot of reminds turkey in the area .
we had a few people who ran into , uh , water and a few of , uh , just a few .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
not more than ten
but , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that .
that's funny that , uh , we can't have it in touch of having a budget to get a loan or too much .
well , the , uh ,
there's an old penalty about texas weather ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
well , it's , uh , interesting ,
uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that .
i'm going down to my son's place next week
and , uh , i was wondering what the weather was ,
but i imagine if it's that cold in dallas it ,
well , some of mine are really good .
it's not a , doesn't get that cold , i guess , huh ?
no ,
it's , it's , quite an expensive
and it's , it's very complicated to have in texas , in terms of the .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
the , uh , you'll be able to teach there ?
yes .
well , uh , take off is , uh , fun from the past while you normally ,
yes .
the way the ends are you take off right into the window , the interior and they're doing them and
and so you figure back over the air and then make a bunch of walk around and come back over again .
yeah ,
we're kind of used to that here in utah ,
course , there are mountains ,
and i fly into nebraska a lot
and we have a ,
the mountains are , are really , uh , high
and a lot of places we go in to , you just kind of , uh ,
it's in the little valley ,
but , i , uh , sure do you think ,
we really need the button .
i hope we can get , uh , get some .
oh , really .
there's supposed to be a storm ,
but it went , down white down , uh , northern arizona and southern utah
and they're not allowed any for the next , uh , week anyway and the first
so , i , i , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know ,
well , i noticed on the weather together on , uh , cable that was there was supposed to be a storm front east and put down on your way ,
but i guess it didn't take out , huh ,
yeah ,
well , that's , that's the only ,
None
was , uh ,
uh-huh .
so that just left us ,
huh .
we got a high heel which system has been sitting in the air
oh , boy .
and , uh , we broke the chicken for the amount of herself that we've had , uh , you know , she'd been picked down , uh , about reading every day
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and then they knew the walls or , the population to try to get the way in and in the microwave .
huh .
well , i , i , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
we , uh , had a bad one , uh , last year ago .
we went up to visit my wife's , uh , sister who lives in , uh , in , eighty-seven ,
the world's about government .
i'm not lucky sure that that's the same thing .
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
None
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh
i , i think people tend to think that the government is not going to do
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and that people aren't self improvement .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's what i would like to think .
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,

i , i think that the last , part of that question was particularly interesting , about , how much potential makes us be because made it because to me whether that or public service or not so many of any nations that you have to have so many so many opportunities to join the legal that , to ar- .
uh-huh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
maybe that's what is happening .
right
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,

None
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
so .
yeah ,
that makes sense .
so .
you start watching an card in your lives , you know , their brother and then ,
that's right .
sometimes , i don't even know how much of a difference it really makes ,
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,

None
just because you did something in the past not mean he's a good person to have a big job to be .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,

i , i agree with that and also that the punishment that they're putting out and they do that they're not able to be doing percent , what's going to do the public schools for their , to pay the private schools for their own private school .
that's it .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
when it becomes public , though , it becomes worth .
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
that's , that's the thing that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh-huh .
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
people could say , they do it ,
i guess ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
sometimes i ask myself , what are , people doing that are in the world when somebody , comes up to office ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
yeah
i guess it's what your accent had ,
it's a very low way of living .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so .
yeah ,
uh-huh
just in a very wooded way .
right .
i vote
i , try to do whatever i can get on the little local news ,
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
i , i- , it just is not one of the things that i have , had , a lot of my opinion and effort to get ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i always feel very proud this kind of an issue .
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
so .
i am kind of the same way .
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah ,
right .
yeah ,
so .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
i'm not in there ,
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
right .
right .
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
the media talks , as you said ,
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
None
okay .
all right .
that's a real different topic .
i'm not sure i'm familiar with , with what they mean , of course .
i know .
i guess that , i guess you just consider that things every day that would , you know , would think of about .
see , i'm a college student ,
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
so i can think of lots of things that my roommate does that bother me that you know , i like that is an invasion of my privacy , stuff like that .
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
but i think it'd be , it is kind of a tough thing .

oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i'm , i used to be a college student ten years ago and i think , uh , i think my invasion of my privacy is when someone calls me on the telephone and says , have , we got a deal of we have .
oh , golly .
you're like , no , you don't , no .
it's like , how do you know my name ,
where did you get my phone number ,
and why do you think it's a deal for me ?
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
i mean , those people , they'll call you any time of the day or something with , i try to be an invasion of my privacy , i think .
they call late ,
now , i mean , now there's , i heard that they were going to start calling on saturdays or some- ,
oh , they do already .
see , that's ,
i would be so mad
well , i , i , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , because i don't know if they were ,
and i've even had the computer calls on video , too ,
really .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
huh .
but i do know of a way to get around the computer calls .
how ?
don't answer your phone , huh .
the clarinet to , to start talking to you on the , on the word they're grown .
really ?
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
huh .
i don't know ,
i think like things that , that
None
oh , yeah .
that drives me up a little bit .
are you and your roommate a similar size .
no ,
see , we're not ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
and she still goes through your clothes ?
yeah ,
she'll take all my stuff and , and stuff
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
because she can't like wear my cats and not take my foot all my time and stuff .
ooh .
man , i'm just glad she can't wear my newspapers or my desk or my dresses , you know .
oh , yeah .
but still , she'll just take them ,
and she won't even think about it ,
and then , i'll like see her that day ,
and she'll be buying my clothes ,
and i'll be like , you know , i don't like to say my clothes out , you know ,
i really don't .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so i prefer that you just not go in and get them because she doesn't even ask me .
stuff like that really
like that's an invasion of my privacy , i feel like .
oh , yeah ,
i agree .
stuff like that ,
yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i was thinking like my mom .
i know this ,
oh , yeah .
she would think this is like an invasion of privacy , is going like her through lunch , like if you ever needed money and stuff we just give her her husband , you know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
and she'll get it out or whatever .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i was trying to think ,
i was thinking that's the only thing i could really think of that would be really .
my mom doesn't even like for us to go through her point .
really .
i mean , we're all grown ,
all her kids are grown ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and we have our own families and now if we go through her cruise like , well , what are you aware of for ?
yeah ,
get out of my ears .
like , what are you doing ?
don't you have your own house to walk in ?
that's great .
yeah ,
so , i guess , is sure the most ,
and at the work place , i suppose ,
oh , well , actually .
i can say definitely ,
privacy at the work place .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
see .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
None
and i could tell i mean , even if a heck of the fall way really .
you could tell ,
you know you put your stuff where it's ,
um .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
that would drive , that would ,
it would drive , it drove me for a while .
really .
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
well , i worked a second bedroom and everybody else in my first area worked and his wife and they travel in this time ,
and there would be people sitting at my desk , working ,
and i'm wondering , you know , um , what is this ,
it's my husband ,
i wonder , what is , you know , what , yeah ,
why are they working at my desk ,
and can i have it back .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
None
then you start missing stuff ,
and i think that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
oh , yeah ,
no construction is going to take the time ,
i'm sorry ,
i have
that's okay .
see that would , that would make me really upset ,
because you can always tell when you become honest and stuff ,
just because ,
um .
i mean , i know i have everything like a certain way and you know how it looks and everything .
oh , yeah .
well , you know how you left it the day before .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that would bother me , definitely .
oh , yeah ,
so , that's ,
yeah ,
i agree ,
it's , it's pretty tough that way ,
and , i know , even like with your kids and baseball equipment .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
do you miss your papers sometimes ?
see ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you know .
that's the only thing i can really think about an invasion of privacy , like something every day , though .
yeah ,
well , actually i do know ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and i have used it once and it , it really is an invasion of privacy ,
but in the library there's a book that you can find out what the phone numbers are doing where they live , their street address .
oh , really ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and that ,
i mean , i've , i've used it once ,
okay .
all right ,
well d- , d- , do you play any flower beds or ,
no ,
i don't play any .
i used to .
oh well ,
i think everybody took piano lessons
so , i , i , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know ,
everybody ,
sure .
i , i started when i was in , uh , third grade ,
and i've , i still play the piano of today as that .
do you ?
yes ,
i do .
i started ,
i think i was in the fourth grade
and i played it for maybe three months
but , then , again , i was also in , uh , the band .
i played the n ,
i played the clarinet ,
i played the piano .
wow
uh , you know , nothing
and so i ,
i still sing ,
and i sing in the choir today
so , i , i , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know ,
all right
i thin- , i enjoy the music ,
it gives me an hour .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
it always sounds like ,
for my playing piano when the piano was and didn't have anything else and do you know there was no one to play with i could just play with the piano , you know .
true
so , how long did you play ?
only for about three months .
three months .
yeah ,
me and my brother both took the classes
and we got pretty easy clothes
i was going to say , y- , y- , you got as far as the , uh , subscribe to , um , shopping for , you know .
um , well , i could play , uh , the wood would sleep .
oh , the wood goes home
and i still can to this date .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
and your mother's decided , and said , the money that we spent for those college this year is all we had the last regular truck
yep ,
they went out and bought us a piano
and for three months
oh , bless your heart .
None
oh , yeah ,
any time i got married
oh , okay ,
but i mean , can you play anything on it , other than wood song ?
no .
no .
and , uh , i think , uh , i think , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
but i think everybody can .
okay .
i c- , i , i can still read music if i'm going to eat
because i ,
if i work real hard i can still read the music ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
but , see , i played the piano from the third grade the way through high school ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
so i played a , uh , plastic and other things
but , uh , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh ,
i got to the point where i wasn't really reading music , i was able to music ,
so because of that , i can't read music as well as i used to ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
but anyway ,
but i enjoy it , though .
i find it to be a good thing
and i still enjoy the band scouts
and i still enjoy , uh , singing in the choir
so , i , i , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know ,
do you sing at your choir at church ?
yes ,
i do .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
yes ,
i do .
that's , uh , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
in fact , that's about the only thing that i still do is not put the software in .
i tried out for awhile when i was , in the , in the seventh grade
and they wouldn't let me in .
so , i , i , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know ,
i never tried to believe .
well , i , i , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , because i don't know if they were ,
i sing in the choir ,
i do know if they want me to have ,
but at least i do sing in it
yeah ,
that's pretty good .
well , i , i , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , because i don't know if they were ,
i never really learned the music or anything .
i never learned ,
i got right to where i was able to hear all over the years and the doors
and that's about when i quit .
i was at ,
i actually went to the university of texas at one time that i did , uh , start a musician .
i wanted to be a high school band .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
but after one semester that i , i said , n- , no ,
no ,
this isn't for me .
enjoy it , but not for example , no ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
and besides that i kind of learned it wasn't that i really enjoyed it
i gave up .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh , you know ,
course , my mom thought i was ,
but , uh , you know ,
of course ,
parents always do .
oh , yeah ,
so , i , i , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , because i don't know if they were going to be a lot of people that are going to be able to do that .
they're nice that way .
yes .
well , what else we can d- , uh , talk about ,
uh , i , i , i , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
uh , well , i don't , d- ,
so you listen to kind of church music , some ?
no ,
no ,
i , i listen to v n a t i .
oh , yeah ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
so i listen to the radio ,
i like the pop music .
oh , yeah .
i like people like tom and all , all the folks that you're not supposed to have ,
but that's what i go for
oh , yeah ,
the professors work as i call it .
oh , the car called them .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
oh , okay ,
well , i , i , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
my boss teaches them to that .
we listen to my mother's part
and that's his phone , so i think it should the rap car .
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
now what d- , kind of music do you listen to ?
well , i listen to like listening to one point , you know , more ,
what d- , what is that ?
it's more , uh ,
i don't know how to explain it ,
kind of pop , you know , rock .
rock .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
hard rock ?
well , not hard .
not hard rock .
just kind of ,
not like the possibility .
huh ?
is that the bulls ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
okay , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know , i don't know ,
i know , i know what the scout is .
it's not too hard ,
it's ,
that's not too hard .
you know .
but it's not enough to put you up a month
true ,
true .
which some of the songs on the v w i could be .
well , course , i see , listen to v i f b s for the years .
i mean
oh , yeah ,
got the trim for , too ?
oh , yes ,
oh , yes .
you can't drive a car without track of stuff
and you know they're going to call you up .
okay .
yeah
well , listen , i've enjoyed talking to you .
i , i'm sure that the switchboard will probably give them up there show me out that quick .
okay .
i appreciate it .
okay .
catch you later .
bye-bye .
bye-bye .
okay
okay
have you done this very long ?
uh , well , yeah ,
for the last , uh , couple of months .
yeah ,
that's the same with us .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
well , what kind of car would you buy ?
well , it's kind of hard to say ,
uh , because i don't think we're going to buy another car for about three years .
we just oh , okay .
o- ,
for , uh , a car , uh , last year and then in one for seventy-five and , uh ,
wait a minute ,
we bought one in ninety .
we've got three cars , of all things .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so , uh , probably we'll be in at least a little bit , right door with the guns .
okay .
what kind do you have now ?
uh , we have a , a nine twenty nine and a hundred percent of a p m and a little bit younger or two t v .
oh , okay .
uh , it's rather difficult to , to say what kind of , uh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we'd , look , always look into , uh , consumer reports to see what kind of , uh , report , uh , or , repair that records the various cars have and then of , of course , we look into the prices .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
and , uh , uh , that's , uh , you're not to sell around in the summer when , the cars could be to get
because we keep , we've got to keep them , uh , a , longer period of time .
uh , i traded off an hour for the grocery store for the family .
oh , uh-huh .
so , uh ,
and did you find that you like the old insurance will look at the family ,
uh , yeah ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
we , we've had thirty some odd cars in our house ,
and , uh , we had , it's a good old for the car .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , uh , they , they , uh ,
i've been very ,
we've had three months .
we've been extremely pleased with our teeth .
oh , really ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
we've always bought american interest out , supposedly .
yeah ,
well , we , we've had , uh ,
let's see ,
we had , uh , we had a , uh ,
let me think .
so .
and a , uh , we had , uh , two years is a couple years ago at a dress period
uh , and we had a good
and then we had this resort .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so we , we really can't complain about doing , really .
yeah ,
we've been real pleased with ours .
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
i think we've had , one , two , three and two ,
we have a quarterback , we still have a draft professor and all like that , a little bit .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
then we have a luxury sauce
and we've had the button .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
so ,
but i don't know ,
we'll , we're going to be in the market for a car , probably in the next year
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and the personal union is something we never , you know , the next generation or , but they have good through the military , uh , the computer .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , i don't know what we're going to buy .
None
but , boy , with all the civil stores are running off , i thought that sounds important
so ,
well , uh , my son over in , uh , sold , uh , eighty-five , ninety-three , and , for ten years and ,
and that was one of the reasons there's been in the seventies .
oh .
uh , so , uh , the first generation that we had a , was a , a m b m , for t i ,
oh the ,
None
ooh , boy .
and , uh , i drove it for a while .
and , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
i'll bet it was hard to find out with the .
yeah ,
it really was .
my husband was in the air force
and we got transferred to me .
oh .
so , uh , we had to sell it .
w- , which really adds up me
oh , yeah .
because , uh , it , it w- , it was great .
and then , uh , when we got to see , well , we bought a second day ,
we , uh , we decided that , uh ,
we had this , uh , twenty-five percent
and it , and it was just too big ,
so we , we sold it to the fact that she was back to the states
and we got a little bit , uh , and a , uh , the little , uh , forty miles a year old , straight up .
oh .
so what do you think about for us rather folks ?
well , i think , uh , the biggest really is a good machine for them to be .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
they've got a lot of the dental market
and at the same time , uh , the majority of them don't want to give up the death penalty because they have .
right ,
very definitely .
and so you've got a real job to make there .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
what about you ?
well , i'm thinking about it more in terms of my parents that are starting to get older .
they aren't really that old ,
but they are , sort of weird for it .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
my wife is a lot of brother and it is only about thirty-five ,
but she's had some pretty close calls
and my husband has to drive her to , because it worked
and so she's got it
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , but she's also a very , very , uh , liberal of education and having having people like , uh , not being able to do things for herself when she wants to , uh , i know they don't really want to be in a nursing home ,
but my dad keeps talking about it .
i don't ,
i couldn't possibly ,
so .
couldn't never see him in a nursing home .
and my grand p m is just , wouldn't be able to put in a nursing home .
oh really .
he's ninety , i think right on my wife and every year we started doing it .
oh , okay .
my grand church doesn't be a couple of years ago but , it's , you know ,
yeah .
yeah ,
but it gets hard .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
right .
my , my grandmother is in her desk and she's , uh , i'm , uh , from illinois and , uh , uh , shoot his civil rights , um , she had to do it , uh ,
right .
but they are things back whenever she was so young and , and so ,
she was living by herself
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but my , uh , daughter has moved in with her to take care of her and it's a lot of problems .
right ,
especially for your daughter i think .
oh yes .
yes .
yeah ,
do they have anything like that in dallas .
in dallas ,
uh , yeah .
i've , i've heard of several things
and they really are neat programs to be able to do if you can remember them up with ,
but sometimes it's hard to find either the kids to get them in , uh , or to be able to get them there for the day care and pick them up .
right .
so they are pretty limited .
right .
oh , another interesting thing ,
uh-huh .
oh really .
to make sure that they would take care of their minds .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
None
uh-huh ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
well , it , it's , it's a really , day care shows are really , you know ,
and if the , if the people are able and can get up and move and everything like that , that is one of the best things to do ,
uh-huh
right .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but i think the hardest thing to do is if you've said a person who's very highly complex and a healthy team and just always picked up with them and i think that's in a way more , uh , some place on the home that , uh , they've taken care of you know , have a lot more learning to be able to do those .
right
to , uh , get there and it's to choose the government .
right .
cause i know , there's not one too far from me from here in dallas .
right .
uh , and they have and forth and make them a lot nicer and stuff .
right .
but if your daughter is gone and you have that real badly ,
that's true .
you can't play those things .
yeah ,
you can't do it .
well , that's true .
but you can sing down and , uh , tell you about the old foods .
i guess , you know , you were talking about your ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
was it an electric was that new orleans that we got , uh , have to tell them old .
you can perhaps a lot of people that aren't too far as far along with the size of times and then it toward the way that they happen .
and they love to be .
i mean they just , you know ,
and they will just go on and on these stories
and they have such a problem .
do they like to listen to other people too ?
my grandmother doesn't
she , she wants to protect , i don't like to remember your family about it
right .
so which is fine , you know ,
so , i , i , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , because i don't know if they were going to be a lot of people that are going to be able to do that .
well , that is good because we ,
um , so what do you think ?
um , i , i , i , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
i lived , i lived in germany for two years .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and in fact they have mini beds .
and so i saw some of the good
and also i saw some of the bad ones that are following a lot of program .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh , some of the , some of the good that one's that you want to worry about health care .
right .
so it's a , it's very , it's a very , uh , talking about ,
i mean they are very important in comfortable that , you know , there's no medical way that's going to make you for life .
right .
um , the bad was more crowded i think at least for me
because i think it would follow in a hundred , on a way that you could see .
one , one thing that i noticed is it's very , very convenient to be in dallas .
oh , really ?
because it's quite a bit more .
now i don't know if that necessarily has to be part of the medicine ,
but , uh , if you're , if you're , then you're able to sell as you know , on its welfare
and so there was very little incentive for people to get out of that .
huh .
also , um , another thing that , that i noticed that was very strange ,
i was , uh , i would go down all these , uh , uh ,
i remember this one of houses
and they were , uh , row houses or mercedes ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
all crazy stuff in it was like lower shirts and this .
well , it would be lower rates this year is ,
it's probably twelve inches there .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
um , and there was a puppy that comes in one of these two years
and there was a doctor that lived in one of these .
the one guy was a doctor
and one was a driver who's ,
and so their , their thought are pretty good about the same .
huh .
yeah ,
right .
and that , that didn't fit in terms of .
right .
and , uh , i mean their people , uh , their health care tax number something from the fact that just the teachers are lower
and it was , it was less professional
and it was treated more ,
like a , like a driver type job ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
then a , then a doctor type job .
i- , i , i don't know if i would have to do that , because i don't know if they were going to be a little bit more than that ,
that is , uh , that is something i've heard .
uh , i had a friend , uh , that i worked with that was from pittsburgh
and that was , uh ,
probably the , the major concern i have is that , you know , we are , we are outside the technology of , of just jobs because it is such a great threat to , to get , uh , the medical field ,
but at the same time it's real hard .
i mean my husband works for a company that has increased
and so , you know , i'm real , you know ,
it's like well , you know , you know ,
there's got to be better ways , you know , to do some things
but , you know , i hate to , uh ,
the , the rain , there's in a lot of cases , is just wonderful because , you know , just your own place
and , and , uh , they have to be able to , to be good and be able to hear .
but at the same time , there's a , you know , they're based on their privacy
and , and the things are just tied on quality for these reasons that they don't have to pay very much for .
my , i have a brother who's a lot of
and for something that he can get , you know ,
right .
and i'm sure they can get a lot cheaper because they , they , they beat them in have a open rate , um , you know , they could charge you for twenty dollars a dollar fifty
and that's ridiculous .
and i don't think that is that , uh , is that , uh , any means in to be doing things like that .
and , uh , i think , uh , i don't know , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
you don't think it's ?
i don't think it's for hospitals to be doing that at all
oh , i see .
you're not saying it's right ,
you're just saying it's common .
i- , i , i don't know if i would have to do that , because i don't know if they were going to be a little bit more than that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
and so i- , i- , it's , i think , i- , i think to me , uh , that's something that we need to medical , uh , is , um , for ,
and i don't know how to , i don't know how to do this
but i think people are too happy .
and i mean things will happen
and , and you've got to , uh , keep up there
or you've got to realize that , you know , i- , it is just men or women that are , that are making , um ,
and they will make him
and e- , they , you know , if i- , you know , if you , uh ,
yeah ,
but there are other things that just happen that you can't , you know , you can't say , you know , well , if you had just done this , you know , would have done something ,
and , um , i don't know .
i , i think the fact that has gone up i guess has been a record around our family . um ,
yes .
in the , in the last couple of years
and i think that's something that if , if they could work on the cause of that , uh ,
well it's , uh ,
i'll start off here .
uh , i don't know .
None
uh , i like c n n because it , uh , you know , it rains ,
well i think his books is just a little bit of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
right ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
but it makes it really convenient because i could keep a good car force
and , uh , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
but the newspaper said , uh , a little bit of that regard you can't get from ,
i , i think i'd agree .
a , a s- , similar of getting the news with me and getting that .
it's , uh , uh , c n n has been a little closer to the t v here in the ,
um .
last , uh , number of years .
uh , p- , prior to cable , you know , you didn't get much news off of any , uh , television .
right .
uh , just usually pretty high in , or whatever
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , and i like , uh , c n n because you get some world , world crimes uh , is so too much of people on , on the other , newspapers , and so forth .
right .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
i know , the ,
my only major is that , uh , i don't think our education system doesn't have , uh , attention on , uh , on our neighbors like church and canada and employees .
uh , i , i , i , i don't know if i don't know if i would have to do that , uh , i don't know , i don't know ,
that , that's true , you know .
you hardly ever see , uh , articles about the , uh , the either group and , uh , the other vehicle is , or other teams on in terms of those countries .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
uh , but when you pick up a , a paper , a little bit , uh , you know , all the , they need management , they might , uh , have this news , uh , other countries in them .
right .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
i mean , you know , canada has gone through a lot of problems now with , with , and everything
and , uh , it's amazing that ,
you know , i , i listen to d c area and the washington tells you , uh ,
i mean the most they'll give it is the back of the house , i don't know .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
uh , you know .
i'm , i'm never living in dallas
and it , it won't even give it the back section .
you just ,
um .
never see , you just never see anything about it ,
uh , which is a shame because you go to other countries , uh ,
and , and they carry quite a bit of the u s on the other hand .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and if you go to up , uh , canada , those people are usually pretty , uh , dealing with the politics and going on the news and the u s
and we're pretty , uh , limited in our areas of , of japan and in canada or whatever ,
yeah ,
definitely .
you just don't know what's going on .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
i'd , i ,
every once in awhile , i have to travel and stuff
and lately i've taken the , taken a little radio , uh , and then got the wind up at b c
and it's sort of like , uh , a c n n too .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you you can move into some things
and you get some , like thirty minutes of , of the tree teams .
uh , i occasionally get into some of the middle of , uh , texas ,
and that's the only way you can tell what's going on at all
um .
right .
there's not much of the way in television of some of those places .
uh , but that's a good point about , about the families have .
i hadn't really thought about it
but i guess you don't think about it if you hear it .
right .
exactly .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
i , uh , spent this past summer up in canada .
uh , well part of it , too .
and , uh , you know , i- , i was wondering why about oil and a few things that's about working and about all these , you know , really interesting things going on .
there's some serious talk about whether there's just a little bit , that , you know , in the next year , you know ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
you know , because of the problems with kids ,
and n- , i had never heard any of that before .
yeah ,
you know , there was a , a , a ,
what is it called ,
is it our lake accent
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
or , or , i- , that's just something , uh , i'd say about twelve percent of the people here would never have been in
and i think that i heard of it about the first time when i was up in a couple of years ago and , you know , picked up a , a paper and started reading a little bit more about it .
and , and c- , came ,
it was a big thing going on there
and i came back here
and nothing in the papers .
right ,
right .
i didn't see a thing about it .
so it's , uh , we've got a long way to go , i guess .
it's horrible .
and i like say , i saw with my news and , and , uh , the cable news .
even , even there's , uh , uh ,
it's frustrating , it's in some respects .
but what is it ?
it's , uh , i mean it's the worst way , is not that ,
uh , oh , i'm trying to think of the channel .
the , the north district would be .
oh , yeah .
uh , i , it looked okay .
i've caught it a few times
and they , they do some pretty good news .
uh , mostly news of the technology .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
uh , uh , the , the weather of the husband's is sort of funny .
you'd think it would carry an expensive box
but it , it doesn't seem to have .
so i'll flip through and listen to it once in awhile too , uh , and catch something maybe a little different than , c n n than might be .
uh , some more humid , in terms crime , in the other areas .
but it's kind of world , whether , uh , local is too .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
uh , i , i guess i've never seen the t v show .
i used to get the , uh ,
a , golden retriever .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
that's one of my favorite kinds of dogs .
is it really ?
how long have you had it ?
we've had him for ,
he just had his fourth seven .
fourth stays .
yeah ,
we got him when he was about eight weeks old ,
he's pretty good ,
we like him .
does he writes a lot ?
he does .
that's the one thing we don't like about him .
None
None
how much does he apply to ?
None
they put him on the ground
he's up to ninety four now .
oh .
he's not a real traditional , dog for a golden retriever .
he's kind of been , and western and things .
so .
so .
is he good with family ?
he is .
it's , just me and my wife
he's kind of our band for having kids .
None
yeah ,
and , uh , i , i , i , i , i don't know , i don't know ,
i can understand that
uh-huh .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
how about you ?
we have a cat who's about also a year old .
oh .
he's our child account right now ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
he also had a lot .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
we hope to get a golden retriever buff .
we figure we'll get the kids and then the dog
that's probably a good idea .
they're good though .
have you ever had a retriever before ?
no ,
my husband had one when he was growing up .
None
they don't tend to get real reliable or two .
they like to play .
so .
especially with the kids .
they love to play with kids .
is your dog an inside and then ?
no ,
he's pretty much an inside dog .
so .
he stays in .
yeah ,
None
really ?
he's really a lot .
when it comes to being alone ,
if you give him the freedom to walk around and go and then wants that , he likes ,
he does not like to be tied outside .
he'll just sit and forth and visit .
yeah ,
no ,
he's , taken to the training pretty well
he knows where our yard is
we have a pretty small yard ,
he seems to know the possibility .
so .
he usually is good at staying within them ,
our next door neighbors have a dog , too ,
she is good friends with my dog .
oh , yeah ,
he often gets to her mother's and will go over there and put it around to stuff
so .
he's pretty good .
he stays out of the street
if i catch him i call him
he comes back .
so .
he's pretty good about taking to us and things .
no we never did .
None
so .
i known him on my own
this is the first dog i've had all my own as an adult .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we've had dogs when i was a kid ,
this is the first one that i , took in ,
None
he seems to have picked it up pretty well .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
i never really hit to him or anything .
so .
really ?
just , frustrating learning of heart and those kinds of things .
i see other people out there
they hit their dogs and try to ,
None
least i ,
circuit what ?
everybody's to ,
have you heard of that ?
no ,
what is that ?
oh .
yeah .
they wear a hundred with a special little vegetables on it
oh .
if they get too close to that , that it showed them .
boy .
yeah
i'd be afraid to walk around if i was that dog
yeah ,
yeah ,
None
he held on to the playoffs
he walked out to the moment .
he said it was a good suggestion .
really ?
yeah ,
so .
i don't take too well to those university of friends who played .
i don't think they're always necessary .
if you put enough interests up ,
yeah ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
just be independent and threw it with
so .
is your cat an indoor cat or an indoor cat ?
yeah he's and wearing all because i know the average , life is an adult of baseball homes like nine months .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
somebody just told me that because of the whole area ?
yeah ,
that and also just , getting hit , i guess , or getting beat up .
yeah ,
wow .
so .
quite a difference .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
what kind of does do you have ?
we just moved recently
now we're in the , dallas area
oh .
it's very nice
so .
the only experience i have ,
i don't have any children
but i've , uh , i was a baby-sitter in high school .
and then , just recently , after we were married , i think for a while they worked here .
and i just , uh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
that's the only thing i've ever done , also is ,
is it ?
but , uh , i've heard people that i work with talk about , you know , child care .
especially , i guess it's not even educated on single mothers .
oh , yeah .
the expense .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
having to pick up the kid by , you know , six o'clock
or it's five dollars for every minute you're late and stuff . that
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
which is .
just sit around
i mean , these people can't , you know , stay there until eight o'clock because somebody has to work late
but
that that's true .
see the lady i did it for ,
that's why she picked me is because i would go to her house so she wouldn't have to get her little girl .
so she could sleep in .
and , uh , then she could be at home
and then i'd bring her to my house for a couple of years ago i wanted too many or something .
but , uh , she paid , i think it was two or , i think it was about two fifty , three dollars a week
and by the time i paid taxes on it , i , was getting like eighty cents
oh , no .
and that wasn't turning up or food or anything .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
it's hardly worth your time .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
that's pretty bad .
the only time i was in high school
and it , you know ,
of course you don't ha- ,
i didn't pay taxes on that ,
so .
right .
it was easy , you know , go over to some , uh ,
it was these people that lived in our neighborhood
and i'd just go over there .
every thursday night , they went to the theater .
they had a ball
and they'd give me ,
it was supposed to be two dollars an hour for two kids ,
but they would usually give me like five dollars at the end of the night .
oh , wow .
and , i mean , they'd , you know ,
it was great .
i'd go over there
and there would be like , uh , you know , there's , we have these videos over here .
watch , uh , i think , uh , i think , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
um .
whatever you want .
and there's some character in the , in the daytime .
and there's some vegetables
and you know , just help yourself to work .
wow .
so it was , it was , you know , the best ,
that was a long time ago
and that was only for a few years .
just once a week .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
but i don't know .
None
oh , yeah .
that's true .
and they stick around for years .
because i mean after i figured out i was getting eighty cents an hour , i said , it can't .
and i quit you know .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
i was just like but i'm watching my time .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
i really liked the little girl and everything
but i thought
she does take up ,
and they do take up a lot of your time .
that
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
yeah ,
i
they're very expensive
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
well , and she was really spoiled .
they didn't make her eat anything she didn't want anything .
so , basically , they talked to professional guns and stuff for lunch .
and the mom was a dentist
and i was just like , we've got to quit this .
and she's like no i don't want her to come .
but i don't want to make her eat something she doesn't want to eat
oh , shoot .
like , uh , i think , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
eat this or something .
my mom would like , uh , eat it or don't eat it .
that's right .
so , i can see the trend on what many people want .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
because some ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
i mean , you know , if i was thinking up a year , there would be so many you would have to have your service to .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
cause some parents don't pay up anything . where i did .
i think ,
yeah ,
i think the best way to go to be just , to be able to do it out of your hands .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and just have t- , like at the , most ten minutes like , you know .
no .
and all from maybe people that you know type of thing .
instead of trying to actually set up a lot where you don't know the people coming in and
that's true .
i , i'd love to do it .
but i just don't trust people now .
there's too many times .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
i just , i think it's a bigger risk than
more than what it's worth ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
it would hurt me .
with , uh , i think , uh , i think , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water ,
i don't know ,
cause i'm sure some of them have good reason to solve
but i think a lot of them are just , you know , they're going to
and they get happy about money
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , uh ,
and they just want to you .
well , yeah .
that's , uh , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that .
yeah ,
exactly .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
yeah .
oh , yeah .
and that's just , you know ,
that's impossible .
you can't watch that many kids are little getting things at home and then
you know , you never know what they're going to get into .
i have a girlfriend that works at a lot
and she takes her little girl with her
and , i mean , she told me about the people that they have to see
and half of them she'd like to find them over the state
and that's the people that are working there , you know .
and then she would like to turn in half of the parents that drop their kids out of the tape where you are in the , you know .
oh , that's horrible .
like they'll be in the same clothes they were the day before , the same token .
huh .
you know , that's just awful things .
and so i don't know .
i don't have kids
but i always think man i just don't know if i could think anybody else .
i mean , you just don't know .
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
that's i- ,
yeah ,
that's a hard thing about it .
if , i mean , i don't remember i was a teacher in doing it .
but if , you know , if i ever wanted to have a kid , how would you spend the time .
i mean , i don't think i could afford somebody with my kid to do .
oh , yeah .
that's true .
unless it was a friend that , you know , did it in
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
i just , i couldn't do it i don't think .
it would just shoot me off , i think ,
i don't know .
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
just not knowing .
yeah ,
just besides the fact that , you know , your , when your child gets out of school at three o'clock and then to be able to make .
what do you usually wear to ,
well , let's see .
it turns out that , uh , do ,
i work at home
and it's a very , uh , low area as far as low as dress goes .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
you just wear , uh ,
let's see .
when i first came here , i think fifteen years ago
but after a while i got , uh , found out that that wasn't all that important .
i'm an engineer .
oh , i see .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and , uh , so , i get to wear just , uh , how i say i guess it , uh , walking as opposed to shoes and dress and everything , well how i say it kind of like , uh ,
well , that's nice talking through that .
yes .
open , play , in the short of the , you know , no .
wow .
and , uh , just , uh , pretty strong , whether it's really , uh , i mean , sports or whatever , uh ,
wow .
that's nice .
now , being from plano , i don't think your dress code or not that , uh ,
well actually right now i'm a lot more late saying ,
so my dress code is very , very ,
oh , okay .
yeah ,
None
but over the summers i've had a dog , too . with other hand
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and that's so ,
generally then i dress , you know , like babies .
usually nice summer trash or something , like we saw stuff , uh ,
so , then it's still , you know , the weather is going on a list because it's a lot of walking and coming in , and in the office
but you still have to have a professional opinion of just know .
yes .
yeah .
so .
yeah ,
well i , uh , i just recently called a job for the different company here in the world
oh , really .
and so i decided i wear well a hundred dollars .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and it , it was very interesting ,
uh , like i said , most of the people at , at least this week , you know .
uh , most of the teachers and two and things pretty very cheap , just like the last year that , you'd wear to school .
wow .
that must be nice atmosphere then .
well , it has been .
although the new orleans and r e and the company is not a more from a low program , uh , background .
oh .
and so the trend is that , uh ,
so anyway i love this space
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
and i went over to , uh , uh , to one of the problems that has a lot of the more of the people it and it , and i , i almost was because , uh , the effect of that yourself on the way , businesses and , and become forced to me as opposed to the ,
uh , just to kind of ,
how shall i say it ,
they know you're there
but they don't
uh , you don't ,
there's no notice at all .
but when i buy a suit that day , uh , it was interesting people that didn't know whether i was a nurse or a manager .
wow .
so people , uh , how well if he wants , i know , made a much more effort to notice you , you have any , say your hands , uh , things like that ,
so .
that's interesting .
it's like a little , children's calls that you know
but , uh , i don't know if i have a lot of , uh , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the water , the , the , the , the , the water ,
that's really interesting .
and so this dress for example of this , i think is , uh ,
right .
by the old i'm kind of , uh , kind of , uh , that , uh , that , uh , that just one , uh , uh , experience and then having talked to several other people that , that , uh , unless you're in a , where an environment where they're going to make of fun , of , of course , better clothes that better costs us pay off .
huh .
that's interesting .
doesn't mean they have to be , uh ,
how shall i say it ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
th- , they don't have to be the , the most , uh , the best i know , uh , a little bit a little bit under the standard , i think , uh , would pay off ,
so i'm in the process of telling me the only we got to go together for his hands .
that's neat ,
that's neat
and , uh , i , i don't know ,
now i , i know my ,
right .
we have , uh , we do have some snow in the summertime
and it can be quite warm in the summertime .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
not hot like , uh ,
i lived in the midwest for a while .
oh .
and i know that , uh , you know , it can be cold in the army ,
and hot and , uh , twenty-three in the summertime .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
we don't have that much .
it's , uh , it's a very mild kid .
oh , well that's nice .
that's good for the clothes budget , i would imagine .
yes ,
it is .
because here , gosh , we had , uh ,
the winter hasn't been bad this winter .
it's , it it's only maybe twice or once in the past
but it's been cold .
low involvement , let's say ,
and then the summer gets up to eighties , because it's ,
so , i , i , i don't know , i don't know if i would have to do that .
you interested in woodworking ?
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
i guess i am

i guess he's young .
the judicial system are that are , it will be the kurds area and then ,
yes
he's about five and a half years old .
he'll be darned .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
now i just have to finish it though .
it got designed to be a little bit of work because
now , i've got to jump back in and finish the ,
i've got it all cut out ,
it's all ,
i've done most of the lambs

to do th- , the turn cut .
how about yourself ?
i am interested in woodworking .
i don't have lots of tools .
oh .
our local schools have education in the evening they use their month to add , uh , some of their , and some of their .
i'm an engineer .

kind of jack all of admissions , luckily .
yeah ,
no ,
i get good enough to sell it or have people say , um ,
you didn't buy it ,
you made it .
that's great !
it's like the button is gone
let's do something else .
right .
you want to , send a new field
so .
i- , well , yeah ,
None
yeah .
fortunately that's , i actually have a masters of the refrigerator
it's in education .
okay .
i'm a teacher
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
gee .
i've been fortunate that i can afford to work part-time .
i don't know how long that's going to last year
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
they're cutting back ,
i don't go in all that often
]
i've been real interested in some of those cute things kind of country .
yeah , uh ,
i see stuff in front term for five hundred dollars
i say , no
i go
i make it .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
that's how i started making catfish .
i love to cook .
that's great .
huh . ]
None
None
yeah . ]
you get the tools you don't feel like buying it .
exactly .
None
it took me a lot of time
oh , yeah .
but then it doesn't ,
if it cost me twenty dollars ,
cousins and then i ,
and your time ,
then you're that much laid ahead
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they were ,
then i saw one of these country looking wood .
it was a solid worker with a lot cut out of it .
right .
i've seen them
the backyard , the red with the cardinals or done
so .
oh , yeah .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
that's neat .
i went there ,
we have home out here .
i don't know if you've heard of it .
i went
yes .
we have one .
i got two six months olds are running out of a public school .
None
huh .
showing that out of the tent was good
i'm sure .
a band saw ?
i had a , i did it through nineteen months ago .
what ?
i did it through saudi carolina again .
oh , i think that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that , that ,
the teacher was one of these odd things ,
that's dangerous ,
we can't do that ,
we just can't do that .
i'm going how about this way ?
i want to do that ,
that was the plan here
right .
a requirement for it .
None
yeah ,
so you can afford it
you used a bit of a diet ?
yeah .
right ,
right .
yeah ,
i said i'm not that big ,
it's not going to happen .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
we built a button for it
we got one cut out on the first ,
uh-huh .
right .
goodness so ,
yeah now you're talking to a third bit in this ?
i'd say it's about an inch .
how'd you know anything ,
yeah , well , i'm a lot , like a musician
uh-huh .
it's ,
if you're looking at probation you have ,
up here in rochester , uh , we're the second election house as far as the air pollution .
i think grand canyon was one .
uh , we really don't have too much of a problem as far as , uh , industry we're doing real high as far as our industry in the city .
but we do have the same problem a lot of boating , level stuff in the house here is ,
and that is the effects of acid rain .
right .
illegal , coming basically from canada and sisters in ohio and france and ,
well , tha- , that's good .
actually down here we don't have a big problem with , uh , with air pollution .
mainly because we don't have anybody to th- , to see each other of them .
uh , which helps a lot out as far as that goes .
i wouldn't even necessarily thought of that except when i lived up in boston and , uh , you know ,
and would come up there in massachusetts and you know , in that area , uh , in the pollution area
and their , basically , well , basically , well , comes to the east coast
so why should we have to worry .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
i've , i've , uh , was in an inch while
and that was quite a difference as far as they're pollution .
i mean you couldn't really see that much
oh , yes
nothing ,
yes .
and then it gets around here
but they're really ,
we don't have a big problem with it .
i think that , uh , what most of the people here in new york are just best than right now is ,
it's , it's the , uh , you're concerned how good isn't it .
especially in the , uh , uh , areas where , you know , the kids are very , uh , changing the , uh , changing the lakes and the different things
right .
and we're having problems now because the fish are dying and certain parks are , uh , plants or plants or , closed plants or , um , plants or innocence , they're plants are increasing , anymore , not know cancer are responsible because the results , the water network is as the world's building frame .
and i know that there's been going up the pound up here .
uh , you know , governor going to be , you know , when you went and know of , uh , and burning to what's going on down there .
i remember when i was in florida ,
the only problem that was it seemed like it may ,
it wasn't really pollution , just the whole door .
oh absolutely ,
yeah ,
just gorgeous .
so , yes
i think ,
yeah ,
i think you're right .
our most issues goes down here is just so far .
yeah
it ,
but i , i , i , i think , you know , the biggest even then a lot of times are a lot of , uh , uh , like when i was up in boston just all the cars . you know , just all over the place .
you just got a lot of , you know , a lot of pollution from those
and , uh , you know , if you don't have a , a wind down here .
oh , yeah .
i , you know , i was in boston there
and i seeing some of these things that are gone at recycling areas , even with the bike .
absolutely .
uh , just this , it looked like of labor of europe and there and they sit there and then for the air conditioning to go .
i mean , yeah , that's what's in , you know , los angeles is ,
i think that's definitely the same thing
because when i was in los angeles for a time , it's all , you know , from los angeles to san antonio because it's all like .
right .
and there's really , there's been responsible for this to be , really ,
uh , hi like running movies and , you know , these sort of air pollution and that and help
but if you have to do anything .
that's , that's very true .
uh , you know , of course then when , when you're not , you've got recycling , these days and stuff , that can give you some pretty stuff going up in the atmosphere .
but i , you know , you've got , you've got the industry ,
you've got that ,
and you got the cars .
i think the cars are where , at least where it's right as far as weather , you pollution .
but , uh , i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if they have to do that , you know , i don't know , i don't know if they have a lot of people that are , uh ,
i , you know , florida doesn't seem to be at , like maybe stayed on ,
but i , i , uh , you know ,
they're primarily i , i don't know what the big are saying that are , uh ,
right .
but , you know , up here we have so much and the worst goal .
they put , uh , uh ,
you can smell in the air conditioning
it keeps the details i guess happy .
i guess so .
uh , cause they clean the , uh , the market for ours and
and they , they make catfish here
and they're the worst problem
but it's , you know , it's under so much control .
you know , windows is the only big them from them
but that's really getting under control now .
right .
i , you know , i don't know in the air conditioning what they do .
uh , i , i haven't run across any major painting down there that i've , i've really seen a lot of , you know , talking about .
uh , i , i know i've seen like , uh ,
my grandparents live in texas , well ,
and i know they've , there's a lot of down there
and that , that's some pretty exciting stuff they put up in the air .
i , but i don't know how , uh , you know ,
there's a difference in what you can smell and what you , uh , you know , what's bad ,
be interesting to see when , as their changes itself are , you know , without ,
