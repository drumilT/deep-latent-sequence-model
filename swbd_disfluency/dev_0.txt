that 's ,
you know .
kind of the way i feel .
oh .
the one thing that is also detrimental as far i 'm concerned , my skin is very fair so i 'm going to have to golf in the evening
or i 'm going to have to golf at a time when the heat of the day does not cook me .
right .
and i don 't think the ,
okay ,
have you participated in anything like that ?
well a little bit ,
we mostly do our newspapers .
we keep our newspapers , and stuff like that and we keep our newspapers and stuff like that
and we take them to be recycled .
uh -huh ,
uh , we , we have a pretty nice recycling center , uh , in our city now
and we take the newspapers and plastic and glass up there .
they 're open like two days a week
and you can just take it up there and drop it off .
uh -huh .
it 's kind of fun .
and everybody up there looks pleased with themselves when they 're taking their stuff in like they 're doing something good to ,
yeah .
help the earth , i guess .
and a lot of people complain because it 's really not convenient for them .
yeah .
yeah
my husband was complaining the other day
because he said every time i turn around you 're telling me some new rule about recycling
like yesterday i was tell him , you have to , you 're supposed to squeeze the plastic jugs before you take them up there .
you 're supposed to what .
every time he turns around i 'm giving him some new rule ,
but what are you supposed to do with them .
where you 're supposed to squish up the , you know , like collapse the plastic jugs .
oh , okay .
instead of taking them up there solid .
and i wish that our recycling center took paper bags .
they won 't take those .
we like to put our , just put our newspapers in a paper bag , you know , and then carry them up there that way .
uh -huh .
and we have to bring the paper bags back every time .
yeah .
because they won 't take them .
do you , uh , take your papers somewhere
or does someone pick them up ?
we , we usually collect a , you know , collect a quite a bit
and then we take them , take them in .
uh -huh .
we , um , we don 't take our cans up to that center , though ,
our aluminum cans , we like to take them to one of the places where they pay you for them .
yeah ,
we don 't , we don 't , um , use aluminum cans ,
uh -huh .
so , we generally don 't have those to do .
yeah ,
it takes us about a year to save up enough to be worth , you know , worth bothering to go in and do ,
but . do you , um , have any ideas on anything that would make ,
you know , they , they charge you , you know ,
it 's like a flat rate i think for picking up your garbage .
uh -huh .
and i know a lot of people it would , would solve the convenience problem if they had curbside pickup
and some communities are trying to do that now .
and i think that maybe if they only charged for the garbage that you did not sort and have set up for recycling ,
right .
they , they charged you by , by weight of how much trash you were actually sending to a land fill .
 yeah
that would be a good idea . 
 that that might be a better way to do it . 
yeah .
and then people would , would know that it was going to cost them money to not sort their trash .
right .
yeah ,
that would be a real good motivation for people .
you know , because then it would , then it would make monetary sense to them , you know , to say , hey , you know , if i just spend the time to , to sort this out where this stuff can be recycled then i don 't have to pay for them hauling it off .
right .
yeah ,
my father was telling me about some program he read about where you buy your bags , like you buy your garbage bag from the city ,
uh -huh .
and you pay more than just what you would pay for an empty garbage bag
but then you don 't pay any monthly fee or anything ,
so how ever many bags of garbage you throw away , that 's how many you have to pay for .
oh , yeah
that 's about the same kind of thing .
yeah .
yeah
that would be a real good idea .
i 'm trying to think if there 's anything else i could think of .
they are talking about going to curbside pickup in our , in our city  
where do you live ?
rowlett , texas .
oh , okay .
do you know where that is ?
yes .
and i don 't know if they decided to do , or not ,
but i think they said it was going to add like either a dollar or three dollars a month to your bill to have them do that .
although , i think a lot of those programs can operate at about a break even , break even point ,
 it seems like they would be able to . 
 without charging people .
 yeah
i don 't know , uh ,
i guess it just depends on how they manage it .
uh -huh .
i don 't know how much they get when they sell all that stuff .
the center that they 've got now where you take your stuff in i , i think that should be making some money .
yeah .
since they just have to hire someone to man it a few hours a week .
and they sell , i guess they sell everything to some waste company that comes and gets it .
yeah .
but i wish that , uh , more of the cans , you know , like the cans you buy vegetables and fruit and stuff like that in were recyclable .
i don 't ,
a lot of that 's that recyclable steel
and i don 't know anybody that takes that .
yeah ,
that 's true  
th -, my husband likes pepsi
and those cans are steel instead of aluminum ,
so we can 't ,  can 't ever recycle them .
i think it 's a good reason to quit buying it . 
 um , now i didn 't know that ,
cause we just usually if we 're going to ,  uh , buy sodas they 're in the , the two liter bottles .
yeah ,
that 's what we buy the most of , unless we 're going on a trip or something where we want to ,
yeah .
put the cans in a cooler
but , well that 's all i can really think about for recycling .
okay .
it was good talking to you .
okay .
uh , bye .
all right ,
bye -bye . voice said what 's that about >>.
tones >>.
voice said , where were they from >>?
there you go .
what do you think invades your privacy ? heavily
oh , well people that call on the phone all the time to try to sell you something . you know , that , that try to sell you the s -, newspaper , and , uh , wha -, carpet cleaning , and , uh , what else , roof repair
and enough ,
well i think it 's a waste of paper , the people that always leave , uh , junk mail and , because , um , you just end up throwing it away most of the time .
probably eighty percent of the , the junk mail that you get is , is , um , something that you don 't need .
and the same way with those calls .
what is it ,
oh m c i , m c i really does .
even when you tell them no , they keep calling back .
m c i
what 's that ?
m c i
it 's the long distance telephone company .
oh , now see i , i really don 't have much trouble with , i just say no thank you and hang up .
uh -huh ,
well they wo -, they won 't take a no for an answer here for some reason .
they just keep calling back .
i had a carpet service call up three times ,
uh -huh .
all within in an hour ,
but , i , uh , i do telemarketing ,
uh -huh .
so , uh , i 'm very polite
and i just say no thank you , and say no thank you very politely
and i hang up and ,
uh
don 't bother me after that .
yeah .
so i think the only thing that really bothers me is if when somebody contacts me
and they try to get information out of me .
uh -huh .
like the census bureau , united states census bureau .
oh yeah .
that bothered me .
uh -huh .
i didn 't feel they had a right to know how many bedrooms were in my house even .
right .
that i think is my invasion privacy because it 's the government
and i don 't understand what their need to know is .
uh -huh .
and i think that is my biggest objection to anything as far as invading my privacy . if somebody wants personal information out of me ,
but telephone calls i figure , they don 't bother me one way or the other .
uh -huh .
uh , i know when i do telemarketing , um , i 'm a soft person ,
if , if someone says i am not interested i 'll just say fine and back out .
uh -huh .
and i make very good sales ,
but i 'm not , uh , as i said , i 'm not half as pushy as these people because , i don 't really care .
i mean , if , if they 're not interested fine .
 you know that 's it . 
 you can 't force them to be . 
right .
no .
and i 'm not pushing something down their throat that , uh , i don 't think is a good item anyway .
uh -huh .
that i don 't think i could do anyway .
but i feel like , oh , movie stars , or
sure , it 's part of their , i guess they 're  portray  being a movie star
they get themselves in these rag sheets
but , uh , i think they go too far .
i think that 's invasion of privacy .
oh , yeah because they follow them around twenty -four hours a day .
yeah
and you know they do ted kennedy .
oh , yeah .
of course , he 's breaking the law all the time ,
so it 's a different story then .
you know , but , but ed mcmahon , i mean , you know , who cares about ed mcmahon .
he 's probably hasn 't done anything interesting in the last thirty years that they 've been on the air ,
you know .
and he has a chauffeur .
maybe he drinks
but he never drives a car either , you know ,
it 's not the same with johnny carson .
no ,
i think my , seriously my  classification  of , of invasion of privacy is trying to get personal information ,
uh -huh .
and putting it falsely out or just bombarding me for the answers .
without your , and without your permission .
right .
uh -huh .
this to me is , is my invasion of privacy .
right .
anytime i can honestly say no , or , throw the paper away , or ,
but you can always write to , uh , oh i forgot the name of it and stop the junk mail .
that i 've done . because i don 't want junk mail anyway ,
so i c -, wrote to them when it came on the air ,
so i don 't get any of that bull ,
tha -, it works by the way .
oh , good .
but , uh , the telephone doesn 't bother me because i leave it half the time , on , uh , you know , answering service anyway ,
uh -huh .
unless i 'm home ,
so i figure i can turn it off one way or the other ,
but i think that 's the only bottom line thing that i dislike .
because it does ,
other than the u s census , um ,
what was it .
oh the , the carpet place that called me three times ,
uh -huh .
that i felt was invasion because it was the same carpet place , and called me three times .
i mean one should be sufficient .
that 's right .
but , if people don 't use the telephone ,
it 's like i don 't know when the police has their project going
and i don 't know when the other ones have their project going and when they want to pick up down my street for things .
that 's the only way i know .
uh -huh .
and , uh , that 's i -,
well you have to have the telephone ,
but you can 't , you know ,
and , and it 's , sometimes it 's hard to screen out all the calls that you don 't want .
well see there 's no way of knowing ,
uh -huh .
that 's , you know , that 's the problem .
like the product i sell , uh , i sell mostly to older people which can 't get it in a normal public situation .
the only way we 'd get to them is by telephone .
um .
and , uh , most of them like it because the company i work for is nationwide , and , uh , reputable
and they know that hey , we 're backing it , one hundred percent .
ye -, uh -huh .
but , if we were denied the right to call people up , these people would never be able to get it .
because your normal companies that offer it , do not offer it in the amounts that we do
and they 'd never have it then , at that point .
uh -huh .
because we offer it in a very low , you know , quantity .
so i mean , i , i don 't know what to do as far as that 's concerned .
but it is nerve racking .
i mean it is nerve racking to have the telephone ,
but at least , as i said , you can always say no thank you
right ,
uh -huh .
i gather you get a lot of telephone calls .
sometimes ,
yeah ,
some days it just rings off the wall .
yes ,
yes ,
yes .
in other words you own your own home .
no ,
no .
i think that 's where they hit most of us .
like i own my own home .
uh -huh .
and you just know about what time ,
like some days i hate staying home because the phone rings all the time ,
but , uh , i don 't know ,
i haven 't been able to figure that out .
something else to do about it .
when they call up and want to say , well tell me this , this , this , this and i 'll give you a free something or other ,
uh -huh .
my answer is no thank you , i don 't need it .
and they say , well don 't you want to know what 's free ,
and i s -, no
if i have to give them so much to answer the questions to get fifty rolls of film or something like that , they 're taking something away from me
and i don 't like that .
right .
yeah
even if , i guess it 's for coupons , they , they have a survey they run
and it , i guess it , one of them is supposed to be a smokers survey
but the questions go a lot farther than having to do anything with smoking .
uh -huh .
and they ask , tha -, you know , they start out
and they ask you even , even to your income level .
i think that 's , you know ,
whether you buy a t v dinner or not , i don 't think it has anything to do with ,
are you ready to start ?
yes .
okay
have you recently bought a new car catherine ?
well , i just found out that my car like an old was thirty months old ,
and it doesn 't seem like it 's that old .
oh .
seems like i just bought it .
oh , wow .
it 's an eighty -nine
and i bought it , uh , in , uh , eighty -eight
so , yeah .
well , i really , i -, the last car we got was a , was a used car .
i really don 't prefer buying a new car .
i like to let somebody else pay for that
i know ,
i really will do that the next time ,
i buy it too .
but , uh mine was a year old ,
uh -huh .
and we bought it for very functional purposes ,
uh -huh .
and that was we bought a station wagon .
uh -huh .
we wanted an economical car to operate ,
but we wanted one that could carry a lot of equipment .
so , we chose a nissan stanza wagon .
uh -huh .
and i 've never been sorry ,
oh , that 's wonderful .
uh -huh .
however the need for that kind of car has changed now ,
oh , okay .
and , uh , while it is still good ,
uh -huh .
and it 's quite serviceable ,
huh .
and i 'll drive it until it no longer is reliable .
and probably then some
i 'll spend a lot of time praying over it before i give it up .
sure .
i think that i would like to ,
right .
if i -, you know , we all say , if i could have the car i always wanted i would either buy a nissan maxima , uh ,
i 'm sold on nissans .
uh -huh .
i a or , or foreign cars actually .
uh ,
but do you feel though , uh , craftsmanship is much superior to the american abilities ?
uh ,
is that how you ,
i have never ,
its reliability .
its re -,
its reliability .
and , uh , i , you know , i 've read all the consumer reports and things ,
and they just run head and shoulders above the american made cars .
if ford was a head and the shoulders above it , i 'd buy a ford .
isn 't that a shame .
but i had , uh , had a ford escort that absolutely needed  taps  the day we got it .
my word isn 't that sorry .
that 's sorry .
uh , you know , i mean it was ready for the graveyard .
my word .
and i spent as much on that car in twelve months as i spent for the car .
oh , mercy .
so ,
you ,
and that was just trying to hold us ,
getting out of that was a used car .
huh .
and it was an older car ,
huh .
huh .
but , you know , escort is supposed to have a great track record as far as sales .
uh -huh .
but it 's just , it just was not deliv -,
and you get stung a time or two ,
sure .
and you say , no thanks .
no thanks .
that 's right .
so , i just trusted the consumer reports and the auto ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
uh , reports inst -,
had my son who knows a lot about that , study them thoroughly ,
and he gave me four choices of cars to buy
uh -huh .
an escort definitely was not among them .
in fact , there wasn 't an american car in there .
wow .
uh , the nissan came
and , and we bought the nissan for functional purposes not what the consumer reports said we should get .
uh -huh .
but it served our needs .
uh , later on his reports , the reports that he studied showed that , uh , nissan was head and shoulders above the rest in the area -, in the class that we were looking for .
and that , and i 'd rather have a maxima than a cadillac .
i really would .
it 's not necessarily prestige ,
uh -huh .
but it 's comfort .
uh , there 's a lot of features on there that are desirable if you 're going to pay that kind of money for a car .
uh ,
who makes that car ?
nissan .
m -,
i mean but where are they , where are they ,
what , what is their location ,
is it , uh , asian
or is it european
or who ,
no .
no ,
no .
nissan is japanese .
oh , it is japanese .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh ,
okay ,
uh -huh .
i didn 't know .
yeah .
uh -huh .
and , uh , if i couldn 't have my luxury maxima then i 'd buy me a fancy little red  c r x  sports car
okay
i mean , you know , every othe -, every one of us have two sides
yeah ,
i guess so
that 's true .
 yeah . 
 yeah .
 now what about you ,
if you could have the car that you wanted what would you get
and why ?
if , if , if i had the car i wanted .
gee .
uh -huh .
probably , um , uh , let 's see , i like the looks of the lincoln town car
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
yeah .
 see there , 
 but i ,  i don 't know the performance of it .
that 's a ,
uh -huh .
ford product ,
uh -huh .
and , you know ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i would get hung up by my boot straps if i ra -, if i ever mentioned the ford product in my family .
uh -huh .
i tell you that 's sad too because there one time ford was the best ,
yeah ,
that was made .
yeah .
really was .
uh -huh .
and , uh , i , i really have not seen ,
now a lot of the american cars actually are , are , parts are produced in foreign countries and assembled here or vice versa .
can i put you on hold for one minute ?
of course .
thank you .
well , that was one minute .
they hung up .
okay
uh , at any rate do you have color preferences
or what would be the features that you would be looking for ?
um , well , the comfort of a large car that the security of a large car .
uh -huh .
um , and the luxuries of a large car .
uh -huh .
uh , now color preferences ,
i think i would opt to go with a bronze .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
which is probably closest to gold that you can get
yeah .
oh , wow .
we like the stuff that glitters
yeah .
good .
there 's nothing wrong with that .
actually i think probably if i were going to get a -, if i were going to be practical , which doesn 't mean i would be ,
right ,
well ,  practical
yes
that 's , 
 i would prefer  white .
uh -huh .
because , simply because it 's more visible at night .
right
and it 's cooler i believe ,
and ,
too ,
uh -huh .
when you 're driving in ,
uh -huh .
now the interior ,
okay ,
i don 't care about the interior just as long as it 's not black or red .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
but if i had the little red  c r x   ,
i guess the interior would have to be black leather
and i 'd have to live with that .
and if i got the  c r x  it would have to have a real good sound system in it because i 'd want that too .
oh .
i 'd just go back to my teenage years and just throw all my experience to the wind
um , can you , uh , hang on again hon -,
uh -huh .
thanks
i 've got the phones for lunch hour .
uh -huh .
so .
just don 't mind me if i bounce back and forth .
that 's okay .
um , so you like to listen to , uh , a lot of music ,
or do , is it talk shows .
no ,
no ,
no .
i generally would p -, uh , prefer to listen to , uh , well , i listen to k c b i a lot
but i will listen to the news and the , and the traffic and those things at work .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
but if i 'm going to be traveling in that car for any period of time ,
uh -huh .
i want some real good classical music .
uh -huh .
i love classical music ,
all the ,
yeah .
and you just can 't enjoy it unless you 've got a good sound system to produce all the , all the characteristics of the instruments .
uh -huh .
that 's true .
so i do love classical music
or it li -, or , or , uh ,
contemporary classical .
do you listen t -, do you lik -, listen to w r r ?
uh -huh .
huh .
sure do .
yeah .
w r r and the oasis are the two that i listen to ,
uh -huh .
more than anything else .
uh -huh .
and i do like them .
and i 'd like to have a compact disc player in the car .
that would be ,
 those are nice , aren 't they ? 
 something that i would really like . 
 yes ,
those are nice . 
 those compact discs , 
uh -huh .
really are good for cars because they don 't melt ,
they don 't warp .
uh -huh .
you know , there 's nothing in there that can wrap around the , the , uh , rollers or anything .
it seems like a really good answer to portable music ,
huh .
that you can choose .
okay .
okay ,
i , i do a fair amount of cooking .
uh -huh .
and , and i love having guests to dinner .
i probably do that about once a month .
and , uh , i usually prepare something , depending upon the guests , you know ,
it , it , i like to prepare chicken , that seems to please everybody , pasta or a casserole .
uh -huh .
how about you ?
yeah ,
those are things i like the most .
i like fish and chicken the most .
um .
and , uh , most of the cooking i do just comes out of a can .
uh .
unless it is , unless it is , i catch a fish and i prepare it .
and then i just , uh , you know , i just broil it and put lemon on it .
uh -huh .
well , that 's about the way i prepare most fish .
uh -huh .
uh , i made scallops the other night ,
that was unusual ,
and , uh , basically , uh , i found a recipe to make it in the microwave
and you sprinkled , uh , you swished around a little melted butter and do , uh , oh i do not know , micro -, microwaved them for about nine minutes .
no ,
no ,
four and a half to five minutes
and you had to add sesame seeds and bread crumbs on top ,
very simple , but very nice .
so , if you are looking for a french recipe , that was good .
sesame seeds and bread crumbs .
sesame seeds and bread crumbs .
uh -huh .
and , uh , my husband liked it .
yeah .
and , uh , no
unfortunately scallops are one of the more expensive , uh , fish items .
right ,
uh -huh .
but , you know , i , i look for them to go on sale at the grocery store
uh , one of the things i love to do , eat out .
how about you ?
oh , yeah ,
uh -huh .
do you have any particular places you like going ?
oh , there 's a restaurant called string bean on spring valley and central .
uh -huh .
i like that ,
it 's just , it 's just home cooking .
yes .
i have been there .
uh -huh .
and , uh , it 's kind of , kind of like black eye pea ,
but i do not think it 's a chain .
right ,
exactly ,
uh -huh ,
and that 's , that 's the other restaurant   black eye pea .
oh .
so , i do not really like , uh , you know , uh , uh , chili places or , what is it , judge roy bean 's ,
oh , yeah .
or i do not like greasy places .
yeah ,
i , i do not feel like they are very healthy ,
and i always ,
yeah .
feel like the home cooking places , are , are the healthiest meals .
you know , i tend to have chicken fried steak when i go , go to them .
right ,
and i , and i got , uh , chicken marinara the last two times .
oh , how was it ?
it was , uh , it was great .
um .
because that 's , that 's what i like ,
i do not like it , you know . i just like a baked , you know , a piece of chicken
and then i get like green beans and mashed potatoes .
uh -huh .
you know .
yeah .
i , i tend to , uh , i get teased by my family a lot , because , uh , i like experimenting on , on food
and sometimes i go for ex -, fairly exotic things .
and my father teases me about gourmet cooking .
uh -huh .
which is not always true ,
but and the thing about experimenting with cooking or anything else , is that some of the experiments fail .
yeah ,
that 's true .
uh , the last time we had some , uh , friends over for dinner , i tried a dessert that sounded wonder -, wonderful in the recipe
and it was just a total bust .
i was ,
yeah .
sorry i did not have ice cream to fall back on .
yeah .
my , uh , my brother tried to make , uh , a bunch of things , uh , way back .
he tried to make bagels one time .
oh my that 's ambitious .
yeah ,
and , uh , we took some
and then we had , uh , german shepherds at the time ,
and we took some and gave it to the dogs ,
and the dog never , you know , he treated it like a milk bone
and he never did finish it .
um .
he just barely made a dent in it .
yeah .
uh , and , uh , then he tried to made grapefruit citron one time .
uh -huh .
it 's , uh , supposed to be candy .
yeah .
and , uh , it , it did not turn out very well ,
it was , you know .
uh -huh .
it like made concentrated all the acid of the grapefruit into , uh , into a kind of a candy stick ,
so , uh .
huh , see i am not ,
that 's interesting .
one of the things i do not make is dessert .
uh -huh .
and , uh , my husband accuses me of putting him through dessert depravation , because , uh , you know , we have ice cream , or something like that .
and that 's why when i took , did this experiment for the company we had about three weeks ago ,
uh -huh .
it was just a total fiasco .
huh .
uh , everything else was fine ,
but that was a fiasco .
well , you have to put eggs and everything , don 't you .
or ,
uh , yeah .
yeah ,
just about .
yeah .
and i , i also don 't have much of a sweet tooth ,
so i can live without , live without dessert for the most part .
uh -huh .
use about half the sugar ,
or make everything diet .
yeah .
uh , do you cook for yourself
or do you cook for others ?
mostly , i just cook for myself .
yeah .
well , when i was single , i used to , uh , i think my favorite meal was a , a baked potato .
uh -huh .
and ,
it 's easy ,
that 's for sure .
oh , yeah .
yeah .
oh , yeah .
and , i mean , i never put anything other than a little butter on it ,
if i had , or if i had a little cheddar cheese , sometimes i would grate that up .
yeah ,
i always put cheese on them .
and , uh , it 's amazingly satisfying .
uh -huh .
yeah ,
but , you know , there 's hardly any , i guess there 's hardly any protein ,
it 's mostly starch .
so , it fills you up
and then the cheese has to make up for whatever the protein you get .
yeah .
i did -, i did not say it was nourishing ,
but it was satisfying .
oh , yeah ,
it really is .
and ,
then you have to make a salad
or ,
yeah ,
yeah
tha -, but , you know ,   i never really enjoyed cooking for myself ,
so i ate very simply .
uh -huh .
and i was , that 's why , i think that 's one reason i like having people over , because i could try things .
i mean , i must be a frustrated chemist or something like that .
right .
cause cooking is a little bit like , like being in a chemistry lab .
uh -huh .
and , uh ,
except you get to taste the product instead  
yes ,
and have an explosion .
fill them up
or blow up .
sometimes it blows up anyway .
yeah .
i , i once had a , an old boy friend over to , to dinner when i was recently staying with my parents .
and , uh , i had this wonderful recipe
and you were supposed to make a , a toffee like substance for a pie by , uh , boiling evaporated milk three hours ,
and it does turn to toffee inside the can .
oh , yeah
and , uh , the only problem was , when i opened the can , it just flew all over the place .
it was on the ceiling , on the walls and me .
and , and the boy friend thought ,
it was , he was supposed to be there at six o 'clock , not seven o 'clock ,
so just at the time all this happened , the door bell rang
and there he was .
and i had to have my , my , my , my dad sort of entertain him for a , for
right .
for awhile while my mother and i scrambled to clean everything up .
uh -huh .
did you let the can cool off ?
uh , i really do not remember ,
that was about ten years ago ,
i just remember how embarrassing it was .
yeah .
and i have made , i have made it since , i 've , i , and several times before
and i never had that problem ,
just that one time .
huh . yeah .
and , uh , he , he was a gourmet cook ,
he was kind of  pushy too . 
acted like , he came from san francisco
and he had a very sophisticated taste .
i , i really wanted to impress the heck out of him
and , and well , it was a memorable evening anyway .
right .
uh ,  as far as , 
i , i do enjoy cooking
so , i was awfully glad i was given this ,
are you ready ?
uh -huh .
she didn 't announce that to you ?
oh , i didn 't , i didn 't quite hear all of it .
oh , i see .
that 's fine .
um , i think , uh , that 's pleasurable for all of us , if we choose the right restaurant
right
so , what are your thoughts on dining out ?
well , i , i really choose restaurants more for the quality of food than anything else .
not for the price ?
okay .
well , a little bit for the price ,
uh -huh .
the be -,
but , uh , i think that as far as quality of food goes the m -, some of the most expensive places i 've been had the w -, the , really the , the worst quality of food .
really ?
okay .
really .
um , a lot of places that even don 't look , don 't look like much .
uh -huh .
some of the , some of the best food i have ever had was out of a , outside or inside of a place that we drove up
and i was like , i 'm not eating in there
are you nuts ?
and , uh , we went in
and it was the m -, it was the most wonderful food .
my word ,
it 's like mama in the back kitchen , huh ?
yeah .
oh .
i 'm serious .
yeah .
uh -huh .
um , a lot of , uh , one place that we went just recently uh , was to atchafalaya .
no ,
that 's not right .
that 's not right .
that 's not right .
okay .
someone in the what 's the name of that restaurant ?
in the background  where at ? 
someone in the background the hari krishna .
in the background relies  oh . kalachandji 's 
kalachandji 's .
it 's all vegetarian ,
and it , it was just fabulous .
i mean , my husband was aghast because i ate turnip greens and liked it .
wow .
and where was that at , near your ,
um , kalachandji 's .
it 's , uh , it 's a hari krishna run restaurant .
where ,
is it in dallas ?
yes .
is it in the phone book ?
uh , i think so .
it should be .
do you know how to spell it ?
uh , it starts with a k .
okay .
so
 kalli   , k a l l i ?
k a l a , i think , c h a n d .
okay .
that should get you close enough to , to be able to find it .
i think it 's , uh , probably listed in the restaurants , you know .
uh -huh ,
section ,
yes ,
uh -huh .
but it 's , uh , it 's just fabulous food .
what about fast foods ?
do you have a preference if you were going to ,
eat a fast food ?
well , we like arby 's .
you do ,
as far as ,
like arby 's ?
fast food goes .
see i don 't like arby 's .
oh , really ?
why ?
no ,
because they use everything they can and make this into pressed whatever .
they use the , they use the insides of the animals , heart and liver
and they , they form it ,
and they make it look like roast beef ,
and i said , no ,
thank you .
oh , no ,
no ,
no .
someone has been lying to you .
what they use is roast beef .
well , that 's not what i heard ,
that 's what ,
from one of , somebody that was supposed to know what they were talking about .
oh , my goodness .
uh -huh .
i 'm surprised .
my dad worked for arby 's for several years .
really ?
yeah .
unless somebody is trying to blackball them .
well , that 's happened before .
uh -huh .
but we like good s -, uh , w -, we 're , we like mexican food .
okay .
and stuff like that .
and so , um ,
how about the health food , uh , restaurants ? well , like this one
but it 's probably not advertised as such , is it ?
or ,
a health food ?
uh -huh .
health food , uh , restaurants that ,
like , like ,
name one
i 'm not sure what you 're talking about .
well well , like , um , well , i can 't really think of any off the top of my head right now because there 's so few and far between .
but they ought , there are restaurants that cater to the people that are very health conscious . you know , as far as their cholesterol levels and their , their fat content and , you know , the amount of calcium and so forth that are in each product
and they list them .
now there 's one restaurant that does that
and it 's called rodolfo 's
over on preston road and royal lane i believe .
huh .
and they r -, have very good food over there .
i don 't guess i 've ever been to anything like that
so ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
i really don 't have anything to compare it to .
they do list , um , you know , list the fat ,
it would be good i think ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
uh , i don 't know how expensive they are .
it sounds like that it would probably ,
well , it was pretty reasonable .
i , it was around ten dollars for lunch . okay ,
wha -, which is kind of high for lunch i guess .
for one person ?
yes .
oh
yes ,
uh -huh .
a bit
yeah .
uh , but ,
um , you were served by maitre d 's and , and , uh , um , men waiters .
yeah ,
i , i won 't really be interested in going to , in going there .
well ,
because ,
if you 're looking for a nice ,
i feel like i 'm , i 'm paying , you know , five dollars for the food probably and five dollars for something that i could get along quite well without
uh -huh .
well , i guess if you were having , if you were trying to impress somebody w -, like taking somebody that you hadn 't seen for a long time and wanted to show them a good restaurant .
yeah .
it 's a special occasion ,
maybe , maybe that .
yeah .
type thing .
 yeah . 
 yeah .
 i could see that ,
uh -huh .
then maybe .
and now the red lobster i found is very nice at lunchtime .
yeah ,
because they 're ,
i like the , the seafood that they , when they had it , you know , the broiled ,
well , they have lunch specials that
you can 't , you can 't beat that price , uh , if you went to a cafeteria .
yeah .
probably that 's true .
but i know a lot of their , a lot of their specials sometimes are fried things ,
that you can 't really get away from the fried ,
well , i had the , i had a broiled chicken breast
and it was excellent .
it was a marinated , broiled chicken breast
and it was exce -,
now why would you go to a seafood restaurant to eat chicken ?
oh , it was ,
that 's one of my husband 's pet peeves .
he doesn 't understand why somebody would go to a seafood place and eat either chicken or steak , you know .
well , i 've never had catfish either in a restaurant because i 'm from the north
and that was a no no .
oh , really ?
and i haven 't gotten over that from the north .
oh , catfish is wonderful .
i know they say that ,
oh , really .
that is ,
really .
but i 'm , but they 've got all these caution signs now on fish
and so i kind of stay a -,
why ?
oh .
because of all the pollution in the lakes and the , everywhere . i mean there isn 't any safe haven anymore for fish .
huh .
i -, and especially , uh , in wisconsin and michigan they say , no , buying of our fish .
that 's too bad ,
i ,
because i 'm probably not going to stop eating it
well , yeah .
so yo -, i am ,
and the , the best brand of chicken to buy is the , uh , pilgrim pride because they don 't use all these hormones to  remote   , uh , unnatural growth in their products .
uh -huh .
yeah .
so i mean , we have to be on the lookout if we want to stay healthy .
that 's true .
so i 'm , i , you know , i ,
oh , on one hand i see that
uh -huh .
yeah .
and on the other hand , uh , my older sister remembers when , uh , at one point they were taking radioactive wastes and storing them in tin barrels which i -, i guess ,
corrode .
had a half -life of , oh , five years if they sit empty on dry land .
huh .
so they 're putting radioactive waste in it which reduces it dramatically .
uh -huh .
and then they take these things that will rust
and they throw them in the ocean which is going to speedup the process even more .
well , i 'd like to get ahold of some engineers and knock their heads together if it would do any good .
oh .
and then they wouldn 't think .
they were floating around
so they shot holes in them to sink them .
oh , dear .
and this is before i was born .
wow .
so , i mean we 're taking thirty years ago ,
sure .
this happened ,
yeah .
that 's right .
everything we eat .
and , and who 's , you know , the tuna is radioactive to a certain extent .
you can 't get away from it
so i think ,
everything , everything we eat should have a label on it
to some point ,
 yeah . 
 yeah ,
 you know . so there 's , you know , there 's some things i think we can av -, we ,   you know we can 't avoid for health purposes and some things that we just need to like , you know ,
this is not in my control .
well , you know ,
so i 'm either going to be , i 'm either going to starve to death
or i 'm going to get over it and just go ahead and eat as healthily as i possibly can , you know .
well , becky , you know , even if you lived off your own land , that you would have to put caution signs ,
do you use credit cards a good bit ?
i do ,
and i wish i didn 't
uh .
 uh -huh . 
before i got married , uh , about the only credit cards i used were gas cards , because i didn 't like carrying , you know  the cash  with me all the time ,
uh -huh .
but i just never wanted to get into the hang -up of using credit cards and having all those bills hanging over my head .
uh -huh .
in fact , i remember getting my first mastercard ,
okay .
absolutely .
and the only reason i got it was , you know , there was a while years ago when you couldn 't cash a check without like a mastercard or visa
right .
and so that 's why i went ahead and got one .
uh -huh .
it was a mistake
yeah .
well , actually , i , i have a whole wallet full of credit cards .
yeah .
i don 't use them very often .
um , oh , i may use , i try to use at least one gasoline credit card a week , and try to use a different one , so that , you know , i have , keep those active .
yeah .
i have a half a dozen department store credit cards ,
yeah .
and i , i 'll use those if i need to run in and buy a dozen pair hose right quick or something like that ,
just enough to keep them active .
my biggies are the visa , mastercard and discover .
yeah .
yeah .
and for the most part , i had used those for like , uh , charging airline tickets , where i can pay for those , you know , you could make the transaction over the telephone ,
or i fly southwest a good little bit , which means i can just run that card through the machine .
that 's right .
uh , and it saves a lot time .
and that 's what i was using it for .
however , we had a , had a , a very pressing financial family crisis , which said you have no alternative ,
you must have the money to do this with ,
uh -huh .
and you do not have any other options so i charged all three of those cards up ,
and right now i am paying and praying .
but , uh ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh -huh
i know how that goes and that 's exactly what we 've , i mean i have to say i have been thankful for them , because there were times when it was just like that when we had to have the money we had no way around it and the only way to do it is go get , you know , an advance on a card and so like you were paying for it ,
but it 's one of those i 'm glad it was there .
well , i never did , right .
i never did use it for an advance .
most of my charges were , uh , medications .
oh , i see .
didn 't have cash for the medications
or it was , uh , the doctor would accept mastercard or visa
oh .
and , uh ,
a lot of times you can get by using those for , uh , uh ,
what ,
different labs will use those charge accounts for ,
do you find now , though , that even some doctors won 't ?
i 've found some doctors that say , you know ,
i was so used to doctors or medical care places taking credit cards ,
and so many of them don 't anymore .
uh -huh
so ,
well , i have not ,
like i said , that was just one period in my life where that was critical .
yeah .
i don 't generally charge .
i say well , i need a checkup in six months ,
right .
and i kind of set that aside and just pay for it .
i 'm reimbursed on insurance anyway ,
and i can handle , you know , paying for it and waiting two or three weeks .
right .
getting into a credit card fiasco is easy .
oh , it is
it is easy ,
and it 's very difficult to get out .
i just cringe every month when i see those interest charges .
i know .
i say wow ,
i , i ought to go to the credit union and borrow the money and pay this off .
big deal ,
i 'm saving two percent .
right .
but , you know , the interest , even though it bothered me , it didn 't used to bother me so much , because , of course , you could list it on a schedule a
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
and you got all your interest , you know towards your tax deductions ,
and now they 've messed that up to where it really is a financial burden to have to pay it .
right .
and but it , but it is easy to get into a credit card problem ,
and i , i think about young people that think , you know ,
there 's kind of that feeling of hey , it 's so neat ,
uh -huh .
i have my first credit card and , and they just don 't understand that you still have to be able to make the payments .
oh , yeah ,
you know .
and it 's not just paying back what you 've charged ,
that 's right .
it 's paying that and half again .
that 's right .
uh , you send in , uh , uh , fifty dollars ,
you 're going to pay twenty , twenty -five in interest charges .
that 's right .
you only get half of that paid for the principal ,
so i 'm looking at three or four years before my balances are cleared on those charge accounts .
right .
now , as the monthly payment , uh , i mean as the monthly payment amount goes down , that will free up more cash where i can continue to make the larger payments .
right .
uh , as long as i don 't have a major disaster where i have to use it again , i can , i can do that .
right .
meantime , though , i 'm not building any reserves .
no ,
and that 's frightening to me .
anything that i could be put aside into savings is going for interest on those cards .
that 's right .
that 's frightening , too .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh , i , i just , i , my husband is in business for himself i work for t i
uh -huh .
but he doesn 't and , uh , we 're , uh , i , i 've kind of got my fingers cr -, crossed .
uh -huh .
i 've learned when you 're in business for yourself , that , that you don 't count on something until it 's happened you know ,
but he 's got some , you know , it 's those once in a lifetime cases ,
uh -huh .
and after ten years he 's got two of them and they should pay through next month ,
and , and we 're both just looking at each other every night going man , that will pay off like both of our mastercards , you know .
oh , right ,
right .
and , you know , just in one lump ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
because that 's the only way you can do it , is to have a big chunk of money or it 's like you say ,
you pay forever .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
and so i 'm really looking forward to that .
well , you either need a big chunk of money
that 's right .
or you need a large reserve so that if you do charge on that account , you can make a single lump sum payment .
right .
sure ,
yeah .
i agree .
now , those are very handy if you have the reserves and you can make lump sum payments , sharp , good no problem because you 're living on the other guy 's money for a while .
that 's right
but i can promise you that those credit card companies are going to ride high on my money
i know
and ,
and it just irks me .
i say my gosh , i had to work three hours just to pay the interest on this ,
and i 've got three cards .
i know .
i 've lost a whole day of my life to interest .
you 're like what am i working for today
yeah ,
yeah .
and that just blows my mind .
i , my house is paid for ,
my car is paid for ,
i 've got some home improvements ,
but even the payment on that doesn 't equal the payment on one of those credit cards .
it 's incredible .
uh -huh .
boy , i wish i could say that my house and ,
well , my car is paid for now .
it was wrecked three weeks ago ,
uh -huh .
but , but you see again the credit cards came in handy .
i had to have the money to pay rental car , pay this , pay that till the insurance company pays back .
that 's right .
and , uh ,
yeah .
i think that is a good , healthy , safe use of credit cards .
because you know that 's coming back to pay it off .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
uh , i went to a seminar ,
they said don 't ever use your credit card for consumable items .
you only use credit cards for investments .
right .
it 's ,
sure .
i  said  for crying out loud , if i had the money to in -, you know , if i could do some investing , you 'd have to invest at better than twenty percent earnings in order to pay for the payments on the credit card .
that 's right .
that doesn 't make a bit of sense to me .
that 's right .
i thought god dang , where is his pencil ?
well , the smart half was don 't pay it for consumables ,
that 's right .
don 't , you know , if you can 't afford to go to a restaurant and eat out and pay cash , don 't put it on a credit card you know ,
and , and so that , that is the smart half .
uh -huh .
but , uh , and i can remember before we had kids , we did that a lot ,
uh -huh .
but it was no biggie you know , because we could pay it off ,
while after kids , and you 're paying child care and other things , all of a sudden it 's not so easy to pay off ,
so we cut that out real quick
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
and , uh , but i , i do like having them there .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh -huh
there is a bit of security in having the credit cards and knowing that in times of crisis , they are there to use but you have to have a very good sense of saving , and or common sense not , not to get yourself in trouble .
uh -huh .
you also have to have that willingness to commit to that because you 're committing a good portion of your life and income when you do it .
well , well , pat , did you vote in the last election ?
most assuredly .
oh , you did ?
yes ma 'am .
i 've voted in every major election since i turned twenty -one .
oh , that 's great .
well , why do you think ,
 people don 't . 
 don 't always  vote for somebody .
i sometimes vote against somebody
that makes sense too .
i think that a lot of it is , uh ,
i know that my late husband was simply indifferent .
he didn 't feel like he had any say .
there was too many people , too many other votes .
for example , you know , he 'd say , well , look , you and i see different sides of the fence .
if i go vote you 'll cancel my vote .
i said , i sure will .
and ,
he said , so , i just won 't vote .
i said , then mine counts ,
then does ,
because you could cancel mine too .
yeah ,
i think , i think , that 's a lot of people ,
just indifferent
uh -huh .
i know that i 've moved around a lot .
in the past , um , three years i 've had three different addresses .
uh -huh .
each time i change jurisdictions or whatever .
sure .
so i just haven 't ,
because , i mean , graduate school or whatever ,
so i haven 't kept track of it .
i did , when i lived steadily in one community , i always , i voted .
uh -huh .
but this past time i didn 't .
well , actually i voted it for the presidential election ,
uh -huh .
but then i didn 't vote uh , i guess , in the two year for , uh , some legislators and things
and ,
uh -huh .
well characteristically , in some , in the local elections typically those people who vote are those who feel very strongly about an issue .
right ,
uh -huh .
if i do not feel very strongly about an issue , then i see no reason to go vote .
right ,
yeah ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
and that 's probably one reason why i voted in the the last election , but not really this one because this one really didn 't matter that much .
uh -huh .
yeah ,
it 's probably true .
well , of course , of course listening to government , the instructors , you 'll find out that everything matters ,
but then you could go crazy worrying about everything .
well , you know , they also say that most people vote their local politics , that , that local is far , much more important than , uh , national issues .
uh -huh .
right .
well that 's the way you get to national and that 's the way you make changes about your neighborhood ,
oh , i definitely think so .
uh , i know that i have been involved in preparing and in , in , uh , carrying out a lot of the local petitions that take place .
uh -huh .
right .
even something so simple as getting a street light in between lights on the end of the block .
uh -huh .
yeah ,
that 's true .
but it makes a big difference when it 's the difference in having a child run over in the dark .
yeah .
uh -huh .
and , uh , it took a close call to wake us up and cause us to take that kind of action ,
and that 's completely unnecessary .
uh -huh .
in another particular case they were trying to put in a , um , senior citizen 's home in , in an area very near our neighborhood ,
but if you just cross that major street , the character of the neighborhood changes ,
and it 's less savory .
uh -huh .
okay .
and that , i was just very , i felt very strongly about that ,
those people simply did not have access to safety , to security
and they were at risk .
uh -huh .
and it was for elderly people who lived alone ,
and they were going to put a cluster of , of houses there for them .
but even clustering together for the elderly does not ensure safety .
no ,
most now ,
that 's true ,
and all it , all it did was to , in my judgment , make them ,
prepare them to be ,
victims ,
yes .
easier targets uh -huh ,
yeah ,
easier targets ,
and so we , we did get a petition together
and we very strongly resisted it ,
uh -huh .
and it was placed in a actually , it was placed clear , closer to my neighborhood but it was on the ,
right side ,
 right side of the street . 
 of the tracks ,
yeah . 
and , uh , it , it , i think that they 're , they 're much more comfortable there .
uh -huh .
did they ,
uh , i haven 't seen too much crime in my neighborhood ,
uh -huh .
yeah .
although we have a good crime watch program but it 's , it 's very serious just across the street .
did , um , did you think ,
i know that texas 's last gubernatorial , uh , election probably brought out a lot of voters .
well .
did that , did that seem to ,
well .
because that re -, that got national attention , national attention , i guess , having a woman governor running against a man and whatever .
no ,
i don 't think it had to do to with woman running against man .
i think it had to do with dirt running against dirtier .
uh -huh .
yeah .
and that 's it it was a dirty election .
people were calling each other , uh , names and every bit of the trash ,
it was a , it was a dirty campaign .
it was a dirty , mud slinging campaign .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
well , you know , what 's funny , up here , uh , i live , i see a lot of virginia news and i guess , uh , senator robb and governor wilder are active right here ,
uh -huh .
and they have some type of wire tapping problem going on ,
and the people in virginia are complaining ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
see robb is married to lynda bird johnson and the people in virginia are complaining that he is , he 's using texas politics in virginia and they 're really complaining big time ,
because they said that we don 't have that type of trashy politics up here like they do in texas all the time .
well ,
 of course , now , that 's not all  the time .
 so you , you guys were getting  yeah ,
you were getting slandered , i think ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
yeah .
we 've had some pretty we were having some pretty healthy uh , campaigns that were based on issues there for two or three of the gubernatorial races but , i , historically , texas has had mud and muddier campaigns i mean , it 's just , i think that eventually , you know , the better people have sensibilities
and they vote on those people who are least likely to do damage .
unfortunately , that 's not always the way it should be .
uh -huh .
you don 't want to vote for the person who is least likely to do damage .
you want to do the one who can do the most good .
do the most good ,
yeah ,
that 's true .
and , uh ,
i guess that 's why ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
okay ,
i know that , um , i 'm previously from pennsylvania and dick thornburg who 's now the attorney general is going to run for senator because , uh , john heinz , a senator from pennsylvania , died in an airplane crash and i know that they 're expecting a gigantic turn out to landslide dick thornburg into , as , into the senate because they don 't like the governo -, the governor 's political appointee , or whatever and they 're almost expecting landslide out , uh , turn out , right now for for that election .
so you so , you see ,
uh -huh .
yeah .
that 's very negative motivation isn 't it isn 't that too bad .
uh -huh .
we really could use a little positive motivation hey , we think this guy can really make some changes
and we 're going to support him .
yeah .
that was true in a lot of cases in , in a couple of the older sixties campaigns .
uh -huh .
uh .
what ,
in texas ,
was that when , you ,
no ,
i 'm talking about national campaigns .
that 's , that 's true .
yeah .
uh , even when john kennedy was elected , there were so many strikes against him ,
but there were people who believed he could make a difference .
right .
now , that 's not to say what has transpired or what really was ,
uh -huh .
i 'm saying that 's how it was perceived .
that 's , right ,
that 's perception ,
that 's true .
and , uh ,
oh , yeah .
because the , those were big political , that was a big , um , turn out election .
absolutely .
uh -huh .
and , and it was people going to vote for , i think , more than those who voted against .
uh -huh .
i know , i know that in my own , uh , area of people , whom i knew and how they were going to vote , they didn 't go to vote against , uh , a politician as they did a little bit later when nixon was running .
uh -huh .
they went to vote against the less of , lesser of the two evils in certain cases .
yeah .
uh -huh .
but i think that one was one that you had some very strong feelings among people ,
and they voted their convictions .
uh -huh .
well , i think that also happened with ronald reagan .
absolutely .
you 're right .
he was he was landslided in
and people really saw that was ,
there we go .
uh , so , uh , what do you consider the most important benefit besides salary ?
boy , i , i don 't know .
that 's a , that 's a , a tough one .
uh , uh , and it 's , uh , i suppose it 's , it 's changes as , uh , as percep -, my perception changes of , of what , uh , i 'm getting gypped on
that week ,
right .
and this week or this month , uh , uh , uh , we 're just , uh , going through , uh , uh , well , there 's a couple of changes to the , to the , uh , our health plan
and , uh , and i guess right now the one in my mind is health insurance
but , uh ,
um .
if i step back i 'm not sure i 'd , i 'd , uh , say that .
what , what about you ?
well , uh , i , right now i 'm in sort of a weird situation .
oh , okay .
i 'm a graduate student that , uh i don 't have that many benefits per se
yes ,
okay ,
uh , sort of get ,
but , but , on the other hand , one of these days you 'll be out looking for a ,
yeah ,
yeah .
my wife has a real job
and i can see from her angle .
uh , uh , i think health insurance is real , real important .
yeah .
i 've , i 've , i 've , i 've discovered .
i mean , even in my case it 's sort of , they 're really , uh , a pain in the neck about it up here
because the university makes me buy a small ,
yeah .
they , they have a mandatory , they have what they call the mandatory portion of their health insurance they offer insurance to everyone ,
but then the basics that are major medical , they , they force you to buy here .
now i 'm covered by my wife 's anyway ,
right ,
okay .
but i still pay them a hundred dollars a semester for , uh , mandatory .
so that 's sort of annoying that i 'm paying for something i 'm not getting in that case .
i 'd rather that , that went to something else .
and , and , yeah ,
and the benefits you 're getting for that hundred dollars a semester , uh , you , you never use because you just use your wife 's .
right .
i mean , uh ,
and , and , and it turns out that actually , uh , the benefits they , you know , that , that hundred dollars sort of would , would entitle me to go to the university health services here , you know , and , and use them
and it turns out that i do think they 're v -, they 're excellent physicians there .
so , through my wife 's h m o , we 've registered for them as our primary care physicians
so we go there anyway ,
so they 're , they 're , so if they were to bill , which , which i believe they don 't ,
but if they were to bill the h m o for my business , they could , in , in theory , be getting paid twice for the same thing .
but they 're not , thank god .
uh , but anyway , uh , otherwise , i would imagine , uh , good vacation is , is important , although i don 't know if that 's really a deciding factor for many people on a job .
i don 't , you know ,
uh , yeah ,
i , it , uh , the , the , that , that 's a , a negative about , uh , where , where i am in that , uh , well , i came out of , uh , i worked five years civil service
and there it 's , uh , if i remember right , you well , they , they accumulate it as hours per week or something like that and , or hours per pay period or something ,
but , anyway it works out as i remember basically to , uh ,
you start at , at , uh , two and a half weeks or something like that ,
and it , at three years , uh , it goes to four weeks i believe ,
and i , i 'm coming up on , i 've been at t i now , uh , uh , coming up on fifteen years
and it , and it just , uh , this year is going to go to four weeks here
so ,
oh , wow .
uh , uh ,
so that 's really ,
yeah ,
that 's a , that , that is a , a , a negative , but , uh , but , not , probably not at , probably not a deciding factor ,
but , uh ,
yeah .
i mean , i don 't , you know , i don 't , i know my wife , uh ,
yeah .
i think she gets , you know , about two weeks a year , i guess but they 're pretty good about it if she wants other time off .
they , you know , usually let her ,
well , that , that ,
yeah ,
yeah .
that 's , that 's the thing is how , how flexible they are for comp time kinds of kinds of things
and , uh , uh , that 's the , the , the , uh ,
yeah .
oh , really .
that 's a , why it hasn 't made all that much difference is because the , with the civil service , that you could take , you could take your vacation in increments of one hour and , uh , and , but , uh , there wasn 't , uh , anything as far as comp time ,
just ,
yeah .
so you tend to dribble away a week of it a year , uh , you know , an hour here a couple hours there kind of a thing .
yeah .
uh , whereas , uh , here i , uh , things are free enough to , that , uh , the , the actual vacation time per year probably isn 't that , isn 't that much different ,
but , uh ,
but , uh ,
that 's , well , that 's a that 's reasonable , i think .
yeah .
i think the , i think the health insurance ,
i think that 's , that 's going through changes everywhere to , uh ,
the , they 've , uh , uh , gone through a couple years ago here where they , uh , will cover you much better if you go to their designated hospitals
and now they 're in the process of developing a list of , of , uh , designated doctors , uh ,
so that just routine visits , uh , they will compensate much better for , if you go to their designated doctors .
yeah .
which , which , uh ,
my assumption is that , that will not include my doctor since , uh , he keeps real busy without having to , to , uh ,
weigh all sorts of other things .
yeah .
yeah ,
i think , i was watching something the other day about that actually on , uh , a news special or something like that
and they were saying how in some sense that , that 's good because that makes health care affordable for everyone and makes , you know , lowers the cost of everything and all insurance
and in other cases it 's actually bad because it winds up people , you know , don 't get to , they have much less of a choice in who they can use and stuff like that
so ,
well , and , and i think in the , in the , in the much bigger picture than , uh , to some extent hospitals and doctors have some , uh , fixed amount
uh -huh .
and , if , if you don 't work for somebody that 's got enough clout to , to , uh , uh , give you , you know , give you these rates and make this agreement then , uh , you 're not covered by that ,
and , and the added costs get passed on to you ,
right .
so uh , i 'm not , i 'm not sure ,
it , my , uh , one of the phrases i use is that , that it 's moving towards , uh , private socialized medicine . that , uh , in terms of the negatives of , of always heard in terms of socialized medicine , you have no choice on who you , who you go to for a doctor and things like that , uh , where it 's the government that decides ,
here it 's , it 's , uh ,
least off , who decides .
yeah ,
uh , and , but it , but it 's the , the same , the effect is the same as the ,
you , you , uh , get left out of the loop more .
right .
i , i , i know that their , uh , idea is that , uh , if , if you have to pay a bigger share , you 'll , you 'll be more careful about spending the , spending the money and , and helping hold down the costs but , uh , i , i , i don 't know ,
in terms of , in terms of , uh , the health care , i , uh , find that , that , uh , although i 've , i 've been lucky enough to never have any big problems , but that , that , uh , the cost is not a , a big factor .
right .
i want to , i want to know if the doctor 's doing the right thing to make me get better .
yeah .
yeah
and ,
you want to know that , that , that when you pick a doctor , you know , you , you could pick one who you could have some sort of a feeling about .
yeah ,
that , that 's the ,
well , how do you feel about spot test -, spot testing for drugs ?
well , basically i think it would be a good idea myself .
i , uh , i think if somebody 's not on drugs , they have no reason , you know , to be afraid of it .
uh -huh .
uh , i do think that there has to be some controls , uh ,
like , i don 't think one test positive should , uh , be , uh , the end of it , you know .
 right . 
 i ,  i think they should test more than once .
yeah ,
 it 's , it 's  it 's refreshing to hear somebody ,
 it , 
that has a similar opinion as mine .
i mean , all these people that are against it that may , the -, you know , they may not even be on drugs .
they , they call it an invasion of privacy .
uh -huh
and i don 't see that .
that 's right .
to me that just doesn 't sound like a valid argument because this company is paying you good money that you 're working for and they , i believe that ,
faint >>.
they have the right to know if you 're using a , a dangerous substance
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
 but , 
 there 's  so many jobs that , uh ,
really have other people 's lives in their hands or even their own life
uh -huh .
and , you know , and it 's , uh uh , how can you do anything about a problem besides if you don 't know about it ?
right .
  right  
you know , and i just , um , i ,  i think  there definitely needs to be some control to it .
i guess it is possible to have a false positive report .
yes .
no ,
i , i , i agree that , you know , you , there needs to be a , a well thought out , sane approach to ,
how to administer that program .
 uh -huh . 
 just because  you , you , something can get mixed in the mail ,
uh -huh .
or uh , the chemicals could react incorrectly than , than what you would expect them to .
 and , yeah ,
you , you know faintly >>, 
 or somebody 's  test gets mixed up with somebody else 's .
 right . 
 i mean ,  those things do happen .
yeah .
right ,
uh , i certainly wouldn 't want people 's lives ruined  uh , wrongly . 
 and , you know , i 've  the , the , the company that i work for , uh , has just recently , well , you know , within the last couple of years , instituted for all new hired employees ,
they submit to a urine test .
uh -huh
and , they , they say that there 's been , you know , they , they , they 've also implemented random testing .
uh -huh .
 uh -huh . 
and    , it hasn 't happened to me in the couple of years that , you know , it 's been in progress  but , uh ,  i , i fully agree with it
and there 's , you know , there 's all these memos going around about folks that are disgruntled and feel it 's an invasion of privacy ,
uh -huh .
and i , i agree with you .
if , if , if you feel it 's an invasion of privacy , you 've , you 've probably got something you 're trying to hide
yeah
 yeah . 
and you maybe need to look for some other type of job to do  that ,  uh , doesn 't require the testing .
right .
uh , to me , it 's , to me it 's not an invasion or privacy .
i think it 's people have a right to know if , if , uh , their , their life maybe 's in jeopardy or , uh ,
or , the quality of their product .
yeah .
their work , the work they 're doing for their company .
uh , those things are all affected .
if not immediately , it certainly does eventually .
yeah .
i think that 's where a lot of the problem is at first .
uh -huh .
it doesn 't seem to , uh , bother the quality of work but eventually it does .
right ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
because it usually requires more and more of that substance that you 're misusing to get the same effect .
uh -huh .
um .
course , i feel the same way on the aids problem .
i , i don 't think that 's an invasion of privacy ,
that 's the only communicable disease that they 're not allowed to test for
you know ,
and it 's destroying a  lot of   people 's lives 
 and then   and one of the  few that they don 't have a cure for
yeah ,
and it 's , you know , it 's , it 's destroying people 's lives
and i , i think that person , plus anybody in danger should , should b -, know about it and be aware of it .
yeah .
  faint >>.
i don 't know .
it 's , it 's kind of hard to
i guess the gay movement has had a lot to do with considering that , that , uh , an invasion of privacy .
of course , that 's not supposed to be what we 're talking about today , i guess .
so ,
yeah
i kind of get off on a tangent here .
uh , do you work for , uh , texas instruments ?
yes ,
i do .
uh -huh .
and i 'm , i 'm down in the , the central ,
but i don 't know how familiar you are with texas ,
but i 'm in a , we live in a town , uh , near a town called temple .
um .
which is right in between waco and austin on the freeway .
oh , that 's probably why ,
my brother did live in grapevine , texas .
that 's near dallas .
right .
uh -huh .
we 're probably about two , two and a half hours south of him .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
so .
it 's pretty hot down there probably .
oh my !
yeah
it 's , actually , we got about two inches of rain in about three hours , yesterday .
oh , did you  really ? 
 oh , that 's great . 
 and it 's   cooled things  down somewhat .
it 's getting more humid  now ,
but , 
 uh -huh .
 we , we need rain real bad up here .
uh -huh faintly >>.
it 's , uh , everything 's really getting dry .
it 's , uh ,
yeah faintly >>.
it 's been about three weeks since we 've had any .
yeah .
it 's kind of at a dangerous level here .
people hauling water ,
um .
and , uh it 's getting real bad .
wow .
so .
how about that ?
so .
well , i hope you do get some rain up there .
um so do i
i faintly >>,
uh , i can 't think of anything else , uh .
yeah ,
 uh -huh . 
 uh -huh . 
i , i guess being in  agreement  kind of tends to limit the conversation  you know 
uh , i can understand
i know if somebody is using drugs and doesn 't think there 's anything wrong with them , i can see them objecting . you know ?
there 's a lot of people that think that there 's nothing wrong with  
one of the things i found interesting ,
it , it 's funny that you mentioned that ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
t i is pretty much a worldwide company and we have manufacturing plants all around the world including some places where the use of certain drugs that are illegal here are not illegal .
um . uh -huh ,
 uh -huh . 
 yeah ,
 they don 't have to submit to drug testing like , like they do here in the states and some places abroad .
oh , i 'll be darn .
yeah ,
i thought that was kind of interesting  too . 
 yeah ,
 yeah ,
yeah .
the different cultures and that  too , uh 
 i mean , uh , uh ,  from a quality standpoint , that 's not , i mean , just because it 's not illegal doesn 't mean it doesn 't affect you the same way .
no ,
no .
i 'm sure it would have to affect you the same way .
 yeah . 
i , i can 't think that would make any difference  whether  it was legal or not ,
 right . 
 it ,  it would still have to affect you the same way .
yeah ,
but , like if you 're going to do business in another country , you 've got to respect their rules .
uh -huh .
i mean if , if , you know , that , that 's the trade off .
oh yeah .
you can 't you go by their laws .
yeah .
the same way our people have to go by their laws when they 're over there .
huh
that 's why a lot get in trouble because they have to follow their rules
right .
and , uh some of the countries are very much against drugs
and you use them , you pay for it
usually with you life in some  places . 
 yeah ,
 a lot of them .
yeah .
 that 's right . 
 where , where  is it they lose the , if they steal they lose a  thumb or a finger ? 
 yeah ,
from the middle east . 
is that where it is ?
yeah .
 iraq , iran , in that area . 
 i thought , wow 
yeah
you know , that 's quite a deterrent
well , in saudi arabia , you know , using , uh , alcohol and drugs and something like that , you get the death penalty .
yeah .
yeah .
so , it 's pretty strict over there
yeah .
so i guess , you know , we , re -, we have so many freedoms over here we sometimes forget about  how   great out country  really is .
 well ,   people tend to  take the first amendment out of context .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
which , which means you know , i could do anything i want to
and you can 't stop me ,
and you know
yeah .
they , they abuse it is what they do .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
so , that 's ,
so ,
i don 't know .
i 'm , i 'm glad to see more and more companies implementing the policy ,
okay ,
let 's talk about schooling .
yeah .
uh , what , what contacts do you have with the public school sy -,
okay ,
well , i have a boy
and he just went into middle school ,
and i have a girl ,
and she 's in , uh , grade school ,
and then i have a little boy who goes to , uh ,
they have something just before kindergarten ,
and it 's called early childhood ,
oh , okay .
and i have a young a young boy in that .
uh -huh .
so i , i have a lot of children in , in the school system down here .
uh -huh .
and , um , i think we have excellent teachers here .
i am really , uh ,
like the stu -, like the way the teachers work with the students .
uh , i 've not been so , um , happy with the schools themselves , i guess .
uh -huh .
like , my , last year , my son and daughter were in the same grade school before he moved up to middle school ,
and it was just packed .
i mean , it was a , a fire hazard if we had any kind of assembly there with parents .
yeah .
and it was just a real problem .
uh , so we had to do a bond issue and , and , um , vote to take money and either have students bussed to different schools if that 's what the prefer to do , or to , uh , work on the , work for another school to be built , which is a good idea ,
but in the meantime , the school still has lots and lots of kids in it .
yeah ,
yeah .
so , um , i think one thing is that would ,
maybe we don 't have enough schools ,
and secondly , when we have enough schools , sometimes we can 't get the , the support for the teachers that we need to pay them to keep good teachers .
well , i think that 's , i think that 's , uh , true .
i , i 've got a little different , uh , contact ,
oh .
uh -huh .
but i 've , i 've got a , one son that graduated from high school last year and another son that 's a , a sophomore this year and , uh , my wife teaches kindergarten here in richardson .
oh , great .
uh , but , in general , i , i think the , the , you know , one of the reasons that we , we , uh , the , chose to live in richardson when we , when we came here was the , was the schools ,
and i think that plano and richardson in terms of the , uh , things seriously wrong with the public schools are not nearly to the extent th -, that
we see through the , out the country .
uh , right ,
right .
and i think , i think part of that is that , is the , the , uh , a big part of that is just the demographics ,
uh -huh .
i think that 's right .
the population in those schools are , are , typically , uh , people that very much value the education and support the , the school systems and , and , uh , although there 's still some , still some problems ,
but , uh , i , you know , i , when i was , when i was going to school ,
i grew up in iowa ,
and , and , in my family , school was certainly valued ,
yeah
but if there was ever any sort of a , uh , if ev -, if i was ever in trouble in school , i was also in trouble at home even more so ,
the home ,
yeah .
i think that 's right .
and i think that part of it is , is not exactly with the schools , but with the , with the , uh the culture that doesn 't , doesn 't value the education and doesn 't value the schools and doesn 't support , uh what the schools are , are trying to do .
yeah ,
that 's true .
it is so hard with a family system , um , either divorced or , or just one parent or just li -,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
and then , if both of them have to work , even that is a , a hard situation for the children , uh , to , to have a supportive system around them to make school work for them and i think it 's real important that the parents work with the school , um i think what you said is , is really a pinpoint , though , that the student and the family life really adds or detracts what 's happening in the school so , um , what about your wife ,
is she , she happy at school
or  
well , uh , she , she works very hard as a kindergarten teacher .
i bet she does .
she has , she has two half day classes .
uh -huh .
yeah .
right ,
right .
uh -huh .
so she has , uh , you know , on the order of twice as many students as as the teachers in the higher grades and uh , uh , but her , her background is in , is in , uh , child development , and and , uh , so forth ,
and so kindergarten is as high as she , as she wants to teach ,
yeah ,
and she 's she 's teaching rather than something else because that , that , that 's the jobs that are available and that , the schedule matches , uh , you know , with our kids and things like that .
right .
so , yeah ,
uh , and , but , uh , the
so , the ques -, the question had something to do with usage of personal computers , um .
yes ,
we are , we are talking about computers this morning .
um , i 'm a firm believer in , in having lots of them .
i 'm sitting at my desk now with four machines in front of me .
you have , you have four machines around you ,
boy , well , you 've , uh , you 've got me beat .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i have a , a zenith here and at home i have a commodore and a zenith ,
and my wife has an a t and t twelve hundred , i believe it is .
good grief .
what do you do with all those ?
well , actually on my commodore i mainly study lottery numbers , would you believe .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
right .
uh -huh .
i have written some , uh , programs in basic whereby i can select any number of , uh , drawings and from that extract the numbers that have appeared the most i have another program in which i can look at the cyclical , uh , appearance of these numbers to see if there 's anything that 's consistent on that .
i have another number that allows me , another program that allows me to add all the numbers i want ,
uh -huh .
and then it generates a complete set of numbers so that all combinations are covered so this is what i do most of the time , uh ,
that 's what you do on your , at least one of your machines on your commodore .
on my commodore on my commodore ,
uh -huh .
and of course i have , uh , word processors ,
yeah .
and i write all my letters it 's wonderful , uh ,
uh -huh .
my , uh , thoughts in my head come in bursts of about a paragraph at a time ,
yes .
and i get them all down ,
and naturally on a computer if you make a mistake , who cares ,
yes ,
yes .
you can go back and , uh , correct it very easily so that makes it very , very nice .
i get all my thoughts down and go back and clean it up very , very readily .
so how about you , charles ?
well , i , um , i do an awful lot of preparation of documents , um , uh ,
uh -huh .
and i use word processors and , and fancier programs , i mean you know , graphics programs and simply make all of our slides ,
some of them i do on a sun ,
uh -huh .
some i do on an x t now maybe we don 't call these personal computers , um ,
yeah .
i started out with , you know , an i b m p c back in the , you know , about a year after they came out and , you know .
so , whe -, where , may i ask where you work , sir ?
i work for the government in washington .
i know you work for the government ,
i just wondering are you an    ,
or what , what , what section of it ,
of , in , in , in an obscure part of the defense department .
oh , uh -huh ,
because , see , that 's my type of work , too .
uh -huh .
i work at the applied research lab here , here on campus ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
and , my , my field is underwater acoustics and there 's a lot of things we can do with computers into , uh , studying how , uh , things vary in the water , you know and , uh , taking advantage of them , and so forth ,
so it 's a very nice , very nice field ,
and i , i am retiring at the end of this month . end of december , excuse me .
are , are , are you , are you also a professor ,
yes .
or , or do you just research .
i 'm a , i 'm an associate professor ,
yes .
but my , i , i 'm a full time researcher and it 's , uh , been a very , very interesting career , believe me .
i can believe .
what are you going to , what are you going to do when you stop , i mean , take all your machines with you , or ,
well , uh , the ones here in the laboratory obviously i 'm , they 're going to stay ,
but i have similar machines at home .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i would consider doing some more consulting when i get home but i have a very , very busy extra life anyway .
i 'm also a musician ,
yes .
and i play in several symphony orchestras and , uh , i run a concert band ,
uh -huh .
yes .
yes .
uh -huh .
and so i have a lot of external , uh , interests but i do want to get very deeply , much more deeply into computer work , because obviously the world is going to be controlled run and operated by computers in the future .
there 's no doubt about it ,
because it is really taking over ,
uh -huh .
and the amount of work that we 're doing and the depth of things that we are studying can basically only be handled by computers , because , uh , it 's so much involved and it sounds as though you 're probably more aware of that than i am , because , uh , i don 't get to use it in my daily work as much as i would like to .
yeah .
yeah .
here again let 's say i 'm starting to getting ready , in preparation for retirement and , uh , so basically what i 'm doing is slowly getting rid of my things .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
for many , many years i had a full size acoustics , uh , study laboratory whe -, where i could take recordings and , and , uh , perform experiments with them and so forth ,
and so that 's gone now ,
and so i 'm sort of out of business .
um .
uh , as i say , i worked with  
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
fellow named steve blazey was the fellow i worked with for many , many years and he is now retired .
so it 's been an interesting life ,
and computers have come in towards the latter end of that .
i wish we had had computers in the very beginning .
it would have been ,
seem to have the topic already on top of th -, tip of your tongue there
so why don 't you go ahead and start .
yeah .
isn 't the , uh , the subject auto repair ,
yes , sir .
for tonight ?
yeah .
that 's great .
the reason i say that is pretty timely because just tonight i went out and changed the oil in my car
and ,
okay .
right ,
exactly .
that 's something i like to do and , uh , something i , something i can do with now the sophisticated auto , cars we have today with all the computers and everything .
it 's , uh , and there 's not a whole lot you can do without the equipment and electronic analysis that needs to be done on a car ,
but i do like to get out and tinker with a car
and it 's something i can do still .
do you enjoy working with your car ?
i sure do .
i , uh , in fact , the last thing i have , i 've done i , i don 't even remember what it is .
i 've had to have oil changes done myself because i live in an apartment complex ,
where we are not allowed to ,
oh , dear .
work on our vehicle .
we can 't even wash our vehicle ,
so .
oh , that 's too bad .
uh , but the last thing i can remember doing wh -,
i had a sixty -six mustang ,
oh .
and that was all right because like you said that was pre technology days , i guess .
oh , yes .
and , uh , you know , you could do a lot of it yourself still ,
and , uh , i didn 't tinker too much with the engine .
it was , it was in pretty good shape ,
but my main concern and what i enjoy doing was , was the interior .
oh .
and , uh , it was , it was pretty shelled , uh ,
but it was fun .
it was taking the whole thing , you know , the whole interior apart and , you know , ordering new carpeting and , uh ,
and did you install all that yourself ?
right .
and ,
well , that was , i bet that was a lot of fun .
it , it was .
i , my wife enjoyed , uh , she , you know , helped out a little .
we sanded down the , the insides of the door panels .
uh -huh .
and painted ,
wow .
those and ,
do you still have the car ?
no ,
i sold it .
well , that 's too bad .
a sixty -seven chev -, uh , mustang is about the , uh , top , top year for the mustang car .
yeah ,
it was fun though .
it was fun .
i , i really enjoyed it ,
and i was surprised at , at , uh , the availability of parts yet .
yes .
you know , you can , you can still get factory original parts .
huh .
but , uh , you pay a premium
but you just don 't get them .
i , i didn 't .
i went ahead and got , you know , japanese made duplicates or wherever they were made ,
canada .
yeah .
you know , prefabs and all that stuff
but ,
well , you know , that 's , that 's fine .
i , i don 't think that there would be , uh , you know , a , a quality difference .
i don 't know .
you wouldn 't , you didn 't notice the difference , did you ?
well , actually there was .
oh .
and , uh , i had heard rumors that it was because they couldn 't duplicate certain patterns , uh , exactly .
uh -huh .
and so like the , the glove box was just a little , little wider ,
oh , dear .
little harder to fit in ,
uh -huh .
and the carpeting , uh , stretched a little too far .
i had to cut some of the sides down .
oh , dear .
but just , just little things .
you know , one of the screws on , on the door regulat -, uh , window regulators
you could get three of the , three of the four to lineup .
the fourth one you couldn 't get to lineup no matter what you did .
oh ,
you know , thin -,
i bet that was frustrating , wasn 't it ?
oh , it was
but ,
the end result is after you put your , your panels on , nobody sees that you got one screw missing in your , your window regulator anyway
and ,
right ,
right .
it , it runs . it works just the same ,
so .
yeah ,
that 's , that 's true .
well , you know , that , that is something i really enjoy doing . um , working on our car too ,
the , uh , i just changed my oil , oil tonight
but , uh , i enjoy also working on things like the brakes
and , uh , in fact , just two weeks ago i helped my neighbor out on his brakes on his car .
and , uh , either if it 's a drum or , or disc brakes , i enjoy working on those kind of things .
disc brakes don 't seem to give me too much problem
but i , i honestly don 't have the tools for the drum .
yeah .
spoons and ,
i know you got , uh , certain spring lever that you got to have or some , uh some spring pulley or something that you got to pull that spring back over onto that notch .
yes ,
you do
uh , my dad has got all that
and , and i , i helped him when i was growing up ,
uh -huh .
but i don 't have that stuff now ,
yeah .
because of the drum brakes i , you know , don 't have any choice but to take them in .
yeah ,
that 's true .
and , you know , it , it doesn 't , doesn 't hurt every once in a while to have them done professionally too
because , um , i was helping my neighbor out
and one of his drums needed to be resurfaced
and i don 't have , of course , the equipment to do that ,
sure .
so he took it into a shop and had it resur -, uh , resurfaced and , and fixed that way .
but , yeah ,
it is true , uh , you know ,
i did have a sixty -four ford truck that i wish i still had and loved to get inside that and tinker around with it and work with it ,
uh -huh .
because you didn 't have all the extra , extra stuff ,
that 's in there now .
i 'll tell you what .
the other , the nicest thing about them is , uh , everything was standard .
you didn 't have to worry about finding a metric anything .
oh , yeah .
boy , i tell you .
and you know ,
uh , what do you think are the major social changes ?
well ,
what age , uh , if you don 't mind me asking .
well , i 'm , i 'm , uh , thirty -one .
oh , well , you 're , you 're young .
yeah ,
right
i 'm in my early fifties
so you should take my word
you 're young
oh , i , you know , i 've seen a social change ,
yeah .
it 's definitely ,
for sure ,
and it 's , uh , uh , and besides that , i came from california where social change is like , you know ,
every day ?
yeah .
i mean every second .
you know , social change in california means it takes another two or three minutes longer to get to work .
yeah ,
i can believe that
and , uh , when i started work there in , it started , you know , actually going to work in eighty -two ,
i guess that 's when it was .
between eighty -two and eighty -five , uh , it started out taking me an hour and fifteen minutes to get to work ,
and then it became , you know , an hour and a half , to , you know , some days , two hours to get to work .
that 's social change .
that 's , that 's social change .
well , what do you think is , is the major social change ?
oh ,
right now .
yeah ,
that 's , that 's a , that 's a tricky one .
i 'll let you go first .
okay .
i think probably the big major change is the role of women .
uh -huh .
i think , one , the women , uh , in the work force .
uh -huh .
and i think the fact that they 're becoming , uh , more , uh , how do i want to say , not necessarily politically inclined ,
uh -huh .
but they 're more apt to be in political offices now .
uh -huh .
i think , you know , we 've made great strides in that respect .
i think that it , thirty years ago , when , uh , i was newly married , family was very , very important .
uh -huh .
then i think we veered where the family was not as important a unit .
and i think now it 's revolving back full circle .
uh -huh .
i think the family unit is becoming much more important than it was .
oh , i think it 's , that 's probably for two reasons .
uh , you know , the number one is , women wanted to get out of the house .
and the second reason was , is everything costs so much more that if you don 't have , you know , equal rights so that your wife gets equal pay , you can 't make twice as much
that 's true ,
that 's true
well , i know that economically , uh , a wife almost has to work anymore .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
and yet , i 'm also noticing , uh , in the areas that i 'm working and stuff , more and more women are wanting now to stay home with the children where fifteen years ago they didn 't .
i mean , you know , they wanted children ,
but they still wanted to be their own person out in the work force .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
but i see , i am seeing women now wanting to stay home more , at least until the children are up to , you know , school age .
uh -huh .
yeah .
and , uh , i find that very interesting that , that it 's sort of reverting back .
yeah ,
i , i 've , i 've , i 've found that , too , you know , where the wife is married and , and ,
i mean , not , not married ,
sorry ,
wrong word .
uh -huh .
where the wife has gone to school , you know and gotten a degree , spent five years out in the work force , found , you know , the , the , their husband , either at college , or whatever ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
but still , you know , after five years , it 's like , first kid and then they 're out of the work force for another ten years .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
but , i think most of those people are still out
probably .
i think that generation , they 're all at home right now
and , and we won 't see them back for another two or three years .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
uh , i 'm , very rarely do i meet anybody whose children are , are , you know , past that age when they 've been away for a few years .
uh -huh .
but , uh , it 's kind of different .
yeah ,
yeah ,
it is .
it , uh , i , i note that i had , taken care of my grandchildren recently while my daughter and her husband had been out of town .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
and i do not envy these mothers or these fathers that have these , the children that they have to rush home from work and pick them up at day care , get them through their homework , get them to their soccer practice get them to their piano lessons .
i mean , that 's tough .
i , uh ,
i don 't envy these young parents
i 'm an assistant scout master
and that 's , that 's it 's like , uh ,
yeah ,
parents , uh , even rarely see their kids for weekends , which is , you know , kind of rough , too .
that 's true .
that 's true .
 especially now . 
 i don 't know . 
yeah .
and , and i 'm finding , you know , running into these , uh , women that are wanting to have their children at the age of thirty -nine , forty , i 'm thinking at the age of fifty -two , you 're crazy
yeah .
you 're going to be doing your worst running around when you 're fifty
and you 're absolutely nuts
i , i know two women that , that , uh ,
let 's see ,
one of them 's forty -nine
and the other one , well , the other one , i don 't know what her age is ,
but i know she is , she is somewhere in that hairy age of half a century up there .
and , uh , boy , i 'll tell you ,
these are the , the go -gettingest , happiest people i 've ever met .
you know , because ,
well , you can be go getting ,
but you can also get gray hairs and have a nervous breakdown
i 'm thirty ,
i 'm getting gray hairs already
i just know it , it would absolutely exhaust me .
maybe it 's because it 's my grandchildren
and it 's not my children .
um .
maybe that 's ,
okay ,
uh , let me see , i 've got two children .
one is , uh ,
both preschoolers ,
one is two
and one is , uh , four .
uh -huh .
so , and , uh , this is my first year off ,
and i 've always worked , uh , from the time that they were little
and so i decided to hold off on my job for a while and stay home with them and spend some more time with them which i hadn 't been doing .
well , i think that 's wonderful .
so ,
my children are in college .
oh .
but i teach school
and i teach , uh , middle school age children .
oh .
and so i see a lot of , uh , variation in what happens when kids are at home .
yeah .
uh , i have taught school ever since my children were little .
uh -huh .
but the advantage of teaching school is your hours are closer to your children 's
and your holidays are , too .
yeah .
so teaching , i think is a , a good career to have and still be able to spend a lot of quality time with kids .
well , that 's what i was doing before ,
i was teaching for richardson school district .
uh -huh .
and , uh , it just seemed like it took a lot of my time with them being so little .
right .
and it 's really hard .
well , with them being as young .
it was much , much harder when mine were young .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
and , uh , i really didn 't have that much of a choice because my husband was trying to finish his , uh , college work and his master 's degree and so forth ,
and so it was a matter of somebody had to have a   job .
that 's right ,
that 's right .
and that 's what was kind of what , where we were , you know ,
we , i really didn 't have to work ,
but i felt like i really wanted to work .
uh -huh .
and i felt , i also felt like , boy , i was sure missing a lot
and they were growing so fast
and you know , it 's like , do i really need to work , you know ?
uh -huh .
and i , and it , that choice was there ,
i really didn 't have to
and , you know so i did have that advantage there ,
but it 's different staying home too , you know .
yes ,
it certainly is .
we ,
it 's an adjustment to make , also .
well , i think that , uh , we need to spend more family time together with , with children today .
uh , we made a point to spend a lot of quality time
uh -huh .
yeah .
and the activities that we were involved in were the activities the kids were involved in , you know , like , uh , through scouting or you know , anything like that
we participated .
and , uh , we always made a point to have breakfast together and supper together now .
wow , that 's great .
when ,
yeah ,
when , uh , the kids were in high school , it was harder to always have supper together ,
but we did always have breakfast together .
uh -huh .
so , we , we had supper together as much as possible ,
uh -huh .
but when it wasn 't feasible , you know , we kind of kept a master calendar and when it wasn 't feasible , well , that was understandable ,
yeah .
but uh , we 've always tried to spend time to talk and , uh , have some time , together time
and we sat around the table ,
wow , that 's great .
we didn 't sit in front of a t v or that kind of thing .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
so i think that 's been important , because we do have a close family and even though the kids are basically , uh , grown , uh , they still like to sit down at the table and us all eat together when they 're here and uh , have spoken before of , they want that kind of , you know , situation for them when , you know , and their children when they marry and have children .
yeah ,
kind of goes on .
uh -huh .
they do what they see , you know .
that 's right .
they model
uh -huh .
yeah .
uh -huh ,
yeah .
and , with the dysfunctional families today , i 'm sure , with a , as a schoolteacher also , you see what happens to these kids when these families never communicate or they 're dysfunctional as far as the , between , uh , oh , second families , uh , one parent families or all those kinds of problems that they have
and then you see them magnified in the children .
yeah .
plus , you teach middle school ,
so i 'm sure that ,
oh , boy ,
yes .
you are really , you really ,
boy , oh , boy .
uh -huh .
i taught early childhood so i had the little ones .
yes .
and , uh , you know , i saw it there , too ,
and you , you know , you just oh , it 's , it 's , kind of an eye -opener .
it is .
so ,
it is .
uh -huh .
and m -, i think most teachers realize the value of quality time with children and i think we make a point to do that .
yeah ,
i think you 're right .
yeah .
because we see we see all the time , the outcome of not doing that and i think if we weren 't so interested i -, in children , in child care , then we wouldn 't be teaching anyway .
right .
so ,
right .
uh , i wish we could reach more of the rest of the world
yeah ,
yeah .
i think , uh , the major problems in education are not what 's happening in the schools ,
it 's what 's happening in the families .
i agree ,
yeah .
yeah .
and , uh , they expect us to , you know , have , create miracles at school and fix all the problems and take over the roles of the parents as well as that of the teachers and you get to a point where it 's completely impossible .
yeah ,
i agree .
i , i know exactly what you 're saying
and you just get more and more frustrated
and yet , you feel for the , the kids .
you do the best you can
but ,
okay ,
uh , what do you consider an invasion of privacy ?
uh , i was just now told that 's what the topic was
and , uh , i guess invasion of privacy , uh , to me , for example would be unauthorized use of credit cards uh -huh .
for example .
and , uh , i guess recently one of the t v stations here , uh , ran a series of , uh , news casts on unauthorized credit card usage and how easy it was to get a person 's credit card numbers .
it 's very easy .
and use it
and i was quite surprised at that .
i guess i can consider myself fortunate that , uh , it never happened to me .
i don 't know what i 'd really do if it did .
now , i 've never , i 've never had that happen to me either .
what do you think about places ,
like i was in michael 's the other night and charged something ,
and they asked for my home phone even though , you know , the charge had been approved .
what do you think of that ?
uh ,
does it bother you to give it ?
no ,
not really because i 'm listed in the phone book .
if i was the type of individual that , uh , had an unlisted number , i , i think i would be hesitant to give it .
you know that they , they now have a , uh , i believe it 's a federal law that you do not have to give your phone number on charge tickets .
one of the things that upset me when i lived in california was , uh , they did a lot of things with s -, your social security number .
security number ,
uh -huh .
as a matter of fact , they even went to the point of printing our social security number on your driver 's license .
oh .
and they would not cash checks unless they had your social security number ,
so we had our social security numbers imprinted on our checks .
uh , uh -huh .
and i was really , you know , unhappy about that situation .
i think that was an invasion of privacy .
privacy ,
yes ,
yes .
i can see , you know , where that was .
i , i don 't mind my phone number and address or work phone being given , you know , when i have to cash a check .
i don 't see any need for it when i 'm charging something ,
but i , neither am i a person that has the guts to say , no ,
i 'm not going to give it to you , either
right .
you know , and , uh ,
one of the biggest things , i think that 's going on in this country right now is the selling of , uh , mail lists and things like that .
yes ,
yes .
uh -huh .
you know , uh , recently we , uh , i purchased some magazines , u s news and forbes magazine .
uh -huh .
and every since that day , i have been inundated with , you know , uh , subscriptions to this , subscriptions to that , uh , this news letter , this investment letter , uh , even to the point of people calling me at home .
and prior to me ordering these magazines , i never got those kind of calls .
right ,
right .
and ,
i discovered with , uh , charge cards , uh , i feel like that i don 't know whether it 's the stores themselves that sell the list or whether the , uh , uh , credit report bureau sells it ,
but i get catalogs from people i 've never even heard of .
uh -huh .
and i know they have to be coming from my charge cards , you know .
from some , some list ,
yeah .
from some list , you know , that knows that i have a , say a charge account at , at neiman 's or something
uh -huh .
right .
because then i 'll get catalogs that , you know , are within that range that i would never order from ordinarily ,
and , uh , you know , and i get , i get tired of that .
i , because i look at all that junk mail ,
all their time .
and i think of how inept our post office is and how that 's taking up you know , all their time to sort
and they 're not even paying full postage .
sure .
you know , and if you did away with some of that , our postal service might give better service .
right .
i think the general public would be , you know , uh , tremendously upset if they knew how easy it is for , uh , let 's say the criminal individuals to , to get access to people 's records , uh , their credit cards driver 's licenses , checks , things like that .
uh -huh .
uh , i don 't think anybody really knows what to do about it .
no ,
no .
computers caused a lot of this , i 'm sure .
well , you know , let 's face it ,
computers can be gotten into very easily if you , if you really have the , the know with all , if you 're , you know , so inclined to , uh , oh , what do i want to say , have the smarts to be able to tinker with something like that .
sure .
you know , and have a basic knowledge ,
they 're very easy to get into .
to tap into a system .
seems as though they are ,
yeah .
uh -huh , you know ,
and , uh , which is scary ,
i mean , you know , our lives are on computers .
unfortunately .
and , uh , and i don 't know ,
i kind of , i resent the calls of an evening trying to sell me something .
uh ,
fortunately , i haven 't , uh , haven 't , uh , been inundated with that situation yet .
we are constantly , it seems like .
i don 't know why .
you know , either wanting to clean our carpet , sell us storm windows ,
okay , jerry ,
i guess tonight 's topic is about recycling .
uh -huh .
all right .
and i 'd like to tell you first of all what 's happening in our community here in plano .
right now we have a pretty nice recycling program where a lot of the recyclable materials can be picked up by the , by the collection agency or the , the city along with your garbage can .
uh , you can put out newspaper ,
you can put out glass ,
you can put out aluminum cans ,
you can put , put out certain types of plastic material
and that is on a roll out effort right now .
not all the citizens and the people in plano can go ahead and , uh , participate right now ,
but , uh , that will be rolled out to everyone , i hope , in the next year or so .
and those that aren 't participating , they have the specific drop off sites where you can take glass and newspaper and aluminum .
and i think , uh , overall that 's an , an excellent opportunity
because i hate to see our landfills being filled up and , uh , growing bigger and bigger and bigger where they are becoming a big problem for o -, not only the people that are living today , but for the future also .
so ,
yeah ,
uh , i was read -,
how about your community ?
my community ,
that 's cute .
i live in a place called dye mound .
dye mound ?
or dye community .
uh -huh .
and it 's not a city , not incorporated ,
my nearest neighbor 's about a half a mile at least ,
i can 't even see their house
and , uh ,
sounds like a place where i grew up
yeah ,
i mean , uh , i 'm out in , i 'm out in the wilderness .  literally . 
 well , i like it . 
and , uh , well , give you an idea ,
it 's three and a half miles of dirt road to the concrete , i mean , to the asphalt ,
we 're out there .
uh -huh .
and , uh , we , i do some interesting recycling things .
well , good .
i 'm building our house right now
and i 'm going to incorporate into my , uh , garage area a weight activated , uh , crusher .
oh , okay .
so when i drive the car in the , in the driveway in the afternoon , it , it will just drive it up on a ramp that actually puts me on top of the , the , uh , pressure side of a , uh , hydraulic cylinder .
uh -huh .
and the weight of the car will crush ,
what 's ever in the disposer .
oh .
hope -, hopefully , it 's not my wife .
well , let 's hope not .
you can be , uh , get in trouble for that .
well , i thought i 'd , you know , i 'd use it as a , an escapement type thing .
i don 't know if you 're familiar with that operation ,
uh -huh .
but , what you do is you just build up the pressure and then you go over and release it
and then it just , it just drops , you know .
well , it 's quite similar to a hydraulic jack , isn 't it ?
very similar ,
yeah .
okay ,
okay .
well , what , what it will be , you just , you drive up on the jack ,
but you , it won 't go down .
yes ,
until you release it .
until you pull the pin ,
yeah .
all right .
i think ,
anyway i have another , uh , recycling method i use .
yes .
you know all that junk mail you get ?
oh , yes ,
i sure do .
uh -huh .
the glossy paper that says , buy this , and send off for that and you have won and all that .
uh -huh .
oh .
well , anytime they send me a return envelope i put all that stuff back in the envelope plus the other stuff that i , you know , happen to gather up .
because , uh , well , like i say , we live a way
and when you throw trash away , you throw it in my yard .
yes .
no .
and i don 't like that so i don 't do that .
so i take it
and i send , and i mail it back to them .
well , great .
that 's excellent .
i 've had four companies actually stop mailing me stuff .
well , uh , if a lot of people did that , then we wouldn 't have a lot of this junk mail .
that 's a great idea .
i hadn 't thought about that
and we might be able to incorporate some of that .
one thing ,
yeah .
well , i think one of the , the best ways to eliminate , uh , or help the recycling problem is to eliminate non reusable items .
right .
for instance , uh , i saw a thing on , uh , nova , i think it was the other day .
uh -huh .
this guy has designed recyclable materials , i mean recyclable items .
right .
whatever he makes , it 's all out of the same thing .
oh .
see , so , plastic , it 's all out of plastic .
yes .
if it 's metal , it 's all out of metal .
it 's , he 's a design , he 's a engineer , designing stuff .
well , that 's a great idea ,
that 's a great idea .
products .
yes .
and , and , in -, incorporating , you know , reusable materials into your , uh , you know , your assembly line into your actual scheme of product operations is is the only way to really do it on a , on a broad scale .
uh -huh .
make it financially , uh , attractive to recycle and somebody will find a way to make money at it .
yes ,
they will .
and ,
exactly .
well , there is a guy in dallas ,
that 's all he does .
huh .
he collects trash . you know ,
and ,
well , that 's a full time job .
yeah ,
well , he 's , he 's out for cardboard .
yes ,
well , i 've found out , too , that , uh , you know , a couple years ago ,
we 've always been recycling newspaper for the last twelve years ,
and at one time we could get a pretty good return , uh , with the boy scouts .
we could take and collect the newspaper ,
so , a -, are you a news person ?
uh , i really am ,
i enjoy , i enjoy listening to the news and getting as much as i can . although , you know , i 'm a full time student
and i work full time , too ,
so , or not full time ,
but i work quite a bit
yes .
and so so i mostly depend on the radio , you know , on the way to work .
i like , i like to listen to national public radio , uh , all things considered .
yes ,
great show .
yeah ,
and i like to listen to that and catch , you know ,
i don 't get , i don 't get a lot of , uh , sometimes i don 't get the current events , you know . because that show kind of has feature stories that might not directly deal with , uh , you know , some important issue on the day .
but ,
yeah ,
yeah .
so , so the real , the real current news and , the hard news is , is not , there is not really enough of it there .
right ,
that 's right ,
yeah .
yeah ,
i 've had , i 've had that frustration , too .
yeah
i end up switching stations from time to time .
yeah ,
you , you li -, you like n p r uh , programming ?
uh , in general .
yeah .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh , i watch a lot of c n n uh , and c span .
uh -huh .
uh , i , i subscribe to three newspapers .
uh -huh .
uh , you know , i sort of can 't get enough of this .
yeah .
and , and i , when i travel elsewhere , i 'm often amazed at the local papers how little they have .
h -, h -, h -,
oh , yeah .
of world , world events and national events .
oh , yeah .
well , in , in dallas , what are the , what is the newspaper situation ?
well we d -, we , we have a , a big newspaper situation .
uh , because , we used to have two newspapers up until , uh , last sunday
and a , uh , major , uh , a , one of our major papers just closed down .
they closed shop , and said , well , we can 't put any more papers out ,
we 're done .
was , was that the , the better paper
or     , 
 yeah ,
i thought so .
 it was a , it was a more effective paper as far as i was concerned .
it , it had , uh , uh , it got to the news , you know , and gave you the dirty facts pretty quick and easy .
uh -huh .
uh , which i like .
i don 't , i don 't like to , you know , i like to save the editorial information or the the politically , uh , weighted information , you know , for the , for a different section .
yes .
i like just to get to the , you know , find out what 's happening pretty quick .
and i feel that the other newspaper , uh ,
the t -, the dallas morning news is the one that 's still here .
the times herald is the one that closed up
uh -huh .
and , uh , the , the morning news was , was , i -, is okay ,
but , you know , you have to wade through a lot of editorial garbage as far as i 'm concerned .
uh -huh .
you know , many times it doesn 't doesn 't reflect my own opinion
and ,
uh -huh .
but if you , if you were to look at the front page of today 's morning news morning times rather , w -, would you , would you see things about what is going on in europe ?
no ,
no ,
that 's the problem .
oh .
but , y -, you know , you see , you see troy aikman 's knee surgery on the front page , you know .
whoever troy aikman is .
yeah ,
a , a quarterback for the broncos or for the , for the cowboys .
okay .
yeah .
uh , you know , you know , you know what i mean that , there is , uh , local news that , uh , that really a lot of times doesn 't , doesn 't change , change my life one way or the other .
yeah .
so , uh ,
i guess it 's current events , but not the kind of current events that changes the world .
right ,
right ,
yeah
not something you 'll , you 'll , uh , be interested in ten years from now by any means .
yeah .
you know .
how , how about you ?
yes .
a lot of them .
uh , i guess in washington , d c you guys have several papers that are pretty pretty effective don 't you ?
i , i rather like the washington post .
yeah .
but , i also get the new york times and the wall street journal .
uh -huh .
right .
uh , and , uh , each of them covers different things in , in dif -, dif -, in different ways
and so it 's , you know , if i only looked at one of them i would have a different perspect -, clearly would have a different perspective on the world .
right ,
yeah .
uh , i , i have a question .
uh , does , does the wall street journal , uh ,
i , i 've kind of gathered lately that , uh , maybe their information is not just only related to business .
is that , is that a correct assumption ?
that , that is certainly true .
uh -huh .
uh , they will , they will have articles ,
oh .
like a few days ago they had a , a nice article on einstein , you know theory of relativity .
oh .
you know , that started on the front page ran in , into the full , almost full page inside .
uh -huh .
now , these are feature kind of articles .
wow .
all the , all the , uh , you know , the bulk of the paper certainly is about business kinds of activities .
right .
uh -huh .
but , but there is some very good other articles uh , you 'll find in the , in the journal .
uh -huh .
do you find that you 're , uh , uh , disappointed or pleased with , uh , uh , the performance of like network coverage of news ?
uh , i wish it were in more depth .
uh -huh .
uh , that doesn 't mean to say longer ,
just more facts would be nice .
uh -huh .
uh , c n n has , has , you know , was , was pretty good during the war .
oh , yeah ,
definitely .
uh , and they were , you know , sort of had a unique vantage point for , for doing that reporting .
uh -huh .
so , but , you know , it 's not , it 's never quite ,
all right .
uh , exercise huh
yeah .
uh , as a matter fact , i work out in the mornings .
i belong to presidents .
uh -huh .
and , uh , i have got a routine for every morning of the week
uh -huh .
and i don 't work out on saturday or sunday but , uh , i do , i do a combination of , uh , uh , running and weight training
they set that up for you .
no ,
i , uh , actually i just , uh , joined on my own
uh -huh .
and i have been thinking about getting with a , uh , one of their counselors just so see what , uh , they might have to offer as far as , uh , alternatives .
but , i pretty much , uh , worked on my own routine .
and , uh , what kind of running do you do ?
they have got the track on the inside .
uh -huh .
and , uh , i run one mile on monday , wednesdays and fridays
and then on tuesdays and thursdays , i run two miles .
uh -huh .
and then after that , i work out with weights .
is is just aerobics
or ,
uh , i work out with free weights .
no ,
uh , i mean the running .
oh , uh , yeah .
it is really the , uh , aerobic work out part .
you do it , you do a mile in about eight minutes or less ?
uh , about seven minutes .
uh -huh .
yeah .
then you wouldn 't , then you don 't get , uh , out of breath .
uh , no
i do
oh .
yeah ,
that is , that is a pretty good clip
and i am pretty winded by the time i get done .
oh .
so ,
but , i mean it 's not pushing it real hard , like , you know , if you tried to make six or something like that .
oh , yeah .
i , i , uh , could probably go faster ,
but then i would wear myself out
right .
and i wouldn 't be able to work out anything else .
uh -huh .
yeah .
how about you ?
yeah ,
i , i don 't run much any more .
i did when i was in school .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
right now i just lift , uh , weights and do push ups and sit ups and , and i , uh , jump rope a little bit and that is about it
yeah .
and i don 't , i don 't lift any heavy weight , uh ,
they are about a third of my body weight .
oh , i see .
so this , uh ,
do you just try and keep them , i guess , uh , firm and , uh ,
yeah
and uh , uh , i play the trumpet
and the , uh , the more upper body strength , the easier it is to play .
yeah ,
uh ,  that is true . 
 you have  to do a whole lot of sit ups
and , uh , and then , uh , i hurt my neck , uh , about three years ago .
yeah .
so , you really have to build up around your neck and your shoulders to keep from , uh , hurting yourself when you play high .
oh , i see .
you have to , you have to do it correctly , you know ,
it is like an exercise in itself ,
but a lot of people , uh , strain themselves doing it .
oh , i see .
uh , so you are in , uh , in part of a band ?
uh , i play at church .
oh , i see ,
i see
i use to play an instrument when i was in high school ,
but it wasn 't the trumpet
yeah .
so , i was just wandering if that was what it was or something .
i think ,
uh -huh
so do you have any plans of maybe running more when the weather gets nicer ?
well , yeah ,
yeah .
uh , well the weather is nice except for when it rains , you know i mean in dallas .
yeah .
yeah .
i keep thinking about it ,
but that doesn 't mean it gets done .
i , i mostly jump rope more .
uh -huh .
you know .
yeah ,
i use to do a little bit of jumping rope , uh , when i was , uh ,
uh -huh .
well a while back i was more into basketball and , uh , i could do a lot of jump rope and other jumping exercises to try to build my calves .
uh -huh .
and , uh , but , it has been a while since i have done that .
yeah .
right .
i do a toe lift and squats for that .
but you know it , it doesn 't , uh , doesn 't , uh , accustom your legs to the kind of strength that you have like when you are running for a long time .
right .
uh -huh .
they tend to tighten up whenever , whenever you have to do something at , uh , uh , great length of time .
yeah ,
i , i , uh , that is true .
i have noticed that , uh ,
and it also builds too much mass if you just , you know .
uh -huh .
so , it is like , i , i lift weights with about the same curl weight as i do the squats with .
uh -huh .
and , uh , then it doesn 't bother me very much .
yeah .
yeah .
huh . that is interesting though .
uh , i have been thinking of changing , uh ,
i have done the same routine for almost two years now
and i am thinking of , uh , changing it up .
uh -huh .
uh , that is why , well , you know , i was thinking to talking to one of their counselors and seeing what different exercises they could get me on to , uh , get out of the routine .
right .
because i have heard that , you know , you get locked into a routine then you are going to get to a point where you just stop developing .
uh -huh .
so , i am looking at changing things a little bit .
yeah ,
that is , uh , i have started doing more push ups
and , and it has helped a lot
uh -huh .
and then i add sets to it so that i don 't like you said , wear it out .
yeah .
i don 't try to push it so the end in one set .
okay ,
uh , clothing at work .
um , i work as a news reporter ,
 oh . 
 and  a lot of ,
i work in a , since i work in a small station ,
uh -huh .
this is my first job and so , i dress very variedly if that 's a word .
um , sometimes i 'm shooting and doing photography ,
and so i 'll be in jeans one day ,
uh -huh .
and another day i 'll be on camera ,
and so i 'll be in a suit
and another day i 'll come in
and i won 't know what i 'm doing ,
yeah ,
uh .
so i 'll wear a pant suit in case i have to shoot .
oh .
so , it really varies .
i try to dress very comfortably .
i don 't really like dressing up at all .
oh , me neither
i don 't , i don 't wear a lot of makeup or anything like that .
yeah .
i just ,
i don 't know ,
it just , it takes too much time out of my day ,
and i don 't , i don 't know
yeah ,
same here .
i don 't mind not wearing any makeup
yeah ,
i don 't mind it at all . um .
uh -huh .
um , i work at a bakery because i 'm a , still a , a college student . um .
okay .
but , we , we have to wear white pants and , um , any color t shirt , as long as it 's not like a bright color , like a pastel .
white pants in a bakery .
yeah .
wow .
yeah ,
the bakers wear all white
okay .
and we wear aprons and have to pull our hair back
and so .
what 's the name of the bakery ?
oh , italian i guess .
yeah
it 's italian bakery .
new clothes and stuff .
and , uh , so , i don 't mind having , having to wear a uniform , because i don 't have to buy , you know right , as mu -, you know , many clothes .
yeah ,
oh , yeah .
that 's one thing i would like , is just to sort of have , i really don 't like uniforms but , just to have something i don 't have to get up and decide what to wear .
yeah .
that just bugs me to death .
i know
i do that every day for school
oh , yeah .
yeah ,
but i , i like to wear comfortable things like cotton and baggy things and .
sweats and .
yeah .
yeah ,
when i was in school , i was a sweat monster .
yeah
all i had was sweats ,
and when it was time to go out , i didn 't have anything to wear .
yeah ,
i know ,
i don 't have very many dress clothes
yeah .
but i don 't mind ,
i don 't need them yet
yeah .
um .
um , let me see .
i hate shoes .
if i didn 't have to have shoes , i wouldn 't have them .
oh , really .
i just , oh , my feet bother me ,
oh .
and they 're just tedious to go find shoes for me , it 's just ,
i don 't know .
oh .
i wear size nine and it , i don 't know if just the shoes i get , i either don 't like them or they don 't fit right ,
um .
and i just wish that i could just go without them .
oh , wow , i love shoes .
 oh , really . 
 i always  buy shoes
oh .
yeah .
just the opposite .
but , um , let 's see ,
what else do i wear ?
um , if i were in a bigger market , when i do get into a bigger market , i 'll probably go out and buy a bunch of suits and things , and , uh , where i wouldn 't have to shoot and do a lot of other things 
 uh -huh . 
and i could  then i would be able to dress more business -like and things like that ,
yeah .
but we 're all kind of just out of school at this station ,
and so we 're all , you know , still in sweats , really .
oh .
so , it 's pretty fun though .
i like the look , the , the like suit look , professional like , you know , look ,
but i , i really don 't have much of an opportunity to wear it
yeah .
 i . 
um  i 'm  going to be a teacher ,
oh .
yeah .
so i 'll probably just wear casual clothes , maybe skirts and some .
i like this , the , uh , suits with the ,
oh , yeah .
they come like with a mini type skirt you know , and the jacket .
i like that ,
yeah ,
that is cute .
but but i 'm pretty short ,
i 'm five four ,
and so that really doesn 't flatter me ,
but i think it looks good on taller people .
yeah .
i 'm five three
and
are you ?
yeah .
yeah ,
any time i go to the store ,
oh , really ?
i mean , i , i have like two pairs of pants , because i can never find any that are short enough for me and it 's just , oh , ridiculous .
pants , too , i could do without those .
 oh . 
 pants , shoes .
i like the like stretch pants , the cotton ones .
yeah ,
 those are nice . 
 they 're really comfortable . 
those are nice .
with a baggy sweatshirt .
yeah ,
those are nice .
and , tennis shoes .
my boyfriend 's got me these l a gear .
they 're kind of big and hefty tennis shoes .
oh , yeah .
and it , it 's just like a chore to pick up my feet .
oh
because i 'm used to wearing the little whi -, white girl tennis shoes .
the little ones .
oh , yeah i have a pair of those .
yeah .
yeah .
and i 'm used to those .
they 're just sort of , you know ,
yeah .
like your feet i mean , you don 't feel them .
you put these things on ,
it 's , it 's , you know , like exercise or something for your feet .
and i have to wear them because he gets upset if i don 't .
oh , yeah
so so , so how do people in wisconsin dress ?
 warm . 
warm  this time  this time , of the year pretty warm .
sweaters and .
i grew up in new york ,
and so i know what warm is .
like five pairs of socks and ,
yeah .
yeah .
yeah ,
sleeping in sweats or long underwear .
my parents keep the house cold
hello .
hi .
okay ,
i pressed one
so i guess we 're recording now .
okay .
okay ,  um . 
 um ,  as far as spare time , they talked about ,
i don 't , i think ,
who has any spare time
i 've got a , a six year old and a , um ,
well , my baby 's one today .
um .
today 's his birthday .
um .
and i 'm also , i 'm expecting ,
and , so , i , i don 't know ,
i haven 't had much spare time lately
but ,
okay ,
well , i 've , i have had some because i was working for p i e ,
and they went bankrupt
oh , uh -huh .
so i 've got quite a bit of spare time right now .
and i 've been making dolls , cloth dolls .
oh , have you ?
uh -huh .
oh .
and , uh ,
you sew the bodies and everything ?
yeah ,
it 's a , they 're all cloth .
it 's not , uh , any porcelain at all .
so , so you just sew everything up , huh ?
oh .
yeah and i make the clothes for them .
uh -huh .
and .
what kind do they have yarn hair
or ,
um , no ,
oh , uh -huh .
you can get the little curly hair at the craft shop .
oh .
i made some of them with that hair
and then , uh , don 't ask me what the other hair i made ,
it looked like , um , it looked ,
well , i made some of them with regular wigs .
oh , did you ?
i went to the flea markets and bought , you know , like the wigs for a dollar .
oh , uh -huh .
oh , my goodness .
then i cut a v shape out of the back of them and then sewed them on .
it sounds like you 're creative .
they looked really cute
uh , do you sell them ?
i have sold five of them , so far .
oh , have you ?
uh -huh .
i just have to get a place where , you know , i can sell them actually .
yeah ,
i bet .
how long does it take you to make one ?
uh , if i would just work all day long , making the clothes and everything , probably about two and a half days .
oh , really ?
uh -huh .
oh .
so .
do you enjoy it ?
yeah .
yes i really do .
uh -huh .
and , then i also crochet
and ,
i , i , i can crochet and knit .
um , actually , i started an afghan ,
yeah .
but it 's been a whole long time ago probably over a year ago
and it 's   sitting in my closet half done right now ,
but , it 's a knitting one .
and ,
yeah .
i tried knitting first ,
but , i don 't know ,
i , i didn 't like it .
oh , didn 't you .
so then i went to crocheting ,
but now i want to learn how to knit again .
oh .
i en -,
you know .
yeah ,
i enjoy knitting .
i , i kind of like that ,
but i just , like i say , haven 't done it for a while .
uh -huh .
and i do like sewing sometimes .
uh -huh .
i , i 've made a few of the , you know , just the little valence curtains in my house , and things like that .
yeah ,
yeah .
but , it , it 's just finding the time for these things that you you enjoy .
but ,
yeah ,
i , in fact , i just bought a serger in december .
oh , i would love one of these .
yeah .
oh , that 's neat .
i haven 't done everything on it yet , you know ,
but just what little bit i have used it for , i really like it .
oh , those are wonderful aren 't they .
you know , especially making the seams and things like that you know , it 's , it 's got such a professional finish on them .
oh , yeah ,
that , and that 's what i hate doing is the finishing stuff .
yeah .
it 'd be nice to have that .
so i like that .
oh , that 's neat .
and .
well , do you have , um , uh ,
i guess you 're kind of young ,
i was going to say , do you have grand kids or anything to make dolls for .
well , fifty -seven 's not young ,
but no ,
my son 's , has been married for almost ten years ,
but they don 't have any children .
oh , uh -huh .
so , i just make clothes for my dolls .
 oh , well . 
well , how did you get involved in that ?
just , you know , just like sewing and stuff and decided to buy a pattern and try to make a doll .
so you did buy a pattern , and then  started from there . 
 and they , they turned  out really cute .
yeah ,
uh -huh .
you got to have a pattern for the body you know .
uh -huh .
and , uh ,
yes .
ha -, have you ever seen those bunnies that they dress ?
yes .
yeah ,
aren 't they cute ?
i , i did make some clothes for one of those dress one of those .
yeah ,
i have quite a few of them actually in my house ,
i , and most of them i have bought , um , already clothed ,
 uh -huh . 
but  i did  i did make the dress on one ,
and i kind of made the pattern up .
it 's not , it 's probably not the best
but
no ,
i , i bought a bunny pattern one time ,
but when i sewed it up , the face of it looked like a mouse .
oh , it did ?
uh -huh .
oh .
see , it was too pointed .
oh .
so i tore it back apart again ,
and i haven 't tried another one .
you haven 't sewn it back up , huh ?
no ,
but i bought a little lamb pattern and the material and everything to make it out of ,
but i haven 't made it  yet . 
 uh -huh .
 uh , do you do any kind of painting or anything ?
no ,
uh -huh .
i don 't paint , except i stenciled my wall .
oh , uh -huh .
i tri -, i tried that ,
i did , i , i ended up just stenciling a , um , a blind , like a , just a roller shade .
uh -huh .
but , i , i can , i had a hard time stenciling .
for some reason i just couldn 't do it .
oh , really ?
and people have told me it 's very easy .
oh , yeah ,
i , my neighbor did it first
and i seen her house
and i saw how beautiful it looked ,
so then i decided well , i was going to do it ,
 well . 
 and  uh , it turned out really , really good .
what design did you use ?
oh , uh -huh .
uh , mostly flowers you know .
and , what room ?
i 've done it in the all , uh , all my rooms .
have you ?
i put it in the bedrooms and the bathroom ,
where are you , bob ?
i am in plano .
where are you ?
oh , okay .
i am in waco .
is that right ?
yeah .
oh , okay .
right down the street .
oh , credit cards .
my favorite subject
you mean you use credit cards ?
oh , do i .
i bet you used them all up over christmas .
yeah ,
mostly over christmas .
and then your are in  debt . 
uh , i get in a rut with credit cards cause they get me kind of in a vicious cycle . where you use them a lot one month and then you have to use whatever money you have to pay those off  and so  then you have no money ,
so you use a credit card .
i understand that .
yeah .
uh , i probably have one of every credit card there is .
do you use them a lot ?
well , uh , it kind of comes and goes , uh ,
uh -huh .
i use uh , citibank , the , uh , advantage one pretty much cause you get vantage points for every dollar you spend .
once a year , i get a free airplane ride that way .
oh .
so , as long as you pay it off every month , it doesn 't cost you anything .
yeah .
yeah .
well , that is a good idea .
 that is what i , 
 is that  that through a visa ?
yeah .
uh -huh .
yeah .
huh .
but , uh , i got all sorts of credit cards for my business that i use
but , uh ,
uh -huh .
if i can get away with paying them off every month , it is alright .
if i don 't then it gets expensive
yeah .
that is my problem .
i don 't try and pay them off .
i pay , like the minimum .
well you shouldn 't do that .
i know
 so i have got myself , 
 you never , you never  get out of the hole that way .
exactly .
i have got , that is why i have got myself with all this trouble now .
but , i pay most of them on time and everything .
it is just the ,
i always have them .
so , it is kind of strange .
kind of like the federal government right ?
oh , yeah .
exactly like the government
 in , 
 can 't  never get out of debt .
in debt .
and every time you try to get out of debt , the economy goes to pot because people are spending money , right .
yeah .
have they put the cap on the interest rates ?
no .
i didn 't know if they actually did that or not .
i know they were considering it .
just the people who don 't need credit get the four and a half percent .
the rest of the , uh , and me , we have got to pay fourteen and eighteen percent .
uh -huh .
yeah .
funny how that works , isn 't it
the , thou who doesn 't need credit , gets cheap credit .
i would be interested to find out how many people , or how much , uh , people use credit this year . say in nineteen ninety -two as opposed to nineteen ninety -one , even nineteen ninety .
i think , i think it would be amazing how much , how many more people use it .
well , i think so
because the ,
because of the economy .
that 's right .
yeah .
you have got to use everything you have got just to stay where you are at .
exactly .
i would be very , i would like to see some numbers on that .
i think that would be interesting .
do you , do you have any , uh , credit union where you work or anything like that ?
yeah ,
i have a credit union .
do they have a mastercard or visa card ?
yeah ,
they do .
uh -huh .
you have got that one .
yes ,
i do
yes ,
i do a matter of fact .
who , who do you work for ?
uh , i work for channel six .
 oh . 
 it 's  it 's an n b c affiliate down here .
i do a lot of work down in waco ,
oh really .
a lot of , i call on a lot of my business is down there .
oh , okay .
where do you work ?
what is your ,
i sell metal fabricating equipment and tooling .
oh , okay .
oh , okay
tyme and mercury and tempco and all those people down there .
uh gene he -,
so you probably work with , uh , uh ,
what is the boy from here ? faint >>.
you ever work with davis ?
davis iron ?
 davis iron work ,
yeah . 
 yeah ,
matter of fact  i just saw them last week .
oh , okay .
and , uh , what else .
are you in that part , are you in the south part of town now ?
well , i live actually in hewett .
oh , yeah .
 okay . 
 yeah ,
 right outside .
so , that is where davis iron works is .
you know do you know parker machine tool down there .
uh .
bobby parker and , uh ,
i don 't think i have seen that one .
i am sure i pass by it or something ,
but i am not sure .
there is a place in hewett , called ,
it is a new company called prime air .
that is in hewett . just around the corner from davis iron works .
huh . prime air .
oh , okay .
okay .
they make , uh , humidifiers and uh , filters for air filtration stuff for hospitals , homes , something like that .
have you ever been to marlin ?
uh , yeah .
i think it is marlin or mart .
they have , uh , uh , a place , i guess that would be similar to prime air .
oh , really .
it is called h g h or something like k g h or ,
huh .
i can 't think of it .
i can 't think of the name .
huh .
but ,
i will have to stop in there .
i went , i have gone through there , uh ,
my oldest son goes to a and m .
oh yeah .
he is working on his master 's .
the navy sent him there for his master 's . mostly in engineering .
so , once and a while we go up six there rather than take forty -five .
yeah .
that is about the last time i have been through marlin and mart
uh -huh .
oh , i don 't like that drive .
i make that drive sometimes
we have stories out there
but , uh ,
there is always a state trooper down there .
huh .
you have got to drive careful .
oh , really
i know .
between mart and marlin , they will nail you if you go over  sixty miles an hour . 
 oh , goodness .
 they , they are bad at hewett too . on eighty -four .
uh -huh .
they are real bad .
that is where i got my last ticket .
so , of course , i couldn 't pay that on a credit card .
well , i was just wondering if you had had any experience with , um , the care of the elderly .
yes ,
i have .
in fact , uh , just a little over , just a little less than a year ago , uh , my mother went to be with the lord ,
and we cared for her the last , oh , seventeen months of her life here in the , at home .
uh -huh .
aside from , uh , having to , uh , take her to the hospital
and , uh , you know , those times , well , she was there in the , the regular hospital .
right .
and then she was diagnosed having inoperable type of cancer ,
and so the doctor elected to have her , uh , finish out , uh , in the hospice program .
uh -huh .
and , uh , i , as far as i 'm concerned , that is far and above any nursing home , because , uh , she 's around her own fa -, you know , the , the elderly parent in question is around their own family .
the , uh , hospice program provides a hospital type bed . well , it is a hospital bed , and all the oxygen ,
stuff and a , uh , and a visiting nurse at least every other day , et cetera , et cetera , et cetera .
well , that 's  nice . 
 and  it 's all taken care of by , by , uh , medicare , uh ,
and , uh , it , it 's , it 's really neat , uh .
and i , you know , i wouldn 't , i wouldn 't banish , uh , my old loved one to a , to a warehouse .
no .
and that 's , that 's what i basically , uh , view a nursing home as , a warehouse ,
so  that 's , 
 it 's  really sad
pardon me ?
it 's really a sad situation .
uh -huh .
 and ,  uh , i think a lot of people struggle with .
 i , 
  oh  
i guess the problem is that the spouse of whoever , you know , the parent  is , 
 uh -huh . 
doesn 't always want the in -law living in the house .
is that right ?
right .
well , that 's really sad .
yeah ,
i know .
but , uh , in this case , uh , spouse and i , uh , are , uh , we 're , are , are , uh , united in this area  because , 
 uh -huh .
i guess her father , her grandfather and grandmother both lived with , uh , her parents , uh , th -, th -, their golden years too ,
uh -huh .
so this isn 't like , uh , uh , just one , one , uh , instance .
uh -huh .
in fact , uh , her , uh , uh , experiences were , were invaluable to me .
uh , in fact , i don 't know if i could have , uh , held up , uh , you know , without my wife , uh , helping in  this , 
 right . 
this , in this case .
yes .
well , i know when the , i remember being a child
and my grandmother had had se -, several strokes and things , and that we had , my parents tried to keep her in the house ,
and they did for a long time . i  couldn 't , 
 uh -huh . 
tell you how long , until she got , uh , where she had to have complete care ,
  and so   , 
 uh -huh . 
they couldn 't , you know , keep her in the house anymore ,
and it was really hard on everyone .
she had to have , you know , twenty -four hour a day care .
uh -huh .
and i don 't remember much about it except that there was a nursing home at that time just a block or two from our house .
uh -huh .
and that , um , they put her there ,
and we all went just constantly until she died .
oh , okay .
but it was very hard on everyone to see , you know , grandmother be like that ,
uh -huh .
and i don 't know that , you know , i don 't , being so young , i don 't remember why . you know , what was , why she had to go there .
well , maybe , well , as , as you say , the care of , of grandmother or was , was just such that such mom and dad couldn 't handle it .
uh -huh .
well , i do remember that she was , you know , totally incapable of taking care of herself in any way .
oh , boy ,
 yeah . 
uh -huh .
 and that  that , they couldn 't , they found that they could not you know , give her the hygienic care and everything that she needed .
uh -huh .
well , then , then there 's almost , then there 's almost no , no , uh , uh , choice left to her then
no ,
but like you say , there is a tendency for people to be abandoned , though ,  you know , 
 uh -huh . 
in the nursing home .
i do remember the other patients there , uh , being real excited when we came to see our own grandmother , because they got some interaction with someone .
right .
uh -huh .
in fact , just , uh , just , uh , sit and chat with them for five minutes and , and be interested in what they have to say regardless of what it is .
right ,
right .
and i guess that 's hard on people to give , give up their lives .
if they 're busy they don 't you know .
uh -huh
it 's easy to abandon people , because we do have the nursing homes ,  i guess . 
 right . 
if you can afford them .
but , anyway .  well , i 'm , 
 and then , then , 
glad it worked out good for your family .
oh , yeah ,
it did ,
and i was just pr -, i just praised the lord that , that we were able to , uh , have , uh , uh ,
i pushed it .
okay .
so what do you you in your lawn ?
do you do it yourself
or do you hire someone to do it ?
uh , no
we 've been doing it ourselves for most of the time , uh , find that it 's really a little more economical ,
and we have , oh , i find that i have the time ,
and i kind of enjoyed it over here in texas .
i used to live in arizona ,
and it was very con -, very frustrating , because i didn 't have the watering system
uh -huh .
and it was , it was just too much work and not enough enjoyment .
uh -huh .
but over here we get enough water automa -, you know , naturally as well have the automatic sprinklers ,
yeah ,
right .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
and so it 's a lot more rewarding so .
well , we do our own out here , uh , you know , mow it ourselves and everything ,
but , uh , our water supply right now is bad .
we need rain badly
oh , that 's right .
uh , we can water , here in patterson , i can water on tuesdays , thursdays , saturday and sunday , four days a week .
uh -huh .
so .
is that enough during the hotter times of the year ?
it was this last summer ,
yeah .
uh -huh .
yeah ,
yeah .
uh , now if it , we don 't get some rain , they might limit it to not even four times , you know but , uh , yeah ,
we do our law -, our , you know , mowing ourselves and everything ,
uh -huh .
and i do our planting of bulbs and things where i can have some spring flowers and , uh ,
yeah ,
uh -huh .
 uh -huh . 
i find that i 've been doing a lot of perennial planting , which i never did before and it 's been real enjoyable , although i didn 't do any this last fall , because our past winters have been so cold ,  um  they 'd freeze down ,
and by the time they , the flowers would come back to life it was supposedly the time to pull things out for the spring and summer planting
oh .
so i was getting kind of disillusioned and tired and , and spending too much money on something that was kind of more of a problem than it was rewarding ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
yeah .
so um , i 'm going to try to wait now and just do the spring and summer type plantings and see how that , you know ,  feels . 
 yeah .
 we have quite a few roses .
i just , uh , we , in fact we just pruned them way down ,
and i just had to replace one of them ,
so i just bought that yesterday ,
and i 'll probably go outside today and plant that .
uh -huh .
but , um , i like to have the roses where i can have cut flowers all year long .
yeah ,
those are enjoyable .
oh , did you ?
i even had , uh , roses on my table for christmas dinner which was really pretty , you know
uh -huh
but , um , other than the roses i don 't have too many flowers .
um , those are nice .
i plant gladiolas and those are always pretty ,
but they get so tall ,
uh -huh .
and they , they bend over so fast you know .
yeah ,
yeah .
i haven 't done much in , in bulbs .
in fact i received as a christmas present a , a planter that had bulbs in it , that we were supposed to go ahead and water it any time and after it started to sprout put in a sunny window ,
uh -huh .
and it it just grew like crazy ,
but i don 't have any flowers on it .
um .
i don 't know how long that takes , or if there 's anything i need to do differently .
it 's just nice and green right now
uh -huh ,
well , is it that , one of those amaryllis ?
no ,
huh .
oh , okay .
uh , no i 'm thinking white narcissus or something like a pa -, like a white paper flower or so .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
and , uh .
do you have a big yard ?
no ,
not really ,
and in plano and most of the newer areas of texas , uh , they have just the , the minimum square footage for lots , to where you get a little bit of a backyard ,
we have a pool in our backyard ,
uh -huh .
and we did plan it to where we have some , some play yard left over ,
but it 's , it 's , um , you know , very small .
uh -huh .
yeah ,
 right ,
right . 
but most of the houses here , if you have a pool , you don 't have anything else in the backyard  that 's about the size  of most of them .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
um .
so , uh i guess we 're kind of fortunate .
everyone looks at that , with our yar -, at our yard with kind of sense of awe , like wow , you really got , you know , some grass back there .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
well .
well , that makes it nice .
yeah .
well , it 's hot enough here in the summer time that we could have a pool ,
uh -huh .
but we don 't have one you know ,
yeah .
yeah .
uh -huh .
uh , yeah .
yeah .
but they are a lot of people that do have pools around here you know but we just , we just have dogs and , um , and grass you know , the cement work and a little play set we made for a garden .
so we do have a garden , you know .
it 's just a small one , you know ,
oh .
uh -huh .
but we , had lots of tomatoes , and , uh , zucchini it 's amazing what you can get out of a little you know , it 's probably about twenty by , i don 't know , twenty by six , something like that ,
yeah ,
yeah .
and it 's amazing what you can , you know , how many plants you can plant in there but it was nice .
few cucumbers .
that 's one part of gardening i haven 't tried yet ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
and i don 't think this yard is a very ,
okay .
um , i guess if i had to rate it from one to ten , i guess ,
i would rate it a five in the aspect that i wouldn 't want everybody to have guns
and i think there should be limitations of , like semiautomatics .
uh , things like that should not be just given out to anybody .
in fact , you know , i can 't imagine anybody having a semiautomatic for what purpose .
uh ,
uh -huh .
so i guess , you know , being that i come from a hunting family i 'd rather have some restrictions put on weapons but yet allow hunting rifles , uh , things that people would use for sporting type of , uh , a , activity .
those would be fine
but when you get into a , a lot of the more complex weapons , i would say yes
we need to put restrictions on them
uh , that 's pro -, i probably would have to agree with you pretty much all the way i think .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh , i definitely think that there , some things shouldn 't be limited like , like you said , rifles and uh , hunting rifles and possible handguns for people who use them  to , 
 exactly ,
 for self -protection ,
sure .
right .
and , but i think the , i think semiautomatic weapons , people say they use them because it , for sport .
 i can 't imagine that .
yeah . 
uh -huh .
but i , i personally cannot  see any use for them  other than , uh , for , for , like people who dislike   have some sort of crazed you know , ambition to use , have high powered weapons or something .
to do massive amounts of killing , uh ,
right .
 yeah . 
 and  i mean , you can only , how much  do you wa -, 
uh -huh .
 the only  thing that i can see is the police having it in a case where somebody is , uh , uh , you know , going to kill a massive amount of people or , uh , somebody that 's escaping , that 's , uh , very dangerous semiautomatic would allow more rounds to be put out to hopefully catch the person and , and , uh , get him down .
right .
but , uh , you know , i , i think of my family .
right .
uh , they 're very much into sporting and , uh , you know , as far as hunting and also like , uh , clay pigeons things like that .
uh -huh .
so they have may have some shotguns .
they may have other type of , uh , hunting type things ,
 right ,
yeah . 
 yeah ,
that 's  true .
but i figured if the , if the criminals had to take a hunting gun out to kill somebody , more than likely , somebody would see it , you know  what i 'm saying  versus a , you know , a small handgun ,  uh ,  that can be , you know , put right in your coat pocket
and nobody would see it ,
but yet , you can 't stop people from having , you know , a handgun in their home .
right .
even if there are small children around , there 's , you know ,
uh -huh .
 yeah . 
you can 't say people with small children can 't have guns and people without small children that may have grandchildren ,  you know  still have these guns
right .
but uh , i guess i , i was always taught ,
number one , a gun isn 't a toy .
right .
 uh -huh . 
uh , you know , and i don 't know if that makes a difference if the parent sets down to them and say this gun can kill you ,  you know  and don 't ever play with it .
right .
uh , so i don 't know if that makes a difference or what
but ,
well , i think par -, uh , in that ca -, i think that cases like that it 's definitely , um , i think if you 're to say okay ,
uh -huh .
we have to get rid of them all because you know , they can only , they only seem to do bad , it , it 's , uh ,  it 's saying we 're t -, 
 the criminals  would get them . i mean even if they had to go across  border to get them . 
 right ,
right .
 and people who , people who have them and are responsible with them are , are , are being punished
uh -huh .
and people who and they 're saying that people you cannot take care of things yourself or like that you 're not smart enough to teach your kids how to , how to , uh ,    
 right . 
 how to use ,  you know , to make sure the guns are put up as something  as  uh , not a toy .
right
yeah .
uh -huh .
right .
because we had guns all over our house when we were kids and not that they were laying on the , uh , couch or anything like that but , uh , i never had an interest in them ,
uh -huh .
right .
right .
being in the fact that i knew that guns could kill and i had four brothers and never messed with any type of guns and so it was kind of the idea that we knew that a gun could kill and that a gun wasn 't a toy and , of course we were quite young
and we went through ,
uh -huh .
uh , the national rifle , uh , club and so we were taught , you know , kind of at a , a good age , ten and eleven and twelve , to sit down with a kid and say okay ,
if you 're going to learn how to shoot a gun , you 're going to learn how to do it correctly
uh -huh .
and you 're going to learn how to have safeguards and and know how to protect yourself
but yet have this ,
training so that kids aren 't you know ,
they have to have a certain respect for it .
right .
well i think , i mean we , i grew up in a family
uh -huh .
and , and my father had two guns because he used to hunt years ago
sure .
but he stopped before , really before i was old enough to remember .
uh -huh .
but , and i knew we had the guns in the house
sure ,
yeah .
and , th -, the time my father was keeping them just for protection at the time but we , it was never , my brothers , sisters nor i never , i mean none of us ever thought well let 's go look at the gun
or let 's go get the gun
yes .
  it was just something you knew was there and th -, it was your father 's
yeah .
and y -, you , that was not something you 'd go and play , played with at all and i think maybe , uh , and that 's the type of , the thing that should be ,  you know , stressed . 
 yeah ,
i think so
an -, and i  don 't know if the kids nowadays are different than what
okay
so , do you have , do you have the long ,
i guess not , not if there 's ,
see i was raised in new york ,
but i guess up there you all don 't have too long of a growing season , do you ?
uh , well , we probably have about three months ,
approximately .
do do you do your own gardening ?
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
do you .
we live on a ,
used to be a farm ,
but we don 't farm much ,
we , uh , but we do have a garden .
huh . see i got mine in ,
well , let 's see ,
i put in pepper plants this weekend .
oh .
i wish i could be doing that
yeah .
i got all my little seedlings coming up in the kitchen
and , i enjoy tinkering with it ,
uh -huh .
you know ,
it 's pretty hot down here during the summer ,
we hit , you know , a hundred , hundred and two sometimes ,
right .
but , you know , we don 't do too much during the summer , as far as tomatoes and stuff ,
you almost have ,
like that .
to get started pretty early probably . i guess ,
yeah .
i can , usually i can put in , oh probably mid -march , i can put anything in the ground ,
uh -huh .
you know , beets , and onions ,
uh -huh .
and stuff like that .
uh -huh .
but then i have to wait for my ,
uh -huh .
tomatoes have to go in here in the next couple of weeks as soon as we 're , sure we 're not going to have another freeze ,
yeah .
go ahead finish it .
you 've had more freezing this winter , or this , yeah , winter , i think .
yeah .
we 've ,
more bad weather .
had just a few , you know , that freezes a little here and there ,
uh -huh .
but every once in a while , we get a freeze around the middle of april ,
uh -huh .
and it 's pretty tough .
uh -huh .
are you , do you work ,
or are you retired
or you ,
no .
uh -huh .
i work , uh i 'm only forty years old .
i have to work ,
uh -huh
uh , my husbands retired .
but he 's not a gardener .
he , he , he 's been helping me more ,
but he really isn 't , uh , real crazy about gardening .
uh , i , i really enjoy it ,
it gives me time outdoors ,
uh .
and , you know , i 'm a golfer ,
but , it gives me time outdoors , and time around my house ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
oh .
uh -huh .
and i , burned my grass off here in the last couple of days getting ready to start to the spring season , and see if i can grow me another nice lawn ,
i usually have a pretty nice lawn ,
oh yeah .
it 's a lot of work you know ,
but it 's ,
but it 's a pleasure to , like you said , it 's good to get outside ,
yeah ,
it is .
and and i like , i like my garden too
we didn 't have to , we have just a small garden ,
uh -huh .
but we planted corn last year too , which takes quite a bit of space we , we didn 't have too good luck with it ,
because the , uh , we had a couple of good , real good wind storms ,
oh yeah .
and it really damaged the corn so we didn 't get too much corn ,
we 're going through that ,
last year .
we going through the dust storms down here now ,
uh , uh -huh .
so , but i , uh , what i did with my garden , is i have a , a two by six frame that 's five by ten .
uh -huh .
i have two of them sitting side by side and then i put , uh , like , a black plastic ,
it 's really not a black plastic .
oh .
uh -huh .
they call it  wedet  and i put that down ,
huh .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
and then i put up a couple of inches of pine moss on top of that and i use a , one of those black poker hoses that actually oozes water every where so i waste it up and down there a couple of times ,
oh that 's great .
and i only have to water about two hours a week and it 's pretty nice .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
especially during the summer , it keeps everything wet ,
yeah .
instead of wilting .
we don 't , we don 't usually cover ours .
we did a few different times
  sometimes we 've covered with the plastic ,
oh .
and other years we 've tried newspapers and , uh , but we generally don 't , we do our watering from our spring .
oh you have a spring ,
yeah .
how nice .
we have an old fashioned pipe sitting , that , you know , water runs into
and ,
uh -huh .
my husband set up a pump that runs ,
it runs first down
and then it stops ,
and when the water comes up , it comes on again ,
and we use that to water our garden
oh that 's , that 's pretty nice .
with
so ,
but you actually enjoy it , huh ?
oh i do .
i do .
do you ?
i love it ,
get out there on your hands and knees ,
and crawl around .
i 'd rather be doing that , than housework
i , i can imagine .
you all have much trouble up there , with insects
or ,
uh , not a who -, well , not a whole lot .
i think our cabbages , and broccolis and that in we have more trouble with , that type of thing , with the , the ,
with the worms ?
yeah .
yeah .
i have quite a bit of problem down here with the squash bugs ,
uh .
and haven 't figured out how to get rid of those yet .
uh -huh .
do you go more for natural , keeping them off naturally ,
or do you ,
yeah ,
i try to ,
use insecticides ?
no
i , uh , uh , try not to use any insecticides at all .
i try not to even use insecticides on my lawn ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
but ,
uh -huh .
i , sometimes i can 't manage .
yeah .
well , our lawn , is , is a big lawn because , because we live out in the country ,
and so we were not , our lawn is not perfect , you know ,
yeah .
it 's just the it 's just a lawn
well , mine 's full of dandelions ,
uh -huh .
now ,
so ,
do you eat any of them ?
no ,
i never have .
i don 't know how to prepare them .
oh , did , well , did , does your wife ever make , uh , bake in a hot bacon dressing , like for ,
no .
salad ?
huh -uh .
oh it 's delicious
and it goes real good on dandelions .
really .
uh -huh .
huh .
i 've never eaten dandelions
uh -huh .
now i 've tried dandelion wine but i 've never tried any dandelions just to eat .
yeah .
  use the greens , if you get them when they 're young and tender , you know , before they have grown too , too tall ,
because they do get a little stringy .
all right .
but , uh , they 're kind of fun to , to try ,
yeah .
get a , get a few
and then throw them in with the rest of your salad sometimes .
i 'll try that .
yeah .
yeah .
i sure will
uh , but i 've been cutting our grass too lately because my husband 's back ,
and he 's been having trouble with
so , wasn 't allowed to run a lawn mower ,
oh , oh .
so , it takes about four hours to cut our grass .
yow .
and , we have , we have hills .
i 'm afraid of the hills
but ,
i 'm getting on to it ,
i just pretend they 're not there ,
and i just go ahead and do it
so you all are into , so you all are into the lawn , big time , huh .
yeah .
yeah ,
i only get , well , i guess i got
uh -huh .
my , my whole section of my house is probably a tenth of an acre then i have a pretty nice backyard ,
uh -huh .
and you know , i 've got enough room to throw horseshoes .
oh , that 's great .
you know ,
great .
couple of other    ,
that 's , a lot of people don 't have that much space even .
no ,
and it 's nice .
i 'm just inside the city limits ,
i 'm probably a mile , mile and a half inside the city limits ,
and i 'm only a mile ,
uh -huh .
and a half from work .
so you have all the conveniences of ,
yeah .
it 's pretty nice .
a city ,
yeah ,
and , and the country also .
i have the room outside i need ,
and i don 't really have all the room in the house i need
but ,
well , you never have enough room do you think .
no .
especially if your into any hobbies or anything .
i have a question to ask you about gardening though .
you know , those ,
what are they called ,
the , they called , uh ,  rolly polly  bugs ,
that 's what my son calls them anyway .
 rolly polly  what ?
 rolly polly  bugs .
the ones that roll up in a ball .
i don 't know what they 're called .
is it a bug ,
they look like they 've got ,
you mean ?
yeah .
a worm ?
yeah .
a cutworm ?
no .
not a grub worm ?
it 's not like a ,
no .
you find them under bricks and all that stuff , where it 's moist ,
and if , if you touch them , they roll up in a ball .
oh .
i don 't know what they call them .
but i 'm plagued with those things ,
uh .
and i haven 't figured out ,
i even called the nursery ,
uh -huh .
i 'm trying to think of what they are , what kind ,
they could be .
i , i don 't know .
you find them under bricks usually , and that .
yeah ,
under bricks , or under wood ,
or you know , if you leave a piece of newspaper in the yard too long , they get in there .
they usually come out at night ,
but , you can find them during the daytime if you pick something up that 's   been laying around ,
they 're not a slug .
no .
not a ,
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
a slug is actually kind of slimy and these are just ,
he plays with them all time ,
he picks them up and rolls them across the patio .
oh really .
they were not hard are they ?
no .
are they a hard worm ?
no .
they 're not real hard ,
they 're not a hard  
they 're like a , water bug ,
huh .
of sorts ,
i don 't know what ,
oh ,
they 're called .
are they black then ?
yeah .
yeah .
but they roll up .
yeah .
i can 't think of what kind they would be .
when you touch them , they roll up .
uh -huh .
i 'm no help on that , then . because ,
but , i 'm plagued with those .
i can 't think of what they are . what they would be .
i think you have a lot more insects down there even than , than what we have .
you know , i think it 's a big problem because we 're in more of a tempered zone .
you know , we don 't really , we only freeze down here in january , and february , at the most .
i know ,
you know .
my brother had trouble with fire ants , and that even .
yeah .
i got fire ,
uh , yeah .
ants too .
and they be can be a real dickens .
and , you , spray in one part of your lawn ,
and they just move to ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
another part .
so you got to ,
yeah .
yeah .
spray your whole yard ,
and your , your , your neighbor gets them ,
and then he sprays his yard ,
and you get them back again
yeah
you keep trading them
yeah .
but we 're not doing too bad down here really , you know ,
the daffodils are out
and ,
uh -huh .
ours are going to be coming out .
now our cancer society sales daffodils .
right now , they 're , they 're big now .
so , we , we have daffodils ,
yeah .
here in the house because of the cut flowers ,
yeah .
but they 're just beginning to come out and bud .
yeah .
see mine are up and bloomed already
so ,
uh ,
already .
uh -huh .
they sure are ,
uh ,
pretty ,
uh -huh .
i like them    ,
uh , they 're such a nice bright early spring ,
yeah .
color .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
and then in , in my back flower bed i have , uh , tiger lilies and they bloom in , you know ,
uh -huh .
late june , mid ,
and they 're ,
july .
beautiful too .
yeah ,
they are .
they real ,
they 're beautiful .
beautiful .
they 're , they 're nice and green , you know ,
they 're , uh , they 're up above a foot ,
oh my .
maybe eighteen inches .
they come up real pretty ,
yeah .
every year ,
yeah .
no problem .
we won 't have too much here for another couple of months yet .
is it still pretty cool up there ?
yeah .
yeah .
we 're ha -, it 's raining today .
well , do you all have a ,
what kind o gra -, grass do you grow up there ?
do you grow , uh , bermuda or    ,
well , our grass , like i said is just grass .
we really didn 't plant anything .
it 's just ,
yeah .
  i suppose maybe you call it crabgrass even .
yeah .
and , uh ,
see we , i have bermuda ,
uh -huh .
in my yard ,
and i still have the old standby crabgrass here and there ,
uh -huh .
but ,
it 's probably ,
bermuda seems to be ,
very pretty .
yeah .
bermuda seems to be pretty ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
good down here .
we have some people that have done their lawns ,
and , uh ,
okay .
okay
they suggested that we , uh , discuss what we think of when we say camping .
yeah .
what do you , where do you like to camp ?
how do you like to camp ?
oh , i can camp just about , most anyway
camping or , uh , motor home is nice , uh , travel trailer , pop up ,
oh , really ?
oh .
i used to , uh , live in the ozarks and , uh liked to go up there and just take a backpack and strike out into the woods .
you really rough it then .
yeah .
uh -huh .
do you do that very often ?
uh -huh .
i haven 't done it in quite awhile since i moved down here .
uh -huh .
but i used to do it quite a bit .
you 'd have a lot of hills in that , down in that area .
yeah ,
yeah .
yeah it was real hilly .
that would be really great .
take a twenty -two
and go out .
pardon ?
take a twenty -two
and find a creek .
uh -huh .
that sounds like it 'd be fun .
did you go alone or with a group or ,
i used to go with my brother .
uh -huh .
we just lived up there .
uh -huh .
oh , that 's great . long as it 's not raining .
yeah ,
it gets kind of ,
uh -huh .
i , we used to have one of those little caves you can go back in get out of the rain .
really ,
oh , that would be ,
but i don 't know much about camping in texas .
huh -uh .
well , i 'm in pennsylvania .
you live in pennsylvania ?
yes
i didn 't know they did this .
are you in texas , now ?
yeah .
oh .
okay .
yeah .
i 'm down here at t i .
most everybody i 've been talking to is from texas ,
but , uh , we 're up here in western , northwestern part of pennsylvania .
i used to be in ohio ,
it 's some pretty country up there .
uh -huh .
well you kind of know what it 's like , then .
yeah .
so ,
but , we 've , uh , we 've done , uh , many types of camping .
we 've , we 've done tent camping ,
and we had access to a motor home which is really super great , if you don 't want to rough it too much .
yeah .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
you can get the , they have some nice camping grounds you know , that have the water piped out just set it up
and get out of , get out of the city for awhile .
right .
just get you away from the everyday things that are going on .
we , when the children were smaller we used to go to , uh , delaware along the o -, ocean most every year .
and that was fun
we stayed mostly in state parks
and , uh , we really enjoyed that .
tell you what ,
i 'm losing you .
huh ?
i said i 'm losing you ,
you 're getting fad -, you 're fading out .
oh , maybe my , dropping my phone .
is that better ?
yeah .
oh .
but ,
so what ,
you try to go and take a vacation every year and go out and camp ?
yeah .
well , we used to ,
we don 't as much anymore ,
but , uh , we used to .
we kind of slowed down a little bit .
but , uh , i think the worst , the worst thing is when it 's raining .
yeah .
if you get a rainy season and you happen to be camping then it can be kind of bad .
i know the rain bring out the snakes or used to bring them out in the ozarks ,
uh -huh .
that 's kind of , kind of rough when you got to fight snakes off when your sleeping .
i don 't think i would like that .
what kind ?
uh , copperheads mostly ,
oh .
those aren 't too pleasant .
no ,
they 're .
yeah .
we have some of them around here .
you probably have more there , though , i would imagine .
yeah .
one year they were , they were just everywhere .
oh .
i don 't know what it was ,
uh -huh .
we had a real rainy spring and then it was all year ,
there was just copperheads everywhere .
uh -huh .
but you still backpacked and camped out .
yeah .
well i lived down in , down in the bottom of a big hollow
and we had to pretty much hike out most of the time .
uh -huh .
if it rained we were stuck back in there .
had a four wheel drive .
uh -huh .
you just get used to it .
yeah .
yeah .
i guess you know enough to look where you 're walking or sitting or whatever you 're doing .
yeah .
yeah ,
i would think , i would think a cave would be , could have problems like that , too .
yeah .
this cave that we used to go in was little ,
it was small
uh -huh .
it was more it was just big enough for a couple of people to sack out .
uh -huh ,
is your brother younger than you
or ,
yeah .
he 's about a year and a half younger .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh ,
well , that 's great ,
that 'd be a lot of fun .
you have a lot good experiences from that .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah ,
it was .
did you really ?
saw a few bears things like that .
what , black ones ?
 yeah . 
 yeah .
 that would be exciting .
yeah ,
the first , first couple of times it 's pretty scary
but , uh ,
after that you realize they are just as afraid of you , too .
yeah ,
they 're usually more afraid of you than you are of them , usually .
but , uh ,
they 're on the increase in this area .
oh , really ?
uh -huh .
i don 't know if ,
they don 't have them up there do they ?
the black bear .
 yeah . 
 oh , yeah . 
 oh , do they ? 
 yeah ,
 the population 's been really up .
they 've , uh , they 've had longer hunting seasons than that even to get rid of more of them , because they were , uh , increasing so much .
yeah ,
they , down here they , they stopped for awhile
or they really made it hard to hunt them .
uh -huh .
i don 't know what it 's like now ,
i haven 't been back up there in awhile .
yeah .
but , uh , we , we really like camping .
i , i must say that , uh , we ha -, we really have a lot of fun , a lot of memories in that from camping
and , uh .
well , it 's good to get out and smell some fresh air , too .
yeah .
yeah .
so ,
yeah .
it 's just , so , it 's a lot of work , too it 's , uh , get -, you know , getting ready and taking care of everything .
but it 's , um , it 's really refreshing .
so ,
well , i think we 're about to run out of our time .
i think so
well , it was really good hearing from you
yeah .
and i hope you get back into camping again , and do a little more of it .
yeah .
i 'm sure , i will .
okay .
thanks a lot ,
and you have a good day .
you , too .
bye -bye .
bye .
all righty .
so , uh , do you think russia 's still a threat ?
well , i guess i 'm maybe naive ,
but i never did feel that russia was a big threat to us .
there you go
i mean , obviously there 's the , the , the possibility of , or , was the possibility of war , uh ,
but , i somehow think that war is one of those things that maybe is inevitable ,
but , uh , i don 't look at it as a threat in the same sense that , that i think this question was meant .
what about you ?
well , i think ,
h -, have you ever read the book nineteen eighty -four ?
yes .
okay ,
uh -huh .
you know , like , how , uh , these two , there was like three continents that were always fighting with each other right ,
right .
and you could picture it as being russia versus the u s d -, during the whole time
and what they would do is they would get their prisoners and kill them as soon as they got them because the people there could realize that they were the same as , as themselves , you know ,
the prisoners of wars were , were the same as the people living in that country .
right .
and you didn 't want that to happen .
and to me , it had always been that way .
i mean what happens is , you have a government , right ,
yeah .
and this government controls everything , right and then you have the people inhabiting the country
and these people have nothing to do with the government itself .
right .
and these people are the same as you are .
right .
and what goes on is that every time somebody attacks a country , supposedly u s or russia attacks a country , it 's not going to be within the borders of the u s or russia itself .
like i was telling people , i 'm really mad because the whole thing in the middle east this was going on .
in lith -, in lithuania , they , they were announced to be a separate country .
but , yet , the , the government that 's in moscow told its army to go in there and get those people
and the u . s . didn 't go in there and try to save those people .
right .
you know . it 's like you 're not going to go in there and say no ,
listen ,
there 's a separate country .
why ,
because you 're going into the border .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
right .
once you get into the border , then there 's a threat .
but what happens is you don 't mess with us , we won 't mess with you ,
but let 's mess with the neutral countries .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
you know , and now it 's like you know , they 're saying other people were , were i guess , other leaders were still crazier about it , you know ,
like other people , you could think that they might use a bomb here and a bomb there ,
but russia has never been known for throwing an atomic bomb anywhere .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
and the u s has .
you know , it 's like they , it seems like they can , their , their army or whatever can , can go in there quicker than an atomic bomb can and do , do the job with , uh , you know , less suffering .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
you know , but i think , i think the thing is , is that there , the thing
like they were saying they go , you know ,
like libya could start a nuclear war because of whoever is behind the button . but not the u s s r ,
right .
uh -huh .
the u s s r wouldn 't do it .
uh -huh .
because they got too much at stake .
but i guess there was concern , uh , that i -, iraq would use , you know , nonconventional warheads with , with the chemical weapons and things
but yet it didn 't happen .
yeah .
well ,
i mean why not .
my , my point of view to that is , is that it would have had so much , i mean the attack would have been so complete on iraq if they had .
uh -huh .
i mean the first , you can imagine the first , uh , chemical weapon used that would have meant a total attack of the iraq country within , you know , three hours of when the weapon was shot .
right .
oh , so you think it was fear that kept iraq from using it .
but , yet the ,
and what happens is , what happens is ,
suppose they get saddam hussein , which they eventually will ,
he 's got one less thing to go against him .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i mean , if he were to use that , he might as well commit suicide because he 's going to be captured and , you know .
but the u . s . also makes a lot of , uh , you know , treaties with other people like saying , okay ,
if you give up , then you can come live in our country
and we 'll take care of you , like marcos , right .
right .
we 'll overthrow you ,
but yet you can still come live here , you know .
right ,
i don 't think we 've done that to saddam hussein yet .
uh no .
no .
i think that 's , that 's , that 's not very likely .
yeah .
but yet you know , as , as the parallel russia is that saddam hussein is using the chemical warfare on his own people .
right .
and i guess that makes sense what you said that , uh , within their own borders they feel freer to do what , what they feel necessary .
right .
yeah .
and , uh , you know , there 's , there 's just , you know ,
like people will go , like they , like the u . s . goes and goes into panama
and what ,
see i don 't believe in war .
that 's my thing .
uh -huh .
i don 't believe that anybody should die you know ,
and so then , you know , you have ,
because what happens is ,
suppose i 'm , i go to war
and i 'm holding a gun
and i 'm just looking at myself holding a gun
and whoever shoots first survives , you know .
but that same person also has a family
right .
and , you know his parents are going to cry
and , you know , life ends there
and to me that 's ridiculous .
you know , i mean , i just don 't believe it .
i think there are other ways to fix it even though sometimes there aren 't ,
but it 's pretty hard to think that , you know , people are just going to shoot each other down
and it 's legal in a situation like that .
you know .
yeah .
well or that , that it resolves anything in the end . that that negotiations couldn 't resolve .
yeah ,
i mean , i mean saddam hussein lost so much money during the war that it was ridiculous
uh -huh
and he , all he was trying to do was make money at the beginning so and keep his power ,
but , well ,
well , it sounds like neither one of us thinks that the soviet union is a real threat to the u s .
no ,
i , i don 't think so .
i think , uh , they 're getting , they 're especially getting their life back together now
because a lot of things that you saw on tv ,
a lot of , uh , inhabitants of russia would love to stay in their country just as long as they were able to express what they wanted to .
right .
a lot of like dancers and stuff like that .
right .
they said that they wouldn 't leave russia unless russia told them that they couldn 't travel anymore and compete .
so it must be a beautiful country .
uh -huh .
it 's just that , you know , they won 't let you get out
and when you want to get out of the country , that 's what you want to do .
right ,
right .
so , oh , well ,
i got to go to class now .
okay ,
well thanks .
nice talking to you .
bye -bye .
bye -bye .
hello .
hello ,
this is jim in dallas .
uh , how you doing ?
fine .
i 'm callie in garland .
oh , you 're right here ,
yes .
okay yeah ,
i 'm actually working tonight ,
i just , uh , called and came in .
oh are you .
do you work at t i ?
yeah ,
you ?
yeah ,
i just got a little booklet , uh , this not what we 're supposed to talk about , just got a little booklet in the mail with the gifts ,
and i thought , i better make some calls .
i know ,
i know ,
  they .
yeah .
well , i haven 't had a chance , i haven 't got a chance to look at them yet .
it was a lot nicer than i expected .
my daughter , uh , got a few calls at home .
she talked to some student in ,
i guess they give them to computer students , too , in , uh , virginia , something like that .
she 's talked to two students .
i 've talked to ,
i don 't think they were students ,
yeah .
one , i think , worked at a university , university um , and the furthest away i 've talked to someone has been new york .
oh , yeah ,
great .
uh , we 're supposed to talk about the elderly now , i guess , uh ,
yes ,
we are .
do you have anybody that you , uh , are close to that decision on , or anything ,
or , i 've thought about it for myself and all ,
and my wi -, my wife 's mother is in a retirement home .
she 's not in a nursing home . uh .
oh , well that 's a ,
did you push the button ?
yeah ,
did i , didn 't we push ?
did we ,
let me , i 'll hit it again just in case .
okay ,
just in case
i did it as she said ,
yes .
now , what ,
oh .
but , uh , she 's she 's down in san antonio and it 's , it 's a , uh , it 's a brand new one .
it 's a catholic , uh , retirement home for nuns .
oh .
it 's at , uh trinity , uh ,
no ,
let me see , trinity ,
i keep calling it trini -,
it 's not trinity ,
i 'll think of ,
incarnate word ,
well , isn 't that neat .
and they have a retirement home for the nuns and they take some lay people .
isn 't that neat .
yeah ,
and that one 's really super .
now i , i know what they 're talking about on regular retirement .
yeah ,
there 's not too many ,
uh -huh .
they do have a wing where the people who are really sick , you know have nurses .
oh , that 's good .
and then they have other wings that we visited , uh , that are very nice .
i mean it 's just super .
that 's neat .
just supervised more or less than anything and security , i guess .
oh , yeah ,
they , they , they have , uh , like , uh , a guard with locks .
we 've been there once at night at christmas .
she just went in last year .
oh .
she drives and everything ,
she , she , she 's perfectly healthy .
uh -huh .
uh ,
what made you all decide to put her , or what made her decide to go ?
well , her husband died .
they were in the military together ,
right
   ,
and she just did not want to take care of the house and she visited the place , and then fell in love with it , and decided to just shun all responsibilities of any kind ,
so to speak ,
well , that 's good .
and so she 's happy as , as heck ,
and they   serve meals , of course .
that 's great .
they have clubs and a swimming pool ,
so that 's nice .
uh -huh .
now i , i know the ones where you 're really ill , we visited a long time ago when she had a grandmother that was in one .
right .
and they were all more or less hospitalized type you know , really , really sick .
shut -ins and ,
it 's a tough question .
yeah ,
it really is .
i worked in one as a teenager .
i volunteered ,
oh , you got   more experience than i do then on it .
well , it was really , it was really sad , heartbreaking , i guess .
yeah ,
yeah .
and , uh , i just , oh , i just felt for those people , especially the ones that never got visited .
 oh , that would be awful . 
 that just bothered me . 
i never thought about that , you know .
that just bothered me so much , especially , you know , at my age ,
i was probably about fourteen .
uh -huh .
and that really made a bad impression on me
i always thought , not really bad of them , i mean , because they are , most of them i believe are probably pretty good for the people ,
but , i don 't know .
it 's just a , it would be a tough , tough decision .
yeah ,
i think that , uh , hopefully we as a country are learning a little more about it ,
and they 're getting nicer .
right .
i 've seen on t v where they take animals and young children ,
in fact my daughter is one .
my wife took my daughters one year when they were getting some points for school , took them to an elderly home ,
and boy that really pumps them up .
helps ,
yeah .
that is very nice to see young people .
i think that 's one of the sad things , is when you 're in an older home .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
right .
right .
if you just have people your own age , you never get a chance to see kids or anything or animals or anything , you know you can 't take care of them ,
right .
kind of obvious you can 't take care of children or animals in a nursing home ,
but it 's nice to have them visit and everything .
yeah ,
and get that youth back .
yeah .
right .
you know , sometimes that even helps them , just being around young people to , because some of them are so , um , just stationary i mean , they 'll get in a wheelchair
or they 'll just sit in a chair
and , and , until you come along and really try and pump them up , they 're just stationary ,
and i feel like , gosh , that 's all they do all day long .
so i do , love to see young kids go and , and men take the pets and everything .
i think that 's a real , real neat idea .
yeah ,
i think you do get more by stimul -, by stimulation .
my , in fact , my mother in law just visited .
she 's just about seventy -five . again , perfectly fine .
yeah .
but , one , and , and she visited us here in , in dallas .
when she went back , every time she goes back to , uh , san antonio , my wife has two sisters there , too , she said she 's much better ,
that 's ,
yeah .
right .
she 's much more alive and , and , uh , active when she 's been on a visit with somebody else , you know and , and our routine has   obviously hectic with teenagers and everything and she 's much ,
right .
and so the stimulation part is really important . i think , like any animal , anything you just lay around , uh , that 's the fastest way to die , i think , you know .
stagnant
yeah ,
that 's exactly right .
i think they 're really neat .
oh , yeah .
um , of course i 've seen those reports on t v , the horrible ones and that scares me .
i 'm afraid i 'm a t v flipper .
anything bad , i like , i like to ,
flip , i flip it off .
but it 's sad ,
it 's sad ,
yeah .
it 's sad to think that we would do that to people ,
and you know , i 've seen them on t v with , uh , bed sores ,
oh , yeah .
and oh , they just stay in the same clothes or the same sheets and not do laundry .
and i just think , how can you do that ?
yeah .
these people have given so much of their lives , you know , to , to america you know , whatever ,
and here is how we treat them .
just put them in a home and leave them .
right .
when i was , uh , younger , we , i lived in the east ,
i 'm from the east really ,
and it seemed like there were several people that i knew that had their , uh , parents , i guess they would be , but well in their seve -,
living with them .
uh -huh sound >>.
and one of them was even a woman who was fairly old ,
and i guess she , she had her own separate room .
right .
and i think , whether it 's more a custom up there , or maybe because i was younger and it 's just not a custom anymore to have , uh , you know , the grandparents live with you anymore .
i think ,
i guess that , uh well , we aren 't getting away from that , which is not right .
right .
i think it 's neat .
oh , yeah .
i think , uh , you learn a lot from them from all their experiences ,
and , and that 's one of my favorite things to do is sit around and listen to their stories .
oh , right ,
right .
i think that 's neat ,
yeah .
because they really have a lot of good i -, insights that my fa -, my husband 's father is really old .
he , he had him late in life ,
and he 's , he 'll be eighty this year .
oh .
and i just , uh , he lives with different , you know , people in the family .
he 'll switch from time to time .
i just ,
well , that 's nice in a lot of ways .
yeah ,
i just couldn 't imagine locking ,
not locking him up , but putting him in a home and just ,
bet you were surprised that you said that by mistake .
yeah ,
right ,
lock him up .
that 's what i think about it for me ,
i think , well , my kids better not do that to me .
i know ,
i know .
i don 't want that , you know .
right ,
exactly .
so i , i think of it , well , how would i want to be treated rather than , well ,
it 's easy to say , oh , yeah ,
let 's put these old folks in a home ,
but when i think i don 't want to do that , you know .
that 's right .
i don 't want to be i 'd want to have my little home .
i always threaten my daughters ,
i say , well , i 'm going to build a little house behind yours ,
and i 'll take care of your lawn , he says ,
but i 'm not going to one of those places .
oh , you 're going to put me away .
right ,
yeah .
that 's what my mother ,
she always ,
you 're going to lock me up one day , aren 't you .
i can tell ,
you 're going to lock me up .
that 's what we , that 's the way we call it , which is really wrong .
i know .
but my wife 's mother , and the one , she 's in san ant -,
it 's everything but .
the opposite of what you 've seen .
right .
i mean it 's a little hotel , you might say .
that 's great .
again , a swimming pool , and grounds ,
and she has enough room .
gosh .
she has two bedrooms , and a , and a separate living area .
right .
yes .
prepare your ,
they don 't have kitchens or anything but they have little , it 's like uh , on each floor they have a little kitchen area where you can go down and have a make a meal , you know .
well , that 's great .
now can she leave , um , on a day by herself ?
oh , yeah ,
it 's , it 's , it 's nothing like that .
it 's like living in the hotel .
oh , man .
i mean she 's totally on her own .
that 's neat .
uh , and she still drives , which we do , does scare us some , because she has dented a few things , you know ,
right .
and we keep thinking about that , you know because she , they get less alert ,
and they don 't care ,
and i 've seen some of these elderly people on t v you know , the ones from florida that just run into people
right .
and they don 't even understand what happened , you know .
i know ,
bless their hearts ,
you hate to hurt them by doing that ,
i know .
that 's like their one last thing that they can still do ,
and you take away that driving ability
and that would really be hard .
i , i know .
go ahead ,
i 'm sorry .
we 've , well , we 've thought about doing that for my husband 's father , because he ,
oh , he still drives ?
yeah .
that 's gre -, well , it 's wonderful in one respect ,
but i don 't know if you can afford the insurance ,
yeah .
well , luckily he drives a big old tank
yeah .
so , he , i mean , i don 't think he , he could get hurt .
i just hope to god he doesn 't ever hurt anyone .
right .
but he he hasn 't had any accidents luckily .
that 's good .
i mean , people are all different .
yeah ,
yeah .
i , i wonder if they should give them a test , or at least maybe not take their licen -, maybe give them a refresher driving course , and just to see how well they are every five years .
i saw that on twenty twenty .
are they doing it ?
they , um , you know , they 're testing that , they 're , you know , thinking of doing that .
and i think that would be a great idea , because i think they do , come , become less aware ,
yeah .
and they just , i don 't know , they , and they don 't hear as well , for one thing and that doesn 't help .
well , everybody needs retraining .
it doesn 't hurt , uh ,
you know ,
the best football players and all the opera singers still have coaches ,
and i don 't know why you couldn 't after sixty -five every five years have a refresher course and then take another driving .
right .
it would sure , the insurance companies would , would probably help pay for some of that , you know .
at least that way the burden is not on the family of taking their license or their car away
right ,
there you go ,
it 's on the state
there 's a good point very good point .
very good point .
but i think they maybe , should do that ,
and then the families ,
okay .
do you , have you noticed any new , uh , trends in politics ?
well , the one i think is interesting is the california , los angeles police chief who says he won 't resign .
and did you hear yesterday that mayor bradley said that , uh , he should ?
oh , really ?
no ,
i didn 't hear that .
i think it 's , i think what 's interesting is that , uh , the political activists , jesse jackson and a lot of other people went out there and are demonstrating .
i find it interesting that , uh , outsiders would bother to go in .
how do , how do you feel about people like jesse jackson getting involved ?
uh , i think sometimes it 's good for people outside .
they get a different persp -, uh , perspective on an issue and stuff .
so , yeah ,
i don 't see any problem with outsiders going in and getting a little bit involved .
i think , though , that it should still be , uh , sort of up to the majority in the area .
i don 't know ,
on something like that , they wouldn 't really vote on it or anything , though .
well , do you but do you think gates should resign ?
uh , probably so , just because they were under his authority
and he obviously failed somewhere along the line .
well , well , speaking of that kind of issue , have you kept up with john wiley price ?
yeah .
what do you think of him ?
oh , um , i think he 's got good intentions ,
but i 'm not sure if the way he goes about what he does is really right .
he 's an interesting person .
i was talking to someone who said that , uh , for all his obvious attention to , efforts to get media attention that he actually is a worker on the , uh ,
right .
uh -huh .
i guess he 's on the county , uh , oh , board of supervisors or   and , the , the , the , uh , at those meetings he really comes quite well prepared and is well informed and is a hard worker and is really quite agreeable , uh ,
and that this stuff we see in the , you know , in the media is , uh ,
well , he 's really just trying to make a political statement .
i , i find that an interesting element of politics that we don 't , that , that most people would not know that john wiley price apparently is a , is a , you know ,
of course , he 's got in this , this  deal  of racism and the , you know , name calling and all this .
but apparently , he 's a , a worker .
uh , you may disagree with him ,
but i , i , i find this whole ,
what do you think of this , uh , fourteen one and ten four one in dallas ?
oh , i think that they should go ahead and go to the , uh , fourteen one .
i , to me it 's just fair , you know ,
an equal , it seems like every area should have an equal voice .
i agree with you
but did you see the map they drew up on , uh , on how they were going to divide up the districts ?
no .
it was , it was the strangest ,
i 'm , i 'm not sure it was gerrymandered ,
but the way they drew these little patterns and stuff , i , i , i guess i 'm a little cynical of the , of the power base .
i , i , i , and i don 't quite understand why the power base , uh , doesn 't , uh , why they don 't go with fourteen one .
i , you know , and , you know , the , it seems to me that what happened in the , in the election , that a lot of the people , they said particularly the , the , uh , i think it 's hispanics don 't vote because they don 't think that they have any affect ,
and it 's ,
yeah .
i , i guess i am disappointed with dallas in that , uh , the fourteen one , it ,
i don 't know .
you can , you can disagree with al lipscomb and , uh ,
what 's , what 's the lady 's name ?
diane ragsdale ?
yeah .
you can disagree with , uh , what they 're doing and what they 're saying ,
but in reality i think they 're , they 're trying to represent their constituents .
yeah .
a -, and i think dallas is doing itself a disservice .
i think they ought to get on with something important .
yeah ,
they really make themselves look bad ,
and i don 't know why certain groups are fighting so hard to keep the ten four one .
yeah ,
and i , but i think even , i , even those people are ,
it 's like pauken and box and these people ,
i think it 's , it 's kind of interesting that everybody 's so busy politicking that the question is are we getting anything good done .
it 's like this whole school issue .
no ,
huh -uh .
are you involved in the schools at all public schools ? this whole thing down there where they 're , they 're trying to , um , uh , you know , devote all our money and raise our taxes and better schools
and , and it all seems , you know , like everybody 's trying to one -upmanship on everybody else
so ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
i ,
i , i have got to run to a meeting .
okay .
it was good talking to you .
i don 't think we 've gone our , our ten minutes
but i think we 've , we 've talked long enough .
okay .
good talking to you .
okay .
good night .
bye .
well , there 's been a lot of publicity lately about that new nancy reagan book out by , uh , kitty kelly , the unauthorized biography .
are you interested in that at all ?
not really
i 'm not much of a fan of nancy reagan ,
so i , i don 't particularly read , um , biographies or autobiographies .
 uh -huh 
 i haven 't  read too many .
i , i 'm more of a fiction and nonfiction reader that , n -, n -, not of that nature though .
uh -huh .
well , i , the reason why i was thinking about looking at it is because it 's supposed to ,
i 'm not a fan of nancy reagan
and so it 's supposed to have a lot of unflattering things in it .
and i thought just purely for entertainment , i might enjoy that .
but i , i wouldn 't want to go out and buy it like , you know , the hard back copy of it .
yeah .
but i might check ,
if they , if they had it , i don 't even know that i 'd probably read it even if it was at the library though .
really .
i , i just , you know , i 'm just not really interested in reading about other people 's lives to that degree .
uh -huh .
you know , unless maybe they lived a long , long time ago .
for me it would be interesting to find out what life was , uh , l -, like , you know , in that period .
but ,
uh -huh .
not , not really interested
in biographies .
well , i , uh ,
 i have  read some biographies .
i prefer to read ,
if i read a biography , it 's mostly because maybe i have to , uh , you know ,
back when i was in school i had to have information about that person or , um , preparing some kind of lesson
and i need to have more information about people .
but i , i do like to read some biographies ,
but that one just sounded like gossipy .
and i wouldn 't want to sit down and just read it cover to cover , but flip through just for , just to get a good laugh .
yeah .
i think the last biography that i read , i 'm not , i think it was , it was , um , on lady randolph churchill ,
uh -huh .
churchill 's mother .
and that was excellent .
was it ?
um , yeah .
it was ,
it 's in two parts .
i think the first one is called jenny or something like that , uh , because that was her name .
and , um ,
uh -huh .
i only got to read one part of it .
and i 've been looking for , you know , the other half of it and read the ,
i read that half where she was in her later years ,
and it was absolutely excellent .
and it was very descriptive of , of people with money back then and , uh , affluents in england , uh , that , you know , were associated to the king and all .
and it was ,
 uh -huh . 
 really  pretty fascinating .
and i and that was actually a couple of years ago ,
so ,
 uh -huh . 
 it 's ,  it 's been a while since i 've read ,
 a while . 
 any biographies .
 uh , i love to read .
i mean , i 'm constantly reading .
i read , i like , uh , mysteries ,
and i like , um ,
as far as improving myself , uh , i haven 't read any lately .
but i was reading classical works that i hadn 't read before .
 uh -hum . 
 you  know , that you might have needed to read in school , but that i just didn 't read for some reason or another , another , or that , you know , that you can only read so many in school that they make a requirement of .
 right . 
 and  you have so many out there that , uh , that you , you know , you never get a chance to read .
and so , i said ,
well , i think it was because i read , um , dickens ' a tale of two cities ,
uh -huh .
and i just , um , that , even when i read it now , it still makes me cry , the ending of it .
 and  i couldn 't believe , i , i could not believe that it took me so long to read such a good book .
 uh -huh . 
 i 'd  read some dickens before ,
but i hadn 't read that one .
and i , i was like , i thought to myself , you know , what other things are out there that are , that are classics ,
 uh -huh . 
 you  know , that have withstood time and that are just excellent ,
something 's excellent about them , whether it 's the way they were written or whether it was the material they were written , you know , that was written about .
and , um , so i started reading .
i had this like , you know , i had a binge of bo -,
my mother , uh ,
i was living in bermuda at the time with my husband ,
but my , uh , mother sent me , you know , like bookl -, you know , uh , boxes full of different books .
oh !
and , uh , she just would get them real cheap and stuff and send them over .
but she , she is constantly , was , i guess because ,
it seems like , uh , older people have much better , uh ,
in their schooling , they , they got more of the classics than i did ,
 uh -huh . 
 you  know .
and she knows so much more of them than i do ,
i wouldn 't even know , you know , to go look for that author or that book .
right .
you know .
well , i like the classics too .
uh , i think that there 's a lot of books out now that are kind of garbage books .
and i , well , i don 't prefer to read a lot of the things like you might find at , uh , well , like at a target or a supermarket or something where they have a bunch of books out , paperback type books .
usually , i , i 'm going to the book store for a particular reason , uh .
pro -, probably you read a book review or something .
 yes . 
 a  review on it .
yes ,
and , and , uh , i buy some of the , not self -improvement books , but , uh , self -help books
like , we just bought a new house ,
so i bought a couple of books about how to buy a house and what to look for , you know .
 uh -huh . 
 and ,  or how to repair this or repair that in your own home .
i bought that for my husband
and , or how to , how to do something books , you know , for reference .
and , uh , and those are really helpful i think in helping , um ,
well , you know , like some , w -, symptoms , medical symptoms , like when , how do you know when to take your child to the doctor or not ,
 yeah . 
 type  books , which i use as reference and have been real handy .
but purely just for enjoyment ,
i , i had a major in english and linguistics ,
and so i ha -, have a lot of books in my home that i can read from the classics ,
and i do enjoy those quite a bit .
and , um , so i tend to , for reading just day to day , uh , you in sound know , i have a particular book i 'm looking for
or i just enjoy , uh , you know , the newspaper magazine .
 yeah . 
 it 's  handy .
well , what i do is i usually have two books at one time .
i have a classic which i have to work on , basically ,
 you  know , uh , just depending ,
well , some authors i can just , you know , basically drink in ,
 uh -huh . 
 but  others ,  eh   , i really do have to work at them .
and then , um , whether , you know , they 're a foreign author or whatever , um , or if it 's their style or , or just understanding the material .
and then i , you know , i -, some of those , it 's like i said ,
it 's like school ,
you have to work at it .
right .
but to me it 's worthwhile in the end .
i feel good about it ,
and i usually remember those a long time later .
and then i have books that i read just purely for enjoyment ,
 light reading . 
 you know .
 i mean , yeah ,
just light reading that are ,
i particularly like dick francis books , and just some of the , the authors that are , uh , for mysteries , just , you know , just , uh , purely for entertainment ,
 uh -huh . 
 you  know .
that 's it ,
i 'm not really expecting to get anything out of it ,
 uh -huh . 
 except  to be momentarily pleased , you know , because i don 't , i can never remember ,
 the  plots or anything ,
 right . 
 later  on those books .
well , i think that 's good because you do have to use your mind and imagine up the circumstances and things .
it 's not like , uh , most television where you , you know , you just , you can sit there and not even pay attention very much but ,
 yeah . 
 still  understand what was going on .
yeah ,
that , television , it gives you everything .
uh -huh .
so , it 's ber -, basically mindless .
i mean , all your , y -, the only really thing you are having to use is connecting the things that they give you , you know ,
 right . 
 what  you 're hearing and your , your si -, uh , your sight .
but they give you everything else .
 right . 
 and  it 's usually , the television that we see nowadays seems like that it 's , it 's , it doesn 't even have some of the underlying , uh , things to it , you know , that maybe the old movies and things had , you know , the underlying themes and stuff that maybe you had to kind of figure out .
 uh -huh . 
 or ,  you know , like with hitchcock or something where you 're , you 're , you 're either expecting something or w -,
i , i don 't know ,
it just , i don 't really care much for t v at all .
i just ,
i mean i sometimes get hooked into it ,
but i really , i really get mad at myself when i do , because i r -, i realize fully there 's no really redeeming value for ,
 not too much . 
 t v .
no . 
not too much .
well , that 's right .
well , i think it is good to , to read books and , and , because even if it 's , like you say , it 's light reading , you are still getting some , uh , mental exercise
yeah .
you 're developing your imagination .
you know , when you develop your imagination , that can take you into a lot of other areas , because you 've developed , uh , your , your , your mind in , in seeing things , you know ,
 right . 
 even  if it 's your own set way , you know ,
it 's , you 're , you 're taking words and developing a picture in your mind .
that 's right .
so , i mean ,
that 's good .
it 's , it 's excellent .
i , i 'm , we haven 't got children yet ,
but i hope to , uh , set an example for ours that , you know , that reading is , can , it can be your best friend ,
 uh -huh . 
 basically .
 i mean , even if you haven 't got a , a f -, a human friend around , you can pi -, pick up a book and , and ,
 right . 
 be  with somebody , basically .
uh -huh .
i think so .
well , i guess i 'd better close now so i can ,
it sounds like your kids are doing stuff
or are you a teacher ?
 uh , 
 i  gathered you might be a teacher .
well , i , i was .
i 'm home now ,
 oh . 
 full  time .
 uh -huh . 
 but ,  uh , so , yeah ,
we 're , we think books are important around here .
yeah .
well , you have a good day .
okay .
stay out of the rain .
okay .
you too .
bye -bye .
take care .
bye -bye .
yes ,
um , how do you feel about , um , the way the u s has reacted in the middle east ?
well , i was , it was favorable .
i , i just , i think , the sanctions would have worked ,
but it would of taken longer
and , uh , now with all this stuff coming out with woodward 's book and everything .
uh , and then i saw a nightline program last night about all the funding of hussein 's , uh , back as early as nineteen eighty -six ,
so , uh ,   been a different turn ,
and then i don 't think we projected what was going to happen after the war ,
huh -uh .
it got over so fast ,
so , uh ,
what is the woodward book you are referring to ?
well , it just came out , i guess , yesterday .
it 's called the commanders .
and it 's , uh , it says , big story in the paper about it today , bush trying to comment on it , that colin powell was against the , uh , uh , an early , uh ,
he was for sanctions .
huh -uh .
and so it seems like there 's , you know , always some body digging things like that .
but , i 'm not for sure we know exactly what , what all happened in that situation ,
huh -uh .
so , we were so , uh , fast to get over the vietnam , whatever the vietnam syndrome is , that now we 've tied ourselves up there in the middle east for a long period of time .
right .
that was my feeling .
i was , i was very against our involvement so quickly .
yeah .
i just think , i think if we had been very , i mean if we had that good of a correlation through the united nations , then they could have , uh , they could have made sanctions work , i 'm pretty sure .
huh -uh .
huh -uh .
with that much support , you would have just penalized any nation that broke the embargo ,
right .
i think we 're very naive as far as that part of the world is concerned .
we are .
we are , i think , you know ,
in , in , we 've just misread almost everything in that we always seem to be getting in bad with the wrong fellow for the next , next tenure , for the next thing down the road
and , uh , then , we can , and we don 't tend to read israel correctly
so , uh , i don 't know ,
it should be a mess .
it 's , uh , not going to be anything we 're going to get out of very soon .
right .
right .
in spite of all the promises .
right .
they can talk a good game ,
but , uh , being a historian , it 's , you know , you read all that clear back at least to the turn of the century with all the mess after the first world war ,
huh -uh .
huh -uh .
and we just , we 're still , i , i you 're absolutely right ,
too naive ,
we just , if we do find so -called experts in any area of the world , we don 't listen to them
so ,
huh -uh .
huh -uh .
um , i don 't know ,
be , be interesting to keep watching i guess ,
but i 'm just afraid it 's going , it 's going ,
 huh -uh .
huh -uh . 
 to break  us .
and i 'm not sure we 're sensitive to , to other cultures .
not very much in our colleges ,
we 're trying ,
we 're , i happen to teach at a college with a tremendous number of international students
and , and cultural diversity is just something we really don 't understand
and it needs to be , uh , taught from the earliest grades ,
 huh -uh . 
 with  our school systems in such disarray , i don 't know , if that , it doesn 't look terribly hopeful .
huh -uh .
but i 'm not sure it 's something you can teach .
i mean ,
well , you can at least , uh ,
 awareness . 
 give  them the awareness of the different cultures and , uh , you know , have all sorts of , um , at least , you know , let them know what that , that other people do things differently than , than , than maybe in their own neighborhood .
huh -uh .
so , and when , when , when those people are around
and you can get them to meet
and we 're all pretty much alike ,
that 's true .
that 's true .
so , uh ,
yeah .
but it 's , uh , it 's something as , you know , as i said won 't go away ,
so it will be a good topic for me in the class for along time
because i teach history ,
so .
right .
right .
and , um , what about the whole situation with the refugees , the kurds ?
well , i would just think if bush was so successful in lining up the correlation to prosecute a war , then he should be equally successful in getting that same correlation to push the united nations to , uh , uh , somehow persuade those nations to give the kurds a homeland
they were promised that  
but , what about the palestinians ?
well , that 's the same thing ,
they , uh , they haven 't been waiting quite as long , even though they 've been waiting since forty -eight ,
 right .
right . 
 uh , that ,  that becomes a different matter simply because your dealing with israel
and they seem to be more intractable than ever .
huh -uh .
uh , that shamir can 't , can 't retain his leadership if he , if he backs down the slightest bit
so , uh , i just don 't see us , i don 't think there 's anybody of , of major stature on the scene of , like the great statesman of the past ,
 huh -uh .
huh -uh 
 or at  least we thought they were .
i 'm not for sure that they were .
they seem to have gotten us into some of these messes .
huh -uh .
well , do you think the u s should even be involved ? i mean , as the world leader in the sense trying to resolve these issues
or should we have just stayed out of it ?
well , i wish we could stay out of it ,
but the oil is not going to allow us to .
we absolutely need that oil .
that 's the major thing .
if we didn 't need the oil and if we didn 't have the ties with the israelis , we could probably stay out of it .
right .
right .
right .
but i 'm not for sure that we 're not destined , at least for the foreseeable future , as long as we can keep our head , our own head above water , to be the world leader .
so i , bush is probably , if he can keep that correlation together , especially the french , and the british , and the germans , and be sure that the japanese can kick in some of their money .
they may just have to ,
i don 't know what type of pressure they can put on all the nations there , too , because now that the war is over , societies have just about gone back to their own ,
 huh -uh . 
 uh ,  uh , cold selves .
and i wouldn 't have necessarily fought for the kuwaitis ,
they , uh , they 're , nobody likes them in that part of the world
but , uh , it 's just such a volatile area ,
i mean , there 's just no stability , period .
right .
but in a sense , i don 't know that i would say it 's good ,
in a sense i 'm glad that saudi wasn 't more changed by , by the situation
because ,
 huh -uh . 
 i  mean , we really don 't , i mean , i don 't think , it 's our world to westernize the whole world ,
 absolutely . 
 so  the fact that the saudi could just sort of pull back and , uh , remain , you know , culturally sort of clean is interesting .
yeah .
i think you 're right .
i , it 's not our , uh , role to make everybody like us .
huh -uh .
but , it 's just , uh , for those who have , may have wanted to travel in that part of the world that are up in the age i am , it 's going to eliminate that for awhile .
right .
right .
i think it 's going to be too dangerous to be any place in there .
well , you know , i mean , i actually lived in beirut from sixty -eight to eighty -four is echoing to point of distortion >>.
oh , did you ?
and so , i mean , it 's been   dangerous for sometime .
yes .
i 'm not sure that it 's changed that much .
yeah .
well , i , i haven 't been to beirut
but i 've heard what a wonderful city that ,
it 's just totally gone to , uh ,
well , see that 's it .
it really hasn 't .
it hasn 't  
exactly ,
it depends on whether one talks physical or , or sort of cultural .
culturally , i mean , it 's obviously changed a lot .
because it 's more of a  survival city   ,
but the buildings are still intact and still beautiful , you know , you know .
there was garbage on the corner when i got there
and there 's garbage when i left .
but i mean , it 's just a different cultural aspect .
i mean , the trucks don 't come daily
and you really don 't want the garbage in your house ,
so . and , i mean , i traveled in the area , too .
and , um , so that many of the countries turkey and syria are the same as they were for traveling .
that 's one part of the world ,
i 've been to north africa a lot but not , um ,
i haven 't been to beirut or syria or baghdad ,
yeah .
i was never able to go to baghdad .
it was , i never could get a visa .
so even before , so even when things were good in the middle east , americans weren 't really given visas to go into baghdad .
right .
and , um , but it 's , it 's a very beautiful part , very interesting historically , of course , which was my interest   art history .
sure .
so , uh ,
well , i think we 've done them a good job today then .
for this little project they 're doing .
right .
right .
in fact , i just talked to the director awhile ago ,
so , uh , he was checking to see if i was going to stay in because i 've been so busy with this presidential search ,
i haven 't had a chance to ,
 huh -uh . 
 really  do any calling myself .
huh -uh .
i see .
i see .
so , uh ,
then great
and , um , you know , have a good business trip .
thank you .
and you continue  
okay ,
thank you .
bye -bye .
bye -bye .
all right .
in yes ,
i think we 're terribly taxed .
i , i think the republicans have taxed us just as much as the democrats ,
and i don 't think there 's a change between one party than the other .
uh , i think we get a lot back ,
but not as much as we should .
uh , i guess what i feel about it is that it 's so mismanaged that it , there 's got to be something .
 right . 
when , when we pay so much for the , for the debt , instead of using the money for where  it ought  to go , it , it 's just , it 's ridiculous .
what kills me is when they had a chance to , to , uh , put into ac -, action the , the g -, the glen -, rub -,
the gramm ,  the gramm rudman act .
yeah . 
what is it , uh , the act where they had to cut everything across the board  they kept doing ,  they kept putting off doing that .
why did they do that ?
that 's exactly what they needed to do to get their act together .
yeah ,
well i think they spend too much .
they , they spend too much on themselves , too ,
oh , yeah ,
i think so too .
the , the , a lot of the , the taxes gets back to the members of the congress and everything all running for twenty years ,  rather than . 
 yeah ,
well .  things like mailings .
they don 't use any kind of restraint on some of these things .
they just think once they get there that they can do just anything .
no ,
no ,
you 're right .
they don 't , they don 't try to , uh to conserve .
and of course , here at home , we end up conserving and conserving
and , i mean , when i don 't have money , i don 't buy something .
yeah ,
no
i think , uh , it is the congress and them just don 't have any interest in saving us money , uh ,
they sure don 't seem to .
the national debt is terrible .
uh ,
there are a couple of things i think we need to really work for ,
and i don 't know quite how to do it .
but i think we need to have the one line , uh , uh , veto so that they don 't have to spend so much time doing everything .
 right . 
if it 's a good idea  it can  be done again .
 oh , yeah . 
 you know ,  and if it 's not , so what .
at least you haven 't thrown out all the work they 've done for months and months and months and months .
i saw one on twenty twenty about a month ago i guess , whereas one , i think that he was a senator from pennsylvania or something like that .
maybe it was , uh , connecticut ,
i 'm not sure ,
one of the small states up there , where he had a bill through for another , uh , a drug agency that would be located there ,
and he was the only one that wanted it .
was going to cost millions of dollars .
the drug agency didn 't want it ,
and he was going to build it in his home town
and they were going to hire a lot of people ,
and it was ridiculous , you know , the whole thing
 yeah ,
this is , that 's right . 
 and , and , you know , they asked  him about it .
do you really need this ?
this is going to cost a lot of money .
oh yes
we need it .
but do you know that the drug agency doesn 't want this ?
yeah .
and they do things that are , you know , just like  the , uh , 
 yeah ,
that 's  just an awful lot of that kind of thing going on .
yeah
 that . 
 and  the trouble is , you don 't , you have so little input about it .
 right . 
you don 't know  enough  to know what , what to do about some of this stuff .
right .
 i , 
 they 're  supposed to do what we say ,
but they do what they , they  want to do with it . 
 yeah ,
that 's right .
 the other thing about is i think , uh , limiting their time in office would be good .
 absolutely ,
absolutely . 
i , i just  can 't believe there  aren 't other people out there that could do just as well as what we 've got .
we need to get that through .
we , we have said that , i 've said it several times on different subjects about the government that two yea -, two terms is enough for all of them .
yeah .
uh , whether you 're mayor , all the way up , city council , the works , i think . certainly president , that , uh , two terms is plenty .
yeah .
i think  that 's right . 
 and then we get these  professionals out of there ,
 yeah ,
wouldn 't that be  too bad
and they have to learn how to earn a living again themselves , you  know , rather than  living off of us .
well , that 's right .
i think ,
i don 't know ,
i think , uh , people in general ,
 uh -huh . 
the , the , the idea of what you need to , to exist is so outrageous that it 's not  hardly .
 you know , it starts at the courts ,
right .
it starts everywhere until we can 't , we 've just lost control of , of any kind of perspective about what is acceptable and what is not acceptable , you know .
well , it 's so much money
and you can 't even add it up , you know ,
 no ,
you can 't even , 
 that 's why they  think ,
can 't even conceive of what they 're talking about .
yeah ,
yeah .
when you talk about the trillions of dollars on this and that .
 yeah . 
our  national  debt in the trillions of dollars , you know .
i mean it jus -, and , and you just ,
the other thing is , it 's , it 's all very well to give money to help people , other people ,
and i think we need to do that .
but there are , they need to put more limits on them .
 foreign  aid ,
yeah .
they need to  restrain  about what they do .
yeah faintly >>.
foreign aid means to go down to almost zero unless it 's absolutely necessary .
 they , they 've given that away for fifty years . 
 i , i , you know , i think that 's probably ,  un -, unless we can afford it ,
if we pay off the debts then we can give it to people again .
i agree ,
i agree .
you know , i don 't really mind helping people ,
uh -huh .
but you , you need to get rid of this thing that 's , that 's just , uh , eating us up you know , and get things on a , on an even ,
right .
if it were , if it were a family , we 'd be up before the , the magistrate for , for doing all these wicked things , you know ,
but the government does it ,
and it 's all right .
yeah ,
i , i know we 're taxed to death on every , every thing .
i don 't know what 's the best way to do it ,
but , uh , they don 't even talk about that .
they just raise it .
 yeah ,
that 's true . 
they don 't even consider it ,  like you saying  to cut something back , you know .
well , sounds like .
they are at least doing something now , with the , the military , you know ,
they 're cutting some of that ,
but of course , now , you know t i ,
you know  that 's hurting us but although , 
 yeah ,
it 's good to see them  doing some things there anyway .
but t i has gotten a lot of good contracts from the war and everything else .
yeah .
and if they 'll get a lot of programs in the future because of their exotic , uh weapon systems .
well .
but , uh , that 's the only good that i 've seen congress do , you know , and everybody and all the congressmen and the president and everybody ,  uh , 
 i think  we have to accept the fact that whatever happens , we 're going to have to bite the bullet .
and we 're all going to have to do it .
i , it just isn 't fair , though , that when this happens in some places , it needs to all come off everywhere .
yeah ,
yeah .
that 's why i thought , well , you know , this is the time .
they need to put that into act -, into action and show they mean business . that they 've got to cut , they 've got to cut costs .
yeah .
the only taxes i think that are well spent ,
well not the only , but , uh ,
i think the , now i , i don 't understand the present school thing ,
but , uh , i have two daughters ,
one 's in college already ,
and one 's about to be in high school .
but uh , i think that paying for school , schools is the , schools is the only answer really to get rid of crime .
 yeah ,
i think that 's right . 
and so i don 't mind paying for school  taxes even though my kids will be out of it ,  you know .
yeah .
well , i don 't , i don 't really mind paying taxes for , for positive things that are helps , like roads and making sure that , uh , that water is safe , and some of these things .
but , um , you know , it , you just feel like it 's out of control .
 yeah . 
you feel  like  they do not  have control of it . 
 the spending is out of control . 
and that , and so then it just aggravates you , you know ,
you think , i could spend my money ,
i could help the poor people better by myself than they 're doing .
yeah ,
oh , i agree with you .
so it 's ,
yeah .
i , i think that 's a wide open subject what you said .
people need to take a stand .
i think the people will here shortly , uh .
well , i think that 's right .
if they don 't do , if they don 't , if they don 't pull it in and start doing something , i think they 're really going to have to i think .
i think the next time we have an election we need to try to get some of the ones that have been there forever out , too , that , what they did last election ,
and , uh , ninety some odd percent of the same old boys got back in , you know ,
so we need to try to get people to two terms so they respect our wishes , you know .
they 're supposed to represent us .
yeah .
that 's what they 're called but they don 't .
yeah
may , may , may , maybe we can change and get us rid of some of those guys that are in there , guys and gals whatever they are .
yeah ,
in some ways we 're awful lucky i guess .
there a lot of , lot of places where it 's worse than it is here .
i know ,
but it .
but still , you don 't want it to get that bad ,  good heavens . 
 no ,
that 's right ,
 you don 't want to ,
 no , 
 you  want it to stay as  good as it possibly can be . 
 we need to get , try to get hold  of it and , and have it be , things be honest
and , i guess , in the fact i don 't really mind paying taxes .
right .
but i would just like to know that they 're not being foolishly spent . that they 're doing something that 's positive for for somebody .
i don 't really feel like , uh , i don 't really feel like i use taxes very much
i don 't know
 yeah ,
that 's , you 're right . 
maybe  i do more than i ,
 i guess i do .
i use them in the , in roads and lot of things ,
but , uh .
well i think one of the good ones in the metroplex , uh , in the last say twenty -five years or so , maybe longer , they 've built all these dams .
you know , the corps of engineers have , uh , soon as they finish a lake , they 'll go at , get another one .
yeah .
and that we haven 't had , we 've had droughts here in long summers we 've had good water supply ,
and that 's due to the corps of engineers building , looking years ahead and building all these  reservoirs for us , you know . 
 yeah ,
they 've done some good  things .
the state actually did some good , good work on that , in that a couple of years ago .
yeah .
 yeah . 
uh , sam johnson came out and talked to us about that  about  what they had done .
and they , they really had done some good , some good work .
yeah ,
i think anything for water supply like  that . 
 yeah . 
california should do more of that too .
yeah ,
there are a lot of p -, places where they 're in real trouble ,
right .
and and i think it would be easy enough to be in trouble here too , if they don 't take , if they don 't take that early stand .
right .
they just finished joe poole lake over here ,
and they need to start another one .
i think every time they finish one they ought to just have  another  one in line .
 the water 's critical . 
 yeah   that 's probably right .
right .
 the growth is fast enough so that they can 't afford to just dawdle and wait until something til they need them .
well , it 's good to talk to you .
okay ,
yeah .
how many calls have you made ?
oh , about nine .
oh yeah ,
i 'm up to twenty .
are you a t i
no ,
i just , just a housewife .
i just heard about it and  found it fun 
 oh , well , great ,
 great ,
okay .
guess i like to talk , that 's all
well , it 's been some interesting subjects ,
yeah .
right .
thanks for calling .
uh -huh .
bye now
bye -bye .
well , did you get a chance to watch any of the games ?
uh , no ,
i , i just kind of , i , i kind of watch them on the news
and that 's about it .
oh , okay
uh , the , michael jordan 's on chicago bulls isn 't he .
yeah .
what , did he get hurt last night
or ,
no ,
i don 't think so
because , uh , i saw just a little bit of the game today
and he was out there playing .
oh , okay .
although , uh , i , what i saw was at the end of the first quarter ,
uh -huh .
i think he only had like eightch -, eight points at the end of the first quarter ,
they thought that was big news .
oh , yeah .
so , i don 't know ,
but i don 't know who won ,
and , uh , i don 't know ,
who do you normally pull for , the , the mavericks or ,
no ,
i kind of feel like the , about the mavericks the way i do about the cowboys now .
oh , yeah ?
yeah .
uh , just all this roy tarpley stuff
and , and , uh , what is it
their , you know , he got , he 's in trouble again down in houston
and , and , uh , they said the other night his contract is so big that if anything happens to him , you know , if they don 't trade him , they 'll have to pay him off , you know .
so they 're rather have him , except that he gets in trouble all the time and falls off the wagon , and , and , and have some chance of him playing , you know , earning his money .
oh , jeez .
yeah ,
because that 's just dollars right out of the franchise .
sure is .
oh , man .
now i , uh , i , i 've always been pulling for the lakers for a long time .
oh , yeah .
and , uh ,
 they 're consistent . 
 not just ,  not just because they always win ,
uh -huh .
but , uh , when they had , uh , akeem anybody who was old as that playing that well , you know , i just kind of had to go with them .
now they kind of got caught up with a lot of the other players and , uh , course , uh , all the people that follow the lakers and everything out there in , in california .
uh , and it also helps when they were winning
yeah .
well , they play better as a team than anybody else , seems like .
i was , uh , i  always  wondered that , you know ,
uh -huh .
i , i will take a look at the individual score , you know , in the individual stance in the n b a and , you know , they , they have in the paper , you know , like fifteen different categories
and they 'll have , like , a individuals , uh , they 'll have the , the highest scorer , the top rebounders , uh , assists , foul shooting percentages and all that ,
and you go  down  through
and virtually every one of the categories there isn 't , uh , a laker in the top ten
uh -huh .
usually hardly any , any , anybody in the top twenty except for , like , magic and , uh , yet the lakers continue to win .
so , you 're right ,
i think they do really play much better as a team than they do , uh , uh , each one , you know , individually at their spot
but , uh ,
yeah ,
year in and year out , it 's not like they have , you know ,
a lot of teams will , will , will win in the playoffs
yeah .
and then the next year they 'll be all they 'll be too busy doing their endorsements and stuff , to , to concentrate on the game .
well , i understand that , uh ,
i guess boston 's really , uh , giving , uh ,
are , aren 't they playing detroit ?
i think boston 's playing detroit
and i think they 're really giving them a run for their money .
yeah ,
except larry bird 's hurt .
did he get hurt again ?
he , his back is bad all the time now , i think .
yeah ,
yeah .
i tell you what ,
i guess it 's tough to play that many games and still stay healthy .
yeah ,
they play two or three times a week . like , you know ,
and then they go on road trips
and they do the same thing
and , and then they , and then they stay out for two or three weeks at a time .
so , it really gets , you know ,
i mean they 're sleeping in different bed every night
yeah ,
yeah .
and and i imagine that really helps his back .
he ought to have his own bed come along with him , you know
uh -huh .
yeah ,
he said , he said the other night on the news that he hadn 't done any extra shooting for six weeks ,
so , you know , and he 's the one that 's always winning the , uh , the , the outside , the three point shot
oh , yeah ,
yeah .
and he does that every year .
yeah ,
matter of fact , i watched him , uh , on t v , you know , sink , i don 't know a ,
jeez , it was like , uh , uh , thirty five baskets in thirty seconds or something like that from three point range .
uh -huh .
unbelievable .
yeah .
oh , i don 't know ,
did you ever play much basketball ?
not much .
just , uh , just , just playing horse and stuff like that .
yeah .
yeah ,
because it 's , it kind of a violent game .
it really is for a noncontact sport ,
 and they d -, 
 quote , unquote . 
yeah ,
and they don 't wear any pads  
yeah ,
really
i figured ,
some of those guys got pretty funny looking , uh , eye wear .
yeah .
they have to wear goggles because they get hit in the , in the face with elbows all the time .
man .
well , it 's h -, it 's , i was looking in the paper for something on it
and here 's the top n b a draft prospects
and , uh , i mean they 're all the size of football players , you know , except they 're just taller .
yeah .
several years ago when i was up in , uh , cleveland , i was staying at the marriott
and the cavaliers were playing somebody .
i think it was like utah or somebody like that
and , uh , i was down by the pool
and there was all these guys standing around about chest deep in water .
now i wear , uh , contacts ,
and i , i had my glasses on
and i went down there and , and just jumped into the water where they were
and it went right up over my head
and i came up spittering and sputtering for air
uh -huh .
and they were all the basketball players there to play the cavaliers they were all like , uh , like six eight and , uh , you know , six ten ,
and they were standing in water that was like six foot ,
 six foot ,
yeah . 
 you know ,
and  it was , uh , it was funny , i tell you .
i saw , i saw a guy ,
i don 't remember what his name was ,
but he got on the elevator
and he had his swimsuit on
and , uh , he was just skin and bones , you know ,
uh -huh .
it looked like something out of africa and , uh , i made some comment
and , uh , he says , yeah ,
yeah .
he says i weigh about , uh , uh , two hundred and forty pounds but he says it 's not much when you stretch it over seven foot one .
yeah ,
really .
so , you 're right ,
those guys really , you know , the , the big ones ,
i don 't even know how much ewing weighs .
but , uh , he 's got to be way up there .
oh , yeah .
well , here 's a , here 's a guy from l s u , stanley roberts ,
he 's seven feet tall
and he weighs two hundred and eighty pounds .
so ,
god . that 's a , that 's a lot
yeah .
that 's a lot of , a lot of guy coming down on you .
uh -huh .
jeez .
i didn 't even see ,
who 's , who 's supposed to have the , the , uh , the best , uh , draft picks ?
papers >>. it doesn 't even say .
it doesn 't say ,
here it says , uh , it says
yeah .
the under -, this is for underclassmen for june twenty -six and , uh , i guess , i guess they don 't , they have , they , they , uh , have a lottery on it .
they pick numbers
and that 's how they take them in order .
oh , yeah ?
it must not be according to their , how they did during the year .
i used to go down to reunion arena , uh ,
uh -uh .
went down there a couple years on the day of the draft and that was really pretty interesting .
uh -huh .
they usually have , uh , uh , you know , a video , uh , highlights of the season , you know , and basically kind of walks you through what happened to the mavs and who they traded for and how they did and a lot of good footage , both the good and the bad i , i don 't know ,
i haven 't , i didn 't go down there last year ,
but , uh , it , it was only like a couple dollars to get in
and it was really kind of interesting
but , uh , so who do you thinks going to win the playoffs ?
i don 't know ,
who 's going ,
is it chicago and ,
chicago , uh , and , let 's see , uh , golden state and the lakers and , chicago and philadelphia ,
think chicago 's playing philadelphia
and then the , uh ,
shoot , i can 't remember them all now .
utah , portland , boston and detroit .
right .
yeah ,
yeah .
okay .
that 's the n b a ?
n b a playoffs ,
philadelphia was , uh , favored by one point over chicago and the lakers one point over golden state , and detroit by five over , uh , boston
jeez .
i think boston , boston will win .
think so ?
yeah .
i tell you what ,
those guys really hang tough .
uh -huh .
now , i , i 'd like to see them back up there again .
they really , uh , they really gave some , some really good years of , uh , uh , of enjoyment and fun and everything .
have you ever been up there to boston garden ?
oh , no ,
uh ,
well , i don 't know
is that in ,
i , i haven 't really gone to a lot of games live ,
but boy i 'd sure like to .
basketball 's gotten to be a lot of fun .
uh -huh .
okay .
um , do you have any advice for college ?
i 'm , i 'm , i 'm full of advice .
i 'm still a graduate student .
so .
uh -huh .
well , having been there not too long ago , and my wife having only recently completed a doctorate ,
um .
i 'm fairly full of it , of it myself .
yeah .
uh , the main point that i have about choosing where you want to go to school , is that , def -, you have to early on define what it is you want to do or at least what area you want to be in .
uh , i had the unpleasant experience of going through several schools that were very specialized .
i went through a number of them ,
um .
uh , undergraduate schools , before i found a , a good school that was more general , uh , to give me time to make up my mind .
oh , that 's interesting .
i went to a , a liberal arts school , actually , at first ,
and you weren 't really even , um ,
they didn 't expect you to choose any sort of major or anything at all until you were in your second year ,
and then you , you know , you had , i think you had to pick it , by , by , by the end of the second you had to pick some sort of major ,
but until then they didn 't sort of force you .
they , they sort of forced you to run around taking classes in everything until then . certain requirements ,
so that , so that you had to sort of get a general feel for everything ,
so it wasn 't that specialized .
so that ,
that 's wonderful .
i 'm a great co -, proponent of liberal arts education ,
yeah .
for anybody .
yeah .
uh , being an engineer now , i believe in it even more strongly than i did before .
uh -huh .
i was just on a committee recently , actually sponsored by , uh , the american association for the advancement of science , trying to sort of , you know , where , where they were just trying to figure out how to fit science and liberal arts together , you know , because there are people who are getting just wonderful science educations and not getting enough liberal arts ,
and then the other way around as well ,
people are getting pure technical science educations and not getting very good liberal arts sorts of issues .
so ,
well , thus far it 's working to my advantage .
uh , the great gap historically has , with engineers , has been while they may have all this technical information , they have no way of imparting it to , except to another engineer .
uh -huh .
and i have the ability to listen to them and then translate that into something that nonengineers can understand .
well , that must be helpful .
 well , it 's , 
  that could  be very helpful 
a lot of fun , at the moment .
yeah ,
well , i figure that , that , that 's probably the thing i would most tell any parent , you know , to tell their kids , i think , probably
make sure the kid goes to a school where they get sort of a general education
and save specialization , i guess , for graduate school , unless they 're sure they want , early on they want to do something like engineering or something .
or they can ,
even at that , i have a son , that , who 's only nine at the moment .
but i see him very rapidly becoming the engineering personality ,
and , uh , if he decides to pursue that , i 'm going to insist that he spend two years at a liberal arts college , before i 'll even let him go to an engineering college .
um .
and , yes ,
that 'll add one year to his education experience .
yeah ,
but , but that 's a good idea .
well , where i am right now ,
actually i 'm at the university of rochester ,
and that 's a pretty good engineering school , i think .
 yes ,
it is . 
i think  we do some  they have pretty good engineering here .
they also have pre -, a fairly large liberal arts college as well . a sort of , a separate , you know , arts and sciences college .
um , and i believe the engineers are sort of required to take classes in , in everything ,
and i know people , i do , uh , i do work in language processing ,
and , and , and at least one person who 's in my field started off as an engineer , started off as an elec -, elec -, an electrical engineer student , and then switched over at some point into language processing , because he found that he enjoyed it more .
so they do force them ,
people are forced to sort of take all different kinds of classes here , which i think is wonderful .
oh , i agree .
uh , i have the experience , uh ,
uh -huh .
the last school that i went to was mississippi state university which is historically an engineering and agricultural school .
right .
uh , the typical land grant university ,
every state 's got one .
uh -huh .
anyway , while it has both engineering and liberal arts , the engineering students tend to cluster together .
yeah .
you know , they 're in classes together , even when they 're outside of the engineering department .
uh -huh .
and they don 't learn the communications ,
they don 't learn the thought processes of other fields of , of endeavor .
um .
it 's , you know , it , that 's kind of like if i were king for a day , and got to , and got to make one rule .
my rule would be , no one could get out of high school without an entire year of philosophy .
um , uh -huh .
 that would , 
 and it 's , 
be very good actually .
that 's not even true in our colleges .
right ,
you , you don 't need any philosophy at all in school .
uh -huh .
or so -,
yeah ,
or , or , or , or some other thought provoking area , you know .
very true .
we had , uh , when i went to undergraduate , we had uh ,
went to brandeis ,
don 't know if you know of it or not , uh ,
we had , uh , uh , a requirement freshman year of just humanities .
then you were given a choice of , um , you know ,
there were ten or twelve , or whatever , fift -, or fifteen different courses that you could take ,
but they all centered , they all came out of philosophy , english , and literature departments ,
and they were , they were , they were a set of assigned readings everybody had to read , you know for ,
so the first year humanities courses everyone had to read the iliad an , and  so forth , 
 right . 
and what they did do , was they all approached it from , from very different ,
so that you could have one class in the philosophy of something , that the philosophy of greek mythology or something that actually approached this , or , um , one literature , you know , or a , a literature course or , just all sorts of different perspectives on it ,
and people got to choo -, pick and choose ,
but , but by the end , everyone had a good sample of , of , of , sort of how to think about these things nonscientifically , you know ,
and , uh , and that sort of forced them .
but i believe that , that , that you , one of the , one of the best things to do , at least for me in school was , was , i was sort of forced to take lots of different kinds of courses .
um , i was forced to take , i think you know , some sort of art history course ,
and we all grumbled about it at first ,
but then , afterward , we all wound up taking extra art history classes , because it just seemed like something , something we didn 't totally know nothing about , but just enjoyed very much doing ,
 yes , i re -, 
 and something i  would never would have done if , if i wasn 't forced to take it .
uh -huh .
i remember that experience that and , uh , extra music classes .
yes .
uh -huh .
and that , and that really is something that , that i notice ,
like i talk to a lot of my friends at school that are more specialized ,
and they don 't have that .
they just , you know , they went in and took their courses that they were expected to take ,
and that was all .
they never had some of the more fun classes , i guess  
i feel a little more worldly now
well , that will continue to grow even as you go beyond graduate school .
yes ,
i 'm , i 'm , i 'm hoping , i 'm hoping .
have , have you gone straight through ?
yes ,
i , i graduated , um , college in eighty -seven ,
and i just went straight through .
um , i 'm finishing up next year .
so , yeah ,
i didn 't take any break or anything yet .
i 've been trying actually , in graduate school , i 've been trying to do the same thing , take courses , out -, completely outside my area ,
and i 'm finding in graduate school it 's a lot harder , because , uh , i just don 't have the time any more to sort of sit in a course , that i 'm not getting graded for .
whereas before i would just sign up for credit for it , now i can 't sign up for an art history course for credit necessarily .
so i have to try and go myself ,
and i went for like two or three weeks and realized , not enough time for the work unfortunately .
that 's true .
are you pursuing a master 's or a doctorate ?
i 'm pursuing a doctorate in psychology .
so , i 'm just , wind up spending a lot of time doing that instead .
uh , what else .
i , i think  i , 
 well ,  let me , let me encourage you to stop and experience life along the way .
oh .
i , i first enrolled in college in nineteen sixty -six .
uh -huh .
uh , six years , and a , and a war later , uh , i got a degree , an undergraduate degree .
and then fifteen years after that , i got the first of a set of master 's degrees
and four years after that i got another master 's degree .
um . you had real world experience in the middle there .
oh , yes .
and that helped , you think ?
 or that was , 
 it , it certainly  makes acceptance of different ideas a lot easier .
uh -huh .
um . yeah ,
i 'm getting some of that .
um , i have , i have sort of some ,
work experience  
my wife is not an academic at all .
my wife is sort of in the real world ,
and so i sort of hinge halfway out in the real world
and i , getting , you know , real world  
especially she works in , uh , uh , she works in the , she works for a temporary agency , ac -,
and i never would have had ,
she 's the office supervisor ,
i never would have had any , i 've , i 've learned much just sort of by watching her and her , and her business as well .
so yeah ,
so i , i can , i can see where that might be a ,
well , vicarious learning is a wonderful thing .
yeah
it certainly means that we don 't have to experience everything ,
but experience is a wonderful ,
that 's my ,
oh yeah .
teacher also .
yeah ,
agreed ,
agreed .
well , i 'll , i 'll take that , i 'll take that   and think that through a little bit . uh .
my wife , a -, as i may have mentioned , just finished a doctorate a couple of years ago .
yes .
uh -huh .
an -, and she pursued her education along the lines that i did with lots of break in between .
and she feels reasonably comfortable teaching now .
she has an awful lot of experience to draw on .
no longer
okay .
well , i take it since you selected this topic that you have children .
no ,
i don 't ,
you don 't ?
but i have nine younger brothers and sisters .
my goodness .
so . well , i have two daughters
and , um , they 're past this , they 've been latchkey children for a while ,
and they 're almost where i can start saying they 're , you know , young adults ,
uh -huh .
so i don 't have to worry about child care too much anymore .
um , we 're supposed to discuss what criteria we would ask ,
uh -huh .
or expect .
i would assume it 's , you know , if you were looking for a day -care center or something like that .
well , if i were look -,
or probably even baby -sitters would be the same thing .
exactly .
exactly .
um , i think my , my top priority would be that it would be someone who would be responsible and someone that would actually like children .
yes ,
i would think someone older
and i would want to know if they 've had any past experience with children .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
and i think that varies .
i think a lot of your criteria vary with the age of your child .
yes ,
that 's true also .
uh -huh .
um , you know , it 's , it 's , once they get to a certain age it 's almost more important that it 's someone that can entertain your child as opposed to someone who 's , you know , really , really qualified per se .
um , with a , with a baby , definitely have to be someone who knows how to handle a baby and would know how to respond to an emergency .
uh -huh .
so ,
well , um , i did a lot of baby -sitting when i was younger .
i 'm twenty -two now
and i did most of my baby -sitting when i was between the ages of thirteen and sixteen .
but , um , the only thing people ever asked me ,
well , of course , they knew i came from a family with younger kids ,
but they really didn 't ask me if i was used to children or not .
the only other thing they asked me is what i would expect in pay .
oh , uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
you know , and , um , i was pretty surprised because if i had a child and someone , you know , i would want to know , i personally would ask for people that that person has baby -sit for before .
well , i , my experience , i baby -sat a lot also at , when i grew up
and , um , coming from , you know , that background and the background as a parent now , i think the reason that people don 't ask a whole lot of questions is a , a lot of times baby -sitters ,
i know i did this with my children ,
it 's , you get somebody where you kind of know the family already .
uh -huh .
and that gives you so much basic knowledge that you don 't ask a whole lot of questions .
uh -huh .
becaus -, because i had three younger brothers and sisters myself
so they , they thought , okay ,
she knows how to , how to treat children .
yes .
well , see when , um , i first got my mai -, my first baby -sitting job was pretty strange .
um , this lady saw us at church
and she was a you -, you know , she was a younger lady .
she didn 't really know my mom .
she knew my mom by name
and that was it .
and , um , she knew that i was one of the oldest girls in my family
so she just asked my mom if i could baby -sit .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
you know , she really didn 't know my name or anything , you know ,
i thought that was pretty strange .
you know , and she had two children .
one was still in diapers when i started baby -sitting .
wow .
so , um , she pretty much , you know , just assumed that i would know , you know , how to handle them .
so , i wa -, you know , i enjoy kids
and i get along with them very well
so there 's no problem .
but , uh , with today 's world and the kids today , uh , there 's no way , i can 't say that i would just ask someone , you know , that i didn 't know like that to baby -sit .
oh , i agree with you ,
but there again she , you know , she knew , knew of your family ,
uh -huh ,
that 's true .
and she , and she met in a safe setting , such as church .
uh -huh .
so she was going on those two instincts .
just the same i know myself ,
i never ,
and i was very very protective on who baby -sat my children .
oh , i would be too
and , and in i -, it really shocked me
because just about six months ago someone came to my front door , rang the doorbell .
she had just moved in the neighborhood .
she had her daughter with her ,
and the daughter was , oh , about a second grader .
and she was actively looking for people who would baby -sit her child .
oh , my .
and i thought , well she doesn 't know me or my children from anything .
huh -uh .
uh -huh ,
yes .
and it was , i was almost more reluctant of letting my older children go baby -sit for her because i didn 't know her then she was reluctant of letting strangers into her house .
uh -huh .
so , i mean people are so different .
oh , i know .
um , well , i real -, i , obviously you 've never had to look for a day care or anything .
uh -huh .
well , i did , i did have , um , my , my child , uh , in a day care for just a short time a -, when my oldest was about two and a half and i worked just a part -time job
and , uh , in , in those situations , um , what i did is i 'd , i went in
and , you know , i made  a few  phone calls ,
i went in and visited .
i asked questions such as how they would discipline a child .
uh -huh .
um , that was a concern with me .
um , you know , c -, you , you learn a lot by going in there
and they e -, they explain to you , you know , what their day consists of and what their general rules are ,
and , um , that 's , you know , that 's as much as i know .
uh -huh .
you probably could get really good feedback from a lot of other working mothers you know , that have done this over and over again .
 well , 
 but i ,
 go ahead .
how did you stumble upon the day -care center ?
did you just look it up in a phone book
or what was it ?
um , i think lots of people , i , i think i went by location for one thing .
uh -huh .
i think most people do that .
i think you start out with the criteria of , you know , do i know of anything
or do i know anyone who has their child in a day care
and ,
yeah ,
 there is   , i would say most people would probably go by word of mouth .
right .
right .
and then , you know , i mean , even at that you have to consider the logistics of it .
uh -huh .
you know , i mean , you 're not going to take your child south of town if you work north .
yes ,
exactly .
yo -, even if that 's the best one in the whole wide world
uh -huh .
so there , there are just so many considerations .
uh -huh .
then again , did , um , money come into play with it at all ?
oh , money is always a factor in my life ,
definitely .
i 've never , you know , i 've never had the luxury of not having that be a factor . um , even in something as important as day care .
uh -huh .
i know if i didn 't have that stipulation , i would have done things differently you know .
um , montessori school would be something that i would have pursued ,
but that 's always a little bit more expensive than what i could look at .
uh -huh .
um , and i was very very fortunate in that i didn 't have to do that on a full -time basis .
yes .
so , and , and then when you get , you know , when you get into the full -time basis day care ,
good morning .
hi .
my name is jean .
i 'm tina .
oh , where you from tina ?
i live in garland , texas .
oh , garland , texas ,
i 'm in pennsylvania .
oh , my lands , you 're the farthest person i 've ever talked to .
really ?
yeah .
do you work for texas instruments ?
my husband does .
uh -huh .
yeah .
probably most people you talk to do , huh ?
most of them do .
now , i don 't have anybody that works for t i ,
huh .
but , uh my son works for a computer company , the national institute of s -, s -, something ,
i don 't know what
i see ,
well that 's neat .
so , i guess we 're supposed to talk about foods today .
yeah ,
i guess you have to push one , though .
yes ,
uh -huh .
okay .
you ready ?
yeah .
okay .
uh , foods like you would   for a dinner party or something like that .
yeah ,
i guess so ,
it may be interesting , because probably here in texas , we may eat a little differently than you do up there
well , i don 't know ,
my brother lives down  east  of us down there ,
and i don 't think they ate all that much different
oh , really .
uh , i think as long as you plan your basic foods ,
course , for a dinner party , you fancy things up a little bit more .
yeah ,
that 's true .
uh .
well , uh , the thing that i found interesting ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
my husband and i lived up in washington state for awhile and up there , of course they ate a lot of sea food ,
oh , uh -huh .
and that kind of thing ,
and down here , sea food is pretty expensive , because ,
right .
you have to ship it a long way to get it
yeah ,
and it 's not as good as if it 's fresh .
right ,
and , and , uh , and , but here , we eat a lot of like mexican foods ,
uh -huh .
and , um , up there there was no , no place that we went tasted like real mexican food to me .
is that right ?
yeah ,
it tasted like they were trying to do the best they could ,
but it just ,
yeah ,
didn 't taste right .
well , they probably were trying to do the best they could .
yeah .
yeah .
and , uh , down here , we eat a lot more fried foods , i think .
uh -huh .
like chicken fried steak ,
uh -huh .
is a real big thing .
uh -huh .
up there , uh , it was hardly ever heard of
and ,
uh -huh .
we drink ice tea with every meal ,
uh -huh .
and up there hardly anyone drank ice tea
yeah ,
well they do in the summertime ,
really ?
 i think that  tea is big in the summertime mostly .
yeah .
of course , you have warmer weather most of the time .
right .
so , uh ,
yeah ,
it never gets real cold .
yeah .
so , i ,
yeah ,
but when , when we have a dinner party around here , i think a lot of the time a mexican menu is something real popular .
is that right ?
yeah .
i know that , um , i do a lot of planning with our church ,
uh -huh .
and a lot of the times when we get together , well everybody will bring a mexican dish
uh -huh ,
uh -huh
or . and italian food is real big too .
uh -huh .
more like covered dishes for those type of dinners .
uh -huh .
yeah .
yeah .
how about you ,
what is real popular up there ?
well , i don 't know ,
just about anything
oh , really .
yeah ,
we , we really , uh , use most anything .
i , uh , i think   like parties and that though are ,
well , like we had a dinner party here , here not too long ago with a mystery dinner party
oh .
but , basically , we tried , you know , included all the basic , uh , foods that you are supposed to have in a meal  
uh -huh .
your , uh , bread family and your ,
or least what it used to be the regular menu  was followed and   ,
uh -huh .
ham and bake potatoes , uh ,
uh -huh .
uh , something from each , each area that you 're supposed to choose from .
uh -huh .
and , uh , we , we , we ourselves are into the wok cooking ,
you know they been advertising that
and ,
uh -huh .
we 've really been enjoying those , uh , meals .
well , that 's good .
they have a lot of vegetable to them ,
and , uh ,
uh -huh ,
right .
they really are very good .
oh , yes .
i , i love that kind of cooking .
my , uh , unfortunately , i am married to a man and have two children that eat about four things
is he a meat and potato person ?
right .
they .
well , all our family is , is gone .
they are out on their own .
uh -huh .
and , uh .
that probably makes it easier ,
but .
it , it 's much different
and , uh .
yeah .
we find ourselves eating a lot of macaroni and cheese
and , uh ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
 and of course   ,
well , my husband didn 't like that ,
so we , us kids ,
we had five children
and we ate that when he , he wasn 't going to be home for supper ,
right .
 that 's what we had 
yeah ,
well , that 's pretty much what we do ,
if dad 's not coming home , we have macaroni and cheese ,
uh -huh .
or something .
but , they like , uh , spaghetti .
uh -huh .
you know , that 's one meal ,
uh , yeah .
i can fix
and the whole family eats .
but , uh , there are several things that ,
well as a matter of fact , i keep chicken nuggets handy all the time , because .
oh , those always go good .
yeah ,
the children love them ,
yeah .
and , uh , they are real easy to cook
and ,
yeah .
that way , whatever meat we have , if they don 't like it , well ,
and my girls don 't like beef ,
i ,
oh really .
don 't know ,
well maybe .
i guess ,
that 's good the way , way the things are going .
well , yeah ,
it could be , bec -, they don 't ,
i think it 's the texture of it ,
uh -huh .
but it takes more chewing
right .
children usually they like the ham and the hamburgers ,
uh -huh .
and that ,
and it is easier to chew .
right .
right .
so they 're not too much into beef .
uh -huh .
my husband and i eat more beef than we should ,
but at least we keep our chicken nuggets handy for them
right .
we don 't really have , uh , you know , entertain too much .
uh -huh .
i don 't know if you do or not ,
but we , we don 't a whole lot ,
we 're more , once in a while , but mostly family ,
yeah .
  activities .
well , most of the entertaining we do is church associated .
uh -huh .
we have a real tiny little house ,
we don 't have room really ,
uh -huh .
to have people here .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
but , we do get together for wh -, fellowships at our church ,
uh -huh .
and , my husband and i do a lot of the planning in that .
yeah .
and ,
well that 's good .
yeah ,
it is
and it 's fun to , uh ,
i like just having a pot luck meal where everyone brings their favorite dish .
yeah ,
we do a lot of that  take   ,
yeah .
things to church
and our homemakers meet at the church also ,
and , uh ,
uh -huh .
yeah .
that 's what we do mostly , most of the time for that .
yeah .
so , you don 't really include any certain food groups ,
you just bring ,
right .
what you like
that 's right
sometimes you have all desserts ,
sometimes ,
yeah
you have all vegetables
yeah ,
that 's true ,
that 's the only problem with just letting you bring whatever ,
yeah .
you , uh , like best .
but , it doesn 't happen very often ,
usually you get a pretty wide variety
 and you can , you can   ,
uh -huh .
have pretty good meals ,
yeah .
from one of those .
yeah .
i remember one time we had a progressive dinner .
oh , those are fun .
it 's the only time that ever .
yeah
they are .
uh -huh .
but it 's the only time tha -, i can remember that ,
i can 't remember what food it was
i , it might have been the main dish that hardly anyone showed up with .
several people were supposed to bring ,
uh , uh -huh .
you know , each , like , uh , a , an appetizer ,
uh -huh .
and a main dish and a dessert .
and we had tons of desserts and tons of appetizers
 oh , uh -huh
    ,
and , but when we came to the main , main dish plate ,
oh .
there was only like two or three
was there enough to go around ?
well , not really ,
you know we all took real tiny little portions ,
uh -huh .
and , uh , were kind of angry with whoever it was ,
we were not sure who didn 't show up with the food
yeah ,
that 's kind of irresponsible and does upset you , because they are grown adults usually
yes .
and you know they know better .
right .
even if they can 't do it , they can always maybe get somebody else to  cook 
right .
either , either go ahead and fix your dish
or call someone that can .
right .
right .
i know it .
well , that sounds neat ,
i can 't , uh , believe you 're so far away ,
but you sound so close .
they said that we could share , we share ,
it sounds like you 're here in dallas .
a recipe
but , i 'm up at my daughter 's ,
i don 't even have any of my recipes with me .
oh .
 uh , you know   ,
i don 't know if i have anything handy ,
we were just about , we were getting ready to go swimming ,
oh .
and we 're waiting on my sister .
oh , great .
cara , hold on just a second another person in the
as a matter of fact , my ,
they are ready to go .
little one is hollering
well , we probably , have we talked long enough
i ,
i think it probably has been .
okay ,
so i 'll let ,
so , i 've enjoyed talking to you .
oh , same here .
you have a good day .
thank you .
thanks for calling .
uh -huh .
 bye -bye . 
 bye -bye . 
uh , well , let 's see .
how many ,
you said yours are all ,
i mean , that sounds like an army .
five .
oh , lord .
that is an army ,
i came from a family of six ,
and i have only got two ,
and they are , one
well   any number is nice , let me tell you .
well , i kind of decided that single , single children that , that , that 's not parenting ,
that 's a hobby .
yeah .
but ,
it 's not as fair to the children either , i do not think .
well , do not tell that to all my friends .
they are into quality time .
oh .
i am into getting through the day .
yeah ,
but sometimes you can hurt them by having too much quality time too .
sounds as if speaker b is washing dishes >>. well i , i , i can spot a kid who really , you know , whose parents spend every ,
uh -huh .
quality time with them , you know , outside of the work day .
uh -huh .
and when i take care of some people 's kids ,
uh -huh .
you know ,
when they , when they have teachers ' holidays ,
uh -huh .
and that kind of stuff , i will take my friends ' kids ,
uh -huh .
that are usually in day care ,
uh -huh .
and you can spot them ,
you can tell .
because they have no idea how to hang out and mess around .
how to just entertain themselves .
yeah .
yeah ,
yeah .
really .
it 's a problem for any child
and you take one that 's used to being , uh , busy being , having something to do all the time , it makes a big difference .
it 's not a problem for my two ,
they are only eighteen months apart
uh , keeps you busy .
they can find things to do and mess around ,
yeah .
and plot and scheme and everything else .
well , that 's great .
you , did all five of yours complete college ?
no ,
our last daughter , she did not want to go to school .
she 's , uh , but she 's married now ,
they built a home just a couple miles from us .
and ,
well , how did you go about selecting a college , then ?
well , we did not do it right all the time
with our first boy , we persuaded him to start here ,
and i do not always think you should try to make them stay closer to home .
i think the main thing is to , uh , right now , i think the main thing is to look at what they are interested in . uh , and take what they are interested in ,
and then , then start looking for schools .
no ,
not necessarily .
do you think that what they say that they are interested in is , at eighteen is going to be what they are ultimately ultimately graduating at .
but , mike , our oldest boy , i think he would have .
he wanted to go to  embrey rey -, riddle 
and we talked him into going local here first .
uh -huh .
and he only went a few months and then transferred to pittsburgh .
he went to aeronautical , uh , oh , just learning to work on engines and that .
uh -huh .
uh , it has to do with airplanes and everything , which is what his whole life is
and i really wish we would have let him go where he wanted to go originally .
and he would probably be flying , is what he would be doing .
uh , but , but right now , of course , he 's , he 's working for pratt and whitney in connecticut
and they build and rebuild non jet engines .
how about the other four , other three who went ?
uh , the other ones , uh , the second one , she chose , we let her go where she wanted to , uh ,
we did not want her to go ,
but she went to erie , to gannan university . uh , or gannan college ,
i am not sure which it is ,
college , i guess .
uh , she went there two years
and it was more expensive
and she soon realized , you know ,
even though she did not like clarion , she came back and finished at clarion . because , it , uh , saved her quite a bit of money
and she got really the same basic education that she wanted .
uh -huh .
and our other two boys , they went to clarion also . and , uh , did very well there .
and they have all really got , uh , they have all really got really good jobs .
and , uh ,
when they were , like in junior high and high school ,
uh -huh .
i mean , had they , did they have an idea that they were definitely going to go to college and ,
uh , yeah ,
they kind of had that ,
they just expected to go .
daphne never went ,
she always said she would never go to college .
she said , i , i always thought she would change her mind ,
uh -huh .
you know ,
but she did not .
and there 's nothing wrong with that , you know , if ,
college is not for everybody .
uh .
but , uh , it , it does make a difference in your pa -, wage income .
i think it 's what they want out of life ,
because if they get an education and are willing to go where the jobs are , they can make a , you know , a much better income .
uh -huh .
like my kids , they are all making more than my husband was making when he retired from the state .
you know ,  that boggles , 
 yeah ,
i was , 
my mind .
i was making more than , i was making three times what my father was making ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
as an executive in the insurance industry , when he retired .
okay ,
did you go to college ?
yeah ,
you did .
see it makes a difference .
i went , uh , four years to undergrad at university of nebraska at lincoln ,
uh -huh .
because lincoln is where , where my parents live .
uh -huh .
and there really , there really was not a choice ,
uh -huh .
i mean the finances , uh , dictated that you had to go there .
uh . uh -huh .
i kind of ,
i am not going to say i resent it ,
uh -huh .
but i was , well you know ,
uh -huh .
one of the national merit scholarship qualifying and ,
uh -huh .
you know , one of the rhodes scholars kids ,
uh -huh .
and the whole bit , uh ,
my parents did not even discuss with me going to college out of state ,
some place else .
or anyplace else ,
and i just knew that the finances , you know , would not support it .
uh -huh .
if i had known how , not , i am not going to say easy , but how much less difficult than i thought it would be to get a , uh , scholarship ,
uh -huh .
to go anyplace else , i think that i would definitely , you know , have gone
now when i finished there , then i got a scholarship to go the harvard university in boston .
uh -huh .
and that was , uh , i think that was probably one of the best things that had ever happened ,
i mean i was ,
that 's great .
taken out of my element , you know , the homogeny midwest ,
uh -huh .
which is a lovely place to grow up ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
and put into someplace else where ,
people thought differently ,
uh -huh .
looked differently , sounded differently , you know ,
different life styles ,
yes ,
yes .
different life style .
and i think it was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me .
uh -huh .
now my kids , i keep saying that , uh , you know , i would like them to go to the best school that they possibly could .
uh -huh .
and i do not know , you know , what the realities , you know , is going to look like , you know ,
we are putting money away already .
uh -huh .
uh , but i really think it 's important to put these children someplace where , in addition to , you know , them getting an education , they really need a , you know , a socialization away from what they are raised in .
uh -huh .
especially if you lived a pretty insular community
and ,
right .
an upper class suburb of dallas , let me tell you ,
it 's quite a bit different .
it 's very different .
see that 's the way we are ,
we are more of a rural type of an area
and it does make a difference .
i , they say , you should not look at the expense of the college when you are looking .
you should not .
yeah ,
not really .
because , they say that a lot of times you get more help ,
uh -huh .
with a more expensive college .
oh , yeah .
and so , in the long run , if it 's really what they want , you know , they are better off .
now our children all pretty much borrowed for their school .
uh -huh .
uh , we , we did all we could ,
but they pretty much had to borrow a lot of their money to go .
they suggested some sort of a recipe , uh , for , uh , company , for entertaining .
did you have anything in mind that , uh , you 'd like to share ?
ooh .
well , i , uh , just had a christmas around the world party the other night and had some hors d 'oeuvres .
oh .
and i fixed , uh , a crab meat spread that is real good and real easy .
ooh , that sounds good .
what ,
uh -huh .
it 's , uh , it 's like , uh , eight ounces of cream cheese softened ,
and you mix it with one tablespoon onion juice and one tablespoon lemon juice , one tablespoon worcester sauce and mix it and spread it out onto a plate .
and ,
one tablespoon of worcester ?
uh -huh .
okay .
and then you take and , uh , cover that with drained crab meat mixed with one of the small bottles of chili sauce and spread it over the top and spread it on triscuits crackers .
oh , that ,
and that always goes over real well
and it 's real easy .
how much chili sauce did you say ?
it 's one of the small bottles .
like eight ,
i don 't think , uh ,
not eight ounces .
that would be a lot .
well , it 's about eight ounces .
is it ?
it , it ,
uh -huh .
okay ,
this would make a lot , right ?
yeah ,
it would probably make ,
well , it doesn 't make quite as much as you think ,
but , yeah ,
spread it out because you keep the cream cheese kind of thin .
and how much crab meat did you use ?
one tin .
of the flake .
uh -huh .
and drain it real good .
one , one can of flake .
uh -huh .
oh , okay .
have you ever used the , uh , imitation , yet ?
yes ,
i have .
i used it , uh , last christmastime .
uh , what did i put it in ?
i think i just served it by itself .
there 's like a little tidbit with the sauce to dip it into and stuff .
ooh , that sounds ,
i 've tried it
and then i have it here on hand for about a week
and then all of a sudden it dawned on me ,
wait , is this totally imitation
and then i found out ,
i went back to the store
and they said it is a fish product .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
right .
so , therefore , you really don 't have a very long life , you know once you buy it .
right .
i thought , so , you know , they should put some directions on some of these new things they 're making that you really don 't know what the shelf life is .
that 's very true .
you know .
very true .
i had bought a cheesecake , uh ,
and they very nicely put onto the box that it may be re frozen , which i felt was real nice .
oh , that 's a good idea .
yeah .
whose was that ?
it , uh , was , uh , lawry 's , i believe , or lawler 's .
   ,
and i got it ,
do you have a sam 's wholesale warehouse up there ?
it 's real ,
uh , sam 's ,
right ,
right .
yeah ,
okay ,
that 's where i picked it up .
it comes out of chicago
oh .
and they 're very good cheesecakes .
yeah .
oh , that sounds good because that 's great .
that must be the ones that look like they 're packaged for a restaurant .
yes ,
yes .
okay ,
i , i 've ,
and they have , and they have the little papers between them .
right .
oh , hey , that sounds ,
and i think they 're , what , about nine dollars and something .
right .
and it 's something good to have on hand , too .
yes .
yes .
it 's frozen in the first place , right ?
yes .
so , you can , uh ,
it is frozen , isn 't it ?
yes ,
it is frozen .
and then you can re freeze .
and i thaw it
and then you can re freeze it .
and ,
hey , that sounds great .
uh -huh .
that s -,
it was , they 're very good , very good .
and that 's the one thing that i hate to make is desserts .
oh , do you ?
and that 's my favorite .
is it ?
and i really don 't care for desserts that well other than one piece of it .
oh , i love to eat it ,
but i don 't like to make it .
it takes time
and you have to rack your brain ,
and , time i don 't have anymore
that 's the , that 's the thing i hate most about entertaining is thinking of what i 'm going to serve .
uh -huh .
it is .
i , i said i can make it no time .
it 's trying to think ,
and then we just , uh , built a new home
uh -huh .
and i have one of these kitchens that 's the center of the house and so no matter where they 're at , your company can see you cooking .
that 's right .
which is funny .
and your mess
this , well , this is what everyone has said .
they said it 's okay for you because you keep a real neat kitchen .
and i said , yes ,
i decided it looks better in better homes and gardens than it does in practicality .
yeah
right .
but , uh , what i have learned in the , uh , ten months we 've lived here , is it that when i entertain , i have to have my foods all prepared and in the oven with all the , everything through , ready to serve .
right .
because with the open area , you don 't want someone from your dining room seeing your mess , like you said .
that 's , that 's right .
so you have to have the picturesque kitchen , you know , right out of the magazine .
well , i like to have mine all done anyway , because then i want to , i want to party , too .
i don 't want to sit in the kitchen and be putting an olive on something
you 're right .
you know .
and you know the funny thing is , now that i have a large kitchen with a big island and that , i still have people trying to come , you know ,
they 'll come in the kitchen
and i said , out ,
correct
we have the chairs on the other side of the counter for guests .
you 're not allowed to trespass into my kitchen
sounds ,
and it , it has worked out .
right .
but at our point of life we know many of the people we 're entertaining uh , well enough that they know , you know , it 's very much at home type situation .
well , a lot of our entertaining anymore with the couples , again , that we 've known a long time like you , they , uh , we all bring things
and it sure makes it a whole lot easier .
anymore .
well , we even have a better one .
now we decided that we all meet , we have it worked ,
okay .
all right ,
well , i 'm not a big exerciser ,
but i kind of had to start after i had my baby because i wanted to lose that extra weight .
uh -huh .
and so basically at this point i 'm , i 'm a real walker .
i am , too .
are you ?
yes .
uh -huh .
i don 't do that , oh , i guess i 'll call it that fancy type walking where they kind of move their hips , you know , and keep their arms up .
i don 't do that .
i mostly just take a , a walk around the block or with my baby
oh , that 's good .
or , you know , and i have to do that at least once a day . if it , if it 's going to make any effect on , since i have to eat the same as i did before .
i can 't neglect that because of the baby either .
and how old is your baby ?
she just , uh , well , she was premature ,
so she 's about nine months now , though .
goll -, times goes fast .
yes .
well , i walk two and a half to three miles every night .
oh , that 's great .
uh -huh .
my husband and i were on nutrisystem about eighteen months ago and he lost sixty -two pounds and i lost twenty -one .
oh , my goodness .
so we 've decided to maintain our weight , that we will do this exercise walking program
uh -huh .
and we walk our dog every night and go up around the elementary school .
we have a little path that we do .
uh -huh .
yeah .
exactly .
and , uh , except if it 's raining or real cold which it hasn 't been we try to get out , uh , every , every night .
uh -huh .
and he plays racquetball twice a week ,
but i 'm not into that ,
so i think the walking is enough to help us stay in shape and toned .
well , i think that is just wonderful .
now , as far as i 'm concerned , i have several other children
and so , uh , i think at this point to fit it into , to other things , it 's kind of a task .
yes .
you know . uh , it 's not to where i 'm just so freed up that i , i just go , oh , this is wonderful ,
let 's go
right
that 's right .
i know my kids are into sports
and a lot of times , tonight we won 't finish with the football game till around nine thirty
so we will just go out after that .
uh -huh .
so , my kids , luckily , are old enough i can leave them at home alone while i go out and walk .
yeah .
now , does your husband usually go with you , then ?
yes .
oh , see , now that 's really nice .
yes .
because mine 's at meetings sometimes
and , and he 's not really into it
so i have to ,
no my husband never was either until he lost the weight .
uh -huh .
that was his decision .
he had arthritis in his hips
and his doctor said he needed to lose weight and exercise .
i think that is so wonderful .
so once he got motivated , now he 's ready to walk every night .
and our dog has lost a little weight .
he walks every night , too
so , he gets excited when he sees us put on our , our shoes , our walking shoes .
i bet .
i think that 's really , really good .
and , and , you know , i think this , after you 've done it a certain amount of time , it kind of does get to be a routine .
yes .
it 's not ,
making time for it .
like when i first started , it , you know , that was the hardest thing was to get ready and get out there .
but now if i haven 't done it in a day or two or something , i really notice that i haven 't done it in a
yes .
you know . and i like the time because my kids , sometimes they come with me
and sometimes they don 't .
and when they don 't , i , i really notice , you know , how fun it can be when they come .
so , uh , i like to have somebody come with me .
i know ,
i do , too .
right .
uh , i know most of , enough of the people that if anything ever happened i could go to a home around this block area .
so it , it 's not real dangerous ,
but still , i don 't like to go alone .
no .
so
i never do either . even if i have my dog with me .
yeah .
you know , it 's nice to have another person there ,
but
yeah .
you know ,
mostly , it 's my husband
and sometimes it 's my kids .
well , i think that 's great .
i , and , well , sometimes when i , i take my kids to the playground that 's the only other exercise i , i really think i do .
i was on an exercise program before where it was more like an aerobics type thing .
uh -huh .
uh , i found real quick that wasn 't for me .
me , too .
uh -huh faint >>.
i did the dance step when i lived up in michigan
and it just wore me out .
i would leave totally exhausted .
i never lost any weight ,
and i got to the point i dreaded going in .
yeah ,
yeah .
so walking seems to be a good solution for me
and it doesn 't cost anything
right
right .
and it gives me time to think .
so i think , not only does it help my body ,
yes .
but i think it helps my mind too .
so i like that .
uh -huh .
that 's the one time in the day my husband and i can get away and talk without having the kids jump in and
yeah ,
need something
and ,
yep .
they can wait until you get back home .
yep .
well , i think that 's great
well , that 's what i do for
yep ,
that 's all i do , too .
okay .
okay .
okay ,
how 's the weather been in plano ?
basically about the same as what you 've probably had .
yeah ,
this is probably unusual topic to give two of us in the same city .
uh -huh .
well , i don 't know about you ,
but i was really enjoying the cool snap last couple of weeks ,
and i 'm ready for it to come back .
oh , you like the rain , do you ?
well , not the rain so much as the cool , the other mornings when it was like sixty -five when we woke up and sixty -six ,
uh -huh .
and today i know when i got up that the temperature said more like , close , seventy -nine or eighty so i 'm kind of ready for the pumpkin weather .
oh , are you ?
i don 't care for that as much .
no .
you don 't are you a summer person ?
are you ?
i 'm a summer person i like the heat .
well , i have a friend who 's the same way ,
and anything below sixty , she 's just not happy but i , i think what i would miss is the change of seasons and all because i know in plano we really don 't have as many seasons as , uh ,
my husband 's from nebraska ,
and they have more of the four seasons .
yeah ,
and i 'm from utah ,
so , i , i like ,
oh , you 're used to that , too .
the four seasons i just don 't like the cold .
you don 't like the cold .
well , i usually like it about sweater weather ,
uh -huh .
and the problem here in plano is it doesn 't last very long .
it goes from hot ,
and then you get a couple of weeks of that indian summer ,
yeah .
and then it 's cold and i wish it were several months of that .
the thing , the other thing is the , i don 't like the rain either .
well , i don 't either unless it 's like , uh ,
some of my favorite 's like a friday night when it rains
and you really didn 't have anywhere to go ,
and it 's sleeping time .
but if you have to get up and get out in it , i don 't like it either
well , we have several children that are in sports ,
oh , yeah .
and so it always makes their games be postponed forever and ever and ever on , on , and on .
well , sure it does .
that kind of schedule , you really need a lot more sunshine .
i like it better , i think .
uh -huh .
and also the evenings are going to be getting , uh , darker sooner becau -, as it gets cooler .
yeah .
but i did a walk last night ,
and it seemed like it was a little bit hot still .
sometimes when you work up a sweat you need it to be a little bit cooler .
the thing about when it gets hot here is , i don 't like the humidity ,
that part i don 't care about .
well , i agree , absolutely ,
and you know , it 's all relative ,
because i was from west texas ,
and it was very dry ,
and so i thought dallas was awful ,
and i still think so ,
but then this summer we went to orlando for a week ,
and it was so humid there that your , um , all your windows were fr -, were wet every morning .
oh , really .
they had to get the squeejies and clean them off .
and when we got back to dallas it seemed really dry
because it 's kind of like what you 're used to .
but i agree with you ,
the humidity , especially for curly heads like me .
oh , is that right ?
yes .
i do not like the humid -,
well another reason ,
well , i guess i can 't say that it , i don 't like the rain completely .
we have a little garden that we have
uh -huh .
and and so it really helps our garden ,
and , you know , even , i don 't know if that 's because plants are just that way
and they like rain ,
or , it seems they thrive when it rains ,
they just , really ,
yeah ,
i think so too .
uh -huh .
yeah .
i know our grass needs mowing twice as often when it rains but it seems like here ,
i would like it to rain and then be over , and then not rain for a while .
it seems like when it gets stuck in a rain pattern , that 's all it does .
yeah ,
yeah .
well ,
so , uh , but i , i am ready for a little bit of the cooler weather and not so much in the nineties but something like ,
i guess my , my best would be probably sixty -eight when you wake up or sixty -six , and then probably seventy -five during the day .
yeah .
well i like seventies i like seventies okay .
yeah ,
are you , do you like the heat in the summer then when it gets up in the nineties and hundreds .
oh , i don 't like nineties .
yeah ,
yeah .
yeah .
yeah ,
keep it there
you can give me seventies and you can give me eighties and i 'm okay .
yeah .
well , i do , too ,
but when it gets too hot , then it 's , that , i don 't like that i stay in the house because it 's just , it 's just too hot .
i do , too and that was one thing about the year around school that originally we had been sort of negative on it .
but then we started thinking , especially in plano , the weather is so hot in august , that there really isn 't a lot the children can do outside anyhow .
yeah ,
yeah .
static here .
that 's okay
um , i 've , i 've thought about that , too ,
yeah .
and , um , when we take our vacations , we , we do take them in august sometimes so that we can be away from here
we do too .
i think a lot of people agree the same .
it just really gets way ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
when it gets way too hot and we 've been here for several years ,
and we 've been here years when it 's been hundreds
and ,
uh -huh ,
now there have been worse summers .
years ,
uh -huh .
in fact this morning when they were talking about , uh , harold taft , they were talking about how this has been one of the milder of the summers and milder fall ,
everybody seems to be ,
you can tell some of the newscasters when they like the heat , because they 'll talk about it being so gorgeous on those days when we 're melting ,
and you can tell when they talk about beautiful weather some mornings when we 're , it 'll be too cold ,
and they 'll say ,
well those are the ones that like the cold weather .
yeah ,
yeah .
he , he always did such a good job , i thought .
oh , yeah ,
he did ,
he did .
a good weather man ,
it was it was really a shame .
he didn 't go with all the gimmicks that some of them did .
yeah .
anyway , um , i guess it 's ,
it 's kind of hard to keep on about the weather for five minutes
that 's okay ,
they say when you 're done you 're done ,
so .
oh , is that right ?
okay .
oh , good .
yeah you don 't have to wait for them to say cut off your time .
you just say , have a good day or whatever .
well good ,
well , then have a good day .
you too .
and i hope you enjoy the weather this week .
you too .
what is it about , nursing homes ?
uh -, well , about nursing homes ,
yeah .
and , and older people .
uh -huh .
uh , my husband has a grandmother that lives with his mother and they 're just really close here .
and his mother has bad health too
and so i go over sometimes in the day when he 's at work
and i , um , help with her and bathe her and feed her .
right .
and , uh , and i , that 's hard to be a caretaker i really believe .
it 's really difficult to be a caretaker twenty -four hours a day .
oh , it 's very difficult
i know .
uh -huh .
uh , i -, she has alzheimer 's and does not remember , uh , a lot if anything .
uh -huh .
and so she asks the same questions over and over again . which is not un -, you know , unrealistic .
right .
um , and so you just have to try and be patient and answer them again or just answer another question .
yeah .
uh , i , uh ,
 some  nights his mother calls me and says can your family ,
and just bring the kids  in  the family
and just come over and , and visit grandma because she gets very disoriented .
yeah ,
how old is she ?
she 's ninety -two .
uh , my , see my father is ninety -two
oh , i think that 's wonderful .
and still , uh , he and mother still live at the house and drive and and do the whole thing ,
but you know if something would , uh , whenever something happens to one of them then ,
well ,
i don 't know what i 'll do up there .
uh -huh .
i , i just know that too many horror stories about nursing homes
and so ,
yeah .
i was just going to say .
they 're in missouri
and i could , i , i know , i know stories for sure that they just , they , they just , well , they can 't take the proper care of them .
yeah .
most of them .
um ,
and , uh , it 's , it 's tragic that , you know , when people live so long that they , uh , don 't have a pla -, really don 't have a place to go .
yes .
so ,
uh , i think it 's wonderful these , these places that aren 't nursing homes necessarily
but they can go and reside there like little apartments ,
right .
places in between places .
and i like that idea if they can handle it themselves .
um ,
yeah ,
there 's one very close to where my parents are
but , uh , i think it would be nice
but my dad 's the type he wouldn 't want to spend the money on anything .
yeah ,
yeah
so , uh , i mean , he 's from that old depression era
and , uh , you know , it 's , oh , it 's just  blissfull  that they 're both ,
yeah .
able to do everything for themselves .
i would imagine that i 'll , uh , if something happens , i 'll move one of them or bot -, you know , in , in with me .
uh -huh .
so , uh ,
yeah .
but i know a lot of people have said that and then find out how tough it is
and , but i think you 'd have to really ,
nursing homes .
they also wanted us to talk about you 'd have to really check on the , uh on this homes .
but i just don 't know how much you can see when you go for a ,
visit .
i think you just have to drop in all unexpectedly a lot .
uh -huh .
and so many people when they put people in the nurses home , they never see them .
they don 't go and see them .
that 's right .
they never go to see them .
that 's right .
i 've talked to many , uh , owners of places and say that nobody even ,
maybe , maybe christmas .
uh -huh .
you know , um , i , i think nursing homes are , are , um , some are good i have to say that .
right .
but for the most part i truly believe that the parents would be better if they were with the children .
oh , i do too .
um ,
or if , i -, if they could be real , real nearby where they could see them everyday or so .
right ,
right .
uh , because i know governor richards is really upset about what she 's finding in the nursing ho -, homes , uh , regulation in texas
so maybe we 'll get it improved .
uh -huh .
so .
i hope so .
anyway .
right .
you know , it 's , i think it 's very difficult in the first place to make that choice to have them go there .
oh , it 's tough i 'm sure .
oh .
and then if you find out that they are not having good care , you know , i 'm sure that it is just , you know , you 'd pull them out of there so fast .
right ,
that would be devastating i 'm sure
so .
and , uh , and yet if you didn 't feel like you could be a good caretaker i don 't , uh ,
it 's a very , very hard decision i think .
it is a tough decision
and it 's one that needs a great deal of thought ,
uh -huh .
and prior probably .
i think that 's right ,
yeah .
and especially if you 're not a person that is like a medical person maybe or something that the person needs medical treatment .
right .
now i know a friend of mine who had a father , uh , she brought to her home , uh , to live there ,
but he needed the medical treatment
and she had a nursing person come in like three times a week to , to help him out .
uh -huh .
and that might be a partial solution ,
right .
or something .
but , um , i personally am for the trying it at home caretaker part before i think i 'd ever ,
i would hope we could do that ,
yeah .
and then go from there .
yeah .
well , anyway ,
well , i , i think we kind of are along the same lines .
we 've covered a little bit
and , uh , it 's good to hear from you
and ,
good to hear from you .
have a good ,
have a lovely day .
have a good lif -,
okay .
have you faced , uh , elderly care yet , uh , nursing home care for any of your parents ?
unfortunately , yes .
uh , in fact , tonight i had the dinner with , uh , my three brothers and our wives
and we were talking , uh ,
we had a review with the nursing home staff .
my mother 's in a nursing home .
uh -huh .
and , uh , we had a review today
yes .
and a few things we had to do that are part of it that you don 't really like , like , uh making decisions on living wills and extended care , that type of thing ,
so , yes ,
i 'm very familiar with it
and it 's not something that is , uh , you know ,
i never thought i 'd have to go through this kind of experience .
but i guess we all do .
i think sooner or later , uh ,
both my mother and my husband 's mother , we had to end up putting in nursing homes
and they were to the point that they only lived , both of them , about six weeks once they got in .
oh , really ?
and , uh -huh .
and it 's absolutely , i believe that was one of the hardest things i ever did .
uh -huh .
in my life .
i , that , it just , you know , it 's absolutely devastating .
right .
what have you found in dealing with the nursing homes ?
well , they 're not , every , all the horror stories you hear about them i think are true .
yes
uh , we 've , you know , we 've looked around
and , my wife has looked at , extensively at all the ones in the area
and the one she is in now , uh , there 's a lot of drawbacks , a lot of things we don 't like .
but , again , it 's no different than every one .
um , uh -huh .
yes .
and , you know , the cost of it , the , three thousand dollars a month when you think about it , for what you 're paying a hospital for almost the same , well , even not as much care .
yes .
it 's not that expensive , really .
no ,
uh , there , well , there 's a little bit of difference in , in the two between my mother and my mother -in -law .
uh -huh .
and , uh , theirs both ran ,
oh , i think my mother -in -law 's was like fifteen hundred
and my mother 's was two thousand .
then , this has been five years ago .
uh -huh .
and , uh uh , one of the things that , you know , i had discovered is that if they knew that i came in there at all different hours , they got much better care than if ,
uh -huh .
when i started out with my mother -in -law , because she was in there first , i would go certain hours
and they knew .
and if i 'd pop in unexpectedly , i discovered , you know , they did a little bit , they did better .
oh , really ?
you know , uh -huh .
and , you know , a couple of times with my mother -in -law , i would catch something not being taken care of .
uh -huh .
and , you know , would have to rate ,
so i got to where , i knew then when my mother was in that , you know , not to go the same time all the time .
yeah .
because they would ,
and when i was looking for the nursing homes , another thing that i learned , uh ,
we had my mother all set to go into one
and for some reason i just went back , and on my own went around the different floors .
uh -huh .
and , i saw areas that they had not shown me
well , i 'll be darned .
and they did not come across as well as , you know , what they had originally shown me ,
so , uh , we did not put her in that one .
uh -huh .
yeah .
we put her in another one that i , i went a couple of times when they weren 't expecting me and saw , and , you know , was much , uh , better pleased with the situation .
yeah ,
you , you know , this is the whole point .
you 've got , you 've got to shop them .
yes ,
you do .
uh -huh .
i know my mother 's in now , in a unit that 's mainly alzheimer 's and , uh , we 're convinced that she probably would be better off in a geriatric .
uh -huh .
uh , the fact that these people are they 're up and around ,
uh -huh .
but they 're , they 're , it 's reminds me too much of an asylum type s -, situation .
uh -huh .
and it 's very , very ,
does your mother have alzheimer 's ?
she ,
well , who knows .
they call it , uh , dementia .
uh -huh .
and , uh , we don 't know .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i , i mean she does not know us anymore and whether it 's alzheimer 's or what it is nobody really knows ,
but it 's , basically the same .
and her health is not that bad .
although she has gone down , downhill drastically since this , this last ,
well , she had been in a retirement community
and somewhere in the back of her mind she had it that she would live with her children .
uh -huh .
well she , we , we just did not have the capabilities to , to take care of her .
and , uh , but she , she has gone down steadily since she has been in ,
and she 's been in the nursing home now for , oh , i would say about three months .
uh -huh .
and ,
did she know that she was going to a nursing home ?
i 'm sorry ?
did she know that she was going to a nursing home ?
she ,
no ,
as far as she knew , she was going to a hospital .
uh -huh .
and that she could , she could handle a hospital
and we says , you know , mom , if you , you know , if you get a , you get better , you 've got to have the care , the doctor insisted on it , you know , if you get better that you could come out .
okay ,
what kind of car are you going to buy next ?
well , one of the cars i 'm thinking about buying next is , uh , a nice , safe , small car ,
uh -huh .
but , um , uh , the reason being , is we just purchased a van a little while ago because we have a big family ,
uh -huh .
and we use that to get back and forth and haul kids around and so forth ,
and we have another four door car that i drive to work ,
uh -huh .
and i think it 'd be more economical if i were able to   a smaller car and , uh , wouldn 't be , wouldn 't cost much with gas .
that 's true ,
that 's true .
what , what are you looking at ?
well , i 'm really not looking at anything for a while ,
uh -huh .
but you know , when you 're driving down the road you see all these pretty new ones that are out ,
and you think , oh , well , maybe , maybe i would like a new car .
oh , yeah
but i think i 'll be driving mine about two or three more years anyway .
oh , yes ,
oh , yes .
but , uh .
right ,
they are .
well , the cost of new cars recently are extremely outrageous for the  
i sure do like the looks of that new mit -, mitsubishi diamante .
oh , yes ,
oh , yes .
that is a pretty car .
uh -huh ,
that 's pretty , too .
i 'm , uh , i really like the looks also of the new mazda that they have ,
but um , i , uh , you know , the , the costs of a new car and those new models are extremely out of our price range right now .
yeah ,
they get pretty expensive .
yes ,
they do .
the last one i bought , i bought a , uh ,
well , it 's a , it 's a town car ,
uh -huh .
right .
but it was a demo , returned and i got it with like , you know , i think it was like fourteen thousand miles on it and nearly ten thousand dollars of -, less than what the list price was .
well , you can 't go wrong with that kind of opportunity .
so i was really pleased to find that ,
and i then , i bought it for cheaper ,
yes .
i was looking at a honda accord , a brand new one and i bought this , uh , the , the lincoln town car for just a little less money than what i was going to buy the new honda accord .
wow .
well , you get a much bigger , better comfortable ride .
yes .
and the thing about it is they give you that ten , uh , that hundred thousand mi -, mile , five year warranty where it only costs you twenty -five dollars to have anything repaired .
well , that 's fantastic .
that 's real , real good .
so , uh , i have really been impressed .
i said , i probably never be able ,
to find another one that i can afford , you know .
no ,
do you ,
but i have loved this car better than anything i 've ever driven , because you can go on the road and get there
and you 're not even tired .
very comfortable , smooth ride , huh .
and it gets like twenty -six miles to the gallon on the road .
oh , it does ?
it sure does .
that 's , that 's unbelievable for that size of car .
i , they kept telling me that ,
and i thought they 're crazy ,
yes .
so the week after i got it , well , actually before i signed the papers on it , i took it over to boozier city and it did it .
wow .
that 's great .
but it 's , uh ,
that 's great .
that kind of gas mileage , uh , we 're , we 're kind of hoping for on our van .
yeah .
well , that 's kind of what we 've always been told , you know , they 'll do ,
and then we hope for it ,
uh -huh .
and it never happens but it really , it does get good gas mileage .
well , that 's excellent .
most of the time when i don 't go anywhere i can drive it for like three weeks from to and from work , you know , and then fill it up ,
so .
uh -huh .
do you , uh , do , does it , uh , need a lot of repairs ?
is it a very reliable kind of car ?
i haven 't had anything ,
i 've taken it in twice for like just really minor things ,
and it cost me the twenty -five dollars .
the , uh , really something really silly when we first got it ,
we couldn 't get the light ,
yes .
yes .
they have all these lights in the car and it has this fancy little light that gives you a reading light for the passengers in the back seat and we couldn 't get the light to turn off .
um .
and we kept trying , you know ,
and we went out to dinner with some friends ,
oh dear .
oh dear
and it stayed on all night , you know just shining right down on them , you know and we couldn 't get it to turn off ,
and the next day my husband goes out there
and he tries to get it off ,
uh -huh .
we turn the knob , you know , in the front that 's supposed to turn the lights on and off
uh -huh .
and we turned everything we could ,
and he took it in ,
and they said , you know , you just have to press the switch .
he says , i 've pressed every switch in that car ,
and i can 't get the light off ,
it 's broken .
yes .
so they took it in and charged us the twenty -five dollars ,
and they called and told us though , that all you have to do is turn the off switch ,
and they showed us where the switch was .
they charged you twenty -five dollars just to tell you that , huh .
they , they thought there was really something wrong with it when he told them he had already done the switch .
uh -huh ,
oh , so they probably went through the ,
but he hadn 't , he hadn 't done the right one .
i see
uh -huh .
and it 's right on the arm rest in the back and we didn 't know it was there .
oh , okay .
and found it right away .
and the guy hit it with his arm when he got in the car and so we thought , you know , there , there was , it was broken .
uh -huh .
but we 've had just , uh ,
i guess it 's been in two times .
i 've had it three years now .
yes .
and , uh , it 's been in two , maybe three times .
but it 's just been real minor things .
well , i think that , uh , you have an excellent deal then ,
that 's right .
uh -huh .
and the , the company is able probably to offer that kind of warranty on the car because they know it 's so well built that they don 't expect any kind of major repairs whereas with an awful lot of other lower quality cars you would be getting repairs after repair after repair and those companies wouldn 't be able to afford that for that kind of extended warranty or warranty at all ,
so .
that 's right .
but it 's really , it 's been an enjoyable car .
yes
like i say , i 'll probably never be able to have another one , because i think we bought it for about sixteen thousand , you know and i said , i 'll never find another one for that price .
no ,
not at all .
and they keep going up ,
so i 'll have to enjoy it ,
okay
on a scale of one to ten where do you stand and why ?
well , i guess i stand on , uh , on , probably ten for no , uh , restrictions .
i , uh , recently just moved to texas from , uh , south dakota and nebraska ,
and i guess in terms of gun control i 've always , uh , been raised with the , uh , idea in the constitution that , uh , citizens had a right to bear arms ,
and i realize that probably way back when when the constitution was written it probably regarded , uh , more , uh , of a national defense , uh , than anything else ,
yes ,
true .
but , uh , on the other hand , too , uh , people then , uh , needed to use firearms for , um , survival in terms of , uh , food and , uh , i was raised , uh , you know , hunting all the time ,
i lived on the farm , and , uh , you know , enjoy hunting
and i guess i have , uh , some problems with , uh , being restricted to , um , owning a gun for , you know , hunting purposes mainly .
right .
and , um , it scares me a little bit to think that they would begin restricting gun control to the point where , um , eventually we may not be able to have that right any more .
yeah ,
i can , i can understand that .
i was raised in oklahoma ,
and of course , being oklahoman and texan , uh ,
yeah ,
the hunting and everything ,
and i used to   things in my father and my husband having guns and all ,
and i , i did , used to be all in favor of it ,
but it 's , all of a sudden it 's starting to get really scary with these gangs .
yet i think i would vote a one if i thought that it would be nation wide and they can guarantee no one would have a gun , no crooks , nothing .
but because i know that 's not going to happen , then i have to probably right up there about an eight
yeah ,
it , uh , moving to this area , of course it happens everywhere ,
but , uh , i guess we 're pretty naive coming from small towns , uh , in the midwest and then , uh , moving to a larger city where there are drive -by shootings
and , uh , there seems like killing for no reason at all ,
and , uh .
well , it just seems like in the past three or four years it has just gotten so much worse than it was .
there 's always been a certain amount of crime in your , you know , your urban areas ,
and i know we lived in chicago for seven years ,
and of course it was definitely there .
so when we first moved here , it wasn 't as bad as this .
it 's , you know , it 's just getting all of a sudden so much worse .
i don 't know whether it 's due to the drugs and the , uh , drug kings that are here and jamaican drug kings coming in .
i don 't know whether that 's it , or street gangs .
i don 't know what the answer is .
i know that it 's scary ,
and yet i hate the government constantly telling me what i can do and what i can 't do ,
and that 's basically what the gun control would end up being .
i , i think so ,
and , and there 's always the , uh , the , uh , the old , uh , saying that keeps coming up that if a person wants a gun bad enough they 'll , they 'll get one ,
and , uh , and then , uh .
well , it 's very true .
yeah .
it 's not the law abiding citizen that , you know , is , is dangerous with the gun
it 's the ones that are going out and stealing it .
yeah .
and i said i think the only way i would be in big favor of gun control is if they could absolutely guarantee that nobody would have them .
and i think that would almost have to go with armies , too .
i mean , they 'd have to be almost world -wide , which we know would never ever happen .
yeah ,
yeah ,
that 's for sure .
because even if you said , okay ,
you know , armed forces could have them ,
some idiot would come out and sell it to somebody on the street to make a quick buck .
yeah ,
and , uh , and , you know , uh , i suppose , uh , years ago , way back when , uh , when , uh , they had the revolutionary war and people decided that they , uh , were fed up with the government , uh ,
and if they didn 't have a way to , uh , to fight back they would have been in big trouble .
that 's very true
very true .
who knows ,
we maybe want to overthrow the government
well , the way things are going .
i know ,
if somebody doesn 't do something .
uh , what about , uh , what do you think of this , this , uh , law that they 're putting into effect that you have to wait x number of days before you can , uh , carry the gun , or buy , you know , actually purchase the gun ?
well , you know , they introduced some gun control back when i was a teenager , i believe , in terms of , uh , every gun you ha -, bought had to be licensed , i believe .
yes .
and , uh , you know , that didn 't bother me , uh , too much ,
and so , i guess it depends , um , if there are some statistics that show that , uh , that people , uh , commit crimes on the spur of the moment .
okay ,
uh -huh .
uh , i guess our topic is about movies and , uh , what is coincidence ,
we got a baby -sitter
and we went to the movies that past weekend .
oh , so did i
and we saw cape fear .
oh , i heard that was excellent .
it is .
is it ?
it 's really good .
uh , i wanted to see that
i was deciding between that and , uh , my girl
and , uh , my boyfriend and i went to see my girl .
oh , how was that ?
oh , it was excellent .
it was a really , really good movie .
i 'd recommend it .
i heard that 's , a movie that , uh , you really can 't take children .
is that true ?
uh , i heard the opposite that , uh , you should take children to see it .
oh .
uh , there were quite a few , uh , kids in there with their parents .
oh .
yeah .
uh , i don 't know , though ,
i , i 've heard that , and then what you just told me
so ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
because , uh , the little boy dies .
right ,
yeah .
yeah .
it was sad .
it was really sad .
oh .
oh .
but , uh , his , it kind of shows how his , uh , best friend , this little girl , deals with his death and how , i think , maybe , how children should deal with death .
oh .
maybe .
uh -huh .
but , it was really good .
it was sad , very sad .
oh , i want to see that one .
well , cape fear was , was more suspenseful .
yeah .
it was really suspenseful .
so that , that 's , that 's a real good movie to see .
i heard it was , uh , sort of like , uh , not , uh , too violent ,
but it was kind of like , uh , gross , kind of like , uh , silence of the lambs , like .
uh , no ,
and it , uh , it was kind of ,
i don 't know ,
it 's kind of both , i guess ,
but it 's not , it 's not as bad as silence of the lambs .
oh , really ?
but , uh , it 's just as suspenseful , i think .
oh .
and it , it was a real good movie .
and then we saw beauty and the beast
oh , yeah .
because we have two kids .
uh .
and fievel goes west
oh , i 've seen , uh , previews for them on t v ,
but i ,
but , uh , those were , those were okay ,
yeah .
so , and then , oh , boy , it 's been , it 's been so long since we 've been to the movies ,
but i , we 've rented some videos .
oh , yeah ,
i like to rent movies , too .
oh .
and i think the last one i rented was , uh , mortal thoughts with demi moore .
oh , i , i didn 't see that .
and , uh , that , that , that 's okay .
that 's pretty good .
yeah .
oh , and , uh , what about bob ?
yeah .
i have seen that at the theatres ,
yeah .
yeah ,
we rented that one .
that , that was cute .
and , uh , uh , i guess that 's about it .
have you rented any movies lately ?
uh , the last movie i rented was the hard way with michael j . fox
and , uh ,
oh , yeah ,
that was good .
we rented that one , too .
yeah ,
i liked that .
i like michael j . fox a lot .
uh -huh .
yeah .
he 's one of my favorites .
yeah .
i like his movies .
so , do you go to the movies often ,
or ,
no ,
not too often .
uh -huh .
i , i hadn 't been to the movies for a really long time since last weekend .
but , uh , there 's been movies out that i 've been wanting to see .
i just , you know , don 't get a chance to get out and see them .
yeah ,
yeah ,
well , we have two little kids ,
so it 's hard for us to get out and go to the movies .
we have to dig up a baby -sitter
oh i see .
and and that 's only the only time we can go out ,
so our time is scarce .
yeah .
oh .
but , uh , we , we , we t -, we , you know , we 're , we 're big movie people
yeah .
and we try and do
and i don 't , i don 't know about the last movie i 've seen on t v that was real good . uh ,
oh , i watched that movie with , uh , barbara , uh , uh ,
what was her name .
oh , bar -,
that , uh , her sister got killed
and , uh , she had a baby .
the husband was a dentist
and he had murdered her .
oh , yeah ,
uh ,
that was , that was pretty good .
bertinelli , or what 's her name .
yeah ,
uh -huh ,
oh , valerie bertinelli .
i can 't ,
that 's it ,
yeah .
yeah ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
yeah
yeah ,
that was real good ,
i saw that one , uh , two part series ,
and i heard it was a true story .
yeah ,
uh -huh .
yeah ,
i think that was probably the last movie i 've seen , too .
yeah .
and , and then i saw that other movie about , uh , mother , daught -, mother , wife , murderer .
did you see that one ?
oh , uh , with , uh , judith light ?
yeah .
uh ,
did you see that one ,
that was , was really good .
that was supposed to be a true story , too .
yeah ,
i did see that .
yeah ,
i did .
that was on a while ago , wasn 't it ?
yeah .
yeah ,
i saw that .
guess a couple weeks ago or something like that .
yeah ,
that was pretty good .
i ,
boy we have we , we see all the same movies .
yeah .
i like , uh , the true stories .
yeah .
they 're more interesting .
uh -huh .
and it 's hard to believe that , you know , this really happened .
i know .
some of them are pretty bad .
yeah ,
yeah .
but ,
huh . well
we sure do have a lot in common .
yeah .
if you 're ever in town , we 'll go see a movie
okay
but , and we don 't really ,
d -, do you all have , do you all still have drive -ins up there
or ,
yeah ,
uh -huh .
yeah ,
do you have them there ?
um , well , we may have just a couple over here .
okay brian .
hi ,
how you doing kevin ?
fine , thanks
good ,
good ,
glad to hear that .
i understand ,
are you a total banner ?
total banner ?
yeah .
no ,
i , i believe that , uh , the american public and i , as an individual and private citizen have a right to , to bear arms and to have a gun as long as i , uh , am responsible with it and protect the safety and welfare of my kids
and , and so that they 're not playing with it and so that they can 't hurt themselves or anyone else playing with it .
i think that education with a gun is , is critical and important .
uh , however , i do believe that , uh , guns ought to be maintained and , and controlled that you can 't go out and just buy one off the corner and do whatever you want with it because people that are angry or have concerns or want to seek vengeance right away have easy access to guns
and in the heat of the moment , they can go and do some damage that can hurt themselves and other people ,
so on a scale of one to ten , i , i think i would rate myself as a , in the six or seven or eight .
okay .
but , i think that there ought to be some control ,
but i still think that , uh , individuals have a right .
how do you feel about it ?
well , so , let me make sure ,
so you think that , uh , maybe a five day waiting period for handguns or that stuff would be legitimate ?
well , i don 't know if a five day waiting period would be legitimate .
uh , that , uh , that might cool down some tempers .
i think a , a one day would be sufficient .
the reason i say that is there is an awful lot of people who go to gun shows
and if you see an awful lot of exhibits and things and if you would like to purchase a gun , if that five day waiting period were in effect , you wouldn 't be able to purchase one at that gun show .
uh , you just , you would be able to buy it ,
but they 'd just have to mail it to you , i suppose , huh .
well , i don 't think you can mail thing , guns through the mail .
i don 't know .
oh .
okay .
i think that 's a , against the law ever since kennedy was assassinated
oh , yeah ?
so , how do you feel about guns ?
let 's see ,
i think that gun control has come up because there has been some crazies that killed people with guns
uh -huh .
and i think that 's the problem that we need to address is why these people want to kill other people rather than the instrument they particularly used in the assault whether , you know ,
well , do you think that there will continue to always be crazies ?
sure .
then , uh , how do you propose that we prohibit those types of individuals from gaining access to guns ?
well , we have some laws on the books that , uh , don 't allow convicted felons to purchase guns , if i understand correctly .
and , uh , i would agree ,
a , a short waiting period would be appropriate to , uh , take care of the heat of the moment type things ,
uh -huh .
but uh , i think banning semiautomatic twenty -two rifles is a , a bit on the extreme side .
uh -huh .
and a total ban on guns would just leave guns in the hands of criminals who don 't care what the rules are anyway .
okay .
do you , uh , do you feel there is a need in the world today to have a , an automatic handgun ?
the only purpose for handguns is to shoot people , in my opinion .
o -, or you could do it just for fun , you know , kind of like a game ,
but , uh ,
well , i think that the , the police , uh , or law enforcement have a need because of the tight quarters they might find themselves ,
but , the public , i don 't know .
i think that i should have a right to own a handgun .
uh -huh .
not a automatic , semiautomatic .
yes ,
not an uzi
no ,
no .
uh , but i think a person needs a way of defending themselves .
uh -huh .
you saw indiana jones ,
the guy came after him with that big knife .
yes .
and just , he took care of it ,
just one shot .
yes ,
that 's true ,
and he , uh , saved himself in the , in the , in the process also .
that 's right .
so how is work going ?
very fine ,
very ,
they don 't let you take guns to work , do they ?
no ,
they , that 's , uh , that 's prohibited where we work .
uh -huh .
although down here in texas , uh you do have a right to , to wear and carry arms with you at all times .
that 's still that 's still , you can still do that down here .
can they be , is it concealed ,
or does it have to ,
oh , you can 't ,
no ,
has to be on the hip ?
it should not be concealed .
it has to be on the hip
can a s -,
has to be in sight so that , uh , you know , that you 're not , uh , a menace or a problem to individuals .
how about where you live there in utah ?
okay , howard ,
what do you think of our space budget
and should we go ahead and , and keep exploring ,
or should we call a halt to it ,
is it doing any good ?
i think that the space program has done a lot of good for the country .
uh -huh .
now i think what , we made a major wrong turn when we went into the , uh , to the current generation of space craft , the reusable ones , like they are now because they have not proven as reliable as they should have ,
and i think some of the earlier approaches were much more , uh , much better in many ways .
however , uh , you know , we 've gained an awful lot from the space program , all the way from remote monitoring to teflon to , uh , some new space age materials , plastics and all that .
so i think it 's been a good investment .
oh , really .
 oh , yes . 
uh , somebody was telling me the return was about twenty -five or thirty dollars for every dollar spent which is amazing for any governmental financed  program . 
wish our post office could do that
i wish the post office would just stop raising our rates .
that 's right .
i wish they 'd just deliver stuff .
i think , though , that now that we 're finally starting to get over the fears and the , uh , oh , i don 't know , the guilt that we had out of , uh , challenger ,
 uh -huh . 
i think maybe  we can  pick up and go on now .
but , i , i don 't know .
i don 't think we really have all of our act together yet as far as clear objectives .
 i agree . 
 i agree . 
 the space  station 's where we should go  at this  point .
seems like that we 've kind of gotten side tracked with putting all these different things up there to monitor
and , you know , you know , and i 'm in favor of , you know , getting closer to seeing certain things ,
but i 'd like to see them also go , you know , go back up there , see , you know , what they can do . see about setting a space station up .
i 'm all in favor of the space program ,
and i don 't think we should stop ,
and i don 't think we should cut the money .
well , where do you think we ought to go with it ?
uh .
you talking about , uh , uh , a fully manned space station that we 'll keep up there ?
yeah ,
i would like , i 'd like to see that .
i 'd like for us to really find out more about the actual universe and get up there and see what 's going on , even if , you know , there 's no life up there or anything , you know .
but who knows .
and i would like to see them do something like that .
 well , 
 i ,  i hate to see them just , you know , keep getting diverted off to spying on other nations and putting up defense things
and , i think they , i think they lose sight of , of probably what they 're supposed to be doing .
well , i think about half the nations now are , are military related , are they not ?
yes ,
yes .
and , uh ,
i believe they are .
it seems like it 's that high a percentage .
you know , let 's go back to our original thing with , you know , our experiments and all the , you know , our actual exploring of space and , and all that ,
and , you know , with , with russia , uh , seemingly not going to be as big a threat .
well , it can 't afford to
huh -uh , you know .
have you gone out to , uh , fort worth to see the space , soviet space exhibit ?
no ,
we were talking about that this weekend .
we , it 's only going to be there a couple of more  weeks . 
 uh -huh ,
  uh -huh . 
 we need  to go .
we went , uh ,
we took our grandsons and went , uh , the weekend before last ,
and it is marvelous .
i mean , it 's really neat how they , they have done it .
they have done a beautiful job .
have they ?
and they have a , uh , scaled down model showing how they , you know , fuel it , or , you know , how they , uh , oh , the fuel trucks and things run out there to it and how they , uh ,
all the things that are against the actual space mission , uh , space ship , you know , how they fall away from it ,
oh , yes .
and the loading of it and then it 's actually , you know ,
the smoke comes out like it 's taking off .
it is really interesting .
well , maybe i need to run out there this weekend .
you really do .
it 's , it 's well worth the time and effort .
we went , uh , early on sunday .
we got out there about , uh , ten , ten thirty ,
 and the , 
 now do  you have to have tickets ahead ?
 excuse me . 
 no ,
we  bought tickets there ,
and if you have children , if you go to mcdonald 's , you co -, they have coupons , or did have .
now they may be through with them now .
but , uh , buy one adult
and one child gets in free .
oh , okay ,
 oh , okay . 
um , i think both of my kids are too old for that  they 're both ,  uh ,
you have teenagers or something .
yes ,
 yes . 
 yes ,
well i had grandchildren so , three of them , so between their mother and their grandfather and i ,
because their dad was at work
did you ,
and , uh , but , and the boys loved it , you know ,
they really did like it .
it 's very impressive , i 'm sure .
uh -huh ,
it is ,
and i felt the , uh , six year old would , you know , that he 'd be kind of bored ,
but he wasn 't .
uh -huh .
even the three year old enjoyed it because they had one , had one of those moon vehicles and had it so it looked like it was on the moon , and showed it moving around and stuff .
so it was really neat .
well , see , that 's something else .
the russians have had space stations , manned stat -, space stations for years now .
 uh -huh ,
 uh -huh .
right .
you know , they had the  merv  and see we 've yet to keep anyone up over over a week or ten days .
well , in going through it , i got the impression that actually they were farther ahead ,
they 're talking about , uh , federal government , aren 't they ?
i 'm sure ,
well , actually probably any government ,
yeah .
but the federal one 's the big one
so , uh , so what do you , what do you think in the short term we should be doing to , to improve it ?
well , i saw a program on , uh , recently ,
and , and it said every time they cut , you know , like fifty -five million dollars on a certain thing , then they brag about how much money they cut ,
right .
and then they go and spend that money somewhere else and that 's why the budget is never balanced .
right .
the gramm rudman act didn 't solve the problem .
they just take all the money that they say they cut
yeah .
and they spend it somewhere else or they , you know , they pad out their staff , or , you know , spend it in bounced checks at the ,
commissary ,
or .
uh , yeah ,
i 'm getting pretty , kind of disgusted with the , uh , uh , you know , the fact that they 're counting a reduced deficit as being some big step .
right .
i mean , first of all , we were , we 've already hit the largest deficit , this proposed budget has the largest deficit ever ,
and , two , a deficit is , i mean , the deficit is only , uh , is , is as far from a balanced budget ,
you reduce the deficit ,
you , you 're still not , you 're still not , you 're still overspending .
uh -huh .
right .
i mean , it 's just the amount that you 're overspending ,
and this is , you know , for some reason , the way that the reporting is going on now ,
it seems like , like the goal is to reduce the deficit to some , you know , still outrageous amount , um ,
yeah ,
i , i , i think in the long term something is going to have to be done with , uh , sort of the , the , uh ,
well i mean , it seems to be kind of inherent in the political process , right , that you 've got , uh , people , you know , trying to , trying to corner money for their state or for their constituents so that they can get reelected .
uh -huh .
and , uh , there isn 't any sort of overall accountability ,
and , and , uh , i don 't know ,
i , i suppose that , that , that the only kind of solution ultimately that we 're going to have , is , is , is exposure and information .
and i don 't know that in general the american people are that interested , you know , to listen to , to as much , uh , uh , you know ,
uh -huh .
i mean , you 're going to have to know what people are doing , and , uh , you know , and how , and how , how partisan and how and how self -interested their , their motives are and , and take it to task for it , because it 's not going to get solved , you know , if people are still trying , you know ,
like you were saying you say , you know , hey , we just , you know , we just cut defense ,
let me grab some of this money for my state now ,
and then we can throw in some highway bill ,
or you can throw in some , you know , some other kind of thing ,
and , uh , it 's a pretty vicious , uh , vicious cycle .
i don 't know .
well , i think they should , they should limit the senate to one term , one six year term .
that 's ,
yeah ,
that 's being batted around .
i , uh , my , my dad was always a pro -, proponent of that .
uh -huh .
he , uh he felt that that would get people involved who were , who were interested in being public servants as opposed to personal servants .
right ,
and , and don 't let them come back ,
uh -huh .
and , and , uh , keep congress to , um , two terms of two years a piece and then it 'll be overturning
right .
right .
and they won 't have the same people there all the time and then , all the special interest groups will have to renegotiate all of their their payoffs and kickbacks
and that 'll keep them busy enough so that they won 't have as much influence .
uh -huh .
because that 's one of the things , one of the biggest things is that , uh , the fact that they 're always trying to lean somebody toward one way or another , whether it 's the oil companies , or the automotive companies , and like the air bag thing .
the air bag came out , what , twenty years ago .
right
and only now they 're getting that put in cars .
uh -huh ,
yeah .
and the oil companies are , really aren 't responsible , you know .
the valdez proved that ,
and then the government doesn 't jump on them hard enough to make them do anything .
right .
it should have been done immediately .
yeah ,
yeah ,
i think , i think that that 's probably right ,
because in terms of long term , you just got to get people , um ,
uh -huh .
i mean , uh , at one point , at least on a local level , um , going into politics is , you know , what you 're doing is , is really trying to serve the community right ,
i mean , you don 't expect to make any money out of it .
you know , maybe you gain a little bit of local fame ,
but , but it 's , uh , you put in a lot of work in exchange for that .
right .
and i don 't have the feeling that national level politicians are , are at all like that .
no .
they listen to wherever the money is .
yeah .
right .
and , uh , you know , i think that , that , that the problem with having , you know , junior people coming in all the time is that you end up kind of wasting a lot of time with , uh , you know , with in -, inept politicians or people who don 't know how to deal with it .
yeah ,
they 're not as efficient ,
that 's for sure .
but on the other hand , maybe that 's ,
okay .
all right .
uh -huh .
um , we have small children , two and four and so we , our dining is very limited
i bet you 're mcdonald 's fan .
oh , we 're past that now .
we 're a little sick of that
are you ?
gosh , where do you go , whataburger ?
no ,
um , we 're more
like , um , you know , like wyatt 's cafeteria .
oh is that right ?
yeah ,
that way .
and the kids just love everything that 's there ,
so we 're pretty fortunate .
kind of , um , buffet style ,  uh ,
 yeah ,
that 's , that 's good . 
so you can  go in and go out
and the food 's already served
and you don 't have to wait ,
and it 's already in front of them when you sit down ,
and things like , um , souper salads , you know ,
it 's , again it 's buffet ,
and it 's already prepared
and just things , any , any eating area that you just don 't have to wait an extreme amount of time .
i can understand that .
we ,
we got , we got three kids , too ,
and when the kids are small , if you going to wait , you don 't go out .
no
they won 't put up with that .
we tried a bennigan 's one time ,
and it was terrible .
course it was just probably one of the worst days to go anyway .
we , we waited almost forty -five minutes before everything was brought out ,
 and you had . 
and it was ,  we were ready  to go home .
and you had the kids with you ?
yeah .
and they waited forty -five minutes ?
no
we fought with them for forty -five minutes .
i don 't doubt that one bit .
so , we , we , we rarely go eat in those kind of eating , uh , situations , any more .
but we do love to eat out ,
and , um , and we do it as often as we can ,
and , and times that we do have baby -sitters we , we try and catch , um , some things that we normally wouldn 't do , you know .
where , where do you like to go when you got a baby -sitter ?
oh , um , let me see , uh , for new year 's we went to eat at uncle julio 's .
where 's that ?
never heard of that place .
it 's , um , on , on walnut and greenville .
what 's the name of that again ?
it 's called uncle julio 's .
what , what are they , what kind of ?
um , basically mexican food .
yeah ,
okay .
and it 's supposed to be very similar to , um , uh ,
what is that restaurant off of central ?
it 's a , um , it 's a mexican restaurant off of central .
well , there 's a zillion of them .
have you ever been to mercado juarez ?
no ,
but i 've heard about it .
that 's a good place
i .
really .
they 've got one in addison too , now ,
but the original was on northwest highway , uh , just the other , west of loop twelve .
that 's a good mexican place .
really ,
uh -huh .
good , good prices , good , good food there .
yeah .
if you like mexican stuff . it 's , it 's a good place .
we like , um , seafood , also ,
and , uh .
you , you ever been to vincent 's ?
vincent 's ?
no ,
we haven 't .
that 's a good seafood place .
really .
yeah .
really .
you ever been , tried a place called louisiana purchase ?
no .
well , this is in plano .
they might have another one ,
uh -huh .
but it 's on , uh , parker and central expressway and , it 's , it 's ca -,
oh , okay ,
i 've seen it .
yeah ,
it 's cajun type stuff .
yeah .
yeah .
if you like it kind of hot , that that is good food ,
that 's good stuff .
we 've been to , um , chefalia 's .
yes .
it 's basically the same thing , seafood cajun style .
where 's that place ?
that 's in addison , off of belt line .
yeah ,
okay .
 midway . 
 belt line  and what ?
okay .
like around , i think it 's a little past or it 's right before midway , or it 's right at midway .
yeah ,
okay .
and , um , excellent food .
uh -huh .
so .
we got this premier dining card thing ,
and we 've , we 've been going to all sorts of weird type places with it .
what , what is that ?
well , you get , uh , one free
oh , really .
and you , you , you pay for one now , and type thing ,
and , uh ,
oh .
we 've been to from barbecue to ,
there 's a swan club which is out central and campbell .
uh -huh .
uh , that is , if you like continental stuff , that is really nice .
talk , talk your husband into taking you there some night .
uh -huh .
i mean it 's not a cheap place ,
but , uh , it 's very nice .
really .
and where is that ?
uh -huh .
uh , it 's on campbell . it , it 's north of campbell , but , uh , off central , uh oh , it used to be a northern telecom building in the ba -, in the ground floor .
i don 't know what they call it now ,
northern telecom kind of moved over in their own building .
yeah .
uh -huh .
but it , it 's a big , tall , it 's the tallest building on the west side , northwest side of campbell and , just before you get to campbell and it 's in the lower floor ,
really .
but it 's really a nice restaurant if you like  continental stuff . 
 uh -huh . 
and , tell him to take you there for your anniversary ,
and then they got a place where you can dance , you know , and all that kind of stuff .
yeah ,
well , my birthday 's coming up ,
so .
there you go .
all right .
you got one coming .
i need an excuse
have you ever been to ewaldes
now there 's , if you like cont -,
i , i like continental stuff , myself .
uh -huh .
my wife doesn 't necessary like that stuff ,
but i like that .
uh -huh .
and that 's down in the , the stoneleigh hotel now .
uh -huh .
yeah .
yeah .
and that is really super kind of stuff , too . take , if you like continental at all that kind of stuff either one of those two , you go through a hundred bucks without half trying ,
oh , oh .
but it , it 's it 's nice , really nice place .
yeah .
oh , you don 't have to spend that much ,
i 'm kidding you .
i pushed it .
okay .
so , how do you use your credit cards ?
oh , we use them for ,
paying our gas and for paying , uh , just about anything , because , um , we don 't like to pay for our checks
uh -huh .
so we use it quite a bit but we , we pay off every month , though ,
so we never have to pay interest
and we always , we never get the , the credit cards if there 's a monthly , or a yearly charge .
we always get it through our bank or somewhere where it 's free .
so we never have to pay anything extra .
yeah ,
that 's me .
yeah ,
we just don 't think it 's worth it .
so .
i won 't use one that i have to pay an annual fee you know , and , um , i 'm , uh , like you . i , i use it , well , to buy my gas with ,
my sh -, my shell credit card , i use that ,
and then like my emporium card and , uh , weinstocks card , i use that ,
but i 'm like you .
i usually pay it off as soon as i get my bill .
why i don 't just write a check , i don 't know .
see , well , you , i don 't do it either
you know , it 's just really weird ,
yeah .
but i , i don 't carry a lot of cash with me , because i 'm always afraid that someone 's going to steal my purse .
yes ,
exactly ,
that 's how i fe -,
i mean , it 's a rare day when i even have seventy -five cents in my purse .
yeah ,
you know , enough for a phone call
and that 's about all .
yeah .
but , uh , other than that , that 's the , that 's the way i use them .
i know some people that uses them so bad that every one of them that they 've got , they c -, they can 't charge any more ,
you know ,
and i think that 's terrible .
yeah ,
 oh , yeah . 
because it 's really , it helps your , if you have good credit , you know , it helps you in the long run  when you want to go make a  bigger purchase or something .
yeah ,
because if anything ever happens that you do need to , you know , you have excellent credit ,
why , it really does help .
yeah ,
and i think it 's more convenient , too , in a lot of cases ,
like whenever we go on trips , we always , you know , use our , our visa or our mastercard or whatever .
  yeah .
uh -huh ,
 uh -huh . 
and then , um , you know , we really don 't have to pay for it out of our own pockets until about a month later  and so  it helps us gain interest in the bank that when we do it ,
 uh -huh ,
we come out a lit -, even a little bit ahead because we 've been able to use whatever ,  first off , and then pay  for it later .
uh -huh ,  uh -huh .
yeah ,
oh , yeah .
well , i think it 's better to use credit cards , too , like i say , because yo -, there 's so many people around any more that 's watching what you 're doing and if you pull a wad of money out of your pocket , they 're going to hit you over the head .
yeah ,
even if it 's five bucks , even .
i know .
it just , uh , you know , it just seems like they 're , somebody 's always watching .
so , i just don 't , i don 't carry money .
yeah .
i 'd just soon use my credit cards and just pay them off , you know .
and also , if you , if someone did happen to steal your credit card , my husband was saying that if , you know , you notice it within , i think it 's twenty -four hours , you can report it in ,
and i , he said the most you 'd ever have to pay is fifty dollars for them to cancel , you know , whatever payments you had ,
right .
and if whoever tried to , uh , you know , credit it to the hilt , you 'd only have to pay fifty dollars of it ,
yeah .
yeah ,
right .
 yeah ,
right . 
and then you know , you can have your card back with pretty good rating , you know , because you can pay fifty dollars , but not , you know  maybe five  thousand or whatever .
i know .
and , you know , some of those stores don 't even seem to check your signature or anything you know ,
i don 't know why they don 't , unless you have to spend a certain amou -,
i don 't know ,
but i notice that some of them don 't even look , you know ,
yeah ,
exactly .
they just slide it in there and pass it back to you you know ,
so i don 't think that 's right .
i think they should check it to make sure that the signature at least matches , you know .
yeah ,
sure .
i mean it 's just a precaution for everybody .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
yeah ,
so .
well , let 's see ,
what else can i say about credit cards .
um .
um .
oh , i also use , like to use discover when i can , because they give you some money back every year .
yeah ,
i don 't , i don 't , uh ,
that , that 's that sears discovery card ,
is that what that ?
yeah ,
 yeah . 
 yeah .
 now i don 't have that one , you know .
well , we just started doing that ,
 uh -huh . 
 and  you know , what
uh -huh .
it comes in handy for when you 're buying things like , um , tickets for the train or , um , airplanes because they 'll give you some money back , you know ,
and it 's only a little bit ,
but , i mean , it 's still something .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
we got two fifty last year and so it 's , you know , it helps out here and there .
so .
oh , you mean , uh , for , for your using your credit card you get like a rebate or something ?
yeah ,
they give you , i think they start giving you like a half a percent back , which doesn 't sound like a thing ,
uh -huh .
but when you , you know , when you add up everything you 've , you 've charged up on the discover card for a year and they give you a half percent of that ,
and that adds up to , you know , two fifty or something .
oh , i see .
and so that 's what ,
uh -huh .
and i know we 're going to get back more this year , because they , you know , we spent a little bit more probably ,
um , i see .
and they do it for how long you 've been a member i think , too and they increase the percentage a little bit .
yeah
well , i 'll ,
i 'm ready .
all right .
oh .
do you exercise , uh , during the day time or go to a gym or anything ?
yeah ,
i , i used to go to a gym , um , last summer ,
but then i started school again ,
so , it 's , um , so i don 't exercise as much as i 'd like .
uh -huh .
but , i , i do enjoy , um , going to a gym and working out ,
or just like , i do sit ups sometimes before i go to bed or when i wake up ,
and i ride a exercise bike a lot .
so .
uh -huh .
well , i try to do it at night before i go to bed .
uh -huh .
um , it 's really weird ,
because i 'll get down on the floor ,
and i 'll holler and tell my cat nikki ,
i 'll say , nikki , i 'm going to do my exercises ,
now .
and she can be upstairs in the bedroom ,
and i don 't know .
she knows what i 'm talking about .
you know , pretty soon , here she comes .
so , i lay out there in the living room floor and do my exercises , you know .
uh -huh .
uh , i had a problem with my back ,
uh -huh .
so , when i went to physical therapy they gave me some exercises for my back .
oh .
so , i just try to keep that up , because it seems like if i don 't , then , then my back gives me a problem again .
right .
so i try to do it every night ,
 and uh . 
 oh , that 's  good .
yeah ,
it seems like it 's , you know ,
uh -huh .
i can tell when i do it and when i don 't do it you know ,
so you know it 's got to be good for you .
right
uh -huh .
but , um , a long time ago i belonged to a gym but , uh , now i notice that this , in this small city that i live in , they do have a , a gym that just opened up here about a month ago .
oh .
so , i was kind of thinking about joining it ,
but i haven 't even gone down there and talked to them yet .
yeah .
but , uh , it does really make you feel good ,
and i like to bicycle , too .
oh , yeah .
so , that gives you , you know , lots of exercise .
yeah ,
it does .
yeah .
so .
i enjoy that a lot .
i , um , bike in the summer .
i belong to a biking club here in kenosha .
uh -huh .
and , um , we go on a , like fifty to a hundred miles every sunday .
oh , my goodness .
so i try to keep up in the winter with the exercise bike , so , i , you know , can be in shape  
yeah ,
otherwise you wouldn 't be able to go very far , huh ?
no ,
huh -uh .
no ,
i go with my dad .
he exercises a lot more than i do , though .
oh , really ?
oh , yeah ,
 uh -huh . 
 he 's  always exercising .
uh -huh .
but , i 'm not that energetic
yeah .
i get lazy sometimes .
yeah ,
well , like i say , i just do it at night , you know ,
and , um .
yeah .
do you like you try , try to get my stomach muscles toned up .
oh , yeah ,
that 's what i like to do .
you know , because , boy , they seem like they really get out of shape ,
uh -huh .
 yeah . 
and once you get out of shape it 's hard to get back into shape  you know .
yeah .
 so , i 've just been doing it , i try to do it every night you know ,
oh .
like i say , you just , i 'd rather do that than watch television anyhow you know
wow
so it 's just kind of nice , and especially when i have my cat that comes down and joins me .
oh , yeah ,
that is neat
you know , so . well , i guess that 's about all i can tell you about my exercising .
i wish i knew how to swim ,
but i don 't ,
so i don 't go swimming .
yeah ,
um , i don 't swim much , neither .
uh -huh ,
yeah .
but they do say that swimming is really , really good for you you know , for every part of your body .
uh -huh .
so i wished i , i wished i did know how to do that .
if they had a pool here in patterson i 'd probably , you know , put my bathing suit on and go down there ,
but they don 't have a pool in this small city , either .
oh .  um . 
 so .  well , listen then ,
it 's been nice talking to you .
yeah ,
nice talking to you .
okay then .
okay .
bye -bye .
um , bye .
okay .
okay .
do you , uh , do any woodworking ?
i do ,
and i really love it . um .
oh , um , what do you do ,
for a hobby or for ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
i do it for a hobby and i have my own equipment ,
uh -huh .
and i have a jig saw and a scroll saw and , uh , in the process of getting a router and so , i like to cut out my wood , and then tole paint on the items that i cut out .
what kind of things do you like to do with wood ?
well , i 'm not the one that cuts them out .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
my husband cuts them out but , uh , he likes using the little band saws and jig saws more than the stroll saw , because the stroll saw is , is a lot slower and then , uh , he 's got a router ,
but now he wants a plunge router .
oh .
yeah .
but anyhow , he cuts them out ,
oh .
uh -huh .
and then i , i took a tole painting class to learn how to paint them right ,  you know . 
 uh -huh . 
uh -huh .
and what we want to do is , you know , make them , and then maybe take them to these craft shows or flea market things and s -, and see if we can sell some of them .
yes .
but , uh , i really like it so far .
oh , that is fun .
uh -huh .
and then my neighbor had a little doll made out of wood so i took a pattern off of that ,
uh -huh .
and then it 's just a wooden doll with a painted face and then you , you make the dress for it ,
and you drill holes around the top of the head
oh .
uh -huh ,
the twine .
and you , you stick in uh , like rope and tie ribbons around it .
yeah ,
those are  so cute . 
 it looked really  cute , you know .
so i 've got a couple of those started .
they are really cute .
yeah ,
and then uh , but as far as wood work , that 's all we 've been doing right now .
oh , that is , that sounds really fun .
uh -huh .
  well , they have a really fancy boutique out here in ogden , utah and i just got back from that today ,
so if you could get your projects into boutiques , oh , they are wonderful .
uh -huh .
you could make a lot of money from those .
what do you do ?
i wonder how you ,
you just , they buy them from you ,
or you just given them to them on consignment or something ?
uh , apparently ,
like that boutique , um , they take , oh what was it , twenty percent of the sell price .
uh -huh .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
um , i see .
you would put your sell price uh , and then they would take twenty percent off of that at the counter .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
and so then at the end of the boutique , which usually runs for a week , then they give you what you earned
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
so , you have to decide what your price is going to be and then up it twenty percent so you can get what you need out of it .
uh -huh .
so if the customers are willing to pay it , then you get a profit .
oh , these little things are so cute , though , you know .
they are .
 i . 
 i ,  i have seen those .
those are darling .
uh -huh .
i went through some of the books down here at the craft shop , you know and , uh , there 's a lots of little things you can get to cut out .
 oh . 
in fact , i just sent to shop smith  back in ohio  for a rocking horse pattern .
oh , that 's what i want , is a shop smith
 yeah ,
 that 's my ul -. 
we , well ,  gene 's got one of those too
oh , does he ?
oh , that 's my ultimate dream
yeah ,
so anyhow .
oh , you 're lucky .
yeah ,
uh -huh .
well , uh , he 's retired now and , uh , i 'm kind of semi retired .
my company went bankruptcy ,
so i 'm drawing my pension from them ,
but i 'm still looking for a part time job , you know .
uh -huh .
oh .
how fun .
but , uh , he has all day long that he can , you know , work on this stuff and do do cut outs like that ,
you know .
and he 's got a lot , a lot of tools ,
so .
oh , how nice .
 i 'm jealous . 
 it 's just ,  it 's just getting started , you know .
yes .
but , um , these little wooden things , they seem to sell really good .
uh -huh .
um , i know a lot of people that have gotten them , you know .
my next door neighbor , every time she sees something , she thinks it 's so cute she wants to buy it ,  you know 
 uh -huh .
 oh .
uh -huh .
no .
so , i 'm just hoping that , you know , that we can get some cut out and painted , you know , before summer starts because we don 't want to have garage sales or anything like that in the winter time , you know .
uh -huh .
but , uh .
well , how is the market for things like that in california ?
it seems , it seems like they go real good ,  you know . 
 uh -huh . 
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
oh .
i mean , the country , anyhow , out here and i live out in the valley and country seems to be the in thing out here you know ,
everybody wants little country pieces .
so anything that looks like it might be country  is what they want , you know . 
 they just snap it right up ,  huh .
yeah .
oh .
and , uh , this little rabbit that i made in , uh , tole painting class , you know , is like a welcome .
uh -huh .
it 's got a , it 's going to have little wooden hearts holding it , in its hands and then welcome written on those little wooden hearts .
oh .
and ,
well , uh , preferred benefits , uh ,
i worked for a large corporation in the past
and i think large corporations can give better benefits than small corporations because , right now i 'm working for a very small corporation where the owner is right there
and , uh , there is a lot of profit that 's coming in
but when it comes to , uh , small corporations they seem to pocket it a little bit quick , quickly , or whatever , or however you want to say it
and , uh , the benefits aren 't as great when i worked for a big corporation because the big corporations seem to look at its employees and say okay
we 've got this amount of money ,
let 's put into this plan , this plan ,
you got four oh one k plans .
you have , uh , better vacation plans , uh ,
uh -huh .
you have , just in general , maternity leave plans tha -, that kind of thing .
big corporations are able to do that versus small corporations , uh , you know ,
they just don 't have the money or just feel that there isn 't the need for it .
so , i 've worked for both big and small
so i 've had a chance to kind of take a look at , uh , the pros and cons of both .
right .
sure .
well i 've worked for , uh , well i worked for h and r block here in massachusetts for awhile .
uh -huh .
and the only ,
sure .
uh -huh .
huh .
sure .
uh -huh .
they even hate to give out unemployment at the end of tax season because they , you know , they 're fairly , even though they 're a large scale company , they 're very , the offices , the individual offices are very small and now i work for the framingham school tea -, system because i 'm a teacher .
uh -huh .
sure .
and , uh , we have much better benefits , you know , in the system .
uh -huh .
we have a good pension plan .
uh , let me see , we have a profit sharing plan to a degree .
that 's pretty good for , you know , being a , a school district type program .
right .
 uh -huh . 
 wow . 
and we have the eye glasses , the health care  and  the whole kit and caboodle because what  they  did is they threw all the town employees in together .
that 's extremely good .
     ]
 yeah .
really .
like the small corporation that i work for . there 's no pension plan there 's no type of , uh , savings of any sort that the company will reimburse you for .
there 's really ,
i think you 're allowed so many times , uh , i think two or three days a w -, a year .
oh !
it 's not accumulative , type of sick leave uh , you know , things like that .
so i 've been looking at big corporations and saying , the big corporation that i 've worked for in the past had the pension plans , had the big health , health care , uh ,
you had your insurance
and you didn 't have to pay in as much as if you go to a , a very small place .
uh , they don 't have as good as insurance packages as big corporations .
and faint >>,
right .
uh -huh .
the only trouble we 've had here in massachusetts is the town and state employees have run into problems , especially the retired ones .
sure .
 no . 
 yeah . 
my father 's retired from the town of framingham and he said that they haven 't gotten a , a cost of living raise  in over   five  years .
yeah .
 yeah . 
 and  he said that 's the only thing that really stinks as far as being retired
 uh -huh . 
 and  but i hear that bill is in the senate right now
 sure ,
sure . 
and  it 's , hopefully  will go through .
yeah ,
yeah .
uh -huh .
but , uh , you know , i think the schools are at , where the schools isn 't just the school system and not just the teachers .
they took in the whole town plus all  you know , 
 is it  a union ?
uh -huh .
uh , we have the teachers union which helps out a lot ,
but the town of framingham pays the benefits
oh , that 's pretty good .
uh -huh .
and that 's all the town workers , water and sewer and where it 's a very large town ,
it 's actually , should be a city
but they kept it a town .
sure .
 yeah . 
uh , where it 's extremely large , they were able to offer a little bit more which  was  really great because we don 't have to pay a mayor  
 uh -huh ,
yeah .
 yeah ,
i know what you mean
and that 's true .
i mean , yo -, i -, it does end up being quite a bit when you have to hire somebody for that position , sure .
 yeah . 
 right ,
 because of most of our , you know , the town employees , as far as , uh , electoral positions , are part -time .
uh -huh .
 sure . 
uh -huh .
so it works out good because  we  reap the benefits of it and , uh , but as far as shopping for a job , i 'd rather shop for the benefits than the salary .
well , that 's it , you know ,
and , and i 've kind of looked around , uh , at that , uh , too .
because , uh , salary wise i don 't think i 'm making as much with a big corporation because i think when you look at big corps or large ,
 right 
i 'm talking like hugh companies like three m , uh , i 'm , uh , honeywell , uh , texas instruments   i know people that are , that have vacation times , and bene -, benefits that i wouldn 't even dream of in a small corporation .
you bring it up to the owner
and it 's like come on , you know .
partly it 's because the owner wants to keep getting richer and richer .
right
and , and , of course , when it 's a small corporation , it also wants to expand
so that money is spent
i don 't know if you feel the same
but , uh , when it comes to telling kids that they have to do , uh , two or three years of service into some kind of community , i don 't know if that 's appropriate for a government to suggest that and say , you know , you have to do two years of community service before you can be a citizen
or , you know , in the aspect that we 're telling kids that this is what is suggested for you to do .
right .
uh -huh .
and , uh , i , as far as a high school course , i could see it as , uh , maybe a social , uh , sociology course to where a student would get credits if they were to be involved with some kind of community type of program
 uh -huh . 
 and  to me , that 's fine to have a student do that for like four or even a year
uh -huh .
but to tell them that they had to do two years thereafter , post high school , of community service , i , i 'm not quite sure if that 's appropriate for anybody to be telling somebody they have to do .
uh -huh .
um . well , that 's a good idea to have it as a study program for school where it be more on a voluntary basis as opposed to , uh , mandatory .
exactly .
yeah .
a ,
yeah ,
i kind of agree with that .
uh , i don 't think ,
right .
you know , i -, it , they should have , they should have the same rights as anyone else you know .
right
it shouldn 't be , uh , anything shouldn 't be mandatory , other than , i guess , like , uh , when you come to paying taxes or something like that .
uh -huh .
uh , or if it 's beneficial in some kind of way then maybe uh , people be more eager to do it .
exactly .
yeah .
and doing it for a purpose that they want .
the other thing is this ,
i have thought about this on many times when you get these , uh , young troubled teenagers that , uh , don 't have like the perspective of , uh , uh , of the community , a sense of community or perhaps the sense that they may have problems
but there are other people out in the community that may have problems .
then i can see it as like maybe a probationary type of thing .
 right . 
you have to do so much as  far as in  community service now .
if they were , you know , th -, abusive type of situation perhaps then they would have to work with the victims of abuse .
uh -huh .
or if , uh , they destroyed some property around the , uh , area , then they would have to do , uh , to restore it and perhaps , uh , work , uh , for the community to beautify it or whatever
uh -huh .
but i could see that working in you know , cases where it might be young teenagers getting in trouble with law and teaching him that there is a whole community that is effected when they strike out and do their crimes or whatever .
and that 's , i think they have done that
and judges have said well , you know , this is what you 're going to get for a , you know , a misd -, misdemeanor or something ,
you may end up having to do some kind of community service
so i could see that as something that might occur in the court system for those that are troubled ,
so
uh -huh .
uh , that 's a good idea .
uh , i think they should have more programs like that .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
and i think , uh , us being taxpayers , we pay for , uh , people that 's in jail or in trouble anyway .
sure .
we sure  do . 
 so  they should be programs set up by the government that could utilize those forms in different areas
uh -huh .
 yeah . 
 and  i , i agree wholeheartedly .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
uh -huh .
but , uh , the thing is is that 's not enough of that kind of stuff going on , uh because like you say , is a lot of crimes and stuff or misdemeanors so why have someone in year -, jail for a year or two for a misdemeanor .
uh -huh .
 exactly . 
 yeah . 
uh -huh .
and sometimes , you know , putting them in jail doesn 't really help because there 's nothing in there that would reb -, rehabilitate  re -,   rehabilitate  rehabilitate them and then when they get out , they ,
because they have this stigmatism of being in jail .
and there 's a lot of anger , sure . you know , especially if they haven 't went through treatment
and they dealt with other people in the , uh , system of prisons which , uh , you , you always deal with somebody that 's a little bit worse than yourself next to you or whatever .
i would say the crimes would probably be , you know ,
if you went in for a certain crime , there might somebody that has done a crime even worse than what you have ,
so you 're dealing with people , uh , that may , uh , be an influence later on
and , uh , an issue of anger would be is that i went to prison for a year or two
uh -huh .
 uh -huh . 
but i didn 't get any rehabilitation or , uh , you know . but then again , those that have physically assaulted somebody , uh , that 's extremely tough to put them into some kind of program  out in  the community if they 're of a violent sort and to say
right .
uh , i don 't know about you ,
but , uh , i work outside the home
and , uh , in fact , uh , i 'll be leaving very shortly to go to work
and i work different shifts so are pretty much a later shift to where i don 't have i don 't have the family time .
uh , when my husband gets home , it 's usually , he 's home with my daughter alone
and then a couple of hours later i 'm home .
uh , i don 't know ,
i 'm finding that more and more people that i talk to , there 's less and less family time available to them .
and , uh , it seems that business wise , uh , in the business community , or your employers seem to be taking more and more time away from the family .
so , you know , if you do have any time , it 's kind of like on a rush cycle that you have to get so many other things done , uh , ju -, just to maintain your home and maintain the things outside your home and then , plus try to have that relationship with your children ,
and it , it 's sometimes a very , it , it 's a very hard juggling act .
i agree
and , you know , i look at my daughter
and she 's now , uh , four , going to be four
and i keep saying oh jeez , i don 't have that much time with her
yeah .
and she 's growing fast
and ,
i know that i have three children .
uh -huh .
and , uh , i stay home .
i don 't work .
uh -huh .
and , uh , i know that it , it must be really challenging to , uh , try to juggle a job and , and also your children .
yes .
yeah
because i know my husband , if i were gone as much as he is we wouldn 't have the influence on them that i would want to put on them .
sure .
 exactly . 
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
 and  i also notice that the children that come over here to play that go to daycare every day they don 't like to be around adults .
uh -huh .
they don 't want to play around adults .
they don 't want to be around you .
they don 't want you to tell them what to do .
they want to do their own thing .
sure .
and they 're the very same age as my children .
uh -huh .
 exactly . 
 and i 'm  finding as i volunteer up at the school , i just , being , uh ,
i 'm not educated at all in , uh , really detecting this
uh -huh .
but i can talk to the teacher and tell them , on a pretty good basis , after i 've worked up at the school for a couple of weeks which kids go to daycare and which kids stay home .
sure ,
sure .
and you can just tell in their personalities and how they respond to the adults that , uh , the ones that are , are home and the ones even that are at home that are getting the love and attention that they need .
uh -huh .
 yeah ,
yeah . 
not that the kids that go out aren 't  getting that  it 's just a different ,
sure .
 sure . 
they 're , they are more use to being with their own age kids they 're not use to being with adults and to  responding  to adults .
sure .
 yeah ,
i , i    , 
 uh , i think the trend in the united  states ,
 i think so too . 
i feel really bad that it 's turned so much  to where the children  are ,  uh , 
 in  fact , uh , i spent the first three years at home with my daughter ,
so i , i guess i felt fairly fortunate that i was able to do that .
and i did notice the difference between those of infants being placed in daycare
and i thought to myself , how can a mother place her child at the age of six weeks or four weeks or two weeks or three weeks ,
whatever the employer says you have to be back at work is basically when you have to be back at work , whether it be six weeks or three or four .
but how these women must feel to place their children into care
and , you know , it 's our society saying yes ,
this , uh , you need this job .
it 's a little bit financial type thing
because , uh , if you look all over in the other countries , like europe and that , uh , their standards of living are a lot less than what ours are
 right . 
 and  that 's part of it too .
but , uh , like my husband was saying , maybe some of the problems we brought on to ourselves is that these women back in the nineteen fifties , uh , were staying at home with their kids and then made the decision , well , jeez , you know , i 'll go out and get a part -time job .
got a part -time job
and then financially , they got themselves into well , i 'll have the boat ,
i 'll have the car
 right . 
 and  it 's nice
and really women , past generation women have done it to women of this day and age too , uh ,
because it is now , our financial situations are as , it almost takes two people to bring in an income to support a family now
 and , 
 it 's  hard .
it really is hard .
 uh -huh . 
i know that my husband and i have to do a lot of  sacrificing  to keep me home .
sure ,
 and , uh , 
i  did it  for three years
and , uh , it cost us a lot of financial problems doing it
and pretty soon , you know , you 're at the limit where you 've got to say okay , you 've sacrificed for , you know , so many years at home
right .
and you 're not getting any further , you know , along and you have to make that decision to go back to work part -time or go back to work full -time
and you have to make that decision
and it 's a tough one .
right .
 and i , 
uh -huh .
 i think  one of the things that people look at too though , is , uh , spen -, how they spend their time with their children i think with working moms , if you can get them ma -, the bosses to give you almost like a rotation like they 're going to do with year -round school where you work ,
sure .
okay .
okay .
so , what do you think about it ?
should ,
um , i like the idea of nursing homes as a , as a growing choi -, the choices you have in nursing homes now , whereas used to , you used to have only , you put , you know ,
uh -huh .
when , when people got to the point where they were debilitated and couldn 't take care of themselves and there was no other choice .
you couldn 't take them in your own home ,
then they went into a nursing home .
you know , maybe you lived too far away to care for them ,
right .
or your daily job or whatever prevented it .
but , um , i like the choices you have now , where they can go into an apartment type setting and have some , basically have a independent life -style , but assisted care .
yeah .
uh -huh .
and then if things deteriorate , they can go to a second level which is , you know , like , where they prepare their meals for them and , and they still live somewhat independently
but they have people checking on them and making sure they have hot meals .
uh -huh .
and then where the same community a lot of times will also have the third level , which is full care , you know , where some people can 't , where they 're in a wheelchair or where they 're in a bed ,
uh -huh .
and they can 't get around
but then they have full care .
but i really like those , those options now ,
and , and i think about it more often because my husband 's parents are , they 're very active right now ,
but they 're seventy -five and , and seventy -two .
uh -huh .
so , that comes up somewhat more often in my thoughts as i see these things because of their age .
yes .
um , it 's , it 's funny
because , um , i know people at , that are in all three , and people that work , you know ,
i know someone that w -, works in all three different stages like you said .
uh -huh .
and i have known , you know , people close to me that have been in all three ,
and i have seen them like go from where they 're in an apartment building ,
they , we call it , um ,
well , we have high rises ,
and it 's just for elderly people , you know ,
or most of , most of , one of their spouses has already passed away .
uh -huh .
and it 's really nice for them because then they 're with people their own age , and people that have gone through things exactly what they have gone through .
uh -huh .
and , it 's , it 's really nice to go and see them , you know , where they can still get around and everything ,
and they still , you know , do their own thing ,
but it 's , it 's really nice to see them because ,
i mean sometimes ,
like i had a great aunt ,
she lived with us for , um , three months , and , because she 's starting to get alzheimer 's disease .
and i know i have a bunch of younger brothers and sisters ,
and i know it was hard for me as well as it was for them to , to actually sit down , because she doesn 't like doing things that the younger kids like doing .
right .
and to actually sit ,
so it 's really nice to see that .
yeah ,
that 's some of the things i would find important before i , i would look into that for a person , is , is , is like you 're saying , a good mix of people who have the same interests .
uh -huh .
and , uh , and the programs ,
here they have different , uh , besides just different levels within the same program , they have different types of programs .
they have several areas .
they have one area in town where the people ,
i guess a lot of it comes with money .
i , this , this one area is a bit more expensive ,
and the people who probably are living there have had more money in their life .
but , but things that people where they have similar interests .
uh -huh .
like you 're saying ,
yeah .
and the programs that they have , where , where some of them will have dances once a week and some of them sponsor different crafts ,
and they go to the arboretum to see things ,
and they make sure that if they want to go to church , there 's a bus there .
uh -huh .
and , it 'll , or , you know , or someone will transport them to a specific church , even though it 's , you know , maybe it 's thirty minutes away ,
because it 's a big , you know , dallas area is a big metropolitan area .
yeah
but a lot of these places have , have churches or have , have individual transportation .
that 's , that 's something i 'd look for , something that would make me happy personally if i had to live there .
uh -huh .
yeah .
because i don 't think a lot of people really , even in the nice ones , and even in the ones where they can live fairly independently , they really don 't necessarily like it because they 're not in their own home .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
so i think those kinds of things , to make it more homelike and to make it more , um , enjoyable for them . that 'd , that 'd be one thing i 'd look for , along with the , uh , health care aspects to make sure they had , you know , that it was clean and that they had good doctors and nurses .
yeah .
um , i 'm in college ,
and i 'm , i 'm only twenty -one
but we had a spee -, i had a speech class last semester ,
and there was a girl in my class who did a speech on home care of the elderly .
uh -huh .
and i was so surprised to hear how many people ,
like whenever they 're in , you know , the older people , they 're like , um , fastened to their beds so they can 't get out just because they , you know , they wander the halls .
uh -huh .
and they get the wrong medicine , just because , you know , the , the aides or whoever just give them the wrong medicine .
yeah .
and so many of them , you know , are ,
are overmedicated , too .
yes .
and it was , it was awful to hear what , you know , what some of these people really went through .
and i forget the percentage of people that , you know , that she had said ,
and this was , i mean , she did research on it and everything .
uh -huh .
yeah ,
that 's one of the things that , that we don 't think about as we get older , and the , the money that it now requires to , uh , be in one of these places .
because some of these people that are just on social security ,
and if they don 't have any living relatives ,
perhaps they never had children
uh -huh .
or if their children , you know , passed away before they did they can be in some places that are , you know , that , that are not good .
yeah .
or they , they have very minimum , minimal care
and the , the care that they are getting , the people who are giving it are pro -, are paid at a minimum wage ,
and they just do -, they don 't care as much .
yeah .
and , and like you said , they 're trying to make it , the caretakers in some cases are trying to make easy on themselves to the point where they 're putting people in bed or overmedicating them so they 'll stay in one spot and not do anything .
uh -huh .
that certainly would be something to , to watch for .
because you 've got , with some of them being , some of these places can even be two and three thousand dollars a month to stay in ,  
i know ,
and some -, and sometimes they share a room ,
and it 's just a little cubbyhole ,
yeah .
and they share it with another person ,
and they 're still paying that much .
oh , yeah ,
so you 've ,
it , it , it just sometimes , it just seems ridiculous .
yeah ,
you 've got to really strike a balance in what kind of care , what kind of level of care you need , and then what you can , unfortunately what you can afford at the same time .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh ,
yeah .
um , i 've been lucky ,
well , my mom 's , um , parents , they 're both in their , in their , uh , eighties ,
and i was just home for spring break
and my grandma said something to me about , she goes , well maybe we 'll just sell the house .
she said , it 's getting too big for us to take care of .
and i was like , no ,
no ,
no ,
stay in the house as long as you can .
well , like there are other communities , too , that aren 't necessarily a nursing home .
i had an aunt who lived in a small town in texas that , um , was in a ,
it was a , it was a housing division .
uh -huh .
each person had their own little bitty house that they had built ,
and it was , um , supplemented ,
their , they were , most of them were on social security ,
and they got some kind of supplemental aid besides from the state government .
but it was this little bitty one bedroom house ,
but it was a separate house ,
and they had a living room , and a bedroom and a kitchen ,
oh .
and a bathroom .
so they still had , they had , and they had people who came in who , um , supervised , th -, all these houses ,
were like fifteen or twenty of them all right together kind of like on one block .
uh -huh .
and they had a , a supervisory , um ,
wasn 't a house , really ,
it sounds like , uh , an apartment or som -,
it was , it was more like , um , a headquarters or something , anyway , where they , they staffed it three shifts a day so that someone , if they needed someone , they could ring
and , and someone ,
oh .
could come to their house .
yeah .
and that , and they always cooked ,
then they had , they had the choice , you know ,
they lived in their own little house .
uh -huh .
they had their own possessions still in there , to some ex -, you know , some of them .
uh -huh .
and they could make their own breakfast if they wanted to , and their own dinner ,
and they always had somebody come in for lunch .
but they had people who did , you know , they didn 't have to mess with the yard .
uh -huh .
they had people who did the yard ,
and they had a maid that , uh , uh , service that came in and cleaned everybody 's house .
so they didn 't have to worry about that .
oh , yeah .
and it was really a nice , it was really a nice compromise , especially , because she felt like she was still living in her own house .
uh -huh .
and she still had her own couch , and her own bed ,
and it , it really helped a lot ,
and she was a lot more comfortable ,
and she didn 't resent   like having to be in a situation , because she still had a lot of her own possessions .
oh , really ?
yeah .
see , now we 've run into a lot of problems where our relatives were ,
well , i 've lived here for thirty years ,
yeah .
and we 've built this , and this is our home ,
and we have nothing else to show for our lives ,
and we don 't want to leave .
oh , yeah .
uh , we 've run into a lot of that .
yeah ,
it would be hard to .
uh -huh .
that 's , that 's why this ,
she was , she felt that way , too ,
but when , it helped that she got to still be in a house and still have some of her own stuff .
yeah .
and i guess that , that ,
it was a pilot program i think , where she lived ,
so it 's probably not widely available .
uh -huh ,
yeah .
that 's what like ,
well , um , now i know we have an ol -,
we call it an old folks home ,
but it 's basically a nursing home too ,
but everyone has basically their own room .
yeah .
and they 're allow -, you know , th -,
none of them have cars because they can 't drive .
uh -huh .
but if someone would come to get them , you know , they 're allowed to leave with them ,
and there 's a staff there that makes supper for them ,
and each person has a chore ,
like maybe wednesday night it 's george 's turn to set all the tables .
uh .
and it 's really nice because that keeps them going , too , rather than just sitting around .
yeah .
and i know , um , our youth group goes over
that 's good .
and we play bingo with them and , you know , like , stuff like that .
everybody needs some sense of responsibility .
uh -huh
 an even , even if it 's just a little bit . 
 yeah ,
just to keep them going . 
yeah .
uh -huh .
yeah .
so , it 's , it 's more like living with a big , in a big house where it 's your turn to , to set the table , like you 're saying , or whatever instead of being waited on hand and foot all the time .
uh -huh .
yeah ,
that would be nice .
but i think before i -,
like you ,
i don 't think y -, i don 't think it 's right to just put someone in it .
i think they would have to agree to go in it .
yes ,
well , yeah .
unless they 're at a point where they 're mentally incapacitated
uh -huh .
like you 're saying with alzheimer 's and stuff , they 're going to be some people who have to be there whether they want to or not ,
and that 's when it 's important to really check out the medical aspects of it , when you 're , when you 're in something like that ,
uh -huh .
that they 'll get the kind of medical care they want without , or they need , without overdoing it .
uh -huh .
without doing something to make this , you know , to keep , like you 're saying , to keep them still to make the staff happy .
yeah .
so
uh -huh .
okay .
okay .
i forgot all about that that it had to be pressed .
um , but anyway , so , so as far as ,
uh -huh .
w -, we really , we don 't want to get in the habit of watching a lot of t v because we both were raised , you know , that way , you know , where our parents sort of stuck us in front of a t v to be the baby -sitter .
uh -huh .
and we just don 't want that .
we want more communication and interaction , you know , amongst us as a family .
and we both like sports ,
uh -huh .
so we figured , well what , what better way to get out and , you know , be together as a family and also , you know , have it be good for you .
and plus , we like , we both like to cook ,
so , you know , that 's something we spend time together too , is , you know , cooking and , uh , preparing meals and stuff .
so , uh , but as far as that that 's about all we 've discussed  as far as for family . 
 really ,
okay ,
well see ,  i 'm the third oldest of twelve children .
oh my gosh .
so like i said , i ,
and i 'm only twenty -one .
i 'll be twenty -two next month .
so there 's nine that are younger than me .
my youngest sister is five .
oh yeah .
and like i sa -, i don 't have any children .
i 'm just engaged ,
and i 'm getting married in october ,
and we haven 't discussed this at all um .
yeah ,
long way down the road , right .
yeah ,
exactly .
but , um , now i 've noticed that like , while i 'm at college , and when i go home , my bro -, you know , my ,
i 'm really close to the younger ones ,
and , um , like , when , when , like when i do go home they enjoy just laying around me , you know ,
like if we do watch t v at night , they just like enjoy just , like laying on top of me or something .
yeah .
they like that .
but , um , as far as that goes , like we play games ,
i play like old maid and fish with them ,
and w -, we play board games ,
and when it 's ni -,
like i 'm from pennsylvania ,
so when it 's nice out , we go outside ,
and we like to play like kick ball and softball and stuff .
so .
uh -huh .
we do a lot of that .
and in the summer everyone is like , i think there 's like seven of us still at home ,
and all seven are in a sport ,
like also   the girls are in softball
and the boys are in baseball .
so all summer we live on hamburgers and hot dogs and sports ,
that 's it , you know .
well do you , do you ,
uh -huh .
so you go , if you 're , if you 're not doing any kind of sport thing you go to one of your sisters ' or brothers ' sporting events .
yes .
and sort of like be there with them .
right ,
yeah ,
we go and watch .
yeah .
uh -huh .
well , that 's , that 's good , too , i mean , as far as entering ,
i mean , you 're , you 're participating ,
but you 're not , you know .
uh -huh .
i mean at least you 're encouraging them on and stuff
and that 's ,
yeah .
uh -huh .
because , um , even if our kids , you know , get into sports that we 're really not interested in , i don 't , i want them , you know , to know that we 're still there so to speak , as a family .
well , it 's funny because , um , well , my mom and dad both were kind of athletic .
they both grew up on a farm ,
but although , you know , it wasn 't them playing i notice like whenever i was playing softball and such , my mom and dad got into it more than i did .
i mean , they 'd be in the audience screaming and yelling ,  you know ,
so . 
 yeah .
cheering you on and stuff . 
a lot of times the parents get into it just as much as , as the kids ,
and i found , like a lot of times like when we went on to tournaments and stuff , it was really funny because the crowds would like get into argu -, you know , get into fights , who can scream louder , and you know , everything .
so it 's really pretty funny to see my parents get into it ,
and they 're not really even participating .
yeah ,
well , that , that would be fun .
boy , so you , you have a lot of experience as far as , you know , different ways a family can interact and , and do things together ,
yeah .
as far as ,
go -,
twelve .
uh -huh .
but it 's
so , if you 're not ,
i -,
what if ,
do people go off in their own little groups with that many ?
i mean , did like some people go to their rooms and    ,
yeah ,
it 's , um ,
the , the one down thing about having that many people in our family is you real -, we really don 't have any privacy when we 're at home , because you couldn 't possibly have a house with twelve bedrooms .
yeah .
but , um , like i say , you know , i 'm twenty , i 'll be twenty -two next month ,
and i 'm closer to the younger kids than i am the ones my own age .
and that 's , i think ,
huh .
that 's because we -, the ones that are older all have their own little thing to do ,
and the younger kids are at home ,
and i like to spend time with them .
so .
yeah .
i don 't , i don 't , you know ,
but when you were growing up and they weren 't , and the younger ones weren 't around , what did you do ?
we were all pretty close when we were younger .
oh , i see .
but now that they 've all sort of moved off ,
yeah ,
now that we 're getting older , people are get -, you know , each one of us are going our own direction .
yeah .
uh -huh .
so , do you think , even ,
i mean , what did you do when you were younger ,
did you go do the board games and stuff ,
you still did what you do now .
oh , yeah .
and , um , we , you know , we had blocks and stuff ,
and we just did , we would make ,
like in the winter when it wa -,
uh -huh .
we couldn 't go outside because of the snow and stuff we , uh , we would , um , clear out our basement ,
and we would like , do , just , even stupid things ,
like we try hurtling our couches and stuff . you know , and .
hurling .
yeah ,
we would just run and jump over the couches .
oh , hurtle ,
oh , okay .
yeah ,
to see who could jump over , you know .
we just made up our own stupid little games .
and like hide and seek ,
well , we have a , a bigger house than a lot , you know ,
our house isn 't the average small one .
so we could like play hide and go seek in our house and even stuff like that .
yeah .
so you , you had a lot of games and things you played even when you were kids with the ones that you ,
well see , they 're , um , we 're all , like we 're all pretty close together .
like , m -, my sister that 's closest to me , we 're only fourteen months apart .
yeah .
so there was always , there was never just one alone , you know .
yeah ,
no , not real spread in age .
right .
so we were all pretty close where we , we always had a buddy to play with ,
yeah .
you know .
gosh , twelve ,
is that , is that pretty common up there , uh , in ,
no ,
no ,
not at all .
oh , okay .
not at all
i don 't meet , i mean , i don 't speak with many people that come from families that large any more .
uh -huh .
i mean my , my husband 's mother came from a family of thirteen ,
uh -huh .
but , i mean , that 's his mother you know ,
and , and their catholic  ]
and , i mean that 's ,
well , yeah ,
i 'm catholic
well that 's it then , i think ,
probably maybe that , that .
uh -huh .
no ,
not at all .
but , i mean , do you see yourself having thirteen kids or twelve kids ?
not at all .
yeah .
but , see , um , when i was younger i used to say that i would like to have five .
well , i 've even cut that down now ,
and , um , but to me five wasn 't even a lot , because i was just so used to twelve .
yeah .
you know .
but it 's so expensive , man .
but , yeah ,
it 's so , it would be really hard now to have twelve children .
i would think for your parents it would be , it would still be hard even nowadays , i mean , just to raise twelve kids .
would be , shoosh .
well , well , okay , well like my oldest brother , he 's , he 's twenty -four ,
and he put himself through college ,
and , um , there 's a sister older than me ,
she 's still living at home ,
yeah .
but she works you know ,
and i think she even gives mom and dad a little bit , you know , of rent money .
yeah .
and i 'm putting myself through college ,
and like i 'm getting married in october ,
and my fianc3e and i are paying for most of the wedding .
and then , then my brother right behind me , he moved out ,
and he has an apartment ,
and he works ,
and then the next one down is in the marines ,
and he 's out of the house .
so , it 's kind of like they don 't , you know .
well sometimes i think maybe the larger families create more independence in the children though , you know .
i , i think they do .
uh -huh .
i mean you don 't expect anything because there is not enough to go around for everybody so you , you kind of have your own independence on going out and getting it yourself ,
exactly .
if you really want it .
like , uh , well , i find it a lot when i 'm up here at college because i 've always had a bank account ,
i 've always had my own checking account since i was in like tenth grade .
uh -huh .
you know , i would work in the summer ,
and there 's a lot of kids up here that would have no idea how to even do a checkbook or , you know ,
yeah .
to , to manage money .
like my roommate 's laughing at , you know , at me , you know ,  because their schooling 's paid for . 
 or manage money or know ,
 yeah ,
know , you know , how to get , how to even go about getting money .
yeah ,
uh -huh .
you know , how to get a job or you know , just what , you know , what , when you get a job , what your responsibility is .
yeah .
are you going to blow all that money ,
how easy it is to blow money you earn .
yeah .
and see , and then , my mom and dad , like whenever , like we would go out and we would get a summer job ,
and then we would start blowing money ,
and my mom said , well that 's stupid for you to be blowing money .
she goes , okay if your going to blow your money on other things , she goes , you can just pay for your life insurance .
so then we , when we all graduated from hi -, college , from high school ,
uh -huh .
we all got ,
we 're still , like i 'm still covered under my mom and dad 's life insurance because i 'm still in school ,
but i have my own policy , too .
so i had a poli -,
you know , my mom and dad got it set up , you know , you know , helped me to get it and everything ,
and i have my own policy ,
and then i pay for my own life insurance too .
wow ,
you 've really got responsibilities .
and then and then , like , my mom and dad , because there 's so many of us , and because of the way the laws are , you know , now , if we want to drive , we have to pay for our own insurance on our cars .
yeah .
because my mom said , that 's silly to let one of the older one 's drive it ,
if we were in a wreck , you know , you can be sued for anything now .
and she said that 's really not fair to the younger kids .
if we were careless and was in a wreck and they got sued
and then they can take everything away from my mom and dad ,
and the little kids would have nothing .
and i , i agree with her .
you know , i just , i don 't know .
yeah .
wh -,
so if , you know , if we want to drive , we pay our own insurance ,
and .
so really , i think , sometimes there 's an advantage ,
i mean , sometimes it 's good to have a bigger family because it does make you more independent .
uh -huh .
yeah .
uh -huh .
it makes you know that you can 't take anything for granted that when you get something you 're lucky to get it , so to speak you know .
so , um , i don 't know ,
sometimes ,
but now , it , it is hard , i can imagine , on your parents , you know
okay ,
so you watch david letterman ?
yeah .
well , see our favorite t v show ,
uh -huh .
i , i , i live in a dorm and our favorite t v show is cheers .
oh , really ,
yeah
that 's pretty awesome , too .
i watch it every now and then .
okay ,
that 's hilarious .
well , we try ,
like here they show it , like , every day .
oh , serious
and then , like , on thursdays is the night where the new ones come on .
oh , that 's cool .
but we watch it like every day .
but i , like , late night , we don 't watch , uh ,
what we do is , we stay up till around one thirty ,
uh -huh .
and then they show the twilight zone at one thirty ,
and so we just stay and watch that .
twilight zone rules , man .

twilight zone rules .
yeah ,
that 's all .
i used , i used to live in the house that the guy owned .
are you serious ?
yeah ,
it was really , it was really , oh , well , it was all full with , uh , shelves everywhere
and we didn 't have enough books to fill it up
that 's psychedelic .
but , but , uh , so what , what do you like , why do you like david letterman ?
oh , he just , like , totally sarcastic and hilarious
and , i don 't know ,
i 'm a lot like him in a way ,
so the ,
so and he 's got curly hair

curly hair
and so do i ,
so hey

uh , i don 't know ,
but people ,
the other day i went into a bar
and this guy asked me to dance .

and he goes , do you want to dance .
i turn around and go , what !
he goes do you want to dance .
i go no ,
no ,
he goes oh , oh , i 'm sorry .

so , but , okay , so d -, wait
do you watch saturday night live yesterday ?
no ,
it ,
with the , uh ,
who was on , the music people ,
wasn 't that fishbone .
yeah .
yeah
i saw that ,
it was awesome .
but i didn 't see the rest of it .
no ,
oh , you missed wayne 's world .
are you serious ?
wayne 's world was pretty cool .
they 're awesome .
so , uh , let 's see ,
what else .
oh , really ?
uh , see , like , all we do here is , like , every time we walk in the room we turn on the t v because we don 't want to do anything like study or anything ,
yeah ,
that sucks .
so all the , all we do is turn ,
like , like , when i was in high school i used to do , like , my homework in front of the t v set ,
really ?
you know .
uh , kind of annoying
but that 's cool .
what ?
kind of annoying to , like , in front of t v , like trying to do homework , you know .
yeah .
trying to write an essay , you start talking about , you know , like , in living color or something ,
i don 't know .
well , i like , i , i just , i just bogused on all my homework
so it really didn 't matter
cool ,
yeah ,
b s
that 's the way to do it .
yeah ,
i know ,
and i did that all through college
and it worked
cool ,
yeah ,
works for me .
so , uh , let 's see ,
what else .
like , the news we don 't watch ,
no ,
unless ,
because they 're boring .
i watched through the war , you know ,
there 's only one .
yeah ,
especially the war ,
i mean it was like , i , haven 't i seen this episode before , you know .
i know ,
i guess they think that people don 't watch t v ,
but i mean if you watch it for , like , five minutes , then it repeats everything over and over and over .
yeah ,
i know .
it 's , like , oh , man .
and , and in north c -,
see the , the thing is , like here they just , they just give you like local news , okay .
yeah .
like , a house burned down in this little town .
oh .
and were here ,
and i go , so what happened worldwide , you know .
it 's like , you know , even though two hundred and fifty thousand people died somewhere else , they 're not going to tell you , you know ,
they 're going to spend more time on doing a , a thing on a , on a cross guard who 's a hundred and five years old ,
than they are on anything else , you know .
yeah .
so , but , uh , let 's see ,
what else .
oh , we watch , like for example , uh ,
okay ,
do you watch star trek ?
uh , i haven 't seen it in years ,
but i used to .
okay ,
well i used to hate star trek .
yeah ?
i thought , i thought ,
uh -huh .
like , when it , like , when i was , like , in high school and junior high school , i used to hate it but then we started watching it .
really ?
and , and , like , the new ones are pretty cool because , because they got like , uh , like special , like especially things , that , like , fuck with your mind .
oh , really ,
that 's cool .
because what happened is , like they have this hologram right ,
uh -huh .
where you walk in
and you can program
and everything looks real
and you can touch everything and stuff .
are you serious ?
oh , man .
but it 's only a program
and it 's really great because sometimes it 's like the hologram makes up all these things
and , uh , i mean sometimes it , sometimes it 's funny ,
sometimes it 's not ,
but , uh , you know ,
that 's cool .
it 's something to pass the time ,
sound like  
till we do
and then , and then we watch football .
uh , yeah ,
basketball 's cool ,
but football kind of after a while ,
which basketball ?
which basketball ?
college or ,
yeah ,
i kind of like college better ,
it 's more spirited  
we got , we got two teams of the a c c going there .
oh , yeah ?
we got duke and north carolina .
cool .
but , i mean the , i mean there 's nothing to do ,
uh -huh .
like for example yesterday uh , they go , s -, some girl goes , do you  dares  want to go to a picnic , right .
i hear no ,  ]
we 're just , you know , it 's like we just woke up ,
we had a hangover and everything , you know .
and so we just woke up
and , uh , we 're watching t v ,
and i go , no ,
golf ,
yay .
today we 're just going to dedicate  ourself  to watching golf and bowling , you know ,
and everybody , it was , like , oh , god , do you guys really watch that ?
no ,
you know , i was ,
like , a whole golf tournament , it 's ,
like , for example , baseball ,
i hate baseball ,
i mean ,
oh , me , too .
somebody told me , like , that , like , you can watch baseball ,
uh -huh .
and the actual play time that there is is five minutes .
yeah .
because by , the play time is when the person , when the pitcher pitches the ball and it goes to the catcher or when the , when the pitcher pitches and it 's hit .
yeah .
okay ,
that 's true .
yeah ,
that 's true .
and that 's , like , you know , five seconds for the whole play and that 's it .
i mean , maybe a home run could last a little bit longer because the guy has to run around all the bases , you know .
but i mean , it 's , it 's like that ,
i mean it 's was , it 's just ,
ooh , really ?
but when i went home that 's all , like , they had on t v so i tu -, i watched entire games of baseball
and they 're going oh , my god .
and t v in argentina 's really bad .
oh , really .
so , so why from argentina , why 'd you come over here ?
uh , because , uh , i wanted to go to school here .
oh , that 's cool .
yeah ,
how long did you live there ?
they have better computer science up here than they , than they do down there .
oh
so , and i also , uh , my father works for i b m ,
uh -huh .
and we came up here ,
uh .
yeah .
we , well , we came to the united states in nineteen seventy -six , seventy -seven and , uh , we lived here for about seven years
then we moved back .
huh .
and so then i said , i 'm going to move back up there to go to college .
that 's cool .
he goes , okay .
so he goes , but do it fast ,
so i did my undergraduate in two years .
oh , really ?
awesome .
yeah .
so , but it 's , a , it 's just , you know ,
oh , well , we 've been talking for five minutes .
that 's cool .
that 's the only obligation we have .
groovy .
and , uh , well , tell your dad that now he owes you five bucks .
yeah ,
no doubt .
okay .
okay .
all right ,
nice talking to you .
yeah ,
you , too .
bye -bye .
bye .
hi , kay .
hi .
uh -huh .
i , uh , was thinking about salaries and benefits and uh , was wondering what 's the most important thing to you besides a salary in a job .
well , um , i , we just recently graduated from rice university ,
and , uh , we were going through a lot of job interviews and things ,
and some of the things that were important to me , uh , when my husband was looking for his job , was , um , hours , you know ,
we ,
he 'd been in graduate school so i was used to his not being home at all
yeah
uh -huh .
so i was , you know , didn 't want him to have a job that would make him kind of be on call all the time , and have to go in at any time , and you know , even on the weekends and , um , and things .
sure .
so that was important to me , and also insurance for the fa -, our family because we 'd like to be able to take care of our medical needs and not be thinking so much about whether or not you can afford it .
yeah ,
i don 't ever want to have to worry about that .
that 's real important to me .
uh -huh .
um , you know we have that , that aetna that 's what we , the insurance that we have right now .
uh -huh .
us , too .
when we were in colorado , they had , um , a different type of h m o there that i really liked a lot .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
it was , um , not that kind of h m o where you have to go to their , their sort of like clinics , you know but this was just an h m o where you could go to private practice doctors and to the regular hospitals and all that ,
uh -huh .
but it was with a certain list of , of doctors that , you know , participated in the h m o ,
well , that 's nice .
and , um you know , then you only had to pay the ,
for us it was a five dollar co -payment every time you went to the doctor , and , uh , three dollars for the prescriptions .
uh -huh ,
that 's good .
and , uh , i especially liked the prescription , especially since my children tend to have ear infections all the time
uh -huh .
that , those prescriptions can be very expensive .
oh , i know .
we just went through that ourselves .
we just , you know , are like fifty dollars for this series of antibiotics and things .
oh , i know ,
uh -huh .
especially if you get , what is it , seclor i think that that just about breaks the bank right there .
yes .
yes ,
it 's pretty bad .
well , yeah ,
and we , um , we were interested in having dental insurance , too ,
uh -huh .
because , um , having been in school , we kind of put things off and only went in when we knew there was a problem somewhere and stuff
and we wanted to be able to go in and have our teeth cleaned and just checked all over
and ,
do , do you have the basic plan or do you have the , the other one ?
we have , um , you know
we 're at aetna with an , uh , ex -,
we have like the medi -, the dental insurance is separate .
is that what you mean ?
right .
i don 't think it 's the basic ,
i think it 's the other one .
the one that 's like you get additional ,
uh -huh .
they 'll pay a little bit more i think for the different procedures .
uh -huh .
we just have the basic right now ,
and for most things it tends to cover it
we don 't too many major , um , expenses at this point ,
but we have been able to find do -, dentists that will accept pretty much whatever the basic plan pays .
uh -huh .
a couple of times we 've had to pay , oh i don 't know , three to five dollars but that 's not that bad .
no ,
that 's great .
yeah ,
we need to go shopping for dentists and things like that too .
yes
and , let 's see ,
besides insurance , other things that we looked at , um ,
uh -huh .
well , my husband does not like to commute very far ,
and , and we don 't like him to be , you know , having to drive an hour to work or something
no ,
we don 't like that either
so we kind of looked for where , where the , uh , his office would be located
is his office in plano ?
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
and well , he 's at , you know , he 's at the one that 's at , um , seventy -five at , uh , six thirty -five and so we , by living in plano we 're just about fifteen minutes away .
oh , that 's not bad .
right .
um , especially when they finish all the construction out here and we didn 't want him to let , you know , to ,
like we had some job offers in the new york area ,
oh , yes ,
you 're not kidding .
and we thought , well , you know , he would be really commuting and not only is it , you know , trouble to have to drive , but it takes time away from your home and your family when you 're out driving .
that 's right .
and , um , so , that was something that was important to us ,
and , because , like i say , we kind of felt deprived that he had been in school and been away from us for so long
that we were anxious to do everything we could to have , you know , made us be more together ,
and , and what other ,
can you think of another thing that you guys looked at
and ,
well , those are some of the things that are very important to us too .
uh -huh .
um , we , we 'd like , you know , other benefits that are provided , um ,
uh -huh .
the athletic facilities that you some -, sometimes take advantage of i think that 's , that 's pretty nice ,
but i have to say that since we 've come here we haven 't done it too much though ,
we haven 't enrolled in too many of the classes or , or any of that .
but that 's , that 's a nice benefit to have .
uh -huh ,
that 's true .
that 's really important .
um , also , what , um , opportunities there would be for advancement , i think , we looked at besides just , you know , what salary you would be having now .
right .
but when , when could , uh , your salary increase um , is there , was there somewhere to go .
yeah ,
that 's , that 's one of , i think , the hard things right now ,
uh -huh .
i mean they 're going through some tough times to say the least .
i know many of us are thankful that he still has a
job .
yes ,
that we can make our mortgage payments
and , yeah ,
that 's really true .
uh , one of the drawbacks , i think , of working for a big company , is often times , you do have to follow pretty rigid , um , guidelines ,
um , if , if an employee is especially exemplary , i think it 's often ,
in a smaller company it 's a little bit easier for them to say , hey , you know , this person did a wonderful job , give him a big bonus kind of thing .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
a lot of times smaller companies have bonus plans , where i think in a large company it 's hard to do that because there 're just so many people to deal with and you have to have guidelines , you know , for salary increases , and things like that ,
that 's one of the things that , that happens when someone , when you 're dealing with a large company .
uh -huh .
but .
uh -huh .
right  ]
but , we also were interested in , um , you know , being sure that he felt like he liked the people that he would be working with and that there would be some opportunity for friendships that way , so that you would feel happy going to work every day and rather than thinking oh , i really , i can 't stand these people .
but , so that 's something that was important to him , in thinking he could work under .
how long has he been in his present position ?
oh , just since last summer .
uh -huh .
it 's only been , not even a year yet ,
so .
well , i was going to say it sounds like you , you picked out a lot of good things , you know , for him , to , to , uh , to choose in a position and have a lot of thought put into it .
in a big company , though , you also get moved around a lot
yes , well .
he may be having to drive over here to lewisville some time .
oh , yeah .
or we may be having to drive to plano ,
you never know .
you never know ,
we 're hoping that that won 't be the case
uh -huh .
we , i think one of the most deciding factors of why we chose , um , this area is that , um , my husband was raised in irving and so he , we have a lot of family here , his side of the family .
and being ,
when we were down in houston , we were isolated ,
i mean , it 's not that far , but , people would ha -,
we didn 't have anyone in town that was our family .
right .
and although we had really good friends and we had church and school support and things , um , we were anxious to move close to family members , just because we wanted our children to know their grandparents and things like that .
yeah .
we 're very ,
so , that really made a big difference , i think , in why we chose t i , and chose to move this way .
we 're very far from our families ,
and it 's really hard .
i have little children ,
and , um , they were the only grandchildren ,
and so , our , our families are , are really far away .
uh -huh .
in fact , this is a little off the topic , but yesterday , my mother happened to be on a train going from phoenix to , back to chicago and it stopped in dallas for half an hour , so i loaded the kids in the car ,
and we went downtown , and met her train for half an hour , and brought her a little snack and an easter basket
and
oh , that 's nice .
i think it , it made her trip a little bit nicer .
yeah ,
and it is , i think it is important to , you know , want to be close to your family
and ,
yeah ,
and it 's , it 's hard ,
uh -huh .
i mean , just for us to snatch a half hour like that is a special occasion for us .
so , um ,
yeah ,
that 's the same ,
way we felt .
it 's nice . it 's nice that you can have your family close like that .
we 're really enjoying it .
i wonder what it would be like ,
i mean , i wanted to be close to family , but i also thought it would be harder to be close to family .
yeah ,
sometimes it can be .
but it 's turned out really good ,
and i think that , you know , we 're really satisfied with that choice ,
that 's good .
and we , you know , kind of felt like , um , it was worth it to us .
but anyway .
well , i , my children just ran out the door , so i need to go check on them
okay
well i 've really enjoyed the conversation .
well , i have too .
and , uh , nice to have met you ,
and you have a good day .
okay ,
you too .
bye -bye .
bye -bye .
okay
if you want to go first , go ahead .
oh , i think , i think that a woman 's role has come a long way .
we have gone more into the business aspect of , like i say , of , i don 't know , working more ,
and we , i think we 've even gone into more the labor aspect of it also .
yeah ,
definitely .
with the pay and everything , you know .
i feel that , uh , we 've missed as far as the top jobs go .
yeah .
you know , the higher echelon .
uh -huh .
because if you look at most corporations , there isn 't a woman , you know , that 's on the board of directors , or that type of thing ,
they are mostly all men .
uh -huh .
there may be a few , but very incidental .
yeah .
and i really think that it will be a long time , probably , before we see that .
in one sense , i 'm an older person , in my fifties , so i feel that we 've lost some things in the sense that women have to work today .
uh -huh .
you know , that they are not in the home by choice anymore .
uh -huh .
it 's mostly , you know ,
even if you want to say home , you really can 't .
and a lot of times you can 't ,
yeah .
you know , it 's gotten to be a two income family to just survive today between taxes and the cost of living ,
and i don 't think raises have kept up with , you know , a lot of the stuff , you know , as far as your medical insurance and just groceries and gasoline and all , you know .
uh -huh .
so i think that we did come a long way in the sense that we are allowed to vote in , you know , like you say , we 're out in the labor force , but i think we 've lost something too .
yeah ,
my mom , she 's a housewife ,
and , well , there is twelve kids in my family ,
so my mom never could really work , you know , because she was kind of pregnant from day one .
she never really had a chance to work .
yeah .
she worked before she got married ,
but , uh , she , uh , she doesn 't believe in ,
she 's very old fashioned .
she doesn 't believe in the woman working unless she has to .
that 's what i mean ,
yeah .
and you know , there 's a lot of truth to that .
if you are not going to have a family , then that 's fine ,
then , you know , a career is a smart choice .
uh -huh .
and i think it 's great , but if you , you have a family , i think you owe the family a responsibility .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
and to have children and just get a day care or someone to take care of it , and not really have the bonding process that takes place with babies and stuff , you know i , i think that the mother and the child lose ,
yeah .
and i think that 's why there is so many problems you know , with kids today ,
because they don 't have the family roots anymore .
you know , i 'm not saying that , that it 's totally gone , but it 's nothing like what it used to be .
yeah ,
uh -huh .
you know , in that sense .
yeah ,
and also like my mom , my mom thinks ,
i mean she 's kind of right with it ,
when both partners of the marriage work , she feels that that 's taking more away ,
that 's increasing more unemployment for people that need to work .
oh , definitely .
you know , like for , for the men that don 't have jobs ,
if , you know , she feels if there is women out there just because they want to do it , she said , you know , they could stay at home ,
that 's right ,
they don 't want to take care of the kids .
yeah .
and the house and that kind of thing .
that 's very true , but then they shouldn 't have a family .
yeah .
that 's what i 'm saying , you know ,
i think it 's great that women have a choice today .
uh -huh .
that there are ways to prevent families , you know ,
yeah .
like basically there 's contraceptives and all kinds of ways to prevent pregnancies .
there is no need to have children if you don 't want them .
what do you think about that ,
do you think that , uh ,
what do you think about the women that are not having families because they want to continue their business ?
that 's fine ,
that 's , that 's the freedom of choice .
uh -huh .
and i agree with that ,
because anyone who has children that doesn 't really want them isn 't going to be a good parent .
uh -huh .
well , i shouldn 't say they are not going to be a good parent .
they won 't be a caring parent .
uh -huh .
like they won 't have that ,
or they won 't be as good as they could be .
right ,
that 's what i mean ,
they 'll feel like it 's a job .
uh -huh .
it 's not like something that they really wanted .
like i had three children ,
and i mean i , i wanted every one of them .
uh -huh .
i 'm not sorry i had any of them ,
and i worked third shift for a good part of my life just so i would be home with them .
yeah .
you know , i had to work , but i tried to make it as painless as possible .
uh -huh .
in fact , at one time i worked as a second shift ,
and one saturday morning we were all sitting at the breakfast table ,
and the kids were talking , daddy this , daddy that , daddy this , daddy that ,
and i was sitting there .
it was like i didn 't belong anymore .
and it was because i had worked for about nine months ,
and when they were coming home i was going to work .
uh -huh .
and i wasn 't there at supper time or bed time ,
or they couldn 't tell me what went on at school because they would be coming in the door ,
i would be going out .
exactly .
so we were ,
i felt i was losing my family .
uh -huh .
and that 's why i said that 's it ,
i either have to quit or , you know , try something else ,
so i went on third shift .
uh -huh .
and i worked that shift for eleven years .
oh , my .
yeah .
bless you
just so that my kids would have me at home .
uh -huh .
you know , and i feel that 's very important ,
it really is ,
and it 's too bad because mothers miss out on so much too .
uh -huh .
so i mean in the sense that we 've come a long way ,
yes ,
but we 've sacrificed a lot to get there .
yeah ,
i , i agree .
and , uh , i really think that if , uh , like after the second world war when women went to work in factories and all that , that was like out of necessity , because the men weren 't here anymore .
uh -huh .
but then it got to be a point where they got some independence .
and they just enjoyed the income , the extra .
exactly .
a man can afford the necessities , a woman affords the luxuries .
uh -huh .
and i notice today kids , you know ,
like we had apartments before we had homes .
uh -huh .
and we had to walk before we had a car .
exactly .
and now kids at sixteen years old , they have their birthday ,
what do they get ,
they get a car .
oh , i know
and to me , it 's like we 've lost our values in this country .
uh -huh .
we really have ,
and i , i 'm not trying to be , uh , you know , a prude or old fashioned or anything , but i , i don 't think if you , unless you earn something and you 've worked for it , and you have a sense of pride about it ,
because while i did this in , you know , no one gave it to me .
uh -huh .
you will take better care of that ,
and you will prize that possession .
exactly .
more than someone handing something to you .
uh -huh .
and it 's just like college too ,
i think that if a kid goes to college , and you can help them , fine , but i don 't think you should pay the whole way .
see , yeah ,
see , now , my parents , there is no way they could afford to send twelve kids to college .
of course .
and so far there is only two of us that have gone ,
and my older brother has paid his entire way ,
and i 'm on my ,
i have six weeks left
and i 'll , you know , i 'll graduate ,
and i paid my entire way ,
and that 's the way it 'll go down the line ,
and like i don 't have a car because i 'm paying for college ,
and if i want a car ,
my parents always said if we wanted a car , we paid for the car , and we paid for our own insurance ,
and i think that 's right
because ,
sure ,
uh -huh .
yeah .
but i 'll bet your values are a lot higher , you know , and your self esteem and the , the way you , uh , you know , think about things is probably a lot more common sense than these kids that don 't have that responsibility .
uh -huh .
like i 've had my , you know ,
like i know kids up here that have their own cars
and money is just given to them ,
like they still get their allowance ,
they are twenty years old and they still get an allowance .
well , i have held a summer job , you know , since i , you know , i was in the eleventh grade ,
and i have had to take care of my own money ,
i have my own checking account ,
i pay for my own life insurance ,
and i know a lot of kids that don 't even know ,
i mean i tell them i pay for my own life insurance and their mouths just drop to the floor , you know .
sure ,
they probably don 't even have any .
well , if they do , they don 't know it , you know
yeah ,
exactly ,
and that 's what i say , you 'll , you 'll be so much better off for it as you get older ,
because , you know , a lot of kids resent things that parents tell them and stuff ,
but it 's because you 've been there .
uh -huh .
oh , i know .
and no one can tell anyone anything you know , you are going to find out for yourself ,
but i mean i don 't think you should just not listen to advice , even if you don 't take it , just listen .
uh -huh .
you know , there is no harm in that , whereas sometimes you can 't even get that from a kid , you know .
just attention , you know .
uh -huh .
but really , uh ,
uh .
what do you feel the changes in the future , like with the abortions and that type of thing , women in politics and president someday , maybe
actually i think abortion is going to take a turn where there is not going to be as many ,
because i think contraceptives are going to be more popular .
i mean i realize that they are popular now ,
but i think , i really think people are going to start using more contraceptives
and with the abortion , i don 't think there is going to be as many abortions , but i don 't know what women will do when they get into politics , you know , about abortion .
yeah ,
yeah .
i think it will be freedom of choice .
well , i still think people have a choice .
uh -huh .
you know , if you can live with it , and it 's , you know , your conscience is clear then i mean all of us are going to answer to it one day , maybe .
exactly , yeah .
or maybe not .
i don 't know .
uh -huh .
i mean no one has said for sure , you know .
yeah .
but ,
i think if a woman would get into politics or enough women get into politics , i think it will definitely be freedom of choice .
yes ,
yes .
uh -huh .
which i mean i think it should be anyway .
i , i do .
i 'm catholic ,
and we , we are not supposed to , you know , say that that 's okay , but i really feel that it 's freedom of choice .
yeah .
i do .
because i mean you as an individual , what you do , that to me is your business .
uh -huh .
and , uh ,
and different circumstances call for different things .
exactly ,
exactly ,
that 's
okay .
well , i haven 't , uh , you know ,
uh -huh .
when the war was on i watched c n n and , uh , nightline pretty regularly and read the paper and all
but when , uh ,
lately , like the last week or two i guess with easter
and spring break with the kids i , um , i hadn 't been thinking much about the middle east and what 's going on over there .
have you been keeping up ?
well , uh , just really the last couple of days since this , uh , the , u n debate or whatever you want to call it that , uh , voted on whether there was going to be a cease fire .
i guess , you know , the thing really isn 't over .
uh -huh .
they , uh , they had , uh , kind of , uh , i don 't know if you call it standout or whatever
but anyway they stopped and waited to see if iraq would accept a permanent cease fire situation though .
as i understand it , from the iraqi point of view this current cease fire thing that the u n , uh , had set up , you know , the iraqis are probably not going to go for at all ,
uh -huh .
unless they 're just absolutely forced to .
um .
start up .
so , i guess , from what i understand the thing could just it could just , they could take off at any moment without , uh , you know , you know , any local , you know , congressional effort or anything else because , you know , it 's not really settled yet .
there 's no official document signed or anything ?
not yet .
not yet at all .
well , i , um ,
when the , when the crisis began last august i began to think well i , i couldn 't remember things that i had studied in the past in school and all
so i got out like my encyclopedias and tried to read about the history .
uh -huh .
and it was really , what i felt was kind of cynical
because it
there just hasn 't been any peace over there ever
no .
in thousands of years ,
yeah .
i don 't know ,
of history .
why they expect it 's going to start this week , you know .
yeah .
that 's right .
and it just , it 's just not people
they ,
and it 's not , uh , you know ,
there isn 't any real arab coalition because they do fight among themselves .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
and they fight with each other
and they have such hatred for , uh , israel
and ,
yeah .
the , uh , the thing that 's kind of interesting about this ,
my sons in the air force .
oh , yeah .
and , uh , he came within a quarter of an inch of going , uh , to saudi ,
he ended up in korea instead and because of the way they split a transportation group out in lubbock .
um .
so he ended up going to korea
and his buddies ended up going to saudi .
well , he 's still in korea and his buddies home now
oh , no .
he , he almost wishes that , that he could have gone home .
and got it over with .
yeah .
well , i just ,
there 's just no way for us to be involved over there and hope that there will be much peace .
uh -huh .
and , um , with ,
and that i 'm afraid that we would have to stay .
yeah .
the thing , uh , the other thing too , when this all started if you , you know , if you did much reading on the thing , you know , kuwait , the country of kuwait was just , you know , somebody 's uh ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
you go back to world war i when the , uh , ottoman empire broke up and the british and the french and the , yeah , the british and the french mostly decided to carve up that part of the world and call part of it persia and part of it iraq and part of it something else , you know ,
and they , they split things along , um , geographical lines but they didn 't take any kind of consideration into , uh , social or cultural things at all .
right .
yeah .
so , the country of , of kuwait really doesn 't make just a whole lot of sense except that it is an excepted place , you know it 's like any other country , you know ,
for whatever reason it 's , it 's actually there .
well , iraq has had , uh , designs on that place since nineteen twenty -two
so , you know , it wasn 't like something that just suddenly popped up .
yeah .
and it 's just that this was an excuse , you know , to make some noise
now , something that i read in the paper the other day that i thought was kind of interesting was that the arab , uh , uh , their version or vision or whatever the united states , now , is somewhat changed in that we won , you know .
yeah .
now , now we are a , uh , a legitimate player ,
in the game over there , you know ,
the , the ,
i don 't think we can really understand their attitude because there cultures are just so much different .
right .
but , uh , we are now a legitimate player in the , in the , in the game because we came in with a certain amount of force and we , you know we defeated ,
you know iran couldn 't do it in seven years
and we went in and did in seven days what iran couldn 't do in seven years , you know .
right .
right
so that kind of ups our stock in there just a little bit .
it makes us more legitimate .
so , now what they 're saying is that , well , since we won whatever we say goes because it 's , uh , a kind of a might make strike sort of attitude about it
and , you know , we 've got the power .
yeah .
which is why for centuries or hundreds of years the british and the french had so much influence in there
because they 'd go in and they 'd win something .
right .
right .
and then , and then they could call the shots for the , you know , period of time until the next strong man came up and , you know and caused problems .
well , i just , uh ,
i 'm not interested in keeping big military over there and having to go and call the shots like you say .
yeah .
yeah .
and i just would prefer that , i mean sometimes we 've said let 's keep , we 're not interested in what other countries do .
uh -huh .
and then other times we jump in and do things
and while i 'm glad that they ,
uh , i ,
it was important de -, demilitarize that area because of all the build up armaments .
yeah .
i don 't ,  
i hope we don 't try to keep , uh , in there and try to keep our fingers in the pot and try to ,
um .
stay over there
because we just don 't want to send our people there and make them stay .
yeah .
that 's , that 's the , uh , that 's , that 's the big thing , you know ,
we still got a little bit of the old , you know , vietnam , um , problem , you know , in the back of our minds .
yeah .
we , we got this ,
we 're , we 're used to wars where you can get in do the job and get out .
vietnam we never did get out , you know , never did get the job done because they were too  ham strung 
yeah .
uh , this thing
they , they gave the guys , uh , the power and the material and the , told them to go do it and they did it . you know ,
yeah .
got in and got out .
i 'm not sure ,
the , the big fuss that we 're going to see now for the next few weeks i would think is , uh , you know , the , uh , the business with the , uh , the shiites of all people , you know , in the southern part of the country and also the kurds
because these people evidently are , you know , being killed off by the thousands .
yeah .
and whether the , the united nations ,
i don 't think the u . s . will do it on their own
but whether the united nations comes around and says , hey , wait a minute we know this thing isn 't , uh , all that much over , we 've got to go back in there and , and be sure that this large population isn 't just wiped out .
uh -huh .
which is , seems to be exactly what 's happening right at the moment .
uh -huh .
i noticed that .
but , um , you know ,
well , i don 't think there 's much hope for a lasting peace over there like they ,
oh , well ,
expect .  ]
no .
no ,
there , there never will be .
yeah .
i mean , uh , uh , the only way that you 're going to have peace over there , if , if we determine that we want to go in and wipe out every last one of them ,
you know , until we make a decision to do that there won 't be peace but i don 't think we want to make that decision either .
no .
so that 's , that 's a little rough , you know ,
we 're not , we 're not quite up to that sort of thing .
no .
so
well , i guess i better go
i have a repairman just came ,
oh
for my refrigerator ,
but ,
oh , well , that 's , that 's fun .
yeah .
well , i enjoyed the topic .
i hope you have a good day .
you too .
okay .
bye -bye .
bye -bye .
okay .
hi ,
i , uh , i like , i love to do , uh , all kinds of crafts and sewing ,
i , i find that 's my one release
so .
uh -huh .
what do you do ?
um , i like to do like physical things like sports .
uh -huh .
um , i really enjoy softball
and my favorite is volleyball ,
uh -huh .
and , but , i 'm at school ,
i 'm in , you know ,
i li -, i live up at the college ,
uh -huh .
so sometimes it 's hard for me to do that ,
so i just , like sometimes ,
i like , just to get away ,
i go to my room and i like walk in , turn the radio on , or , you know , just kind of like veg out or something .
uh -huh .
well i have two small kids
and so , i , i don 't have , you know , much time to , to go places and play sports , you know ,
uh -huh .
i have to do something where i can do it at home .
so , i 'm , uh , i just love to sew
and , uh , you know , i ma -, i make a lot of my christmas presents ,
uh -huh .
and i love to do all kinds of crafts and stuff like that .
i like to do that stuff , but when i 'm in , like when i 'm at school , i don 't have time to do it or even time to learn how to do it .
no ,
i remember when i was in college ,
i didn 't have time to do that stuff either .
it was really ,
yeah .
but now , you know , i don 't have a whole lot of time now but i have more time than i did ,
so .
uh -huh .
and a lot of my sewing i kind of do out of necessity , you know ,
for ,
you know , i 've got two kids to put clothes on ,
so .
yeah ,
exactly ,
uh -huh .
like , um , we -, i have , i come from a family of twelve children ,
oh .
and when i 'm up here , i really miss my younger brothers and sisters ,
so you know , that 's , that 's a change , because there 's nine of them that are younger than me .
uh -huh .
  i 'll call ho -, like when i know my mom and dad aren 't home , i 'll call home just to talk to my little brothers and sisters .
i , i really miss them a lot
so i don 't ,
i guess talking on the phone is one of my hobbies too .
yeah ,
i ,
yeah ,
i just , uh , have , you know , one brother and he 's married ,
and , you know , they have a couple kids ,
so i , you know , i don 't have , uh , you know , i don 't get on the phone too much .
but , yeah
most of my stuff is just going pla -,
you know i enjoy going places with my kids
and i do like sports , but i 'm , you know , i don 't have a lot of time for them .
my ,
i like volleyball .
of all sports , i think that would be my favorite , because i hate basketball
an , an ,
yeah ,
well , i 'm not much of a basketball fan either .
yeah ,
i enjoy playing volleyball but i , you know , i , i don 't have a lot of time to do it ,
so .
uh -huh ,
yeah .
it 's maybe once a year or something
an ,
and then i , you know , used to play it a lot when i was in school ,
but now that i 'm married and stuff i , you know i 've like , i 'm really bad .
nobody would want me on their team .
i 'm the , you know , i 'm the opposing teams best player , so , so to speak ,
so .
uh -huh .
but , yeah ,
i enjoy , um , you know , just ,
i , you know , i have varied interests and stuff
and yeah ,
so .
yeah ,
um , not that i like reading , but i do do a lot of reading while i 'm here at school .
uh -huh .
do you like reading as a hobby ?
uh , i love to read , but i , you know , i don 't have a lot of time to read an ,
yeah .
you know , what reading i do , i kind of do because it 's , you know , it 's the necessary stuff
as far as fun reading , you know , i maybe get to read the sunday paper , but , that 's about it , you know ,
so .
yeah .
yeah ,
i don 't have a lot of time to read .
i , yeah , i remember in college , i did a lot of reading , most of it text books ,
so .
uh -huh .
and , just ,
you know keeping busy with everything else going on ,
so . but yeah ,
i , i like to do , uh ,
i 've made stuffed cows , you know , dress , you know , dolls ,
they 're like dolls ,
the -,
uh -huh .
you know , you make clothes for them and everything like that .
yeah .
they , those have been real popular with my family .
i 've had them calling up and saying , will you make me another one
and , so , i do things like that , you know ,
if i had more time , i 'd probably do it and sell the stuff
but , you know , i don 't have enough time to do it to really , you know , take orders on it ,
uh -huh ,
yeah .
you know , it 's like i can only do it when i have time .
i have a whole stack of material and patterns to sew up as it is ,
so .
do you , um ,
i know one thing that 's pretty popular with the girls up here at college , and i make them also , is the padded covered photo albums ?
oh yeah ,
uh -huh ,
i do ,
i 've done those too , before ,
yeah .
uh -huh .
those are real ,
i , i have a co -, several of those that i 've made like as wedding gifts , you know .
i made them out of all lace and , and satin , you know , and made them as wedding gifts and stuff like that ,
so .
yeah .
those are real popular ,
in fact , i got some of those for my wedding ,
so .
uh -huh .
i know they 're real popular here at school , also .
uh -huh ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
those are fun to do ,
and just little things , you know ,
i , i didn 't have a lot of ,
when i was in college i did , you know ,
like caller a is whispering to someone else in the room >>.
i did sewing for other people when i had time , you know ,
like if somebody needed a bridesmaids , maids dress made , i 'd make that ,
but that 's about all the sewing i did ,
i never had time for , you know , to sew myself a new dress or anything like that
so , but , yeah .
uh -huh .
i just kind of sew for my kids
and that 's about it ,
so .
well , i guess maybe we 've co -, covered the topic , pretty good .
yeah .
i really don 't have any other .
yeah ,
i 'm not too much , uh , you know ,
i don 't have a lot of hobbies ,
mine are just mostly , you know things i just do out of necessity .
uh -huh .
okay ,
well , it 's been nice talking to you .
it was nice talking to you too .
good luck in school .
thanks .
 bye , bye 
 bye , bye . 
all right ,
do you do garden work ?
as little as possible .
uh -huh .
i 'm a college student so if i do any garden work , it 's only when i go home in the summer .
oh , where do you go to college ?
where 's that ?
it 's about two hours north of pittsburgh .
oh , okay .
yes .
yes .
well , do you , you know , do you do gardening at home ?
yeah ,
we go home ,
well , we have a large family ,
there 's twelve kids in my family .
oh my goodness .
so , like almost all our vegetables and everything is from the garden .
hm .
so we have a pretty good size garden
yeah ,
well i guess you glad you got to go to college so you 'd get some rest
but we have like a lot ,
like my mom likes flowers , so we have a lot of flowers too .
yeah .
i had a whole bunch of flowers and things .
well , i don 't have as many now .
uh -huh .
we lived in the country for a long time ,
and i had a whole bunch .
but now , i work and i live in the city so , that sort a kind of hung it up .
i have a few flowers , but most of mine are like in barrels and things like that .
uh -huh .
and this year i decided that ,
well my husband made a little garden out there with some tomatoes and stuff in it ,
but i decided that i don 't like grass ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i don 't like to have to have to pull grass so i decided that i would plant me a tomato plant in a flower pot and see how it worked .
and mine looks real good
you know , i 've seen a lot of people that do that .
yeah .
uh -huh .
i 've seen , you know , like elderly people that really can 't get out too much   sometimes .
like we ,
i have a great aunt that lives in a ,
it 's just like , uh , a high rise for elderly people .
and , you know , she does her own thing and everything ,
but she has ,
it 's like a little apartment building .
and she has a tomato plant year round .
oh .
because she , you know ,
they keep it warm with , for all the older people ,
and she keeps it year round .
i had never thought about that .
i could probably plant one and bring it in , and just like i bring my plants in every year .
that 'd be neat .
well , i got a patio ,
and i tried to talk my husband into just buying a whole bunch of pots
uh -huh .
and planting them all in it , you know , because that 's favorite thing , is tomatoes to grow .
and so , um , but he said , no ,
he was going to plant in the earth , you know , like he always has ,
because he 's always had a garden out in the country .
uh -huh .
and i think he kind of misses it a little bit , you know , since we moved to the city .
but , um , i went ahead and planted one , and mine looks better than his
it does ,
and then i like , um ,
you know what day lilies are ?
pardon me ?
day lilies .
are they , well ,
uh -huh .
do they just come out in the morning then go   but we call them morning glories up here .
no ,
no .
huh -uh .
these look like a lily .
they look like a , a , well , they really look like an orchid when they come out .
oh really .
uh -huh .
that what the look like ,
but they only bloom for one day .
oh .
they 'll , um ,
you 'll have a bud the evening before ,
and then the next morning as soon as the sun hits it , it open -, it starts opening up
and then when it gets dark , it closes
and that 's it .
it only blooms for one day .
and then it 's done , completely done .
uh -huh .
oh .
yeah .
but , um , they look like orchids , is what they look like ,
but they look like different color ones ,
like i have , uh , yellow ones ,
and i have red ones ,
uh -huh .
and i have purple ones
oh , yeah .
and then they have like , you know , the real velvety looking stuff inside it looks just like orchids in different colors .
that 's what they look like .
oh ,   really pretty .
they are , they 're beautiful .
uh , i have a friend when i lived out in the country ,
and she had belonged to this kind of society that like every year , you know , or every so many months they would send you different bulbs that they came out with .
uh -huh .
and i mean they were real expensive .
they were like , well ,
the most expensive one that she gave me a bulb for was like thirty -two fifty for one bulb .
oh , my gosh .
so what she would do is she would plant them , and they multiplied .
uh -huh .
so the next year when she , you know , weeded them out so they wouldn 't be as thick , then she 'd give me some of the bulbs .
and , i mean , i have some of the most beautiful day lilies that you 've ever seen .
so , when we decided to move , it was really funny because , like i said , i had a whole bunch of different kinds of things ,
and i kept saying , well , i want to take a few of these , and i want to take these , and i want to take these .
my husband finally said , look , are we going to take the grass ?
can we leave the grass ?
i said , yes , we may leave that .
  take the whole grass , the whole yard .
and we had a tree that was like seventeen foot tall , or something like that , that he said , no , no , i am not taking the tree .
you know , i mean , every time we went outside , he 'd look at something that was humongous , you know ,
no ,
we 're not taking that .
but the last day , he said , can 't we leave the grass ,
and i said , yeah ,
i think we will leave that .
that 'd be funny .
but , i brought ,
uh -huh .
my kids , when they were little they had given me some azaleas so i brought all my azalea bushes .
yeah .
uh -huh .
and you know , i brought , i brought as much as i could bring without , you know , really tearing up their place .
but , just like , um , you know ,
the people that bought ours , bought the place , but , um , i knew that they would , you know ,
if i left like one bulb of each one of them , by this year they 'd have ten bulbs of each one of them .
yeah .
so , it wasn 't like it was going to be this big raw place or something , you know ,
it would cover it right up .
uh -huh .
but , i just couldn 't see it , you know , going off and leaving everything like that .
yeah .
because this house , i really liked it and everything , but the yard was a lot to be desired .
oh .
oh there was nothing .
these people ,
we have one ugly pine tree .
i mean , and it is ugly .
i even tried making it look nicer , you know ,
i tied the yellow ribbon around it ,
and it was so ugly .
oh , it did not help , let me tell you .
i took it off and put it on my door .
i did not want to call attention .
i mean , it was terrible .
so really the plants that i brought over and put out here are just about all .
uh -huh .
i don 't do any of the mowing or , you know , edging and all that my husband does all that stuff .
but that 's because i 'm allergic to the grass .
oh , that 'd be awful .
i love going out in the summer in the grass .
really .
uh -huh .
now i like to go to the beach where the sand is ,
because then it doesn 't make me ill
yeah .
and , um , well even up here at school , you know , it gets hot , and we have the windows open ,
well they mow the grass up here sometimes six o 'clock in the morning .
and just to smell the grass , it 's just ,
i just love the smell of freshly cut grass .
yeah ,
i used to until it , i got so allergic to it .
i don 't know if it 's all , well ,
i went and had some tests run and just about all the kinds i was allergic to .
but it 's not as bad here ,
like saint augustine , i think , is what we have .
and it 's not as bad as it was when we were out in the country .
uh -huh .
but out in the country , i mean ,
if i went outside while he was mowing the grass , i was going to have a gigantic attack .
oh my gosh .
so , um , i get shots for it now , too .
that helps a whole bunch .
uh -huh .
but , one good thing about it , see i don 't have to mow the grass
or  
i mean , that 's really nice .
yeah ,
you said that you had a garden .
what all things do you plant in it ,
or do you like to plant in it ?
uh -huh .
well , the first thing we always plant is tomatoes every year .
i don 't care if we don 't have anything else ,
we 're going to have tomatoes .
and then we plant cucumbers
and ,
uh -huh ,
do your cucumbers come good ?
oh yeah .
really .
sometimes when my dad has , like ,
that 's the one thing no one is allowed to touch except my dad .
he takes care of all the cucumbers ,
because he said the vines are just so ,
at our house , as soon as you touch a vine , it 's like it completely dies .
really ,
uh -huh .
it must be the , uh ,
sometimes we have really good luck with them ,
but then there 'll be like maybe two years in a row that we can 't get anything .
now that 's , i mean , that 's something that grows like a weed here .
oh , wow .
i mean , it grows like a weed .
we have to allow extra room for those , because , you know , i mean extra space ,
 yeah
because they take up a lot . 
 between the rows and all .
yes ,
but  i mean , we usually get ,
if we plant , for every one plant we probably get fifty to sixty cucumbers off of it .
holy smoke .
i mean , just pulling them as fast as you can .
we usually give them to everybody .
uh -huh .
anybody that wants a cucumber can have it .
uh -huh .
but we tried it , too , where you run it up a fence and , um , we had some weird cucumbers because they grew inside the fence .
i mean like the little thing would be half on one side and half on the other .
oh my gosh .
i mean , it was ,
but they 're so heavy , you know ,
they get so heavy they kind of weigh it down .
but , i mean , cucumbers here grow like crazy .
wow .
of course it 's real hot here too .
well , see , tomatoes grow like crazy at our house .
like we have a section of tomatoes ,
and we put the tomatoes there every year , in the same section .
and i swear we get tomatoes six rows up .
yeah ,
yeah ,
now if we have any , like the birds will pick or something , you know ,
and some of the seeds drop .
have you ever had them just come up in different places ?
uh -huh .
i know , we do that , too , you know ,
and at the first year ,
because i was from the city when we got married ,
and the first year that we planted , i couldn 't figure out , i mean , the ,
uh -huh .
well , the first year after i mean , we planted them ,
yeah .
but the first year , you know , after we 'd had a crop all these little things like ,
we had cucumbers coming up , you know , in the middle of our okra ,
uh -huh .
and i thought , how did this get here i know i didn 't put that seed there .
and it was weird , but the birds had , you know , evidently just deposited them for us .
uh -huh .
well , sometimes , too , when we take out our garbage ,
uh -huh .
and we usually , you know , we just dump it in the middle of the garden , you know , after your garden 's basically done and we 're finding out ,
like we have peach trees in the middle of our garden now , because we took peach seeds and dump them there , whenever the garden ,
like in the fall ,
now we have peach trees coming up ,
are you in the market for a car recently ?
yeah ,
i just bought a car .
oh , what did you get ?
i got a nineteen ninety -three cavalier station wagon .
uh -huh ,
what , what convinced you to get that one ?
uh -huh .
well , a friend of my father 's , and he 'd driven it all over the country and it runs great .
oh , incredible ,
how many miles on it ?
it 's like , it has a hundred and fifty -three thousand .
and it 's still running real well .
yeah .
oh , great ,
yeah .
we have , uh , right now we have two cars , uh ,
uh -huh .
i have , my husband and myself and we have two sons who are drivers and one of which is a , um , an eighty -eight plymouth voyager van ,
and then we have , um ,
uh -huh .
about a year ago , we picked up a second hand , uh , uh , audi and , uh , that was a ca -, you know , a sedan ,
and , uh , we got that .  
the major things ,
the reason why we got that is we had had a nova ,
and a ,
well ,
my son was driving ,
and someone came into his lane and hit him ,
and fortunately he was able to ,
his ,
uh -huh .
i mean he was checked out of the hospital , was out of the hospital by that night , but the car was completely totalled and mike , and , they had been , my two sons had been a passenger in a car about a year and a half before that , which was hit by another car .
um .
so i mean , i got , i was getting really nervous ,
so i finally said , we , i want a really solid car .
so we found the audi second hand .
right .
i guess right now my criteria for cars is , uh , of being solid , able to take an impact and , uh , so , uh , i , we 're not going to be in the market for , in the near future for any new car .
uh -huh
but the things that i would want would be a solid car .
another thing i 'd definitely want would be anti -lock brakes .
right .
uh , our , our van , which is a , a delight to drive , does not have ,
i think the brakes on the plymouth van is just , are terrible .
um .
if the road is at all wet , and i 'm ,
and i don 't go all that fast , but the , uh , it , it just doesn 't hold .
it doesn 't hold well at all .
so , i , i definitely want to get anti lock brakes .
so , i don 't know ,
do you have any particular things that , that are priorities on your list .
well , it 's ,
yeah .
i didn 't really need power windows , but it has power , you know , windows and steering and air conditioning ,
and , and uh .
i guess down here air conditioning 's a must , isn 't it .
uh -huh ,
oh , yeah .
uh -huh .
it has a stereo and a cassette player and , um , he 's told me it gets forty -two miles to the gallon .
that 's incredible .
uh -huh .
that is incredible .
so .
uh , we , we get about , our , the van gets , on highways , can get about twenty -eight .
the audi does not have good mileage .
that 's the one drawback .
it 's a powerful car .
uh -huh .
um , but it does not , uh ,
i mean , i , if i 'm on a highway and i can get twenty , twenty -one miles per gallon , i consider that luck -, i 'm lucky .
maybe , maybe sometimes i 've gotten twenty -two .
uh -huh .
it comes out around the eighteen or nineteen local driving and that 's a , to me is a real drawback .
i wish i would , you know , i could settle for twenty -eight ,
uh -huh .
but , uh , the , uh , the frills on that car are nice , but they 're not necessary , for me except air conditioning .
in this area , uh , in washington d c area , it gets hot and humid .
uh -huh ,
it 's really humid .
yeah ,
uh , so air conditioning is def -, uh , definitely a necessity for us through two or three months in the summer .
um , but i , uh , i , i don 't need , uh , you know ,
power windows are nice , but i don 't need them
right .
although i must say when you 're driving in the east and there are all these toll roads , come into a toll road , you just push that button down ,
it 's real nice for that window to zip down and zip up , instead of having to crank it .
crank ,
yeah .
yeah ,
but , or , you know , if you want to have open windows , to be able to op -,
right .
if you 're alone in the car just to press buttons , and .
you don 't have to stretch .
but you know , i 've lived all these years without them ,
i probably could have lived a little longer
that 's true .
uh -huh .
uh , one of the things that we have , uh , we 've liked when we gotten a new car , and this , this used car has it , is a sun roof and those are really nice in good weather .
that 's right .
so , so i guess if we get a new car , it definitely would have to have an -, anti lock brakes ,
uh -huh .
i 'd love to get an air bag and a sun roof , and , uh , just so it 'd be a good solid car .
i guess that those are m -, my major criteria .
everything else is , you know , a luxury ,
and they ,
make the car more expensive , but they often add more things to repair when things go wrong .
right .
so , uh , if you were to buy a new car now , a brand new car , what would you look for ?
um , like you said , anti -lock brakes and air bag ,
yeah ,
yeah .
and , uh , i 'd , i 'd really like to have a car that 's dependable that , that you drive , you know , like a american made car that 's as dependable as mercedes or somebody , you know that 's ,
isn 't that true .
it 's , it 's funny , um , uh , that you use ,
the audi 's german , and i have to say , it has been pretty dependable .
uh -huh .
yeah ,
sometimes , one advantage of an american made car , is if you get stuck anywhere , most local garages can fix you up .
yeah ,
they have parts ,
uh -huh .
right ,
but once you get , if you , once you get something fancy , you get stuck somewhere off of the main area you can be really ,
and the parts , i know the audi parts are terribly expensive .
uh -huh .
i mean , it jus -,
i shudder .
i would not get the audi again , just for that reason .
but i would love , i wish an american , an american , that , you know , engineering would make something as solid as a german car .
right .
you know , we certainly have the technology ,
but , it 's amazing ,
when we bought this audi ,
i mean , everything is more solid in it .
right .
uh , if ,
uh -huh .
you don 't feel you 've got any of the flabby plastic and i know ,
and i , i , and i 'm willing to give up a little bit in the mileage for a solid car .
i don 't think i have to give up as much as i 'm giving up .
right .
but , do you need air conditioning down there ?
yes ,
yeah .
we really do because even today it 's supposed to get up into the nineties .
so
oh , we 've had eleven days in a row over ninety .
uh -huh .
they 've in fact had to excuse school down here because of that .
um .
well , listen ,
i enjoyed talking with you .
it was nice talking to you .
okay ,
and enjoy , enjoy your car .
yeah ,
have a nice summer .
thank you ,
you too ,
it 's going to be a hot one .
yeah .
okay ,
bye -bye
bye -bye .
do you have any ?
i 'm trying to think offhand
i can 't think of anything , you know .
i have , i have one ,
okay .
  and it 's a real pet peeve of mine .
it seems i , i do work during the day
and when i 'm home , uh , you know i 'm either cooking or running doing ,
uh -huh .
things or , uh , laundry or stuff .
and i hate when the phone rings and it turns out to be a telephone salesman .
oh
and it 's real ,
the two pet peeves that ,
number one , i really feel that that 's my private , you know , my own home .
uh -huh .
and i ha -,
and if i want something , i will get it .
uh -huh .
i will go out and get it myself .
and i will never , i never buy anything from a telephone ,
oh , i wouldn 't ,
salesperson .
either ,
no .
uh -huh .
so , i really feel that it is a real invasion , they 're invading my time and my space by , you know , interfering in whatever i 'm doing
fr -,
and i ,
it really bothers me .
uh -huh .
um , it 's a little bit like junk mail but except you can 't , you know , ignore it , uh , quite as easily .
yeah .
and i , i try to be polite ,
but at the same point ,
that doesn 't always work .
well , i just say thank you very much for calling but i 'm not interested ,
and then i hang up before they can say anything .
oh , really ?
yes ,
and it works very well
oh
because you don 't hear , you know how ,
they can say anything they want
it 's just ,
but i just feel that 's my big thing on the invasion of , my thing on invasion of privacy .
uh -huh .
and , um , i have , uh , i sort of have a sort like
you can prevent yourself from getting junk mail by getting yourself off of mailing lists .
i wish that there were a way that you could , um , get your tele -, you know , submit your telephone number to the phone company and have a penalty for anyone who calls you to sell things ,
uh -huh ,
from a busi -,
well , how do you get your name off the junk mailing list ?
uh , you , you , you , you do that by , uh , um ,
the postal service has some information which you fill out and they send ,
it 's for every company ,
i mean you can 't do it for any compan -,
uh -huh .
you know , but you can then send it
and they can pro -,
they tell ,
that company is not allowed to sent it , you any junk mail .
oh , really ?
if you get junk mail on a regular basis from any particular company you can ,
oh , i didn 't even know that .
yeah ,
yeah ,
you have to go to the post office and ask them for the form that you fill out to , not to get , you know , junk mail from specific companies .
oh , wow .
yeah .
and i wish there were something like that where you can call the telephone company and you could say that , uh , have your na -, your number put in a registry .
uh -huh .
and then anyone making these calls have to check that registry for that area and could not , should , and is not allowed under penalty of , you know , being reported or something to call you .
yeah .
so that would be one way of doing it .
i can 't really think of anything that invades my privacy ,
but one of my pet peeves , you came up with the telephone is , when you have an answering machine and they hang up before they leave a message .
uh -huh .
i can 't stand that .
i think that is so stupid , you know ,
because ,
oh , i 'm guilty of that sometimes
because i 've called and there really wasn 't any significant message
and i , and i wasn 't going to be available to be called back .
uh -huh .
and it was sort of like , oh , the hell ,
i 'm not going to spend the time giving , leaving a message ,
and , uh , i 'll call later ,
yeah .
if i 'm available .
the other thing that , um , that there is recourse to and that 's another thing , is when you , you use your credit card and then they ask for a telephone number .
uh -huh .
well , leg -, legally now they 're not allowed ,
they 're n -,
you do not have to give a telephone number .
oh , really ?
yes .
uh -huh .
and i don 't really like announcing in public you know , when you 're sitting there ,
my telephone and i don 't like the wa -, way telephone numbers can be used .
uh -huh .
we once had a situation where someone was using a credit card number of ours and he actually had our phone number ,
but it turned out  it had to have been  my husband 's office phone number .
and , uh , we were able , we weren 't actually able to trace it , but we were able to , to  discard  the charges .
uh -huh .
um , but it was ,
i don 't like how they a -,
the ,
i , i realize that this is your identification
but i worked with someone that got hold of his ,
uh -huh .
charge cards ,
uh -huh .
and his social security number .
yeah ,
same with my husband .
it was the charge card and social security number .
and , you know , i don 't , i don 't like , i don 't g -, ever get anything over the phone because i don 't want to give my social security number out .
well , you should never give the social security number .
uh , if sometimes , if you charge ,
uh -huh .
sometimes i charge theater tickets over the phone .
and then , you know , because they pick them up at the box office we 'll call .
but , um , that 's the only thing i would ever have ever used it for the phone
and that was because i initiated it .
yes .
uh -huh .
uh , and occasionally i do order things from catalogs over the phone .
but again it 's , i initiate it not the company .
the other thing is though you do not have to ,
if you 're buying something in a store and they as -, and you pay for it by charge and they ask you for your telephone number , you do not have to give it .
that is one , that 's a law that went into effect , i don 't know a year or two ago .
oh , i never even knew that .
and , uh , you can just say i 'm sorry that yo -, uh , i 'm not required to give that by law
and then they won 't ,
a lot of stores will still ask .
uh -huh .
but , uh , the credit card company , you know , accepts the charges .
i mean it -,
a rea -,
the credit cards company 's responsibility .
uh -huh .
well , is there any ,
so wha -,  in this   ,
like pet peeves that you have that don 't necessarily invade your privacy ?
um , well , this would , this is limited to the privacy issue , the invasion of privacy .
oh , okay .
yeah ,
and i guess , uh , that was my , that 's probably my biggest one in terms of invasion of privacy . for people outside the family , of course ,
i 've got little pet peeves , you know , with my family .
you know . but of course , th -,
i guess that just comes with the , uh , with the territory with a family that
 does a mother can do  some privacy .
i really ,
but , uh ,
uh -huh .
can 't think of any that would invade my privacy you know .
nothing that you felt that , you know ,
any experiences you 've had at work ?
no .
i , you know , othe -,
i , i really can 't say anything that would really bother me .
so many things i think over the years have been , um , accepted , i mean when you , uh , that are no longer done .
uh -huh .
i mean i can remember when i was very young , much younger and i applied for a job
they said , well , d -,  aren 't  you planning to have children .
well , i mean , that 's none of their business .
yeah .
and but of course , now by law they  can 't  ask that .
yeah .
so i mean there has been i think a lot to , done to protect privacy .
yeah ,
especially between women and ,
how do you feel ,
you know , like aids and all that stuff ?
uh -huh .
you know , with se -, you know , your sex ,  you know 
yeah .
i -,
i -,
they 've gotten a lot with , uh ,
applications and stuff and aren 't allowed to ask .
that 's right .
do you feel that drug testing is an invasion of privacy ?
no ,
because ,
or aids testing ?
i think it 's for the better of like i -,
you mean like for working and stuff ?
yeah ,
uh -huh .
no ,
i don 't because i think whenever , and something like that
they 're looking out for everyone .
they 're not ,
yeah .
you know , i think it 's more safety than anything else .
i feel that way too .
i sometimes feel th -, you know , sometimes individual rights including the right to privacy have to be sacrificed for a greater benefit .
yeah .
because i know ,
you know , for example airline pilots .
i mean i do want my pilot to be sober
yeah .
because i know ,
i worked at a still mill in this summer .
and i know ,
uh -huh .
that , um , i 've covered for people that came in drunk , you know , on the late shift or something ,
yeah ,
yeah .
and it , and it 's dangerous .
i don 't even like having them around .
i kind of do their work for them because they make it more hazardous than what it is without them , you know .
that 's right .
yeah ,
i know i -,
yeah ,
i feel , you know , i think some of the people that oppose , you know , mandatory drug testing for certain areas say , well , it 's not ,
so , uh , let 's see wh -, what was the topic ,
i forgot
  we are supposed to talk ,
advice for people taking for parents , uh , help their kids through college .
yeah ,
do you have any children ?
no ,
i just graduated from college .
oh , did you ?
yes .
where did you go ?
i went to clarion .
clarion .
uh -huh .
huh , uh , would you , i mean , if you had children , would you want them to go to a certain place
or ,
um , i would want them to make that decision
and i would , you know ,
yeah .
uh , i pretty much made my decision on my own and my b -, older brother , likewise .
uh -huh .
and , uh , you know , we , we were both pretty much happy with what we did .
yeah .
so , i think , i would not push them towards any one place .
uh -huh .
yeah ,
i know ,
i kind of feel the same way
i , i just finished college a couple years ago
and i , uh , you know ,
it was while i had my family and everything and it was a lot harder ,
but , uh , you know , i went to a college that was fairly local
and i feel like my education , you know ,
you get out of it what you put into it , i think .
uh -huh .
but , you know , i know ,
it 's ,
some people are real adamant about , you know , going to a certain school or whatever .
uh -huh .
i do not know ,
i guess it , a lot of it would depend on maybe what your major was or something ,
i do not know .
but ,
yeah ,
exactly .
but ,
i think one of the first things kids ought to look for is , first of all , they have to decide what they want to major in .
uh -huh .
and then , you know , find a school that 's good for that .
yeah .
is that why you picked the school you did
or ,
well i picked it for a couple of reasons , it was only about an hour and ten minutes away from home ,
uh -huh .
so it was far enough away that i was away ,
yeah .
but yet close enough if i ever wanted to go home , i could .
yeah .
uh ,
so you lived there at school then ?
pardon me .
you lived there at school .
yeah ,
i lived up at school .
uh -huh .
yeah .
uh , another reason was , uh , i paid for my entire education .
uh -huh .
so i had to look for something that i could afford economically .
right .
you know , and , uh , clarion was , oh , it was roughly around six thousand a year .
uh -huh .
and that was for tuition
and ,
yeah ,
that was for everything .
and now , i did not go out a lot
and i did not order out a lot ,
uh -huh .
and i , you know , i did not spend money on myself .
uh -huh .
but , uh , then again , i was there for school
so ,
yeah .
uh , and then another reason was i was not sure , you know ,
i always wanted to go to school for nursing , and then at the last minute , i changed my mind .
uh -huh .
and i knew that clarion was known , you know ,   for two things ,
actually , for their ,
uh -huh .
they are known as a teacher 's school and also for their business .
so , that 's what i ended up going for is for business .
for business .
uh -huh .
so , uh , are you working somewhere then
or ,
no ,
no
not yet ,
i am moving shortly ,
so i am not looking around here .
oh , i see ,
where are you going to move to ?
uh , maryland .
oh , are you ?
uh -huh .
do you have friends there
or ,
my fiancee is down there
oh , i see .
so , does he work for a company down there ?
yeah ,
he works for the government .
oh , i see .
oh , the big company .
yeah
so , yeah ,
i , i have been working for t i for about twelve years , i guess .
so ,
uh -huh .
but i am not originally , i am originally from illinois , but , you know , i have gone to college , i guess a few different places ,
but i think , you know , mo -, for the most part , you know , the teachers have been pretty good and i have got out of it what i have , what i have put into it .
uh -huh .
so , but , you know , i think , i think that 's most of it personally ,
but that 's why i , you know , with my kids , i think that , you know , i am just going to encourage them to go .
and i am going to try to help them financially
but , uh , i think , you know , financially , i am ,
there 's only so much i can do for them ,
exactly .
and i will say , here 's what you have got ,
you can either , you know , go a couple of years locally and , you know , then if you want to move off to a more expensive school then , we might be able to handle it . but ,
uh -huh .
otherwise , you can just go for four years , you know , somewhere and i will try to , try to help you . but , uh , i do not know , you know , the financial end of it , like you said .
i put my wife through school too .
of course t i paid for a lot of the tuition and books and stuff , but , uh , it still was a challenge to do .
and , uh , so , i think , you know , financially that 's , that 's one of the big aspects .
exactly ,
yeah .
you know , you ,
it does have a lot of bearing on it , whether you are paying for yourself ,
right .
or whether your parents are , you know .
yeah .
well , did you , uh , since you were paid for school yourself , do you think you had a different outlook on it , like your grades and things like that ?
uh , yeah ,
because i was paying for it myself , i kind of slacked off ,
because i felt it was mine and i could do with it what i wanted .
uh -huh .
i think if my parents would have paid for it they would have been on me , you know ,
uh -huh .
uh , they pretty much got to the point ,
well , well , you know , you are at that age
and you are going to have to decide what you want to do .
if you goof ,
right .
up , it 's your fault ,
it 's not ours , you know .
right .
and then , lets me go
and , i mean , i did not do poorly .
i finished with a two five ,
that 's not that wonderful either .
uh -huh ,
yeah .
but , uh , you know , i , i mean i worked ,
i did not , you know ,
yeah .
goof around ,
i worked .
right .
it was just harder , you know ,
  i do not know ,
i was used to being , you know , on top
and when i started there , it was like , you are mediocre ,
so .
yeah .
well see , i think , you know ,
i have known a lot of people that would go to school and their parents paid for it
and , and i guess it depends on the way you are raised too ,
but if you , if you grow to expect that , you know ,
uh -huh .
you kind of go there as sort of a vacation , you know ,
yeah .
i ,
that 's the way a lot of my friends did it
and , you know , they were not , they did not take it very serious .
i know i took it real serious ,
 'cause i did not start to college until , you know , i was about eight or ten years and , uh , you know , out of what i should have been in school .
uh -huh .
but , uh , you know , so i think that helped me be real serious about it .
and i , i ended up graduating with like a three point six .
oh , wow ,
that 's really good .
yeah ,
so i , you know ,
and that was hard cause i had two kids ,
uh -huh .
and , you know , a family and everything else ,
so i had a lot of different hats to wear all at the same time .
but ,
yeah .
see , well i screwed myself up also ,
there was a point in time that i decided that i did not want to in school ,
and my parents never pushed me until my dad just said , what are you going to do
and i said , well i am going to go because i have not whipping butter the rest of my life , you know .
yeah ,
you are right ,
exactly .
so , i went and i just took business ,
uh -huh .
well , being as i was paying for it myself , you know , i just kept ,
you do not get into your major until like your second or third year .
right .
and i am going into my third year
and i decided , well i do not want to do accounting anymore ,
uh -huh .
right and i thought , oh , my god , i am paying for this myself ,
i am not switching completely because ,
right .
i will put myself a year behind .
yeah .
so i switched to finance ,
and i liked it better
and i pulled myself from a two oh to a two five , you know ,
uh -huh .
in my last year , my senior year .
yeah .
but i would have really liked to go on , uh , secondary ed with math education ,
uh -huh .
but it was just the fact i was paying for it myself ,
i was not going ,
right .
to put myself behind another year .
right .
well m -, my wife , was sort of in the same situation ,
she was , she went to school to be a teacher just because she did not really know what else to go ,
uh -huh .
for ,
and she did not realize until she got to be a senior and was doing her student teaching that she did not like it .
uh -huh .
but , you know , by then she had practically got her degree ,
so ,
exactly .
so , you know ,
i think if , uh , i would have went with the math , i think i would have done a lot better , because i was more interested .
uh -huh .
and that 's what i , i knew that 's what i wanted .
but , uh , i think a lot of kids that hold off a year or two ,
uh -huh .
oh , my gosh ,
i would like to see the results on a study done .
i think they would do a lot better . because they are more focused .
yeah .
they know exactly what they want to do .
yeah ,
i think , i think you are right ,
when you pull yourself away and then you get out and you say , man i really need this .
i 've , uh ,
are you there ?
yes , sir ,
i 'm right here .
all right
okay , um ,
i 'm in an area where , um , we can , uh , enjoy it year round ,
so , i 've actually been , uh , uh , been out within the past couple of weeks .
i 'm mainly a freshwater fisherman .
how about yourself ?
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
well , actually i 've done both kinds uh , i 'm originally from the state of virginia and , uh , lived near , near virginia beach where we could , uh , surf cast and , uh catch a lot of things in the ocean there .
did you ev -, did you ever do the james river ?
i don 't believe i have fished the james river .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
there 's a possibility , but that was so long ago i moved here to , to state college , uh , in nineteen fifty -five and that has pretty well limited my fishing to fresh water and we have a lot of , uh , beautiful fresh water streams that come through thi -, this area .
i 'm in an area called center county , which is in the very center of the state of pennsylvania ,
i 've i 've been in that area
and the trout fishing is supposed to be legendary .
the trout fishing is really , uh , beautiful .
as i say , the , the streams are , oh , eight , ten , fifteen feet wide and so forth ,
uh -huh ,
for brookies .
and , uh , you , you stand on the edge and you , you cast out and you , you work , uh , from your feet most of the time and then there are , there are a few lakes of course , close
by ,  ]
yeah ,
what do you like , brookies or , uh , rainbows
or ,
well , tell you the truth , i 'm , i 'm not , uh , not picky .
i ,
wherever the area ,
whatever the fish is the specialist in that area , i , uh , i enjoy fishing for it ,
and i try to ,
uh -huh .
yeah .
i haven 't fished in several years i 'll have to admit , but when i do fish , i do contact , uh , some of the local specialists so that i can then find out the , uh , the type of lures that they use and where they fish , and any unique , uh , techniques that would help you .
do you fly fish , or are those streams too small ?
uh , no ,
we , we fly fish .
yeah .
uh -huh .
i used to do that a little when i lived up in new york ,
uh -huh .
but right now it 's , uh , uh , bass and striped bass is the only thing that i go for down in dal -, in , uh , texas .
oh , that 's a pretty big fish .
uh , yeah ,
they 're , they 've , uh ,
the striped bass have accommodated themselves to the big fresh water lakes ,
and they 're pretty exciting when they 're , when they 're running .
uh -huh .
it 's a salt water fish in fresh water , uh , environment .
it 's all put and take .
well , our , our streams here are replanted with fish about every year so that , well , they , they , they , uh , they have a pretty good idea of , of , uh , what the number of fish are in these various locations ,
uh -huh .
and and they have have certain areas that they plant , you know , a hundred here and a hundred there ,
and this is , of course , x number of weeks or months before fishing season opens
so ,
what 's the season ?
april to sep -, october or something like that ?
uh -huh .
that sounds about right uh -huh ,
pretty close .
you know .
uh what 's a license cost ?
well , as i say , it 's been several years ,
but the licenses weren 't that expensive ,
i ,
yeah .
seems to stick in my mind , five to seven dollars is about all , from what i remember it .
uh -huh .
it 's about the same as texas .
uh -huh .
yeah .
and i have , oh , probably a half a dozen different kinds of , uh , fishing poles and , and fly rods and so forth ,
and , and i had been so busy in my work in these last few years that i haven 't had time to fish .
but i 'm going to be retiring at the end of december ,
and i , i hope , uh , the next fishing season , that i can sort of get back in and , uh , enjoy that .
that , that was a really enjoyable , uh , thing for me to do .
well , i have all sons , so i think i 'm probably going to be fishing for a long time
huh , i just have one son and he , he lives out of the state now , rather , in the eastern corner of it ,
so , i don 't think he has time to fish either
i caught the disease from my father ,
and i 'm passing it on to my children .
it 's really
oh , is that right ?
they love it ,
yeah .
oh , my goodness .
right .
well , i , i , the disease i caught was simply because , uh , i , i was in the norfolk portsmouth area ,
uh -huh .
and people there ,
right .
right .
there 's , there 's so much water around that , you , you 're either boating or you 're fishing and , uh , i fairly enjoyed at that time .
uh -huh .
i have a small aluminum boat here that , uh ,
when i go on one of the large lakes that we have here that i enjoy fishing for , for trout from that ,
uh , uh , i don 't , i don 't know about the lakes in central pennsylvania .
are there many ?
well , as i say , i 'm in center county .
there 's , um , there 're two different size lakes about , well , five , six miles from state college .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
now these aren 't huge lakes from your point of view but they are probably fifteen , twenty acres maybe which , which here is a lot of water ,
okay ,
do , do you have a home , or apartment ?
uh -huh ,
i have a home .
okay ,
do you have to do a lot of upkeep ?
not really ,
uh -huh .
we have a small backyard and small front yard but , uh , uh , i do basically like the shrubbery and the planting and the weeding
and he mows the lawn because the lawn mower is too heavy
that 's another story .
okay
and , uh , and , uh , i do the edging and stuff like that ,
but , uh , it doesn 't take us that long because our , our yard is so small .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
but , uh , i try and do as much , you know flowering as i can , and that kind of stuff .
uh -huh .
the seasonal things .
yeah ,
uh -huh .
but , uh , i think we have one of the nicest yards in the , in the neighborhood
well , that 's nice
i wish i could say that .
ours is pretty small , too ,
yeah .
but it , it takes about an hour with the two of us working to , you know , do the bushes and all of that sort of thing .
yeah .
uh , the worst part is controlling the weeds .
oh , yeah .
which i hate because we don 't like to use a lot of the chemicals and , because , like , we have a dog and , and , you know , he 's going to be out in the yard and who knows who he eats out there .
that 's true .
but we try not to use them but we end up using some anyway .
uh um , what else .
i get to put out all the christmas lights out there and all that ,
sort of thing
i don 't
no ?
no ,
he does that .
oh , okay .
well , if they , if they go up
uh -huh .
yeah .
like , one year we did the edge of the house all the way up on the roof
oh .
and i i went up on the roof once and i 'll never do it again
oh , god .
i decided i was afraid
yeah .
don 't blame you faint >>.
so this year , he got lazy so i said , fine
i 'll put some on the bushes .
and that 's about it ,
yeah .
that 's all it gets .
huh , okay ,
we don 't have that many bushes to put them on .
uh -huh .
uh , our , our yard is very , uh , narrow and so we have some bushes , but we don 't have too many ,
but we have a nice tree in the front
uh -huh .
oh , wow .
and uh , we have people that , an association that comes and mows everybody 's front yard and , uh , they keep hitting it , the tree with the lawn mower .
oh , no .
you know , every time you do that , it , uh , kind of kills the tree for a while .
yeah .
and so that 's kind of stunt its growth for just a while until we get it back going again .
oh .
uh -huh .
and we started mowing our own lawn because they were doing that .
and so , anyways i have a nice full tree now
uh -huh .
and , and we put    , we fill it with lights and that kind of thing .
uh -huh .
so ,
um .
and they would , uh , they also edged ,
when they would edge in , into the shrubbery and
oh , no
oh , gosh , it was getting really bad ,
so we ,
but you still have to pay for it , though , even though they 're not going to do it ?
yeah ,
because it 's an association fee .
oh , is it real expensive ?
oh , gosh .
yes it 's like seventy a month .
oh , my goodness .
yeah ,
and i don 't like ,
i , i just get really upset every time i make that check out .
yeah .
but , uh ,
well , do , do they do other things for you all ?
they take care of the , uh , landscape ,
because we live in a cul -de -sac
uh -huh .
and there is a island in the middle so they care of that
uh -huh .
and there is a pool and they take care of the pool and , and there is a pond ,
they take care of the pond in the park area and that kind of thing .
uh -huh .
and , uh , so you 're basically paying , oh ,
and the sprinkler system that ,
that
our yard doesn 't have a sprinkler system , but the island does
uh -huh .
and , uh certain sharing areas have sprinkler systems
uh -huh .
and and so that way if someone moves out , the entire neighborhood is mowed and watered and that kind of thing , you know .
um .
so ,
but you knew when you moved in , you 'd have to pay that , didn 't you ?
well , it , it , it went up what we pay .
oh
and that 's the bad thing .
i just hope it doesn 't go up any more
yeah .
because we just can 't afford it anymore .
i don 't know what to do if you can 't afford it
i don 't know either .
that 's interesting .
so , uh , but , they 're ,
that 's what they do .
uh -huh .
they take care of basically the front yards and unless you don 't want them to do it .
now do at a
do things like plant bushes and trees ?
they ,
o -, only in , like , in the common areas and in the island .
oh , okay .
but they don 't do it in your yard .
so , there is , like , no restriction on what types of bushes you can have or anything like that ?
right ,
uh -huh ,
yeah ,
so we 've added bushes and , and shrubbery , too .
uh -huh .
yeah ,
when we moved into our house i just hated the bushes they had .
i , i ripped most of them out and put them somewhere in the back .
i know .
and put new ones out front .
but that was a lot of work .
yeah .
took me a long time .
yeah ,
that 's what we did when we first moved in , too .
uh -huh .
just rearranged some things
yeah ,
and then , then we put in a sprinkler system ,
and ,
oh .
we won 't go through that again ,
i will pay someone to do it
oh , really ?
oh , it took so long .
oh .
because my husband was , you know , digging the trenches because he didn 't want to get a trencher , you know ,
oh , yeah .
there is a machine that will do it .
because , you know , there is so many people that broke either their water main or their gas main doing it .
oh .
and i guess that costs you an absolute fortune .
that 's true ,
so gosh ,
you did it manually .
by hand .
oh .
oh , gosh .
yeah ,
but it works great now that we 've got it .
i bet .
yeah ,
it 's nice .
yeah ,
that 's a good investment there .
yeah ,
well , we needed to because we 're having some foundation trouble ,
oh .
you know , you have to keep the , the area moist around the house or it makes it worse ,
oh .
so , we had an incentive there to do that .
okay .
go ahead .
well , uh , a friend of mine actually works for mcdonald douglas in the , uh , in the space station program
oh .
so i get to find out a lot of information about what 's going on there
 sure . 
 and  it sure sounds like that 's going to be a really viable program if it continues to be funded at current levels .
uh -huh .
uh , they 're , they 're going to be doing a lot of interesting things .
uh , i think one of the big things he 's involved with is the micro gravity payloads .
and that has a direct impact on a lot of things that we really can 't do down here on earth including , uh , some new pharmaceutical techniques .
oh , you 're kidding .
yeah .
 huh . 
so , you know ,  there 's  there 's a big opportunity for us to explore , uh , what sorts of things you can do in a zero gravity environment .
uh -huh .
 sure . 
 so .  i suspect that we 'll see a lot of gains from that .
oh , that 's good because sometimes i wonder , you know , being a , uh , lay person out there of not , uh , knowing e -, exactly what 's going on in space . whether , you know , they 're going ahead and doing things and whether or not
we 're spending too much money on the programs and not spending enough money on the earth that we have here .
being , you know ,
to me , all this , uh , space exploration that we 've done thus far has told us that there 's no other place like earth . that , uh , we can 't live on mars .
we can 't live here ,
we can 't live there .
i mean , this is the , the place that we have to live .
i mean , there 's , uh , no other resource for us to , to look at other than here .
so , it 's kind of like , to me ,
i would like to see a lot more money being put toward taking care of the environment that we have here and not so much emphasis put on what 's going out in space
and what , you know ,
not that i want everything to halt
and let 's forget about the space program or whatever ,
because we 're always curious
and we always need to know more things .
but , uh , to me it 's kind of like let 's try and clean up the air that we have here .
let 's try to take care of the lakes that are getting polluted and the other things that are going on here .
mainly because , uh ,
the space program has taught us that there is no other place for us .
i mean this is it .
i mean if we would have , uh , if we would have went into space and found mars a livable , uh , planet , we probably would have inhabited it
and , uh , you know , who would have cared about earth ?
it would have been another planet to kind of take over and , uh , continue on .
so , you know , and that
when i look at the space program itself , i think of it , you know , as being in terms of it 's , it 's interesting to learn but it 's also , it 's , it brings down the fact that this earth is it .
it 's it for us , you know what i mean ?
right .
uh , unless technology makes the decision that we are all going to live in space or whatever .
but i would love to , uh , go into the space shuttle some day and , uh , just see , uh , you know , the earth and the different planets and things like that .
i , i think it would be very interesting to do but whether it would be feasible to do i don 't know .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
sure .
well , uh , as far as the practical aspects go , i suspect that the space station may actually be a good compromise between , you know , deep space i 'm sorry , deep space exploration and , uh , and not doing anything because we have the opportunity to off load some things to the space station .
exactly .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
and , uh , you know , perhaps we can find better techniques for doing things that , uh , we 'd normally do down here that are damaging to the environment .
exactly .
yeah ,
that 's true , you know .
and i , i think of , uh ,
i 'm sure you probably have heard of the genesis program that 's going on currently out in the arizona desert .
uh -huh .
uh , there 's , uh , you know , they 're trying to look at how things effect everything in trying to create , you know , an environment where they have an ocean and they have the lakes and then they have the desert part of it
and then they have an area that 's more , uh , you know , full of , uh , vegetation , tropicals , that kind of thing , to kind of look at things and say , you know , the environment wise , this is where we 're living
but what , what effects it
and how can we improve it and things like that .
and i , i think in space , uh ,
i don 't know how many people could live up in space , uh , for any length of time
i mean just the way that we 're affected by when it 's cloudy out
and it 's cloudy for days
and we don 't see the sun
and the people , their moods are extreme ,  you know . 
 right . 
it 's like , god if i don 't get to see the sun i 'm going to be in this bad mood all this entire time
and this is how i see people reacting .
you know , when is the sun going to come out ?
so i wonder how , you know , somebody living up in space is going to be able to tolerate never seeing the sun you know , in the aspect that we see it .
right .
uh , and never seeing , uh , you know , light , bright days , you know .
and ,
well , do you have any , uh , television programs that you watch regularly ?
oh , this is kind of tough .
i don 't too often watch , you know , shows that are on , on a regular bases .
uh -huh .
i don 't have a lot of time
and i don 't really like some of them to tell you the truth .
i mean i don 't thing they have any redeeming value .
no .
but , uh , oh , i watch things like , uh , sixty minutes ,
uh -huh .
every week .
uh , ugh ,
it 's kind of tough to think of some of the others . although , i do watch some of some of those frivolous things .
uh ,
like on thursday nights at nine o 'clock when i get home from aerobics i will watch , uh , knots landing
oh , you will ?
yeah ,
just something like that for , you know , uh , end of the evening type of thing ,
relax .
but , uh . how about you ?
well , i watch , um ,
i like news programs , like you mentioned ,
and sometimes i will watch , um , like the cable news , network evening news program .
yeah ,
i don 't get that so i don 't have ,
that choice .
yeah ,
i , i like that .
i , i watch that a couple of times a week , um ,
it comes on like at nine o 'clock ,
uh -huh .
at night
and i really don 't have any like situation comedies that i watch regularly .
i , i have seen that , um , murphy brown that comes on ,
uh -huh .
monday nights before
and it 's kind of cute ,
yeah .
and , but i don 't ,
but there 's a couple of those i 've seen once in a while ,
uh -huh .
uh , i can 't think of the name of the one that has the , uh , military , uh , fellow .
oh , but ,
i mean he 's playing a military part .
he 's the husband of ,
uh -huh .
the girl on designing women .
right .
i know who you 're talking about .
i haven 't , i have seen it , i think , maybe once .
yeah ,
you know , it wa -, it was on one time when i saw it
and , you know , it , it 's pretty cute .
 i like that 
well , i , um , i ,
we really don 't watch too many programs regularly .
my children like some of the morning children 's shows ,
yeah .
when they 're home .
they , um ,
i just have one son who 's in kindergarten
so in the morning they will like to watch like , um , eureka 's castle , it 's called .
it 's just like a sesame street ,
uh -huh .
show ,
but and they watch a couple of shows like that ,
but i don 't watch any daytime t v at all .
yeah ,
no
i don 't ,
and , uh ,
i guess , uh , there 's some , uh , things on channel thirteen that i watch pretty regularly .
uh -huh .
on saturdays they have , uh , a variety of things , uh ,
and a lot of times i record it and watch it some other time .
but , uh ,
uh -huh .
they have programs on , uh , house repairs and ,
um .
how to build things
and , um , they have a calligraphy show ,
and i do calligraphy , so , i watch that .
oh , that 's nice .
and , um , they have a lot of cooking shows ,
uh -huh .
and , oh , you know , i 'll just short of have it on sometimes to just sort of pick up little tidbits from those .
i don 't sit and watch them but , but i enjoy some of it and especially if i 'm , uh , cooking on a saturday evening or something ,
and one of those is on , it kind of inspires me .
that sounds like a good idea .
i notice that , um , since we moved here that we , we did get the cable t v ,
and when the newspaper comes out on sunday , i sometimes read through the movies that will be listed ,
uh -huh .
and i record some .
and then , uh , we have just totally cut down ,
yeah .
and we never go to like a video tape rental anymore because there 's always plenty of things that we can record and then , and watch and then record over it , something else .
and so that 's been really nice because if you decide one evening you would like to stay home and have a quiet evening and watch a movie then you have two or three saved .
yeah ,
we do some of that ,
in fact , i probably am more interested in watching some of the movies that are on t v ,
uh -huh .
than , you know , other kinds of things .
well , that 's probably what i watch most frequently besides like news programs is the movies
and they have a couple of channels that are like nostalgic older movies ,
yes .
that i have really enjoyed that i 'm seeing for the first time
yeah .
like the marx brothers and things like that .
yeah ,
those are pretty good
i , i like those old ones ,
uh -huh .
much better than some of the new stuff .
right .
and so we , we have really enjoyed that
and it 's really nice not to be running out .
some of the video rentals can be expensive
and ,
yeah .
and , boy ,
the movie can be unbelievable .
uh -huh ,
right .
going and paying six dollars for a ticket for one person at the theater or something .
so we ,
i have ,
and it 's so convenient at home
and you can do it anytime y -, you take the notion .
yeah .
and so , i have really enjoyed that
but , but there are ,
i do have friends that watch programs
like they want to see a particular program and they are either home watching it or definitely recording it .
they have some programs that they won 't miss .
uh -huh ,
i 'm not that hung up to most things .
i mean if i miss something big deal
yes .
well , and things are repeated ,
yeah .
that 's true .
so often that you know if , if i have seen just a program once chances are it 'll be that exact same show
yeah .
if i ever decide to tune it in again ,
yeah .
the only one i 've ever seen and it 'll be showing again .
pretty funny .
yeah .
but , uh , t v is something that we try an -, to not , um , deliberately try not to get hung up on it ,
yeah .
like you say .
we do too .
too many other things to do and too much going on .
uh -huh .
and we don 't want our kids to , to grow up thinking that that 's what you do with your ,
right .
spare time .
right .
i agree .
so it 's a little bit , something that we try doing
and there 's , there 's a lot of good children 's programs that you could watch they could watch several hours every day .
uh -huh .
and you could say , oh , that 's a good program for them because it 's educational
but still you want them to go out and do other things .
even if they 're ,
right .
good programs you don 't want them sitting there watching them .
yeah .
anyway . well ,
okay .
well , we probably exhausted that , huh ?
yeah ,
that was pretty good
i , i like that
and , um , i guess it 's time to go .
okay .
i enjoyed talking to you .
yes .
nice to have spoken with you , too .
okay .
bye -bye .
good -bye .
okay , um ,
what do you think about the war recently ?
the war ?
uh -huh .
you mean in terms of the economy
or ,
uh , the economy ,
the ,
our soldiers going over , uh ,
oh ,
just everything .
i thought we were going to talk about social changes .
is that , is that what
you 're kind ,
yeah ,
of directing it ,
yeah .
oh okay
yeah ,
okay
well
that 's the first thing i thought of
i don 't know .
um . well , i think it 's caused a lot of , you know , big difference between when people had gone to war before ,
right .
like compared to vietnam
because ,
right .
i mean , i know that there was so much more support for the soldiers going over ,
and even people that didn 't agree with the war still seem to be able to separate that ,
right
and ,
you know , and support the soldiers ,
so .
i know that , uh , i 've heard people say that you know when people that went to world war two
you couldn 't become a political figure or president unless you had served in the war ,
yeah .
but then in vietnam that was totally different , you know ,
you couldn 't be a political figure if you were in vietnam probably .
yeah ,
and now ,
yeah .
if you 've served in desert storm you probably would be a , a good candidate .
yes ,
it would be like a bonus for your ,
image or something .
e -, exactly , exactly .
yeah
it ,
i 'm sure it caused a lot of changes in terms of how many families had to have their income ,
oh , torn apart .
oh , yea -,
just drastically altered .
we had people down the street that the guy was in the reserves and he was just about ready to go and they have a , just had a new baby ,
uh -huh .
and , uh , they would have , she would have had to go back to work
and ,
right .
i think she said their income would have dropped by like two thirds .
so it ,
that 's also a good reason why it , it ,
or good that it ended as soon as it did .
yeah ,
yeah .
i think the biggest change that we 've seen , um , in , in my life or whatever lately is the economy ,
uh -huh .
and things are so tight ,
and like my husband hasn 't gotten a raise in two years
and ,
exactly ,
you know .
and it seems like everything is raising , every -, everything that can be , cigarettes ,
yeah .
not that i smoke , but cigarettes , um , uh , stamps ,
i mean it seems like ever -,
even dog licenses
i mean ,
exactly ,
everything single thing that we do ,
yeah .
is higher ,
yeah .
you know . and they just raised the minimum wage today
but that 's not like , you know ,
going to effect too many ,
as much as they should have raised it i 'm sure .
yeah ,
yeah .
but , uh ,
so , that 's the hardest thing for us
and , um , we 've been trying to kind of maintain traditional lifestyle in the sense of  meaning  home .
we have a three year old and a two year old
and i 'm trying to stay home as long as i can ,
right .
but , you know , every week it gets harder
because i could go out and be making money ,
right .
right .
you know , so that 's a big , uh , stress i think ,
yeah .
you know , for the social changes in our family .
i don 't , i don 't have any children or anything right now
i 'm , uh , i work as a news reporter in waco ,
oh ,
and so ,
i see .
i get to see ,
i got to see a lot of not firsthand but , uh , probably a good part of the war , um , as far as what people thought about it ,
uh -huh .
and a lot of things like that ,
so .
yeah ,
yeah .
well i -,
it was kind of amazing
people were coming to me to ask me , you know , what 's going on , you know , like i knew ,
or like i sat in on the meetings or something .
yeah ,
you have an inside track or something .
yeah ,
yeah .
so , i got to hear a lot of what the people thought about , you know , changes in , in the war and everything ,
so that was pretty interesting .
yeah ,
yeah .
let 's see ,
what other social changes in the past ten years , oh ,
i guess between men and women i 've seen a lot of changes ,
yeah .
in terms of women feeling like they have to have a career , be mom , be ,
exactly ,
be everything , be supermom ,
everything , superperson
exactly .
yeah ,
because i know , you know , i , i really get pressure from , because i have a career also ,
uh -huh .
and i get a lot of pressure from people that , you know , my colleagues
that
why am i staying home . you know ,
right .
and ,
whereas before that never would have happened
whereas it would have been ,
people would have said , why are you going to work .
exactly , um .
so , that 's kind of a difference for us .
i think there 's more pressure to , um , not necessarily a negative thing but on my husband to be more involved with the family .
right .
so he 's ,
the roles are changing a lot .
yeah ,
he 's gotten a lot , uh , you know ,
you see all kinds of men being involved in the housework and taking care of the kids and all ,
but in terms of his amount of hours at work , nothing on that has lightened up .
right .
so , it 's now he has the pressure too of being superdad and supercareer
and ,
and even , you know , i think a lot of the movies we see now kind of , kind of play a good part in our changes
because , you see that they have the three men and a baby type movies .
yeah ,
that 's true ,
and i think , you know that ,
mister mom
and ,
yeah ,
and then you have the women , uh , detectives now and , you know , different roles ,
uh -huh .
just in what we see
and so we probably want to do that even more now .
yeah ,
yeah .
you know since the women 's movement in the , wh -, seventies ,
that 's true .
and , you know , we 've come a long way but i think it 's still a , still have a good ways to go .
yeah .
yeah .
so ,
i think there 's still ,
i , i know that , um , i grew up in chicago in the sixties ,
uh -huh .
and was part ,
my family was real liberal ,
and i think there 's a lot of , um , kind of myths that we 've come a long way just in terms of our society ,
right .
and race relations and things like that ,
and , you know , i think there 's so much prejudice still there ,
yeah .
and it 's kind of more covert now .
people used to be more clear and say ,
exactly .
you know , well , i believe in this or i believe in that ,
exactly .
and now , you know , i think there 's still tremendous amount of prejudice ,
it 's just not as ,
but people think , oh , we 're in the nineties , we 're beyond all that , you know
exactly .
but it 's ,
i mean like i say , we 've come a long way , but we have , i mean , twice as far to go ,
yeah ,
still ,
yeah .
and i don 't think a lot of people , you know , realize a lot , the plight of a lot of people .
yeah .
you know , and you may be in good standing and everything may look hunky -dory to you ,
 but there 's so many more people , 
 but there 's so many more people , 
that are homeless
and ,
exactly , that you don 't even ,  ]
yeah .
and that you don 't even see or know about .
yeah .
it 's real easy to get isolated in your own little community ,
oh , oh , yeah .
you know , because wh -, when i was growing up in chicago , um , we were in a real ethnic neighborhood
and there were people from all , first generation chinese , german , you know all different nationalities ,
uh -huh .
and everything .
uh -huh .
and now we 're kind of like in lewisville , miss white little suburbia ,
yeah .
you know .
i mean i don 't even know anybody that
yeah .
 you know   , from any place other than texas hardly ,
you know .
i grew up in , in brooklyn , new york ,
oh , boy .
and so i was just , i was just surrounded , you know , by black people ,
yeah .
because i 'm black ,
and so , you know i lived , that 's where i lived .
yeah .
and so now , i , i feel lucky actually because i 've almost lived around everyone .
i 've , i went to u t to college ,
oh .
and so they , you know , they have a lot of different people go there ,
yeah .
different kinds of people .
and so i feel really enriched in that a lot of people don 't get to see ,
yeah .
you know , some people have lived in lewisville all their life ,  you know , 
 yeah ,
 and so they don 't get to see , 
and they ,   they think the whole world ,  is like that .
exactly and th -,
we lived in a dorm .
my husband and i met in graduate school ,
uh -huh .
at indiana university
and i was , ours was , uh , international co -, you know , co -ed dorm ,
uh -huh .
and there were twelve hundred students ,
they 're graduate students from all over the world .
and once we came here it was like ,
gosh ,
i just miss that ,
exactly .
because it really is exciting ,
it is .
to be around people of different cultures and different backgrounds .
we got invited to ,
one guy practically roasted a goat in his , in his dorm
oh , my god .
 i wonder if he was  from , iran , or some place ,
i don 't know where
but , um , you know .
well , there 's so many people who have never , you know , even gotten to do that ,
yeah ,
so that 's great .
yeah .
my sister was telling me she met a gi -, she 's going to the university of pennsylvania in , in philadelphia ,
oh , uh -huh .
and , uh , she just met a girl from , um , i think , barbados or jamaica , or something ,
oh .
like that .
and i mean this girl she had like two outfits that she would just wear all the time ,
yeah ,
and everything
and ,
yeah .
she got some kind of money from her government like five hundred dollars .
so my sister had to take her shopping and , you know , show her what to wear , show her how to match up colors
and ,
oh , god .
i just thought that was so very exciting ,
yeah ,
yeah .
you know , to go and , and just witness , you know , this girl just coming to america type thing , you know .
yeah ,
really
so , you know , i would have loved it , the opportunity to do that ,
that is part ,
but ,
of the change i think that i 've seen probably , you know , in the past twenty years or whatever , is now kids have to have so much .
i mean i even get caught up in it with our kids ,
oh , yeah .
even though i buy most of the things at garage sales for their christmas ,
uh -huh .
i mean , people ha -, you know think they 're kids have to have five , hundred dollars worth of toys .
  the latest cereal about , you know , th -,
oh , yeah ,
it 's just ,
yeah ,
that 's ridiculous ,
it , it 's ,
too .
when i first moved here i was only thirteen but , everyone had a car in school , you know ,
oh , gosh .
and i couldn 't , and i just couldn 't belie -, you know ,
i was from new york and so , you know , we road the bus .
yeah ,
me too ,
and if you had a ca -,
in chicago
yeah .
i didn 't even date a guy that had a car until i was in college
exactly .
and if you had a car y -, there was nowhere to park it anyway
or , you know , it 's just ,
you just didn 't have a car ,
yeah .
but then we came here and they had parking lots in the schools
and i couldn 't understand it .
yeah .
you know , all the kids had cars ,
yeah .
and they , you know , have to have a car .
oh , gosh ,
so that was ,
my kids are going to be hating me ,
i 'll give them a bike and say ,
yeah
yeah ,
right .
here 's it
so you can afford to pay the insurance ,
really .
you know
or live really close to school and have them walk .
yeah ,
no ,
but ,
kidding .
uh , yeah ,
a lot of changes .
yeah .
so ,
well did we cover it everything  betty 
i think so
okay .
i guess i 'll get back to my laundry
okay ,
well , it 's good , it 's good talking to you .
you too ,
good luck .
okay .
 bye -bye . 
 bye -bye . 
well , we haven 't really heard that much in the news lately , about , uh , u s involvement in latin america , since , uh , all this middle east crisis began .
so i haven 't really paid that much attention like , since back in august when all of the news and all of the media began to focus in on , uh , iraq ,
and , the , so the last thing that i remember hearing that much about is the iran contra scandal that happened in the reagan presidency .
can you think of anything else that 's happened recently ?
no ,
i would agree with you .
we haven 't had too much ,
but , uh , historically , we 've always , uh , almost been like a big brother to , in , and to the latin american area , and , uh , almost used them ,
i , i , i feel .
uh -huh .
uh , i think something will have to be done down there very soon about , uh , about mexico and , and , uh , some of the other areas ,
but , but , with the persian gulf , as you said , it 's just , uh , been very quiet .
i , i keep pretty close tabs on the paper
and you don 't hardly see a ,
unless it 's there and we 're just not seeing it .
well , the only , uh , references that i have seen lately has been , uh , in , part of
the overmilitarization of iraq was due to companies selling them arms and things ,
uh -huh .
and , and they made references to in the past , how we have given arms to , uh , nicaragua and to other places in latin america , and that those might turn around and haunt us someday .
well that 's ,
i mean , not , not to this large scale as iraq ,
but that ,
uh -huh .
whenever we give arms to people , a -, as we did , and as we sold arms to , pardon me , to iraq , when we wanted them to fight iran ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
and then , uh , and then it turn around and ,
i , i agree we 're the largest munitions producer in the world ,
and so , uh , there 's a lot of money to be made there ,
uh -huh .
and it 's , uh , be very difficult to , to cut it back to a , a level where it should be .
and , and , uh , it will come back to haunt us ,
it seems to come in cycles .
uh -huh .
and i know when i spent ,
the time that i 've studied in mexico , uh , se -, spanish was one of my majors in college , that , uh , there was a kind of a lot of resentment there towards america ,
uh -huh .
about , uh , like you say , using them , yo -,
our interest there is , you know , what profit we could make off of any kind of relationship with them ,
right .
and that we weren 't normally very interested in them ,
and they have ,
in other , in most latin american countries , they , there are a lot of the kind of problems that we 've fought for in other countries , you know ,
that they have corruption ,
and , and they don 't have , uh ,
i mean , there 's just very few really modern cities .
right ,
and the , probably the bigge -, biggest problem down there is that 's where the , that 's the drug entry points ,
uh -huh .
and their economy is ,
of s -, several of the countries ,
especially columbia , is so built on the , on t -, on the drugs , that , uh , our , our little war on drugs has really been laughable .
it 's just a , you know , such a small amount ,
and it doe -,
it just ,
it , uh , cuts off just a trickle ,
and , uh , if , if we can 't get a handle on that through some , through some , uh , method , i don 't know where , whe -,
that will be another big problem .
well , that 's right ,
because that 's just so much of the way that they make their money
and so many communities have , uh , have to have that for farming
right ,
right .
and they don 't look at it so much as , you know ,
and as long as we 're the largest , uh , consumer , then , uh ,
uh -huh .
this is the market .
that 's right .
if we can cut back the usage , then uh , maybe it will have to go someplace else .
and i think it 's really very sad that north of the border , you know , the united states and canada is so different ,
uh -huh .
from the s -, from south america ,
uh -huh ,
yeah .
and central america .
there 's really a disparity between the , uh , what a e -, i would call civilization of the countries , you know .
right , yeah ,  ]
we 're just so much wealthier ,
and , uh ,
uh -huh .
and , uh , there has to be resentment built up ,
and that 's where , uh , leaders can use , uh , use that whenever the opportune moment arises .
yes ,
it 's really kind of sad , and ,
yeah .
that we would go all the way to iraq and that we would be very concerned with the situation between jerusalem and , uh , israel and the middle east arab countries , and , and when we have , when we have a lot of problems , r -, r -, right in our own back door .
that 's right .
our own hemisphere ,
but we 've ,
that 's been , uh , that 's been the way it 's always been .
um .
so , uh ,
so i guess we 've kind of neglected latin america .
very much so , except when we need them .
you know when they found oil in mexico , then we got very friendly with them again .
ri -,
recently
yeah .
yeah ,
fairly recently .
well , that 's really sad .
i hadn 't thought about that in a long time .
um .
well , i guess then , i will go ,
but i ,
okay .
made me stop and think a minute about ,
sure did .
not worrying so much about the middle east crisis .
i know that it 's not settled but , there are other areas that we could focus our attention on .
always ,
yes ma 'am .
well , thank you ,
you have a good day .
you too , dear .
bye -bye .
bye .
okay ,
what kind of music do you like ?
well , i , uh ,
uh -huh .
several years ago a radio broke in my car and i never ,
i got out of the habit of listening to the radio ,
and so i haven 't been listing ,
uh -huh .
i , i used to just listen to the rock stations but , um , lately i have been going back to classical music .
i don 't really know what too many of the most popular songs are unless , you know , they 're in the , the news or something
uh -huh .
but , um , so i tend to listen to some of the older songs that were popular back when i was paying attention .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
and then i like some classical music and some of the pieces that have been around a while .
i haven 't paid much attention to most of the current music .
what about you ?
um , i listen , i listen to a wide variety of music .
sometimes i 'll turn on the classical music , in
sometimes i 'll listen to jazz ,
uh -huh .
uh , every now and then country and western .
um , i 'll listen to some of the rock stations .
i also like the , uh , the , the classic rock stations ,
uh -huh .
that play the older , more mellow type rock music and child in background >>.
um , some of the , some of the rock stations now are the , i guess the top forty stations or whatever .
they just ,
it really gets on my nerves because they play so many commercials
and ,
uh -huh .
sometimes the deejays are just kind of annoying and irritating
that 's true .
and it gets kind of old ,
and they play the same songs over and over ,
and i just get kind of tired of all that .
uh -huh .
so lots of times ,
i 'll just play cassettes instead of listening to the radio , actually .
but , uh , most of my cassettes ,
i guess , i don 't , i don 't like hard rock .
no .
um , i have some , some rock and some jazz and a couple , maybe one or two country and western . some , uh , oh , i can 't believe i can 't think of his name . um , garth brooks ,
uh -huh .
i have a couple of his tapes .
and , um , but it 's mainly , it 's mainly just the , the light rock type stuff .
yes ,
i don 't ,
uh -huh .
i never liked any of the heavy metal music
i never really listened to it because i , you know , i prefer to have more , i guess , an established pattern of music to listen to .
uh -huh .
but , and i ,
uh -huh .
back a long time ago , when the rap music first came out it was kind of a novelty , and i listened to some of it ,
uh -huh .
but i , you know ,
now that there 's just a million rap groups
and , and , uh , they try to , tend to try to do , outdo each other with raciness , i think ,
oh , yeah .
and , so i , you know , i 'm not attracted to that at all ,
but , um , it made a big difference in my life not to have a radio that was   easy access ,
uh -huh .
and so now that i do have one , i just don 't automatically turn it on unless there 's something i 'm particularly listening to .
but , you know , if you go two or three years without having that ,
uh -huh .
what i got the most exposure to it really changed my life -style and kept me from just having a , you know , easy access to current music ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
and so i did , like i say , tend to go back to albums and cassettes and things that i had , already had purchased .
but we don 't have a c d yet , do you ?
no ,
i don 't .
i sure don 't
because i have so many albums and cassettes i feel like , gosh , i 'm going to have to go out and buy a c d player and then start collecting c d
and it just ,
uh -huh .
i haven 't gotten around to doing it yet .
yeah ,
i , i kind of decided to wait until it , it was around a while .
it was kind of like , remember when personal calculators first came out ,
yeah ,
yeah .
and they were really , really expensive
and then now you can get one for two or three dollars .
just like v c r 's , too
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
yeah ,
i thought of that , too , that if i wait , it 'll get a lot less expensive ,
and i can do without it for a while .
sure
uh -huh .
and also they get better quality w -,
and they learn to have more features and things and
uh -huh .
without , and making them less expensive .
so we 're kind of waiting to , like , uh , now , you know ,
uh -huh .
and the price of cassettes has gone down because c d are so popular ,
so ,
that 's ,
and a c d is a lot more expensive than a cassette ever was , too ,
right now , i think .
i haven 't even priced them .
i guess they must be .
they 're somewhere between ten and fifteen dollars a piece .
oh , really ?
yeah .
that is awful
yeah
i bought some at christmas time for friends of mine that have c d players .
i thought , my gosh ,
uh -huh .
now i know another reason why i 'm not going to get a c d player for a while .
take our time .
right .
well , i can 't imagine , um ,
you can 't record on them and so they won 't be as functional as like a cassette player , where if you heard something , you could record it ,
uh -huh .
you know . uh , if you have , i guess , if you wanted to record something to play out in your car or something ,
uh -huh .
that you 'd heard or that you owned an album of ,
so c d won 't be nearly as handy .
yeah ,
see , i 've got a , on my stereo i 've got a , a , uh , turntable , and then i 've got a dual cassette
so i can record off other cassettes .
uh -huh .
but i never realized you couldn 't record onto c -,
i just never really thought about it
because i haven 't really looked into it very much .
i don 't have one
and ,
uh -huh .
and i 've never really looked at one very closely ,
but that , that would be inconvenient because i have a cassette player in my car .
now i guess , you know , one of these days when i get a new car , maybe , i guess all of them will probably have c d players by then ,
yes .
but , uh , i 'm not planning on doing that for a while .
i just got mine paid off
enjoy it .
i 'm going to stick with the cassettes and , and , uh , you know , until , until they ,
now my sister , my younger sister has a , she does have a c d player that she got for christmas
and she 's got the , the cassette , so she can record off cassettes onto c d i mean , i 'm sorry , o -, other way around ,
uh -huh .
off c d onto cassettes .
uh -huh .
um ,
well , that 's good .
so i can record some things from her and , you know , get cassettes and record off other ones or off the radio if i want to
uh -huh .
but but , uh , i just haven 't gone to c d yet .
why , we haven 't either ,
but we , you know , we like the , the idea of having great extra quality , you know ,
uh -huh .
in your music and things .
uh -huh .
but , but i 'm satisfied to just have what i 've been used to , not have to think about the great financial sacrifice that that would be , to suddenly try to switch over to all c d or something .
uh -huh .
but i know one thing that has colored my music choice is when we had children , um , i really started to think about what kind of television programs i was watching ,
right .
uh -huh .
and what kind of music i was listening to and activities
because , um , you know , i just didn 't want them to be exposed to a lot of things ,
oh , yeah
and a lot of the , lot of the songs have some lyrics that , um i just wasn 't pleased with ,
and they get worse and worse , too .
you know .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
and so i really think we 've tried to tone down our taste there to make , uh , you know , our children not be exposed to so many ne -, negative things so early in life .
uh -huh .
well , that 's amazing how i used to , when i was in college , i used to have the stereo on all the time or i had on m t v or something ,
uh -huh .
but ever since i 've been out of college , i guess over the last several years , i listen to the stereo less and less .
now i , i will turn on ,
i 've got a small jam box in my bathroom .
uh -huh .
i 'll turn that on while i 'm in the shower and while i 'm getting ready because there 's really not much else i can do and it 's kind of boring standing there , putting on makeup , so i 'll turn the radio on
right .
and , and then i listen to it when i 'm in the car driving to work because , again , there 's , you know , there 's nothing else going on .
i might as well listen to the radio while i 'm driving to work .
right .
but other than that , i 've , i really don 't , i don 't listen to the radio or even to my albums or cassettes or anything very often anymore .
i guess i 'm just too busy doing other things that it 's too much trouble to get up and go decide what i want to listen to ,
and put it on the , on the turntable .
i don 't know ,
i just don 't , don 't bother to do it very much anymore .
yes ,
i know what you mean .
i , i know my husband , he , um , plays an instrument
uh -huh .
and he played in the band when he was in college and in high school and so he has a lot of all different kinds of music ,
and he goes out of his way to play marching band music ,
uh -huh .
or like you say , jazz or classical to the children to , to give them some exposure to different kinds of music .
uh -huh .
and i think that 's really good because they 're learning to like all different kinds
and ,
that 's good .
what instrument does he play ?
he plays the ,
it 's a euphonium .
it 's like a small , a really small , not a tuba , but i th -,
it 's hard to explain
uh -huh .
i never had known anyone to play one before .
uh -huh ,
i 've never heard of that .
but it 's kind of like a small , small tuba but it 's not the kind that sits up on your shoulder .
uh -huh .
but it 's a cross between a tuba and , and an , and , you know , a horn .
it 's a brass instrument .
uh -huh .
so he plays that and , and a little bit of piano
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
and but he has some real fond memories of marching band and concert band type activities ,
and he thinks that would be good for the kids
uh -huh ,
oh , i 'm sure it is .
i 'm sure it is .
i was exposed to a lot of music when i was younger .
i ,
my parents had me take piano lessons for eight years ,
uh -huh .
and , so i was , i was a real good piano player ,
but then i got interested in a lot of other things
and i got real involved in many things
and , and now i don 't have a piano in my apartment or anything .
i could sit back down and play a few things ,
uh -huh .
but not like i used to be able to .
it 's kind of sad that i 've let that slip away .
uh -huh .
and i took guitar lessons , i think , for one or two years ,
and , uh , that was about the same time i was taking piano .
and then i got too busy in high school to really keep up with it between homework and
are you a t i
uh , yeah ,
i am .
oh , good .
yeah ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
i 've been , uh ,
uh , she had a hard time getting a few folks , uh ,
i thought , well every , all these t i have gone home , uh ,
 i , uh , 
 at one  o 'clock on friday .
it is friday ,
yeah ,
that 's for sure .
well , uh , i guess ,
i 'm trying to think the last thing i did to a car .
i , i , i do it a lot .
i have ,
i kind of worked my way through college as a mechanic as a kid .
oh , wow .
okay .
uh , so , and my father and brother were in it
and , and my brother 's still in it .
and i had periods when i didn 't do anything ,
but in the last ten years i 've , uh , my car doesn 't go to a shop , you know ,
it , it ,
 uh -huh . 
 i  just do it all .
do ,
i , uh ,
there 's hardly anything that , other than putting tires on , that i 'll do .
yeah .
i did take it to a transmission place to put in a new transmission but ,
 sure . 
 i  change the oil and transmission
and , uh , uh , i do , essentially do it all .
i don 't know , uh , uh , if there 's anything specific .
in fact , i could advise people , uh ,
i happen to be a m e besides .
uh -huh .
right .
but i do it for fun really and to save money .
right .
and i guess that 's diversion .
uh , i , i 've , i 've tried a few groups , uh , you know , where you ,
i can recommend it for people to take their cars .
yeah .
like i think sears is probably the best place because ,
 yeah . 
 i 've  heard , when i used to go there and when i ,
i just overheard what they did for me , very little because i didn 't take it that much .
but what i heard them tell other people was always right .
right .
you know , when i sat there , i , you know , i dropped my car off for tires or something like that .
right .
and so i respect ,
they seem to actually have mechanics there .
yeah
yeah .
i was pretty impressed with western auto ,
but they didn 't do a great job of changing my transmission , uh , oil last time .
really ?
and when when i did it the next time , i realized the filter was loose and everything ,
and i didn 't like it .
so i 'm just doing it all myself .
i , i ,
yeah .
that 's , that 's the aggravating thing .
yeah ,
i , i try to do as much as i can .
i , uh , i grew up on farm so i 've got that , uh , you know , take care of yourself attitude .
you had to do it .
yeah ,
right .
and , uh , oh , i 've done , i 've done various things .
i 've got an , i 've got an eighty -three t bird
oh .
and i 've , i 've changed out , uh , heater core and ,
 uh -huh . 
 uh ,  oh , timing belts and things like that .
um , i guess the last thing i took to anybody to have done was on my wife 's car , um , when we went in for inspection .
uh -huh .
it didn 't , it didn 't quite pass .
yeah .
so we had to have , uh ,
that 's , uh , that 's a mustang with a two barrel carburetor on it .
uh -huh .
and they had to do some adjustments on that and of course it had never been adjusted so they had to pull it off and pull all the plugs out , to get to it .
oh , yeah .
and , uh ,
well , you like fords , apparently , huh ?
yeah ,
yeah .
i 've , uh , i 'm kind of stuck on them right now , i guess .
but , you know , that 's ,
it 's partially because i can work on them .
that 's , uh ,
 yeah . 
 that 's ,  that 's , that 's a big part of my decision .
but , uh , yeah ,
we ran into some problems with , uh , having them to work on that carburetor .
i mean , they get , they got everything tuned up right , you know .
but they ,
we got , i got it home ,
really ?
and , uh , and they had left the , uh , oil f -, uh , cap off and it was rubbing on a belt
and it rubbed a notch in that .
my goodness .
li -, little things like that , that really start to aggravate you .
that , that 's a lot of the reason i do my own stuff .
yeah .
i won -, always wonder when you have little things like that happen , why , even here at t i , why we don 't inspect , i 'm in facilities , why we don 't inspect areas and , and guarantee it so to speak . uh ,
 uh -huh . 
 we  always fix things and rep -, put things in and walk away .
we ,
there needs to be a time of inspection and check out .
and , and s -, thing like that with a car ,
there ought to be someone there that inspects it before it 's turned .
sure .
there ought to be an insp -, inspector or quality insurance guy after , after an oil change , you know .
sure ,
that 's right .
just in case , uh , they didn 't put the oil in or whatever .
sure .
yeah ,
i -,
i , i always wonder about that when , when someone does repairs or little things like that , uh ,
any , anything that gets , that , that 's in a , gets to be an , an assembly line type operation ,
you 're , you 're always risking that .
yeah .
if there 's , too many people that get their hands on one little project , you know , that things , they 're , you get , y -, you miss that overlap sometimes ,
and , and they miss things .
yeah ,
i 've , i 've had a hard time finding anybody i can trust .
like , like you say , it , it , well , transmissions and things like that .
no ,
no ,
i 'm , obviously , i 'm not going to , i 'm not going to tear apart a automatic transmission  and try rebuild it . 
 i don 't either .
i don 't  either ,
yeah .
but , uh , i -, it , it 's , it 's real stressful to try to find anybody that i think 's going to do me right .
yeah .
and , and , uh , you know , have an idea of what 's going on .
you need to really , uh ,
i , i do , uh , a lot of the simple things .
i , i think i do most of the things better than the average person .
uh -huh .
okay .
you , you have fords and i , i , uh , i have three chevys , which i worked my way into having the same engine .
i don 't know how long i 'm ,
yeah .
i like a v -eight .
and i 'm , i 'm ,
 oh , yeah . 
 s -, sold  on small block chevy v -eights .
 yeah . 
and i ,  i  bought one car new ,
and i almost accidentally got the next car , although i was kind of looking for it when i got a u -, a used car with the same engine .
uh -huh .
well then the nex -, the truck i got next , i definitely looked for the same engine .
so i buy filters , you know , three or four at a time .
sure .
sure .
and essentially the engines are different
y -,
the cars are different years , but the same chevy v -eight .
uh -huh .
and the par -, the carburetors is the same .
almost everything is the same .
th -, the course is two are eighties and one eighty -six , you know .
uh -huh .
so you can learn a lot that way .
i ,
there 's no way i could , i could fix every car in the world , you know .
well , yeah .
that , that ,
the biggest , you know , that 's the three biggest things to me , you know .
i -,
i -,
number one , you 've got to have the tools around .
yeah .
if you don 't have the , the special tools or ,
well , any more
the , the testers , that , you know .
yeah .
right .
i , i don 't have a forty thousand dollar diagnostic tester sitting in my garage , you know .
yeah .
so obviously if it starts , my car starts missing or something like that , th -, it 's almost impossible to track that down any more without a diagnostics .
but at the tools and the space to do it , that , that can be a big problem if it 's , if it 's under carriage or something like that .
but , then it 's experience .
you know , you can , you can look through a , a chilton 's book or something like and get an idea of how to go about it .
but you better figure on multiplying that time out , about by at least by five or so .
yeah .
yeah .
ju -, just , just by not knowing , you know , how to get to that , that one bolt or that one screw or whatever to get things apart .
that was , that was the biggest thing when i did , uh , the heater core in my t bird .
that is got to be the worst location for it .
yeah .
and , and the only reason i did it ,
i ,
i think they 're all bad , really .
they 're ,
yeah ,
yeah .
uh -huh .
the , the only ones i 've ever heard good , good things about are , are the old lincolns and cadillacs where they had the little door underneath the hood .
you just open the door and pop it out .
is that right ?
yeah .
but , but , uh , i , i had , i had taken this in to have it done originally .
yeah .
and , uh ,
what did they want to charge you for it ?
oh , it , it was , it was tremend -,
well it was about seven hours labor .
yeah .
so it , it was going to run about four hundred dollars or so .
yeah .
and they looked it over and they , they , they thought they could patch it up a little bit , you know , and what not .
so they ,
this is your little water , uh , heater in there , for the , uh ,
 yeah . 
 the  heat inside ?
yeah .
and it was , it was leaking inside the car ,
 yeah . 
 in  the condenser unit .
so , uh , they , they did a little patch on it ,
and it l -, it held for about four to six months .
and i finally went back in and started looking at it myself .
and i -, it 's a matter of tearing all the dash out and all that kind of stuff ,
but ,
 yeah . 
 hey , 
yeah .
it was not , uh , it was not a seven hour labor job for me .
it was about a week before i finally through .
did you get it inside or outside ?
i , i took one off my little buick i had ,
and i pretty much took it loose on the inside .
but it came out from the , you know , underneath the hood .
yeah .
it came from ,
oh , really ?
yeah .
no ,
this , this was ,
the only thing that sticks , in , inside the engine compartment on this are the two , uh , hose fittings .
maybe you 're right ,
maybe you 're right .
i ,
it 's been a long time since i took one out .
yeah .
it , it 's ,
i , i 've never heard a good story about , uh ,
course , i broke mine , you know ,
so i 'm always very careful when i change hoses on it .
yeah .
i don 't know whether you did yours .
not to really pull on those .
 right . 
okay .
i ,  when  i take those hoses , i cut them off very gingerly .
yeah .
because if you sp -, you know , pull on that ,
and i 've always done that as a kid , you know , just yanked on it .
uh -huh .
and they must have been stronger and heavier copper at the time .
sure .
but i broke one on my , on my buick .
and i always remembered it was my own fault ,
and i thought , well i 'm going to t -, going to carefully take those hoses off .
you bet .
well that , that 's what ended up being the real problem on this , was the , uh , i -, the , the pipe wasn 't busted ,
but the ,
it wasn 't soldered in good enough .
oh , really ?
yeah .
and it had , it had broken loose enough to where if it got hot ,
 it , it spread out ,
yeah . 
 and just normal driving didn 't  do it .
yeah .
but if , if , if it was an especially hot day , the pressure would get high enough and it would start blowing the water out inside .
yeah .
it was real aggravating ,
but , uh , i , i , couldn 't eve -, even
a week 's , a week 's time is , is worth a whole lot less than , four , than four hundred dollars to me , you know ,
 yeah . 
 than  to have somebody else do it .
sometimes if you 're a tinkerer , you luck out .
my wife 's ,
 uh -huh . 
 uh ,  chevy , uh , it was a caprice , air conditioning stopped .
i , i just heard it .
i realized that the air conditioning wasn 't cutting in .
uh -huh .
and i went out there for five minutes ,
and i just pushed on the wires .
and sure enough , just pure dumb luck , that the connection over by ,
it 's not the evaporator , the big filter on one side .
uh -huh .
i just pushed that in , and i heard it click .
yeah .
and so sometimes you have dumb luck .
i , i was , you know ,
right .
that 's true .
you could have taken something like that and thought , well , the compressor 's not working . or it would have taken me all day probably if i didn 't do that . but sometimes you have some dumb luck . if you have a little curiosity and you have enough knowledge to check things out .
i know , i feel bad for people who just , when anything goes wrong , a fuse , you know , they just have to take it .
uh -huh .
and i know that 's tough if you don 't , uh , at least give it a shot .
i 've got girls , daughters , and i 've always said i 'd teach them .
and my , my one daughter was fairly interested .
and i really haven 't gotten around to ,
i learned because i , i just , uh , learned , you know
and ,
yeah .
i feel bad about not at least showing them some of the things .
and i 'm going to do that .
i , i told my daughters in college this year , i said , this summer we 're definitely going to spend a little more time on the car .
i said , so you can learn the basics , you know .
well , yeah .
a -,
and , and not only from a , from an economic standpoint , just , just pure safety , you know .
yeah .
if you can , if she can get yourself out of a bad situation without having to , to go to a phone booth and stand around and wait .
 right . 
it , it ,  it  can , it can save a lot of time and trouble .
i have the ,
there 's one expression i don 't like , uh , the country expression , you know , if it ain 't , if it ain 't broke don 't fix it .
okay .
all right ,
i had to register us in there .
hopefully you 're a basketball fan .
excuse me .
hopefully you 're a basketball fan .
yeah ,
i 'm from indiana .
great ,
i 'm glad you are ,
i 'm not .
i couldn 't care about any of it .
but go ahead ,
i , i would like to talk about , uh , maybe college basketball .
i 'd like to see it be more of an amateur sport .
i 'd like to see it turned back to like the southwest conference down here ,
i would like to see texas and all the teams , uh ,
uh -huh .
since we 're supposed to talk about specific teams , i would like to see them turned back to where the college player plays for four years , and then , they 're not , they 're not semi -pro and just go on and are stolen by the n -, the , the league , you know , in three years ,
plus i 'd like to see them to be true athletes where they 're , they 're taking a regular college course .
yeah .
you know , i 'd like to see ,
they didn 't ask that , but they 're talking about college teams ,
i , you know .
yeah .
since you 're being , you can talk for hours , go ahead ,
you , you , if you like sports go right ahead with this one .
um , well , i know like what you just said , um ,
purdue had to , had to , uh ,
yeah .
their best player this year , you know , averaged twenty points a game they had to make him sit the bench . and actually kicked him off the team because , um , his , uh , grades , even though they passed big ten standings and they passed , you know , n c double a , they weren 't , they did not pass , um , purdue requirements .
and so ,
that 's surprising that they , that they have better requirements .
that 's good .
yeah .
that 's what i like to see .
go ahead .
 and see , 
 i 'm all  for that .
so he was treated like all the rest of students , you know .
that 's great .
and so , um , their very best player ,
they probably lost over half their games , because , you know , by twenty points , which is what he averaged , um ,
and so , you know , he had to sit , you know ,
he was kicked off the team .
and then they 've got three players , top , you know , recruiting class this year that
they 're going to have to be , well ,
oh .
the , the prep school they go to before they can play because they aren 't smart enough .
yeah .
you know , it 's just sad
because , i mean , purdue , even though they 're one of the few schools that really , uh , stress academics , they 're suffering , you know
and ,
oh , i , i agree .
i think that that , there 's a lot of inconsistencies when some conference , uh , players come from outside of texas , you know , and play us here .
uh , they 're obviously practicing sixty hours a week , you know ,
and there 's no consistency .
seems to me , that like purdue , when they 're trying ,
a student athlete is spending so many hours in class .
he only has twenty , twenty -five , whatever hours he has to spend on practice .
yeah .
he should be playing , they all should be playing another team that , that has about twenty hours to practice a week .
like .
but there are teams that practice sixty hours a
week , they 're not going to class at all .
yeah .
i mean , that 's , that 's what i mean by semi -pro .
there 's too many semi -pros in college
and i think they ought to get rid of that .
that 's what happened to this guy .
i mean , he was , uh , he didn 't go to class , and so they just said , you know , you can 't make the grades ,
you 're going to have to ,
see you later .
well , i 'm all for , i 'm all for the , oh
baseball has a , uh , a , uh minor league system ,
and i think that the football and basketball , they asked us to talk about basketball , should , you know , let , let them go , have a semi -pro team .
but i think , i 'd like to see college athletes ,
let 's talk about college basketball .
i like that .
yeah .
any basketball that i like ,
i like that .
i , i don 't , i don 't like the pros at all .
i don 't either .
it 's .
uh , they 're high scoring ,
there 's no defense it seems like ,
and they just kind of score a hundred twenty five points , you know ,   hundred twenty -two , you know ,
and i don 't really get much out of that .
yeah .
um , yeah ,
it is fun to watch some real disciplined teams play in , in college .
uh -huh .
and i saw princeton , i think it was , or harvard play this year .
they 're like all white ,
and their starting guard had s a t scores of fifteen hundred .
uh -huh .
and it was so funny to watch them play against the other teams ,
because , it was like , they played so much smarter and more disciplined .
yeah .
i don 't know if they won very many games .
but , i don 't know ,
yeah .
their style of play was so much different from from the teams that just run and gun .
yeah ,
i like high school football , which again is not the subject ,
but that 's so much fun to watch because they 're , they 're pure amateurs , you know , and there 's no money involved .
yeah .
you go to college ,
you don 't really know ,
it loses it somewhere .
yeah .
whatever sport it is , if they 're really putting a lot of money in ,
these players , let 's face it , ninety percent are being paid .
so .
yeah .
i 'd like to see college basketball and all the other sports go back to being amateurs .
i don 't care about seeing the best players in the world play .
i like to see the people going to texas just play , the ones that are in class .
and i 'd like to see athletes , uh , or fellow students , like myself , you know , to play the game .
i , i , in fact , i like amateur sports .
i don 't see it has to be ,
i don 't think that college football , or basketball , should have to be semi -pro , you know .
yeah .
i wish it 'd return to the good old days of the amateur . everybody play .
that 's what i like ,
everybody should play , you know .
i 'm kind of racist , i guess , when i say , i like to see the white guys do well , you know instead of the run and gun all the time .  ]
yeah .
well again , i 'd just like to see the true athlete , the true student athlete ,
play basketball , you know .
yeah .
i don 't like to see the ones that aren 't , have no intention of going to class , uh .
yeah .
then , again just picking a school ,
in fac -,
texas is is usually not the best team , you know ,
because the other teams are , i 'm sure practice a lot more ,
and s m u down here in footballs and trying to get back , uh , to having true student athletes ,
and , and that 's what i think is a lot of fun .
there 's just so much pressure on the schools , i think to win , though , you know .
to win and money ,
yeah .
yeah .
and , you know , it 's like if they don 't win , they don 't get any money , so , and the school suffers , which is kind of bad ,
but that 's just how it always is .
yeah ,
i always thought that col -, university was for an education and then sports of course is part of the education .
i don 't think that sports has to make a lot of money , or you do away with it .
i don 't know why the don 't keep fencing and all that , you know .
yeah .
and , and they seem to be ,
there 's articles in the time magazine and all about whether it be basketball or anything else .
if it 's not making money , then we 'll do away with it .
well , that 's not ,
i thought it was so that you give them an education of that particular discipline .
yeah .
and i , i , i just think that amateur sports should stay in universities ,
that 's where it 's at .
i 'm sure saddened to see ,
i think it was wisconsin or somewhere , they were getting rid of fencing and a couple of other things .
i don 't know what it was .
really .
it just seems so sad to have to only rely on , you know , college football .
is that all they 're going to have to make money , you know .
yeah .
but i didn 't think that was the objective , to make money .
but it seems like it is .
huh . it really is .
i know there 's a lot of pressure on schools to have a winning program .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
to get the best athletes so they can keep their seats full .
you went to indiana university ?
uh , purdue .
oh purdue ,
okay .
yeah .
well , good .
so .
you 're , you 're a t i up in sherman ?
uh -huh .
oh , very good .
are you from dallas area ?
yeah ,
yeah ,
i 'm in the facilities there , down here in dallas .
yeah ,
i guess football is the big sport down here , isn 't it .
uh , certainly high school football , and college football ,
but again high school football is just so much fun to watch ,
because , uh , you know , not everybody plays of course , but they 're still ,
it 's good
and it 's still ,
you know the kids ,
yeah .
and there 's absolutely no money involved whatsoever ,
and you know they 're going to class , you know .
it , it 's , it 's real amateur sports .
you heard of , have you heard of damon bailey .
huh -uh .
the i u white guard that plays .
huh -uh .
well , last year , when he was in high school , they drew a crowd of like forty -one thousand for the state finals , when he played .
is that right ?
forty -,
i never heard    ,
that 's , uh ,
i never been in a bask -, football game in high school that had that many .
yeah ,
so that 's , i mean , that 's pretty big .
like he 's from indiana ,
and he plays for indiana now .
and , indiana   him to be a lot bigger than pro basketball up there .
the pacers don 't really draw that big of a crowd
you know , the high school games , i mean , that seems to be the big attraction , and college .
well , my office mate here , earl , he , he goes to all the maverick games
and he loves that .
he , he would be ,
this is a great question for him , uh ,
to talk about basket -.
like he 's got ,
i 'm looking at his calendar ,
he 's got all over the place ,
and he goes to a lot of the maverick games and everything .
but , i , i , i can 't get interested at all ,
zero .
i , i listen to him ,
and occasionally i 'll watch them on channel eleven ,
but gee ,
i can 't , uh ,
more than five minutes of a basketball game , just seems about ,
that 's it ,
of , uh , pro anyway .
yeah ,
yeah .
seems like you could set the score at a hundred and then give them five minutes to play ,
then it 'd be the same result .
yeah .
because they , they start ,
they shoot so much ,
and then the last , what , five minutes they decide who 's going to be the winner , i guess .
uh -huh .
yeah ,
i 'm surprised a little bit when you 're talking about basketball how some players work .
mavericks had , oh two players this year that they got rid of last year .
i 'll think of them in a minute .
perkins , sam perkins ,
can 't think of the other one .
they 're both .
tarpley ,
is he one ?
pardon me ?
tarpley ?
yeah ,
tarpley ,
and they both left this past year ,
and both of them were on playoff teams , uh ,
so , they benefitted tremendously by leaving the mavericks .
yeah .
and sam perkins , here , he 's one guy i did follow
from ,
think he was in virginia ,
i can 't think of what school he went to ,
but from .
i guess he 's been here about five , six , seven years in the pros .
and he was ,
uh -huh .
he never quite achieved the , you know , the super stardom that he had in , in college ,
but , uh , basketball , they have a nice ,
i don 't know if you 've down to the sports for reunion arena .
it 's ,
well , what kind of garden do you have ?
well , we 've tried having ,
let me turn the t v off ,
we 've tried having a vegetable garden ,
and i 'm from chicago ,
and the way that , uh , bugs and weeds grow down here is very different from chicago .
and we have tried several years in a row ,
and we 've given up , between the fire ants , the pill bugs , the weeds , the drought , and a hundred and ten degree heat all summer ,
and we just kind of , uh , decided to go with a few flowers and give up on the vegetable garden
oh .
we had to put so much poison out on everything that we thought , who 'd want to eat that stuff .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
you know , so we have really been frustrated by our gardening attempts here ,
and , uh , if you really water a lot , you can do it ,
but , you know , when you have to pay for water , it really gets to be an annoyance to have to water constantly .
uh -huh .
so , right now we 're just ,
do you have a lawn ?
yeah ,
we , we just try to maintain the lawn and the shrubs right now , and the trees .
we have a peach tree .
that 's the extent of our , um , contributing to our food supply .
but that 's nice to have
but ,
oh , yeah .
yeah ,
yeah .
so what do you do up there ?
well , um , actually it ,
we 've sort of had an ideal spring .
um .
oh , wow .
and , um , the , the peonies have been out for now about three weeks and the roses have been blooming for two weeks ,
and the grass is , uh , this lush green ,
and of course i 've got lots of weeds in mine because ,
i don 't use any poison either .
yeah .
but , um , you know , i just keep looking at ,
and i say , jeez , you know , this is the first year it 's been so perfect .
really .
gosh .
but , and my garden , you know ,
my tomatoes are two and a half feet tall the plants and ,
oh , boy that sounds wonderful .
you know , i 'm g -, i 'm going , gee , this can 't , you know ,
we 'll have a freeze .
if you don 't have a frost you 'll be all right
that 's what i remember from living up north , is that you 'd get everything set and then you 'd have a frost
and half the stuff would get frostbitten ,
and you 'd have to .
well , that 's it .
last year , i think it was , you know , my peonies were , were , budding in january ,
and , you know , there was no way that was going to make it ,
wow .
uh -huh .
and sure enough , you know , we d -, had really mild weather until i think it was may or something and then , you know , everything just got hit hard
oh , boy ,
that 's frustrating .
so , but yeah ,
it , it 's interesting ,
and i enjoy gardening .
my son does the mowing of the grass .
oh , yeah ,
my husband does that , thank goodness , because i , that 's not a pleasure for me
i don 't think that 's a pleasure for anybody , the m -, the mowing .
i love gardens that are well tended ,
and i just ,
there 's been a few different places i 've lived where i 've just n -,
i don 't know whether it 's little old ladies living there or what , but you could just tell that they had a love , uh , a love affair with their gardens , with beautiful wild flowers ,
and just ,
i love the host of colors that just keep coming all , you know , year long .
and , uh , i , i was in england once ,
and that 's one thing that impressed me so much is no matter what size yard somebody had , they had a beautiful garden in it .
you know , it could be three feet by four feet or something .
uh -huh .
so i do admire that , but i haven 't really put , uh , too much energy into it .
course we have two little kids that are two and three years old
oh , they help you .
so that has put a crimp in my every activity other than diapers and laundry , i 'll tell you
oh dear .
oh but that 's nice , you know ,
i mean the peach tree is , is a start
and ,
tha -,
yeah ,
that 's really lovely .
i would love to have different fruit trees .
it 's , it 's been wonderful to have the peaches .
they 're just delicious .
and , we , we ha -, we have , still have to spray some ,
but we don 't have to just asphyxiate ourself with the poison , which is good ,
because i just ,
i can 't see the point in doing that and eating anything out of it afterwards .
right .
what about tomatoes ,
aren 't they pretty hardy ?
um , we 've tried them ,
but again , it 's just like the sun scorch .
oh .
we 've tried them in kind of halfway in the shade and halfway in the s -,
i mean it 's just ,
you really , really
uh -huh .
have to be prepared to water constantly during the summer .
oh .
people that have been successful out here have done this drip irrigation and installed that ,
and um , that 's really what makes the most sense ,
because you don 't have to use so much water ,
uh -huh .
and it really does the job .
but it 's just amazing how hot and dry and for how long it gets out here .
and if you 're not really committed to it ,
i mean , me , i 'm , you know , i 'm real committed to it for about a week , and then i forget about it for a week ,
and then i go , oh , yeah , i need to do something ,
and by then it 's burned up , you know .
uh -huh .
it 's just too distracting right now with these little ones in our lives ,
so maybe when i get older i 'll find , uh , some joy in that
well , i would a -, assume , too ,
yeah .
i mean , you 've got three or four months you 're talking about of , of bad weather .
yeah ,
it just gets so hot so fast here .
uh -huh .
we don 't have really a spring or a fall and it just , uh , immediately heats up .
so , that 's one thing i miss about living up north , as i remember , um , you know , the long springs and long falls and the cooler weather .
it was really nice .
uh -huh .
we always had gardens when i was , uh , living in chicago .
in fact , my mother once tore up our entire back yard
and redid it .
i 'll never forget .
got my stepfather to put in , uh , a waterfall and a little pond in one corner .
i mean , that was like the most energy invested in anything in the whole time i ever knew him
they remodeled the entire back yard .
then they sold the house and got divorced ,
so i don 't know what that says about it all
oh , dear .
oh , but she used to love to do stuff like that .
sounds like it would have been pretty .
yeah ,
it really was .
i enjoyed it there .
but maybe when the boys get a little older , we 'll do some more planting ,
because they like to see things grow .
they 've done a couple of little seed projects ,
and so i think it would be fun for them .
oh , sure ,
sure .
yeah ,
yeah .
well , it sounds like you , you 've got your hands full
oh , yes
they 're both running around now .
and , you know , gardening isn 't , isn 't high on the list ,
but it 's not off the list .
yeah ,
well , it 's very therapeutic ,
i think , really to get out there and dig in the dirt ,
uh -huh .
you know .
they certainly enjoy that part of it
it 's just trying to keep anything .
i planted bulbs last , uh , fall on the side guard , and when i went out there in the spring
and the first day they came out the little one went and pulled all the flowers off ,
and the flower petals were scattered all over the walk
oh .
he thought , what are these fun toys that mommy put out here with all these colors for me to play with ?
at least he didn 't eat them ,
i mean , i guess i could be thankful for that .
right .
maybe next year they 'll do better .
yeah ,
really .
if they survive this year .
oh , well , good luck to you .
okay ,
well , thanks .
nice talking to you .
it was nice talking to you too .
bye -bye .
okay
have you ever , uh , organized a family reunion ?
uh , no
i have never organized one .
but we are , we have one , uh , we are going to have one on memorial day , i guess .
uh -huh .
they have had one the last two years . we go out to the , my dad 's farm and , uh , and , you know , it is just a picnic and spend the night .
uh -huh .
go fishing and stuff like that .
how many people usually show up ?
oh , about ten .
oh , it is not that big .
huh -uh .
because ,
it ,
uh , we have had sort of weekends like that too .
but i never thought of it really as a reunion .
uh -huh .
i sort of think of a reunion with my , uh , all the extended family
everybody ,
yeah .
yeah .
that would be hard for us because most of the family is out in california .
uh -huh .
and some is in new york and north carolina ,
and it gets ,
it is kind of hard to get ev -, get everybody organized .
uh , is there someone ,
do you all just sort of chip in and help out with stuff when you are there ?
or ,
uh , yes .
yeah .
my , my , uh , dad has a house out there anyway .
and there is , there is , uh ,
he keeps a s -, uh , food out there ,
uh -huh .
year round .
so , so he does not live there though ?
uh , no .
it is , it is , it is like a country , country home .
vacation home .
uh -huh .
yeah .
it sounds nice . uh ,
are there kids that are there too , or mostly adults ?
yeah .
the grandchildren .
uh -huh .
just a few .
it just depends ,
uh , uh , all my grandparents are dead so , uh , there is , there are not , you know , none of them are there .
and , and , uh , then an uncle is dead .
uh -huh .
so the , the big family is a lot smaller that it used to be .
uh -huh .
are you all located in texas ?
uh , yeah .
we are in , we are all , uh ,
like they live up in sherman .
it is near lake texoma .
uh -huh .
and ,
uh -huh .
yeah .
uh , all of his children live in the dallas area too .
so ,
yeah .
that to me is ,
yeah ,
dallas i know of ,
houston i know of ,
and that is about it
uh -huh .
in texas .
the rest of it is sort of a big void to me .
yeah .
but , uh , you know , we have , uh , well ,
we all got together ,
it was about two years ago for ,
i was ,
i had graduated from college .
and , uh , i was going to live in france for a year .
and so my parents invited ,
it was not just family ,
it was friends too .
but , uh , we all got together for just a party .
and that was kind of fun .
uh -huh .
nice to have everybody together at once and things like that .
french reunion ?
well ,
yeah .
not quite french ,
but , uh , it was sort of a reunion before leaving .
it was fun .
it was on , uh , new year 's day .
so it was almost a celebration of the new year too at the same time .
uh -huh .
yeah .
it was kind of fun .
but , uh , but who was it ?
a friend of mine had a big family reunion a couple of years ago
and , you know , everybody flew in from all over the place for the weekend .
and it really sounded like it was fun .
but , i am not quite sure what i would do .
i think it would be fun to like rent a big mansion or house someplace ,
and have everybody meet someplace where they do not really know .
uh -huh .
and have different areas to explore and things like that .
yeah .
so that would be kind of fun .
meet in the middle .
yep .
uh -huh .
where nobody lives
right .
but at least that way it is at nobody 's house , so nobody one , no one person is responsible for everything .
yeah .
and they do not have to clean up afterwards .
yep .
yeah .
that is for sure .
the cleaning up can be a mess .
uh -huh .
but uh , do you have horses or anything at your dad 's farm ?
i am , i am sorry ?
does , does your dad have horses there ?
uh , no ,
he does not really have any , any , uh , uh , domestic livestock anyway .
uh -huh .
but , he leased , uh , to his neighbor for the cattle to feed on .
i see ,
so it 's ,
so he really does use it as a vacation home .
it is not like a farm that he has somebody else run for him or something like that .
yeah .
pretty much .
uh -huh .
he has a garden and , uh , a lot of fruit trees and blueberry bushes and things .
well , that sounds nice .
do people actually pick the fruit and things ?
uh -huh .
and then there is wild blackberries there too .
uh -huh .
so ,
yeah .
he gets ,
i , used to , we used to go pick wild blackberries at my friend 's property ,
but we never got enough .
i used to make jam ,
but i never had enough to really make , you know , more than a jar or something .
huh .
so it was not so worth it .
yeah .
it is kind of , they 're kind of off and on it seems like .
uh -huh .
depends on the rain .
that sounds ,
is ,
uh ,
does he have a lot of land to go walking around and things there ?
it is , uh , it is , uh , eighty acres .
well , that is pretty big
uh -huh .
i do not know how they do scale down there .
you know , here it would be a huge amount of land .
yeah ,
yeah .
yeah .
because they ,
 per -, is
this  house here that has a lot of space is three or four acres .
yeah .
and , uh ,
as opposed to tens of acres .
and most of it , you know ,
you just spend time on maybe ten acres of it .
uh -huh .
and , uh , because that is where the ponds are and where everybody fishes .
uh -huh .
we kind of have a , an informal contest .
my uncle , uh , put some bass in , uh , his pond a few years ago .
well , he put some crappie too .
but the bass ,
we have not been able to catch any of the adult bass yet .
so ,
uh -huh .
they are in there , but they are real spooky .
yeah .
i think my dad put some .
we have a little pond at our , at his vacation home too .
and , y -,
i mean really little .
uh -huh .
and they were having problems with too many goldfish because we had put some goldfish in ,
and there were too many little goldfish ,
and so the big ones never got bigger .
oh , yeah .
and , uh , somebody suggested to get a bass .
uh -huh .
and so they went fishing and caught a bass near some place and put it in there and never saw it again
never saw the bass ?
no .
oh .
so we do not know whether it is living
or ,
oh , it is probably in there just burping goldfish .
yep .
yeah .
we still have lots of little goldfish .
they propagate pretty well , those little fish .
yeah ,
yeah ,
they really do .
because we started ,
we have got hundreds in there now ,
and we started with , i think , ten or twenty little feeder fish that i picked up for a dollar , you know ,
uh -huh .
ma -, no matter how many it was for a dollar .
uh -huh .
and , and some of them are probably eight inches long .
but he wants your really big ones , you know , the ones that get to be like a foot and a half long .
oh ,
and ,
yeah .
it ,
they ha -,
there is a , uh ,
you might put some , like some yellow catfish in there .
i do not know if they would live very well up in new york ,
but they get huge .
oh , okay .
and , uh , they routinely use them for bait for , uh , goldfish for bait for yellow catfish .
well , we would want to put some small ones in so they do not eat the big guys , the goldfish too
uh -huh .
but , yeah .
we could see .
i do not know if yellow catfish live up this way .
but catfish do , i think .
yeah .
uh -huh .
they live in the mississippi river all the way through minnesota and up into canada .
so , that ,
you mean ,
well , we could try it .
that is a good idea .
uh -huh .
because he was trying to catch them , you know , using little , uh ,
i forget ,
there 's little , uh , nets you can use to catch fish to use as feeder fish and things like that .
uh -huh .
minnow nets or something .
uh ,
my father was taking those and trying to catch the goldfish .
and it was really funny ,
because , uh , one time he left the net in the pond ,
and he like would put some tuna fish or things in the middle of it to attract the fish .
uh -huh .
and , uh , he left it in the middle of the pond
and that night he came out , and the trap was gone .
uh
and it was a raccoon that had taken it .
right
so it was really funny .
and you could see that , you know ,
you could see where the trap , the trap was dragged and things like that .
uh -huh .
and so ,
yeah .
that is what happens
but do you guys have fishing competitions while you are there ?
yeah
and , uh , we feed the catfish .
uh .
they feed the catfish like , uh , every couple of weeks .
and , uh , and sometimes that is the best time to catch them .
when they are feeding ?
yeah .
because they will just , they will just come after anything then .
uh -huh .
and you could catch a couple anyway during that time .
what do you feed them ?
uh , mixed purina , uh ,
it is , uh , cat food , uh , catfish food .
really ?
yeah .
but ,
and it is especially made for catfish .
yeah .
well , i do not know how much different it is from dog food but , you know ,
uh -huh .
it is , uh , it looks like purina high pro .
yeah .
that is funny .
but they come up to the top .
and it is the best time to take pictures ,
because they come up to the top , and you can see their whiskers come through the water .
uh -huh .
and they 're ,
the ca -, the big catfish just kind of vacuum the top of the water .
uh -huh .
i have never seen catfish , you know , except in fi -, filleted on a plate , i think maybe .
i think i have seen once or twice in like the museum .
uh -huh .
but i have never seen them ,
just alive someplace .
that would be fun to see .
well , they are really funny fish .
uh -huh .
when you catch them , they make a kind of a , a burping , growling sound at you .
uh -huh .
and they try to hit you with their tails .
how big do they get ?
oh , well , the channel catfish get up to , uh ,
i think the world record is fifty some pounds .
okay . but how long in feet ?
uh ,
do you know ?
that , that is only about three and a half feet long .
that is pretty big though .
yeah ,
yeah .
they get real fat .
uh -huh .
uh , from the time ,
uh -huh .
they , they stay slender until they get to be , uh , eighteen inches long , and then they start to widen out .
uh , my daughter , we were up there one time and my daughter was fishing
and i think that was when she was three .
and she caught a catfish by accident .
she was fishing for sunfish .
uh -huh .
and she said ,  "here ," and she handed me her rod and reel
and , and , uh , you know , it was just pulling drag out .
uh -huh .
and it swimmed wherever it wanted to .
yeah .
that sounds amazing .
i will have to see them sometime .
but , all righty .
okay .
it was nice talking to you .
nice talking to you too .
okay .
bye -bye .
enjoy your , uh , weekend .
yeah .
have a nice memorial weekend .
okay .
you too .
bye -bye .
bye .
okay ,
now you can tell me what you do .
uh -huh .
oh , great .
uh -huh .
uh , well , i work with computers , just like your son and i actually do research in speech recognition   part of the reason i 'm participating in the project is to see how the stuff goes .
uh -huh .
but , um , i was working
uh -huh .
well , actually i haven 't worked for any large companies per se uh , recently
uh -huh .
yeah
but hopefully the job that i will have will have lots of benefits namely lots of vacations not real good salary but lots of vacations .
well , the one john works for seems to have a l -, you know , good benefits ,
and the pay is decent .
yeah
the , uh ,
well actually , where i was working the company
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
one of the companies i was working for actually had very good health care benefits which these days i think are really important because health care is so ridiculously expensive .
uh .
because we 're , we 're paying our own insurance right now .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
but and i 'm ,
oh ,
we actually had a little baby so i 'm taking a little bit of a time off from work .
great ,
i had , i had a granddaughter
oh , congratulations .
and so one thing that i 'm very concerned with now is first of all health benefits
right .
because it 's more important with a family and you know , our doctor 's vi -, routine doctor 's visits covered ,
my health insurance only covers , um , the emergency care .
uh -huh .
do you have major medical benefits ?
right , yeah ,
but i don 't ,
that , that helps some ,
if ,
right .
it depends on what your deductible is how high it is .
well , my ,
our deductible 's five hundred
each person .
but it 's for each event .
yeah ,
that 's pretty har -, that 's pretty high ,
right
right .
that 's , that 's right .
but , you know , so it covers the emergency things but it doesn 't cover if you get sick it doesn 't cover doctor 's visits , things like that .
oh , yeah ,
it certainly is .
and five hundred dollars is a lot to come up with for each person to be able to start using your major medical , too .
uh .
yeah ,
i know where my daughter works ,
now she , she ,
uh -huh .
course we live in a , a rural sort of setting and where she works she has no benefits at all .
wow .
and her wage is not , not very good
uh -huh .
but it 's , it 's the type of area we live in .
of course , living expenses aren 't as bad either , though , which makes a difference .
and probably the medical care is less expensive , too .
uh -huh .
well , she has to pay for it herself you know , they have to pay for their own insurance .
but , uh
so i think that in general the doctor 's fees are probably lower there ,
and so the insurance would cost lower ,
uh , well , from what i 've seen ,
from my aunt and uncle really from florida up to here ,
they 're not that much different .
uh -huh .
well , i know that friends of mine had a baby up in boston and their costs were about fifty percent of what it cost to have it in manhattan .
is that right ?
uh -huh .
and they were at one of the better hospitals , you know and , you know , good doctors in boston .
wow
that 's a big difference .
and i was at one of the big hospitals in new york .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
but that 's a huge difference just between you know , and it 's two big cities that i think of as somewhat comparable .
oh , yeah ,
should be .
so i was pretty shocked at that .
but the other thing that i 'm really concerned about ,
and most companies don 't have ,
yes . uh -huh .
some are starting to have , is day care because it would be really nice to be able to have , you know , someone that could watch my daughter at work .
and i 'd go to work ,
and if she were sick i could go down and see her , if she needs to be fed , whatever .
and it would be much more convenient .
and i ,
yeah it would be more convenient , too .
oh , yeah .
it would be more convenient , more productive i think ,
my other daughter works and has ,
they have to take their two children to day care , you know .
uh -huh .
and , uh , it , it 's ,
i don 't know how they do it ,
i really don 't . you know ,
getting them there and then , and going to work , and then picking them up and ,
and , and your hours are ,
all the preparations .
much more constrained and things like that .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
and , that , to me , well , that , you know ,
uh -huh .
those three things , the health care , vacation , and day care are probably the most important benefits .
uh -huh .
i suppose i should be concerned with life insurance and , uh , retirement plans
but ,
oh , i don 't know ,
i think those benefits you mentioned , sometimes they 're even more important than you -, the wage itself .
yeah .
if you can get those benefits even , uh ,
they , they come out to much , a much better benefit than , than an increase in your wage a lot of times .
right
because you 're , you know ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
certainly something like day care at the work place would make life so much simpler that it 's worth paying , you know , having a lower salary .
oh , yeah .
i would certainly accept a lower salary for that .
oh , yeah ,
it would make it a lot better .
you know , everything else being equal
because your life would be so much easier .
uh -huh .
and there 's a question of quality of life also .
yeah .
uh , well , and if it was there , you would really have a little more , uh , knowledge on what 's going on probably , you know , with your child .
right ,
right .
and , you , you , you don 't feel like you 're a half hour away if she something happened .
yeah .
and , you 're less preoccupied with it , i think .
right ,
yeah .
but unfortunately , there aren 't ,
i think i b m has started having that in certain locations .
i don 't know ,
my daughter , one daughter works for m c i ,
and they don 't , they , where she works they don 't have anything like that .
uh -huh .
is that locally ?
uh , pittsburgh .
uh -huh .
pittsburgh , pennsylvania .
yeah
because pittsburgh 's a big enough city , too .
uh -huh .
but you know , i wouldn 't be surprised if thing 's like that didn 't happen more in smaller communities before they happen in bigger ones .
uh -huh .
yeah ,
just because people might be more flexible in smaller locations and things like that .
because many times small companies offer better benefits in terms of quality of life than larger companies .
uh -huh .
like , uh , one company had proposed to me that i could come back to work after having the baby , um , any where between ten and forty hours a week .
uh -huh .
and , um , call my own days , call my own hours ,
yeah ,
oh , so they were very flexible and that , that would be great ,
yeah .
and which
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
many times at a large company it 's almost impossible to do things like that .
they say you 're going to do it this way , and that 's the way it 's going to be .
right .
yeah .
uh -huh .
and if you get two weeks off , you get two weeks off and you 're not allowed two weeks and one day .
yeah ,
yeah ,
yeah .
so it all depends on what your position is there , too .
true ,
well , that 's true in any , any company , i think .
yeah .
i 've , i 've never , well i can 't say i 've never ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i 've maybe worked five years out of our married life out of the ho -, you know , out of the home but , uh , the rest of the time i 've been an avon lady and a   lady .
was that when you were , um , well ,
those have its pluses and minuses , too .
uh -huh .
i 've been a consultant recently and so i don 't have any benefits at all
and ,
uh -huh ,
and you have to take care of any benefits you want yourself ,
yeah .
right ,
and the same thing
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
my husband is unfortunately being paid as a consultant and we tried to argue that he should get more salary for that than what he is
and , um , they , they , they ,
usually consultants make very good income .
right ,
and they , they refuse to give him more salary .
is that right ?
oh .
uh -huh .
because they say they can 't pay more than this and that , and they 're not allowed to pay him more than what his previous salary was and things like that and , you know , times are rough now ,
so it 's , new ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
it 's harder to get the , uh , you know , increases and things but , um ,
yeah ,
well he 's ,
a   consultant really is , should be more knowledgeable than everybody else , you know so it stands to reason they should really ha -, have more benefits .
right ,
well , he 's been doing a long term ,
he 's being called a consultant ,
and he 's really sort of a temporary employee at a place .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
and , they , they pay him as a consultant but he doesn 't get any health benefits ,
um .
he doesn 't get , well we don 't care about retirement benefits .
he doesn 't get , um , vacation benefits
uh -huh .
and he does a lot of things that get factored into somebody else 's salary .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
yeah .
uh -huh .
so really his salary should be , you know , twenty percent or thirty percent higher just based on that , not including the fact that you know , it 's a less , long term commitment for the company and all that sort of stuff .
yeah ,
and they 'll do it ,
do you or your husband work for t i ,
or
oh , are you ,
oh , i see .
well , that 's neat .
i 'm a contract person at t i in fact involved with , uh , data switchboard and , uh , do you work for t i ?
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
so , i 've worked for them for several years , like twelve now , i guess .
right ,
i try to ,
oh , you sound very young like just out of college
i try to think of myself as young ,
but , uh , well , have you seen any movies recently ?
uh , i 'm trying to think ,
oh , did you ?
we saw , uh , dances with wolves and , uh , have you seen that one ?
no ,
i haven 't ,
that was excellent .
i have , have a hard time with movies that are real long .
i don 't know .
well , so oddly enough , i do too ,
yeah .
i get tired of sitting there , and so does my husband ,
yeah .
well , i 've heard a lot of good things about it .
but we both just thoroughly , you know enjoyed it , just really liked it and , uh , i 'm trying to think ,
we went to see a , uh , a real funny one ,
was it ,
i can 't think now what the name of it was i 've gone blank .
uh , we , my wife and i went and saw a couple of funny ones .
oh , we have not seen that ,
we want to see that one .
we saw the naked gun , two and a half and that was , that was pretty funny ,
and then we saw ,
what was the spoof on top gun ,
oh , i haven 't seen that one .
it 's oh , i can 't think of what that was called .
we saw that too ,
tha -,
i was pretty disappointed in that one .
were you .
yeah ,
but , uh , so , you know , through the summer ,
we have small children , so we don 't get to see too many , but we 've seen i guess two or three movies this past summer .
my husband doesn 't enjoy the shows as much going to them ,
uh -huh .
right .
he likes to rent them and so we watch a lot of them , you know , at home as they come out ,
and , uh ,
have you seen ghosts yet ?
yes ,
yes .
i really , i enjoyed that movie ,
did you ?
really .
uh -huh .
now i , i was real disappointed i 'm a real big patrick swayze fan and , uh , i was really disappointed in it ,
it was -,
one ,
i don 't think it was as funny as what i was an -, anticipating ,
oh , yeah ,
well ,
yeah .
and i guess i was expecting it to be kind of funny and , uh , and it wasn 't you know , at all ,
yeah ,
uh -huh .
it was , it was more of a love story and , uh , so i was really disappointed in that because i like him real well .
uh , van damme ,
yeah ,
i think ,
we just got through watching one with , uh , uh , is it claude van damme yeah , and , uh , enjoyed it ,
i can 't think what the name of
right .
right .
uh -huh .
it was a , uh , of course , one of the typical you know , kicking , fighting lots of blood and guts and all that type movie ,
and , and we enjoyed that ,
and , uh , the , uh , uh , the one with jody foster , did you see it ?
oh , silence of the lambs ?
yes .
yes ,
i did .
wasn 't that excellent ?
yeah ,
i really enjoyed that a lot .
yeah ,
uh -huh .
that was one that , that stayed with me you know , for a month ,
i just ,
i kept thinking about it , you know ,
yeah ,
well , it 's amazing ,
no .
but really , i mean , when you stop and think about it , anthony perkins didn 't have that big a role in the movie and yet it was his character that was so intriguing ,
oh , it was excellent ,
yeah .
and , and , of course , he 's such a , uh , very good actor anyway and , i think he made the movie ,
yeah ,
i do too ,
yeah ,
i really did you know , jody foster was good , too , but i think , i think anthony perkins was the one that , that really made the movie ,
i agree with you .
is it anthony perkins or anthony hopkins ?
oh , hopkins ,
hopkins ,
uh -huh .
i 'm sorry hopkins ,
yeah .
i always get those   mixed up .
i know i know .
it , uh , well ,
i 'm not a real big jody foster fan ,
but i thought she was good in that .
well , i agr -,
well , i haven 't been ,
i 'm , i saw her in the keys ,
and i thought that was a pretty good movie ,
but i thought she ,
now , i didn 't see that one .
that was , that was pretty interesting movie ,
and , uh , but , you know , i , i did ,
i really liked the silence of the lambs ,
that was really intriguing ,
and it , it didn 't scare me all that much , you know ,
and i , i don 't like to go to movies to be scared ,
no ,
that 's not why i go so ,
right ,
and that one was .
no i like a good suspenseful story ,
and that one very definitely kept you on the edge of the seats ,
in fact , i want to , uh , rent it when it comes out for my husband to see ,
oh , he didn 't see it ?
because , he didn 't he won 't go see that ,
oh .
uh -huh .
no , i went with , uh , our daughter and , uh , so , you know , saw it with her , and , uh , enjoyed it .
my all time favorite is weekend at bernie 's .
oh , really ?
did you see it ?
yeah ,
i 've seen it .
oh , i 've seen it , you know ,
we saw it at the movies ,
uh -huh .
and then we 've rented it several times and , we just love it ,
in fact we have a ten year old grandson that ,
uh -huh .
yeah ,
i 've seen that .
he and my husband and i , we just sit there and cackle you know , just get hysterical .
it 's pretty , it 's pretty cute .
i guess , you know , as far as comedies go , probably my favorite is young frankenstein .
uh , yes ,
yes ,
i love that movie ,
yeah ,
so ,
my husband liked that uh , he 's a big gene wilder fan ,
yeah ,
well , gene wilder doesn 't do that much for me ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
but i 'm a big , uh , mel brooks fan all his movies , i really , really  
he has a new one out .
he does ?
yeah ,
uh -huh .
uh , i have seen it advertised .
i don 't know what the name of it is .
oh , is that the one with , that 's he 's starring in ?
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
oh , yeah ,
that came out , like early in the summer or something like that .
yes ,
yes .
yeah ,
i haven 't seen that one either .
yeah ,
my husband wants to see that one ,
oh , blazing saddles .
and , uh , did you see that one that he made years and years ago about the , uh , the sheriff blazing saddles .
yeah ,
uh -huh .
oh , that 's my husband 's all time favorite , i think .
oh , uh -huh .
i like , i like that one too , but i thought young frankenstein was better .
did you ?
yeah ,
that , that was just , you know , had all kinds of things throughout the whole movie ,
i just really enjoyed it ,
and , uh , um , i 'm trying to think ,
because we saw another one that we thought was really good , early this summer , that was a suspenseful movie .
i 'm trying to remember what it was ,
because it , you know , it 's ,
okay .
all right .
capital punishment .
okay ,
what 's your views on it ?
um , for myself , i 'm personally against it ,
but we seem to have a duality of , in this country where most states in theory have it , but , but , but do not use it .
correct .
okay ,
well , i 'm for it .
i think there are certain crimes that definitely , uh , call for it .
i , i feel like that child molestation and murder
i don 't see any sense in someone living that does things like that .
i , i don 't feel like they 're a benefit to society in any way ,
and of course texas has it , but they very seldom , you know , put it into effect .
okay , well ,
so instead all of our prisons are full of people on , you know a lot of people on death row .
uh , texas uses it as , about as much as any other state .
texas is a big state ,
well , uh , yeah which is not very often .
right .
um , here in maryland to the capital punishment law ,
people are sometimes sentenced to capital punishment , but no one , no one has , actually has the sentence carried out .
uh , i 'd certainly ,
uh -huh .
i think so .
what do they do , just keep them on death row for the rest of their life .
uh -huh .
i , uh ,
uh -huh .
  or affair number uh , in fact , i think that , it , it affected the sentence though capital punishment is available ,
the sentence of life without possibility of parole , uh , has become a common one , and is being , being used much more .
do you have the overcrowding in your prisons that we are facing down here ?
uh , i don 't know the exact numbers ,
but , but yes ,
prisons are overcrowded .
i know that we have , you know ,
really in fact they 're , they 're releasing people , uh , that are in there for , you know , not major crimes , but , uh robberies and assault and things like that ,
and , because they don 't have room , which then they 're coming back on the streets and of course , doing it again ,
and um , you know , so we 're having problems in , in that way ,
and i know that there are some cases that , uh , you know , capital punishment does not fit the crime ,
um .
and there are extenuating circumstances on certain types , um , but i have to say that i 'm honestly for it uh , almost that eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth .
okay ,
you 're , you 're certainly in the majority uh , at least in this country .
yes .
uh , we are , i guess , the only one of the major western nations currently with capital punishment .
i know they use it very , um ,
they do not have it in europe , as i understand .
no ,
at least not in western europe .
probably not in eastern europe these days either .
um , there are many reasons for it ,
but they , they certainly have lower crime rates and lower murder rates .
yes ,
you wonder what their , you know , how they manage to do that .
well , in part it 's , uh , it 's the nature of societies , perhaps more homogenous society , in many cases , uh ,
arguably , if
arguably is because of , of , uh , of , uh , welfare state benefits .
though i tend to be , we tend to be skeptical .
well , england has , uh , don 't they have a large , fairly large welfare ?
yes ,
oh there 's no question that , that they , that , uh , you know , they have , you know , all kinds of cradle to grave , uh , programs , welfare programs providing for everyone some way .
i , i , i ,
however the question is is that making the difference .
oh , i , i don 't know .
but we have a lot of welfare programs
oh .
and if both do and they tend to have less crime , you wonder if that has anything to do with it then ,
you know , or is it ,
in our society , people are brought up over here thinking that , you know , everybody owes them something .
um , i think , i think that idea is even , even more common in western europe .
oh , do you ?
uh -huh .
well , that 's interesting .
i would not have , i would not have said that .
i would have said that it was more prevalent here in the united states .
that 's an interesting theory .
i 'm not that familiar , you know ,
i 've only been over there a couple of times
me , too .
and i 'm not that familiar with , that ,
all i know is that , for instance we were in germany in , uh ,
okay .
why don 't you go ahead and start .
okay ,
well , we subscribe to people magazine and to time ,
uh -huh .
and , of course i like the people magazine because it 's gossipy and it 's fast reading ,
and , uh , the time of course , is , uh , you know , more newsworthy
and , uh , it has more world affair type things , of course .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
and then i will purchase a good housekeeping occasionally , especially around the holiday time because of recipes and ideas and and things like that and , uh , do you subscribe to any magazines ?
yeah ,
i , well , i have , in a whi -, for a while i haven 't gotten any because i just find that i 'm not reading what i 'm getting because , uh , i have so much going on in my life
that seems to be the last thing i pick up ,
so i found that i was wasting my money . as much as i enjoy them , uh , when i do subscribe
i , i 've gotten in the past the parents magazine and , uh , the housekeeping magazine uh .
yes ,
yeah ,
uh -huh you probably have smaller children younger children .
yeah ,
yeah ,
my children , our children are grown and , uh , i 'm letting their mother read on the grandchildren
right ,
well , i found that after a couple of years of having a parents magazine it was getting repetitious ,
so i kind of canceled it anyway for that reason .
uh , the housekeeping magazines i do like because they , like you say , they have nice , uh , recipes in them and ideas , but , uh , lately they 've just been piling up on me ,
so i figured it wasn 't , uh , something i needed at this point in time .
well , do you think that people subscribe to magazines as much as they used to ?
i don 't know ,
i , i , well ,
my husband would love to have more .
now he 's the type who will get the , uh , inc . magazine and money magazine and all the financial type magazines ,
yes ,
now my husband does that ,
yeah ,
uh -huh ,
yes .
and you know , and of course , uh , naturally wall street journal , you know and , or sports illustrated ,
but i don 't know ,
uh -huh .
i know a few people leafing through them at the store but you just don 't hear people talk about them ,
and i know years ago , when , uh , my children were young and stuff , i just loved ladies home journal , mccall 's , good housekeeping ,
uh -huh .
and i took them all and , uh , then , oh , i don 't know what
uh -huh .
in the seventies , maybe , late seventies they changed their format and i haven 't ,
i don 't think there 's been a magazine as they used to be even good housekeeping i don 't ,
well yeah ,
and some of those have had what , what i consider or what
i get the idea that they are maybe the , the more pricier type magazines , as far as women 's magazines .
they seem just to be so chocked full of , of ads .
oh , they are .
uh -huh .
my sister , uh , takes , uh , town and country and vogue and she sends them to me ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
yes .
right
yes .
yeah .
and there 's really nothing in them but advertisements for very expensive clothes , very expensive jewelry things that the average middle class citizen is not going to be purchasing you know , and if i want to drool or if i want to see how the other half is living you know , then i can , i look through them and i do ,
i just ,
what i do is i flip through them and , and pitch them then , you know ,
they 're not something i , you know , take any length of time over .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
i have discovered that , you know , with my available time , i would rather actually read a book than a magazine .
yes i enjoy books a lot more that 's true .
yes and , uh .
so , but .
well now i have certainly stopped subscribing as much as i used to ,
other than my children have gotten .
yes
you know , they get tons of magazines it seems they 're always getting something in the mail
and , and , uh , so between reading to them and , uh , reading the newspaper ,
and then i have a book that i 'm occasionally reading when i get a chance ,
but i just don 't get a chance for those , uh , newsy magazines , the ones that are full of ads ,
unless you just want to skim through while you 're ,
i , i read them when i 'm at a doctor 's office or , you know , waiting on something like that .
yes ,
yes ,
i will read them in a doctor 's office , too .
yeah ,
as i said , i , i subscribe to , uh , to people and to time ,
and , uh , and i will go through the time , but , usually not cover to cover , you know ,
i 'll glance through it .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
i like reading , uh , you know , the passage of people or something you know ,
and , uh , but i do like the people magazine .
oh , uh -huh .
it , it reminds me of the old time movie magazines when i was young and , uh , that 's one , and you know , i really like that ,
i enjoy that .
uh -huh .
it 's quick reading you know ,
it doesn 't require a lot of thinking ,
yeah .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
and sometimes after i 've worked all day and have things to do at night , i just , i want fluff i don 't want a lot of thinking
that 's true ,
that kind of is a good way to do it .
it , uh , you know , it 's , it 's much more relaxing .
sometimes when i read time magazine , after i 've read an article i 'm real depressed over the situation of the world
so . well , it seems like we both kind of agree on the subject of magazines yeah ,
yeah .
okay .
and , uh so , uh , i think that probably i will end the call .
i 've enjoyed ,
okay .
um , i very seldom read a newspaper .
i get most of my news information from t v .
mainly , um , if i 'm really wanting an in -depth thing i 'll watch c n n .
uh -huh .
and i find it one of the best .
uh -huh .
and , uh , otherwise it 's just one of the regular , uh , channels eight or five .
uh -huh .
and , uh , where do you get yours ?
uh , mostly from t v too .
uh -huh .
i u -, usually start watching the news at five and watch it at five thirty and six sometimes and , and then again at ten maybe just the headlines .
um , we do take the dallas morning news
and , uh , once in a while i 'll sit down and read , read it , you know ,
but not very often do i read the whole thing .
quite often just scan through the headlines
and ,
uh -huh .
well , i take the dallas morning news
and , and my husband , uh , he reads it cover to cover .
uh -huh .
and , uh , if he thinks there 's something that i need to know about he 'll say , you know , here you need to read this
uh -huh .
and , uh i don 't know
it ,
i kind of quit reading it , oh , i don 't know several years ago when the kids were teenagers .
it just seems like i was so busy all the time ,
yeah .
and if i wanted to read , i wanted to read something light and relaxing and and , uh , things like that
and so i coul -,
and it got so depressing
yeah
seems like it wasn 't anything but bad news
yeah .
if there 's something , you know , that i want to know more about or som -,
might be the killeen murders .
i 've been kind of intrigued .
i guess it 's kind of the sadist in everyone
you just ,
yes ,
yes .
i , i will pick up if there 's something really gruesome in there
i 'll go through and read it .
yeah .
uh , but i find that i do better with , oh , remembering it and everything if i watch , uh , the t v you know ,
yeah .
and , and they kind of capsize it and everything
and watch ,
right .
oh , yeah .
and i think sometimes it 's , you know maybe a little biased , you know i -,
 something 
and sometimes .
yeah .
you don 't , you get the sensationalism as opposed to just pure facts .
that 's true .
you know .
i wanted a little more detail like , you know ,
they would tell more about the people that were killed , where they were from and how old they were .
yes . yes .  ]
and i guess you just , you know , you you just want to know
and with interest , you know i found some people that were members of our church which was different .
and that made you even feel a little more kin to , to what was going on .
you found some members of your church that had been murdered ?
well , you know , of the same , same type of church that we belong to .
oh , the same type of church .
uh -huh .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
yeah ,
so that made it a little more and that they were from utah also
so .
oh , uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
so that was interesting ,
but i enjoy the news .
uh -huh .
i , i think our seven year old even e -, once in a while will sit down and watch it with us ,
so .
i used to , uh ,
or i didn 't used to
no .
but , uh when my grandchildren had , uh , have stayed over before and even maybe when our kids were younger one of the channels used to give brief inserts of news at a child 's level .
uh -huh .
and i thought that was very interesting ,
and i thought that was very important for kids .
huh .
uh -huh .
like they brought down something that had happened like if there was something going on , uh , in the war , they would bring it down to a child 's level in words you know , that they could understand what was going on .
and , uh , i noticed that my grandchildren seemed to kind of enjoy that .
right .
the oldest one he 's nine
and , uh , he would particularly enjoy this
 been  a couple of years ago .
yeah .
and , uh , i thought , i think that 's really interesting .
actually i even understood it better
yeah ,
yeah
that 's nice sometimes when they they pull it down a little bit like that .
yeah ,
you know . and , uh , but as i said , uh , i ten -, you know ,
i , i have kind of a blas3e attitude about , uh , news and news reporting which is , is not good , yo -, you know .  ]
right .
nobody should get that way about the news .
right .
and what 's going on in the world .
oh , do you have a certain station you like to watch when you watch it
or ,
yes .
we like channel eight .
do you ?
we like it .
it 's the best .
um , channel five for some reason has always been the one i watch .
is that been your favorite ?
uh -huh .
i , i don 't know
it 's probably the anchors .
they just kind of catch you .
i don 't , i don 't know .
yeah ,
i very sel -,
and i thought it was very interesting , uh ,
uh -huh .
channel nine watching it when the murders were in killeen and , and going on .
they were having news coverage
and ,
the c n n , is that what that is ?
no ,
it was channel nine .
huh .
oh .
and , you know they have that hour that nine to ten of an evening .
and so we had the t v on
and we were trying to catch all of it ,
and they were showing some
and i was watching ,
my husband and i were watching it ,
and then we switched over to channel eight ,
and the difference in coverage was unbelievable .
yeah .
i can understand why channel eleven is , uh , you know , why they 're kind of behind .
yeah .
did i say channel nine to begin with ?
yeah
no
that 's why i wondered .
okay .
i don 't get that channel
no , chan -, channel eleven i meant .
yeah .
i was thinking nine to ten .
yeah ,
yeah .
but channel eleven ,
that is if you , if you want to go to bed early
uh -huh .
it 's nice to , to , to watch that early news sometimes ,
so .
it , uh ,
but the coverage wasn 't near as good  as  when we , you know , switched over to channel eight
and they didn 't e -,
okay ,
would you , uh , like to begin or would you like me to start ?
uh , oh , i can start .
okay .
yes .
i , i think one of the , the biggest , uh , improvements in women is that finally you 're starting to see them get into , uh , management and you 're seeing them , uh , get , uh , elected to , uh , political offices .
uh -huh .
uh , not near enough .
i know there 's still a long way to go especially in top management
yes ,
i agree .
you 're not seeing , you know ,
looking at t i , you see them in management , but you 're not seeing them up there as v p
right .
and i have a sister that 's an attorney in oklahoma city ,
and i know the company that she was with , uh ,
the women didn 't h -, have near the positions , the levels that the men attorneys had .
right .
and were not , uh , given the same respect .
i agree with that .
yes .
i , i think you do see more and more women out there in politics , too , as mayors or , uh , you know , in , in helping to maybe , uh , get some legislation passed to , to have women have more rights .
i think still , even with that whole , um , thing with judge thomas and , and , uh , you , you still felt like the woman was the one that you would maybe discredit first before the man
or something the way they had the trial
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
and uh , i just think that it 's , it 's still going to take another generation or so before , before the women really , could really feel that they 're really equal in the business world and that they work just as hard or harder
right ,
right .
uh , but it 's still , uh ,
going from , from homemakers into , uh , corporate leaders is still a big step .
right ,
i also think that , uh , uh , women as homemakers are beginning to get more respect than they used to be .
used to be people would say , do you work , and you 'd say , no , i work in the home
right .
and it was , it was , then it was almost like a put down , particularly , particularly even by women in the work force .
but , i think now , i think people are realizing that the roles women play in the home are very , very important .
yes .
and it 's getting the respect and , which is about time .
i think it 's true .
yes ,
very definitely .
i think also people are having children at a older age so it 's maybe like , uh , you know ,
you go through college
and then you maybe work for a few years
and then you have your first child
and , uh , you know , you , you know both sides of the coin .
that 's right .
you know what it 's like and how much work it takes to keep the house running smoothly , and to take care of the kids .
and , and then , uh , maybe people that are just working and think , oh , you just stay at home .
but then when they 're in their thirties and have their first and second kid , it 's like , they lose it
right .
they say , wow !
this is harder than i thought
yes
well , you know .
and , and , to those that have never worked and had , you know , and have stayed home with the kids , kind of does your heart good
i know it ,
i know .
because i know i stayed home with mine and didn 't start working until mine were in high school .
uh -huh .
and , uh , so , you know , it , it kind of does me good .
are so involved .
i think also one of the things that , that 's really tremendous and , it doesn 't necessarily have to do with women , but the fact that the fathers are so involved with families .
yes .
which , again , i think it helps a woman 's role .
right ,
right .
you know ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
their role has to change to kind of accommodate us , too .
i know ,
i have three children
and my oldest is eleven
and i 've pretty much been home , uh , since brian was born
and , uh , just recently i went back to work , uh , last school semester to tutor , uh , high school age students with learning disabilities
uh -huh .
and i was just out of the house two days a week but , i thought , wow , this is really hard ,
only ,
and it was only two days
and i was home before three .
but getting the baby to day care , getting the kids off to school , i still did everything i always do , you know ,
uh -huh .
my husband still got up and went to work but , uh , it , it ,
only those two ,
it made a big difference .
i thought , wow , full time ,
i don 't think i could swing that personally .
well , i had to ,
course , i work full time ,
but my daughter and her husband were out of town
oh .
oh , boy .
so i had my grandchildren for four days during , uh , football , soccer season and so i would work
and her ,
some friends would take care of the kids ,
pick up .
dinner .
but i would have to get them picked up from there get them fed , get them to practices get homework done , get baths .
right .
i was absolutely exhausted .
i bet ,
i bet .
and , and these women that are waiting until they 're in their late thirties , or early forties to have their first children , i think are absolutely crazy .
well , i , i know a lot of people ,
i know i had my first child when i was twenty -five ,
and that 's not considered really young these days ,
uh -huh .
that 's almost , you know but , uh , i have friends that , that have kids just starting kindergarten
and they 're , they 're forty years old .
and , and then like maybe a two year old at home ,
and i think , boy , i , i 'm , i 'm in my thirt -,
okay ,
do we just go ahead ?
uh -huh .
okay .
do you want to start ?
right .
uh , well , we 're supposed to talk about vacations and , uh , i 'm trying to think of the ones that i 've been on that i liked the most
and probably the one i liked most was hawaii
oh , did you get to go to hawaii ?
yes .
yeah ,
we went there for our twenty -fifth wedding anniversary .
it 's lovely , isn 't it ?
yes .
we went , uh , six months after we were married .
uh -huh .
and we just went to , uh , two islands .
what islands did you go to ?
we went to oahu and kauai .
kauai ,
uh -huh .
we went to kauai ,
and then we also hit maui ,
the big one .
and then , of course , uh uh , the big one ,
uh -huh .
oh .
with , uh , the big one i thought was very commercialized .
oh , yeah .
it was .
but the other two were just lovely .
yes ,
i enjoyed kauai better , too .
uh -huh ,
it was quiet and restful , and , and so beautiful .
it wasn 't commercialized .
oh , it was rainy
yeah
was it ?
rainy ,
but , you know , we don 't like to spend the money to go over there and sit on the beach anyway
so ,
that 's right .
well , it wasn 't real rainy .
we had s -, a few showers , but , uh , nothing that really got in the way with anything and just very brief ones
and , and , when , uh ,
now we went to nassau
and my husband liked it better than he did hawaii .
oh , really ?
uh -huh .
oh .
yeah ,
he really did .
i don 't know why .
you know , he didn 't like oahu at all
uh -huh .
he thought he thought honolulu was just horrible you know .  ]
oh .
although we went to that polynesian village .
did you go there ?
uh -huh .
yeah .
that was wonderful and we both enjoyed it very much .
that was that was nice ,
uh -huh .
you know , i 've been to nassau , too .
have you ?
i went on a cruise .
oh , neat .
uh -huh ,
and , uh , to tell you the truth , i , i think i 'd rather just go to the island .
yeah ,
uh , our son and daughter -in -law just , uh , they got married last january and they won a cruise .
and i know they didn 't like it .
now , we have several friends that , uh , have been on , and just love them .
but james and i like ,
i don 't know ,
i think we would get bored on the boat all the time .
well , i , got sick .
oh , did you ?
yeah ,
i did the first night .
ooh .
uh -huh .
i went with my sister just , uh , a couple years ago
and , and we both , the first night , just had to leave dinner .
um .
it was bad ,
but , and then after that it was , it got better ,
but we just ,
uh -huh .
it was a four day and we were both ready to get off the boat .
were you ?
yeah .
well , i think if we ever go , it will only be for a three day .
now we 've been real lucky .
we 've been to europe twice .
oh , have you ?
yeah .
we went , the first time we went to london , europe and touched a little bit of scotland
and second time we went to munich , germany and were there a week , and loved germany .
oh .
wow .
i 'll bet it is .
it is just absolutely gorgeous with the mountains
and we were there in the fall before the snows , you know , started
and it was wonderful .
oh .
it , uh it was just , it was marvelous .
and we would love to go back there
and we 'd love to go back to london .
you haven 't been to spain ?
oh .
no have not been to spain .
i was born there .
were you ?
yes
how old were you when you left ?
uh , just ten months .
oh , ten months ,
uh -huh .
yeah ,
so ,
have you ever got to go back ?
no ,
no ,
and i would like to .
would you ?
my , uh , my sister ,
we went with them to germany
and , uh , she would like to go to spain .
i 'm not sure whether i would like to or not .
huh .
and , uh , i would like to go to ireland .
would you ?
uh -huh .
now , now i don 't know if i 'd like to go there just from the the problems .
well , the   there is uh -huh ,
is , is a little scary ,
but i would still like to see it .
i 'd like to see , uh , italy .
oh , yeah ,
yeah .
i would love to go there .
that would be nice .
and , course , there is a lot of places in the united states i still want to come , you know , go to .
now , have you been to yellowstone ?
uh ,
yellowstone ,
yes ,
yes .
have you ?
we have been there .
we , i was there as a child and then we , we went to california and came back through yellowstone with our kids .
uh -huh .
and they loved it .
well ,
i was in utah , in salt lake city when i was a , uh , youngster .
oh , uh -huh .
so , uh , you know , i 've touched on that .
yeah ,
now i 'm just about , oh , a half hour , uh , north of salt lake .
oh .
yeah .
so , uh , it 's at my husband works in salt lake ,
uh -huh .
so we 're real close
and , yeah ,
we ,
now that 's a pretty city .
yes ,
we , we like it .
very clean .
yeah .
you know .
it is .
utah is a pretty state from what i remember of it .
well , we kind of like it
uh -huh
well , do you like to camp , those kind of trips ?
we ,
no ,
we used to
we used to camp a lot with our
kids .  ]
uh -huh .
and , uh , but now we like things like the regency hyatt
oh , you like the motels ?
we like the motels ,
yes
oh , oh , well .
we have , we 've gone past the camping stage .
we lived in chattanooga , tennessee for two years .
oh , did you ?
and we did a lot of camping out there in the smokeys
and it was beautiful
and our kids loved it and everything
uh -huh .
and then we moved to , uh , uh , the dallas area and , uh , it 's hot down here
and camping is not near as much fun .
oh .
and , uh , so , and then the kids were getting older and , and were involved in activities so the camping sort of went by the wayside .
huh .
and , uh , although our son loves to fish
and , uh , and our daughter and her husband are talking now about starting camping with their boys now that they have gotten older .
uh -huh .
so i 've been concerned about crime lately .
uh -huh .
uh , it 's really scary to listen to the news every night and uh -huh .
to hear about all the problems .
i wondered if you were taking any special precautions in your neighborhood ?
well , i , i think we have a neighborhood watch
uh -huh .
i think .
i 'm not real ,
we don 't get real involved .
we 're never home ,
uh -huh
so uh , uh , well , i know they were going to start one ,
but , uh , i haven 't heard any more since ,
so i don 't really know .
but as far as personally doing something , no .
no , um .
how about you ?
well we moved in , when we moved in , there , there wasn 't any outside lights
uh -huh .
and so we 've been trying to install some , uh , outside lights
uh -huh .
and we put up a fence in the backyard .
yeah .
mostly , you know , not so much thinking that we would deter someone to break in , but that our children would be safe playing in the yard .
yeah .
you know .
huh .
and i guess most of the crime that i 'm concerned about generally is against my kids .
it 's scary to send them off down the street a few houses  ]
oh , i 'm sure it is .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
to let them go play with someone and because of what you hear about people getting picked up and everything
uh -huh .
and so i have to spend a good deal of time watching them
walk down the street and ,
um .
say , call me before you leave and come back
and ,
i would , too , if i had kids .
we don 't have any .
we did install a , a a , uh , motion detector light back in our driveway .
uh -huh .
and that was , mainly it was so when we pulled up , the light would come on ,
uh -huh .
but also we have a boat back there and we have neighborhood kids that like to get into mischief ,
oh , no .
so we thought with that light , you know , it would maybe keep them from doing something to the boat
that 's a good thought .
yeah
so ,
well , we 've been real lucky that ,
i don 't believe there 's been , you know , much trouble in our neighborhood , 
 uh -huh . 
but it  but it does seem there , that there is a lot more here in plano of , uh , just bored teenagers
yeah ,
yeah ,
vandalism .
that 's what it is .
we live in ,
coppell
uh -huh .
and , and that 's pretty much what it is , is you know , kids that are bored , like you say .
yeah ,
and they don 't , uh ,
uh -huh .
i know my sister -in -law who lives in our neighborhood they 've had their ,
oh , no .
they parked their car out on the street before and it 's been spray painted and a few things like that
and , course , you know ,
i don 't know
i 'm getting scared for kids to get older ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
because you don 't know if it 's someone their teenagers know who , and , or is it just random crime ,
but , uh , we 've been real lucky that no one in my family with the , anywhere that they live has had , been a victim of , you know , a serious crime .
yeah ,
yeah .
uh -huh .
but , uh , it 's really scary to know that you can live a normal life and try to be a good citizen but it doesn 't mean you 'll be safe
uh -huh ,
i know it .
uh -huh .
and , but , i guess i take a lot of , uh , little bit of , uh , safety in knowing that a lot of the crimes that they report are , like drug related or uh , things that ,
places usually that i wouldn 't be going .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
and things i usually wouldn 't be involved in .
yeah .
yeah .
and , uh , there 's not so much of it completely innocent victims compared to ,
but it is scary .
yeah ,
it is .
 really is 
were you raised in this area ?
yeah .
i 'm originally from chicago , but i 've been in this area , in the lewisville area for , uh , let 's see , about twenty -three years .
uh -huh .
so , has it been getting worse that you noticed , or  about the same ? 
oh  definitely . 
um .
in the last few years , i think ,
and , uh , like i say ,
uh -huh .
now i don 't think necessarily in this area here , but just dallas in general .
i don 't know ,
i think back of when i was , uh , younger and in my party days , some of the things i did , you know , i wouldn 't be caught dead , like , being out that late at night .
right .
in the dark parking lot
right .
take a lot of chances .
well , i noticed that , uh , that , uh , when
uh -huh .
we , we moved here from houston not too long ago .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
and so , of course , we were interested in schools and , uh , but the schools in houston all have big , tall fences around them
uh -huh .
and they 're not really very safe and so it 's been interesting to come to the plano area where the schools don 't have fences at all
around them ,
and it 's just a whole different idea that , that , at least the people here feel that their kids are pretty safe at school .
uh -huh .
and in houston that there was the mentality that they weren 't safe at school .
huh .
uh -huh .
and so that 's been something that 's been good for the , you know , in this area that you feel like , uh , you know , there 's not going to be too many knifings or shootings at school today .
uh -huh .
and i guess ,
um .
i don 't know how people live with that every day .
i don 't either .
pretty scary .
yeah , um .
but , anyway , well , i guess i won 't take up more of your ti -,
well , i am new to texas ,
so i don 't even know what the law is ,
uh -huh ?
in the state ,
do you ?
well , yes ,
of course , we do have capital punishment .
and we 've , you know , done away with our , quote , fair share number .
oh , that 's right ,
i think now , that i recall , reading about it in the paper .
yes .
um , you know , different things ,
is it restricted to certain crimes ?
or just ,
yes ,
it 's certain crimes , uh , capital crimes , murder , of course , uh , rape ,
uh -huh .
this sort of thing .
um . well .
it seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks , you know , that get into the system .
yes ,
i know ,
the one thing that i think is really sad about it , as i recall , from the articles that i 've read , is that if , if people who have been there , are going to be killed . um , there 's people that come to the prisons and they 're very violent
and , they want ,
i mean they 're anxious for someone to be killed
uh -huh .
yes .
i just ,
i can 't see that .
that happens on occasion ,
it sure does ,
maybe it just depends on , you know , how closely the crime , you know ,
uh -huh .
has affected you personally .
you know , i don 't know ,
or a person personally .
no .
i think i would be , you know ,
i guess , really if i had to say yes or no , i guess i would say , you know , that i am in certain cases , in favor of the death penalty ,
i don 't know that it 's a big deterrent really .
i don 't know that it is .
i don 't know how we 'd ever find out , you know , really whether it is or not .
well , there is so many chances for appeal , that it kee -,
oh , yeah ,
oh , absolutely ,
yeah ,
it goes on for years and years , and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars , taxpayer money .
ye -,
it 's really sad .
yeah .
i don 't know ,
i just think , um ,
somehow i hoped that as a people we could be better than , than , um , expecting ,
yes .
the feeling that it  
with ,
someone is calling for someone else to be killed , you know .
yes , uh -huh .
is really kind of bad
yes
it is .
it 's a tough , tough question .
it really is .
um .
i suspect i would be , uh , you know , a lot more favor of it if , you know , one of my children were , you know , brutally killed , or something like that .
like i say , i think it depends on how personally affected , you know , you might be by it .
that 's true
and there really are criminals that are hard -core and ,
oh , absolutely .
repeat ,   and never have any chance for ,
tha -, that 's right .
  oh , i don 't know ,
is it ,
do you feel at all like , it 's a religious issue ?
not with me personally .
it is with a lot of other people .
uh -huh .
it 's not , not to me personally ,
no .
um .
no .
i don 't know ,
sometimes i feel ,
i mean i do go to church and things .
i don 't know how i would feel about it .
but like you say , if it hit you personally ,
uh -huh .
yes .
closer at home you would feel , feel differently .
that 's a , it 's a tough , tough question ,
it really is .
do you think most states have that
or ?
yes ,
i think most states do have capital punishment .
yes .
uh -huh , huh .
but , i think the u s is one of the few countries that still do .
that still does it ,
that 's right .
yes ,
they 're only ,
i was reading something about it the other day ,
i   think there was only like six or eight countries in the world , that have capital punishment still .
uh -huh .
a lot of them had to have el -, elected not to do so .
now i don 't know , what they do in place of it .
you know , maybe it 's life in prisonment or , you know , something ,
i don -, i don 't know how they handle it
bu -, i was surprised to learn that so few countries have capital punishment .
have that .
well , and it doesn 't seem like very many people , uh , are really , i mean ,
there 's a lot of people that are on death row .
oh , yes .
but there 's not very many people that actually , um . do get killed .
yes ,
a lot of them do get their sentences commuted to something else .
uh -huh .
so , it seems like a of people live there ,
and then through appeals .
yes .
because i know they do frequently ,
i mean they cover , cover it pretty heavily on television and the newspaper .
uh -huh .
yes .
if it finally gets to that point .
right ,
the first appeal is automatic ,
so that delays it for a few years just right off the bat .
yeah .
there 's , there 's a lot of , you know , last minute , uh , things that happen cause a person not to ,
uh -huh .
have to go through the whole thing .
uh -huh .
so is it , uh ,
are we doing lethal injection now ?
yes ,
uh -huh .
that 's , that 's fairly recent , i don 't know , how recent , but fairly recent , in the state of texas .
before that , it was , uh , death by electrocution .
uh -huh ,
wh -, which seems so awful .
yes ,
it certainly does .
so , it 's a little bit more humane ,
i guess , it is ,
yes ,
it would almost have to be , i suppose .
if you , if you had to chose , i guess i would , i am sure i would take the lethal injection .
yes ,
the other one just seems so terrible .
yes ,
absolutely .
um .
it 's a , it 's a tough question .
it really is .
i guess , if i had to say yes or no , i would say , you know , yes .
i , i would have to lean toward capital punishment , you know , for certain crimes .
well , do you think that we do it because we want it to deter crime
or , it 's not because we don 't want to pay for inmates to stay in prison ?
no ,
i don 't think it 's a monetary thing .
uh -huh .
i think ,
we hope that it will be , you know , some sort of determ -, deterrent or , you know , an eye for an eye type thing , or something like that .
um .
some of the crimes are just so brutal and so , you know , useless .
this may seem to be the best way out .
i don 't know .
yes .
easiest way out maybe .
no ,
i don 't think it 's a monetary thing .
um . well , um , and i notice that the crime  rate  was up in the dallas area
yes ,
especially the murder rate , its just gone crazy .
it 's , it 's kind of been scary ,
yes .
to think about it
absolutely .
and , and you 're hoping there is something that will cut down on that .
yes ,
i wish i had the answer for that ,
everybody does .
yes ,
it 's nothing to be proud of ,
you hate to have the dubious honor of being , you know , so high in the , in statistics ,
certainly not .
but i , you know ,
we have been really fortunate
our family ,
yes .
hasn 't had any crime .
yes ,
so have we been very , very fortunate .
and , so we don 't ,
it 's harder to think about the poor people that have suffered that way .
that 's right .
absolutely .
and how they would expect ,
uh -huh .
how they would hope ,
i mean you , you hear of people who have , um , committed crimes , and then they get out of jail and they go , and they do the same thing again .
absolutely .
and you wonder why they can 't just stop it .
uh -huh .
that 's right .
so , maybe you would ,
uh -huh .
but still i would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone .
so would i ,
i fortunately , i have never been in that circumstance ,
i hope i never am , like , like everybody else .
no ,
i know when , um ,
we just , we moved here , uh , i from the , i got a summons , jury summons ,
uh -huh .
just like constantly , it seemed like ,
uh -huh .
but fortunately i had small children
and i didn 't have to go .
right .
and it 's not that ,
i mean , i think everyone should have to serve on the jury ,
uh -huh .
it 's just that , i didn 't ,
i hate having to be in charge of someone else 's life .
sure ,
it 's , it 's a big responsibility ,
it really is .
and i would hate to have to hear any kind of case ,
yes .
involving a violent crime or anything .
so would i .
that would be really awful .
yes .
absolutely .
well , anyway , i sure have enjoyed , uh , talking to you about this . although it has been difficult
but , uh .
it is , it 's a tough subject ,
it really is .
i 'd hate to decide it , but i guess , uh , guess it 's important ,
right .
that we decide as a people what , what we 're going to do .
that 's right .
anyway , well , you have a good day .
well , thank you ,
it 's nice talking to you .
thank you ,
bye -bye .
uh -huh .
bye -bye .
well , patricia , i was just about to get on my tread mill ,
and then i remembered that i didn 't make a call last night ,
and i thought i 'd make one tonight .
well , i have an exercise bicycle in my bedroom , but it usually 's holding clothes
that 's what i did with mine ,
for a long time , put it on the handlebars so i can hang them up .
right
and sometimes she just flops them all over the seat .
well , that 's not why i got it ,
right
how do you like your tread mill ?
i like it .
you don 't get ,
is it less boring than the bicycle or not .
no ,
it 's just as boring .
you watch t v or something while you do it ?
i read a book while i 'm doing it .
oh .
but i was doing that on the exercise bike .
well , i do that too .
really .
i feel like i 'm getting a little better of a workout , and i 'm losing more weight on this than on the other .
are you ?
and my legs , you know ,
how ,
okay ,
i 'm going to turn forty this summer ,
i was getting all dimpled up
yeah .
and those are going away .
really .
so that 's real good .
uh -huh .
we got it at a little bit of an incline .
are they kind of expensive .
uh , this one , yeah ,
this is five hundred .
uh -huh .
i know they get cheaper .
they do ?
uh -huh .
probably the more you pay , though , the better the machine you have .
well , i hope so .
well , you can believe that anyway , right .
yeah .
i didn 't buy it really .
my husband bought it because we , we 'd never get out and go walking or anything ,
and we go to the lake
and we ski and swim in the summer
 during the year . 
but  besides that ,
uh -huh . 
yeah ,
well , in bad weather , you know , well you 'd have to do something inside .
yeah .
do you work at t i ?
uh -huh .
i think , your voice sounds familiar .
really .
where do you wo -,
i live in arlington .
i wonder if we talked before .
where do you live ?
i 'm in garland .
no , uh ,
well ,
you sound like this girl that i talked to about books , and we got into movies one night .
oh , really .
uh -huh .
uh , no ,
this is the first time i 've done it .
uh , my husband was just running out the door ,
he 's working at night tonight .
so i decided to do it
i haven 't talked before .
uh , what subjects have you talked about ?
let 's see ,
education .
oh
social changes that we 've seen in the last ten , twenty ,  thirty years . 
 well , that 's  interesting .
yeah ,
that one was .
it 's more interesting than the treadmill and the bicycle .
right ?
the most boring one was about what meal would you cook for a sit down dinner .
oh , my goodness
the other woman didn 't cook too much either .
right .
  really have a lot of variety .
yeah ,
they do .
i talked to this old woman that was a retired administrator in ohio one night about education .
oh ,
and she was ,
a school administrator .
uh -huh ,
retired , but .
well that could , that would have been interesting .
yeah ,
and then one night i talked to these two guys , no , one night i talked to one guy
and then a couple of weeks later i talked to the guy 's roommate , in virginia , about different things .
really ,
well that 's neat .
uh -huh .
one was about painting .
when was the last time you painted something ?
did you feel like you did a good job ?
did you feel , uh , rewarded while you were doing it .
hm .
uh -huh .
how long is this going to go on , do you know ?
i don 't know .
i don 't either
it 's interesting , though .
i never heard of such a project before .
huh -uh .
well , how 'd you find out about it ?
pardon me ?
how did you find out about it ?
oh , i don 't know .
i guess my husband got a letter at the office ,
i , i presume ,
and they must have been asking .
does your husband work with t i .
uh -huh .
oh really .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i have a friend that had a roommate that worked at t i
and she saw it on the computer screen and they made copies of it .
oh , so they wanted any , anybody ,
don 't have to work at t i .
uh -huh .
well , that 's interesting .
uh -huh .
i had no idea that was just for the employees ,
and i couldn 't understand ,
i kept getting these calls ,
i thought it was an advertisement and they just were also called t i , you know ,
there is texas industries and different things .
uh -huh .
i kept hanging up on them for days , until my husband told me what it was
oh
i didn 't know .
well , if you work for t i you 're supposed to get a prize , is what i heard ,
and if you don 't work for them you 're supposed to get cash .
ooh .
but then on the letter it says cash or prize .
oh .
well the prizes are pretty nice .
he brought a booklet home
and depending on how many calls , i think three was the minimum .
but it went up to , i don 't know , nine or ten .
how many calls have you ma -, had ?
i don 't know ,
gobs .
well , it sounds like a lot .
this is going on my fourth week to do it .
oh , my .
and some of the prizes are pretty nice .
well , like what ,
tell me .
oh , i wish i had that booklet here .
oh , i think i do ,
it 's right here .
i 'll look at the end because those would be the best ones , okay ?
yeah .
um , well , they have some watches that look really nice .
there 's one that 's got some diamonds on it .
for how many calls ?
does it say ?
  i haven 't quite figured that out .
i thought it was eight or nine ,
but seems like too nice a prize for nine , just nine calls , isn 't it ?
uh -huh .
says when we have enough calls from you ,
background saying stephen did you start the
you will receive in the mail a numbered certificate for your calls and and explanation how to redeem ,
in background : pour some charcoal in there >>.
for gifts .
are you listening to him ?
no ,
i 'm trying not to .
he 's telling me to start the grill .
oh
it says three for a b gift , five for a c gift , et cetera .
and this only goes up to f .
so i thought that was somewhere around nine .
but anyway , it 's got these beautiful watches on it .
let me see what else
it has a , uh , clock radio that also plays c -, uh , you know , tapes .
then it 's got , oh some binoculars , and some pretty brass lamps .
got some , oh , a food processor .
so it 's not all stuff that t i makes .
oh no ,
i don 't ,
i haven 't seen anything in here that t i makes . the mister coffee , the double mister coffee , you know , the two .
oh , and there 's a phone in here that 's hilarious .
it has a button you can push ,
if you get a call you don 't like then it makes machine gun noise
and then there 's an attache case , and cordless telephone ,
and then there 's a card table , doesn 't have any chairs , just a card table . oh , some more jewelry , suitcases ,
and have you seen those univ -, anniversary lamps where the little balls go around .
you mean the clocks .
yeah ,
clocks .
yeah .
i can ,
i 'm going crazy ,
my daughter 's playing the piano
and i can 't think .
oh , god .
it 's got one of those ,
and um , well , it 's got a lot , i mean , pages and pages .
it 's got wheelbarrows .   a lot of kitchen stuff ,   of the mixer , the toaster , a waffle maker , popcorn popper , all kinds of stuff like that .
here 's where , here 's a calculator but it 's not even made by t i ,
isn 't that funny .
did they mail that to you , or he brought it to you ?
he brought it home .
huh .
i believe it came in his , uh , his mail .
here 's a camera and a dustbuster and some tools , someone , a lot of tools , a man might like you know .
yeah ,
so you 're bound to find something you want .
oh yeah ,
you 're bound to .
all kinds of phones and clocks
and , uh , here 's more jewelry
and oh , there 's even pictures and little porcelain things to put on a coffee table .
oh , here 's some brass animals , brass candlesticks ,
they 're pretty .
so i 'm sure you 'd find something .
yeah .
and , uh .
well , you know ,
silver plated bowls and stuff . there 's a lot of stuff , it 's a big booklet .
well , do you know you have a ten limit , a ten minute time limit .
oh , no .
well that 's okay ,
and then they come on and tell you , and they tell you got five seconds to say good -bye .
oh , well , it 's been fun ,
this is my first time to do it .
we 'll keep talking if we want to come up with something else .
yeah .
let 's see , oh ,
i tried exercise classes ,
and i never would go .
we fin ,
we joined , ex .
  i went to metropolitan a couple of years ago ,
so i sit and study ,
i sit in class ,
and i have really ballooned up since then ,
and , so , he 's says i ought to join one of those that makes you go ,
but    ,
they don 't either ,
well the first one i joined , they went out of business
and they transferred it to another one that was really far away .
that 's a very common experience .
and we were going to do it ,
there was four of us together .
well , then forget that ,
it wasn 't near me .
no .
and then the second time i was going to do it at richland college ,
and we ,
i just get with another friend ,
and we 'd end up just smoking cigarettes and riding around like we couldn 't find the place
that 's funny
so my husband 's just discouraged me on those things .
right ,
well , if you , if you can make yourself do the tread mill , i mean , gosh , that 's a good workout .
oh yeah ,
my husband said he 's never joined a course , right .
and i got one of those jane fonda workout tapes that i dubbed from a friend .
uh -huh .
that didn 't last long  
i had a baby , i think
yeah ,
right ,
each one of those puts on a few pounds , doesn 't it .
how many children do you have ?
two .
yeah ,
i do , too .
two ,
a girl , one 's in college ,
so i don 't have a , have a baby anymore
oh , lord ,
you 're lucky .
well , i 've got a step -daughter ,
she 's in college .
oh , well .
so there 's where the money goes .
  tell me about it ,
tell me ,    ,
where 's you ki -,
  putting two of us through , isn 't he lucky .
two .
well , me , i 'm going , and my daughter janet in austin .
uh .
yeah ,
right .
so , i 'll probably have to sell the prize i get
where you going to school ?
u t a right here .
and what are you doing ?
well , i 'm , um , going to be certified as an english teacher   teach english as a second language .
yes , i do .
i just got my certification .
you 're kidding .
huh -uh .
oh , that 's    ,
the test is a booger .
the test , the exit test .
hard .
it 's hard .
oh , no .
it is so hard .
really .
uh -huh .
really ,
how are the other ones .
i haven 't taken any of the exit tests .
see i didn 't have to take any other exit test because i 've been teaching for quite a while .
oh , yeah ,
before they started    ,
but i 've heard they 're terrible .
really .
bilingual is just horrendous .
i 've had friends fail that twice .
really .
i didn 't know any of this .
none of my friends have failed the english or the education ones
good .
i really ought to take those quickly while i still remember some .
uh -huh .
yeah ,
right after you get out .
i know .  
boring
and they really don 't help you a whole lot .
now see , i went to e t
and i took one course through t w u
and boy yelling in most of the   training i 've got has been through dallas just teaching e s l .
oh  
from chapter one tea
and she 's expecting the end of this month ,
and she 's the only one that lives near by .
oh , well that will be nice though .
so the rest live in ,
one lives in connecticut ,
and couple lives in pittsburg ,
and one lives near d . c .
so , uh
 yeah 
 yeah 
but still sort of up in that general  area  of the country  so you  can probably see them  sometimes . 
 yeah ,
we see them  once in a while , a couple of times a year at least ,
 yeah 
 and the  ones in pittsburg , of course , we see more often ,
yeah
so , uh
okay .
all right
i 'm ready to go .
well , uh , what kind of recycling do you have in your area ?
well , they 've been trying different things .
one , one of the biggest problems seems to be we don 't , they don 't have anyplace to put some of the things that need recycled .
uh -huh .
right now we 've recycled glass for ye -, be -, years because we have a glass industry in our community .
oh , what ,
which one is that ?
owens .
oh , uh -huh .
owens   um ,
so glass has been recycled for a long time .
uh , we have a  cycling  area set up here at our house ,
the boy scouts have , and they 've done that for years .
uh , the stores are recycling their plastic bags now .
you can take them back in
and they have bins to collect those .
uh -huh .
uh , the aluminum cans .
they try to do the , uh , newspapers
and , uh , they had to close their area down because they couldn 't sell it .
they were ,
what they were doing was shredding it and trying to sell it to farmers for bedding for their animals ,
 uh -huh . 
 and  that type of thing .
and that didn 't work ,
but , but somebody told me that they were charging as much for it as they did for straw .
oh .
which is why they couldn 't sell it ,
 yeah . 
 you  know , because the farmers would buy the straw if it 's a , you know , similar price .
sure .
and let 's see ,
is there anything else .
okay ,
i think by this fall it 's going to be required that the town of clarion , which we 'll live nearby , will have mandatory recycling started
so ,
on just particular things
or ,
uh , mainly the glass , the aluminum , the plastics .
uh -huh .
uh ,
well , it sounds like they 're doing quite a bit .
uh .
well , we 're working hard on it because we 're fighting also in our area a large hazardous waste incinerator which we do not want built
and , uh , we would like industry to do more before they build these big , huge incinerators .
yeah .
and , uh , we , we just feel they should , they should offer industry some incentives to do more reducing of their waste products and reusing ,
 uh -huh . 
 them , 
because some of those companies that are doing it have , save money eventually .
at first , apparently , it costs more to get started .
right .
but once they get established , then it 's a money saving thing .
well , our company does some things , all of which i couldn 't even tell you about .
i don 't know all of them
but ,
and what is t i ?
uh , texas instruments .
oh , okay .
 yeah 
gee ,
my , my son works for ,
no ,
not for that ,
okay .
excuse me , go ahead
well , i , i was just curious as how you got hooked up with this , this speech type of thing .
well , my son works in , uh , for the federal government .
he 's , he works in a computer laboratory .
oh
and he ,
and , uh , it was through him that , that , uh ,
yeah .
well , here at work , um , each one of us has two trash baskets in our office
and one of those is designed for any kind of paper products that , um , they want to use , you know , for recycling .
they can 't deal with every type .
uh , maybe you could tell me , what is the difference between office paper waste and just like newspapers ?
well , i guess i don 't know specifically , except that , uh , for the paper that they want to recycle , they do not want any newspaper , um , and things like candy wrappers or , uh , that type of thing .
let 's see ,
i have a list here .
um , they don 't want lunch sacks or brown envelopes , uh , phone books .
so there are , you know , a lot of kinds of things that they don 't want , but then any kind of computer paper , letters , uh , booklets ,
they 'll even take things that are bound .
um .
um , and it doesn 't all have to be like white .
they 'll take colored folders ,
 oh , really . 
 and , and ,  uh , even some of those can have plastic tabs on them .
um .
so it 's , it 's hard to kind of figure out , you know , which things are the right ones .
um .
i mean i , i 'll frequently have to look at the list ,
if it 's something that i don 't throw away all the time .
yeah .
but , um , they do that
and then we use , uh , different chemicals and things ,
and i know that about how they take care of that sort ,
 right ,
yeah . 
 of thing .
 i , i don 't know all the details ,
 right ,
yeah . 
 but they 're  really on top of that .
yeah .
and there probably some other things that i don 't about because we 're a real large company .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
and i just don 't have contact with them .
uh -huh .
but in our , uh , city ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
well , i live in a suburb of dallas and they have initiated a newspaper recycling whereby they pick it up from your alley , uh , one day a week and all you have to do is bundle it .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh , all around dallas there are a lot of recycling centers where you can take things , sometimes for money um , but most of those are real far away from like where i live at any rate .
 well  it would be inconvenient to , in other words to ,
very inconvenient ,
and , um , it 's just , you know , hasn 't been very practical to get into a lot of those things .
if they would make it something where they , you know , would pick it up at the curb or at least make it , you know , down the street and at the corner ,
 right , 
 type  of thing , uh ,
more areas where they would pick it up .
yeah ,
 yeah . 
 that  wouldn 't be so bad .
yeah .
um , our grocery store , like yours , will take the , uh , plastic bags
and they 'll also take the , the paper bags back .
um , uh -huh .
but , um , uh , you mentioned the , uh , glass type of stuff .
the reason i ask you about that is years ago , and it , it changed names somewhere along the line , but , um , my dad used to work for knox glass in ,
oh , well , knox is  just over the hill here 
 knox , pennsylvania .
oh , really ? 
yes , uh -huh .
 yeah
it 's , 
they ,  they no  longer are , you know , active .
yeah ,
they were taken over by glass containers years ago ,
 yeah . 
 and ,  but he worked for them for like thirty -one years .
oh , for heaven 's sake .
and he used to travel up there to knox quite a bit ,
 yeah . 
 and ,  and i even did once when i was a child ,
 oh , for heaven 's sake . 
 you know , so , 
well , we only live probably about fifteen , twenty miles from knox .
oh , really ?
yeah ,
uh -huh .
yeah ,
we ,
i was looking through our photo album not long ago
and they had ,  had  some pictures and things in there of knox .
i 'll be darn ,
yeah .
but , uh , i guess that 's about it , you know , as far as what goes on that i know about .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
i think people are getting more interested
and they are more concerned .
and we 're just , we 're just real concerned about this incinerator because we really , they want to put it right in , uh , in between two of our main water sheds that feed the clarion ri -, river .
um .
and , uh , we , we just , we just don 't want it anyplace
we feel that we , that they should give businesses more incentives to do more recycling and more reduction and , and more reuse and all those things that could be done .
yeah .
we , we just don 't think , we don 't think some of the politicians are really interested in our best interests .
yeah
that 's ,
and , uh , it 's , it 's been a real struggle and a hardship for a lot of people in our area that we 've , have , you know , have been fighting against this thing in trying to have things changed ,
 uh -huh . 
 to  make them more , more right ,
but , uh ,
well , i think probably more people , you know , would participate if they just made it a little easier ,
 uh -huh . 
 and  like you say , make it , um , better for companies to do these things ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
and get involved in it without huge cost to them ,
 right . 
 because  obviously ,
 right . 
 no  one wants to spend a lot of money ,
 uh , well , 
 just to  deal with trash , you know .
we 're , we 're going to pay for that , that whether we pay industry or ,
 yeah ,
that 's true . 
 pay ,
we , we 've  already paid industry for like these super  fund  that 's cleaning up .
we paid industry for it ,
we pay , all help to pay to have them haul it away from their place ,
and where they put it now they found it 's not a safe place .
it 's leaked
and now they have to clean those up ,
and it 's our money that 's cleaning this ,
 that 's right . 
 stuff up . 
and now they want to put it in ,
they burn it
uh -huh .
and that will make another hazardous dump and eventually they 'll have to do something with that .
we 'll pay for it again ,
 that 's true . 
 so why  not pay industry .
this is my feeling .
why not pay industry a little more ,
 uh -huh . 
 and  reduce it , you know , and , and not have as much of it .
also probably look at packaging and ,
 oh , 
 that  sort of thing .
definitely .
we don 't , we don 't need three quarters of ,
 huh -uh ,
huh -uh . 
 what we  get .
no ,
but they think , and probably they 're right , people buy it  easier 
i , uh ,
that 's their marketing .
yeah ,
yeah .
well ,
and i know people would be willing to do more , like saving their newspapers and that , if they had a place to take them .
we don 't have anyplace right now that will take them .
yeah .
i , i 'm ,
guess our city , you know , in picking them up must take them somewhere else ,
 uh -huh . 
 and  get something for them .
probably ,
yeah .
but i don 't that it 's a big money ,
about how many calls have you made on this system ?
uh , i 've originated only a , a few .
oh , okay ,
yeah .
but i 've received quite a few .
i , uh , i only started doing it after , uh , i started getting calls and said , oh , heck ,
that 's right ,
i 'm supposed to make a few calls .
so i started about a month ago
and i ,
 uh -huh . 
 this  is getting close to twenty here which is i think is about all , uh , our little gift book goes up to ,
but i don 't really know .
oh , yeah .
i 've got about twelve tickets in the mail .
do you have ,
you 've   a few ?
yeah ,
i 've been getting mine .
okay ,
medical
go ahead ,
i 'm , i 'm medical .
that 's mine .
uh , you pushed the record button .
we 're supposed to be discussing the subject .
yeah .
i , i 'm benefits .
go ahead , you first .
yeah ,
uh , well , i 'll tell you ,
i 've been around for quite a few years and worked for a lot of different companies ,
and , uh , it 's hard to beat any of the benefits that , or salaries either ,
 uh -huh . 
 that  we get from t i .
i 'm quite pleased with it .
course there 's a few things that , uh , i think i could do better if i was sitting up in the c e o 's seat
oh , yeah .
but , uh i think jerry 's doing a pretty good job as it goes .
the one ,
it 's kind of like , uh ,
automobile insurance ,
uh -huh .
the ones , uh , that i think are the highest and important to me , uh , i hope i never have to use them , really per se , although i 've used medical a little bit that , well that one certainly is high ,
i , i worry that it 's weakening rather than strengthening
so i like to reverse that trend and say i 'd like to get those to strengthen , you know ,
 be  better and better .
well ,
then sal -, sal -, salary continuance , i 've never used that one .
i hope i never will ,
but that 's kind of like an insurance thing .
i sure like that one .
oh , yes .
that 's like automobile insurance .
you never want to get in an accident
but it ,
you like to have it there .
uh -huh .
well , uh , like i say , i worked for several different companies
and there 's nothing to compare with , uh , t i here .
uh -huh .
now i really got caught up back in eighty -five ,
i got caught up in the oil layoff uh ,
i wasn 't with g s i , but i was connected with , uh , uh , oil , uh ,
 right . 
 exploration . 
with t i , or somebody else ?
no ,
with t i .
uh -huh .
but i say , i wasn 't connected with g s i .
oh , right ,
yeah .
and , i got caught up in a layoff .
um .
yeah .
now , uh , course you get six months , uh , unemployment from the state but , what t i did for us is , is , uh , i 've never heard of it before . they fixed us up with an office with , uh , telephones , access to long -distance , uh , computers , a secretary to take messages for us or type , uh , letters ,
 right . 
 for  us .
uh , they had out of town newspapers
and then ,
and outside consultants .
didn 't they have an outside consultant , too ?
i beg your pardon .
did they have an outside consultant , like a , the employ -,
uh , yes .
they did have , uh , seminars every once in a while .
yeah .
uh , course that was not , uh , restricted just to just us .
right .
but the most important thing was that , uh , they had made up the difference between , uh , unemployment pay and seventy -five percent of my net pay .
and they then ,
t i paid me that .
oh , really ?
so , uh , i was able to , uh , not just exist .
i mean , i , i lived just as comfortably as i did before i was laid off .
yeah ,
they seem to be do -, doing a good job of that .
i 'm in facilities ,
and our organization built , builds those facilities over in park central now .
uh -huh .
and i guess they 've been using them for six months now .
and i 've known several engineers that got laid off
and they said it 's like getting a ph d almost ,
they ,
the much they learn over there , you know , after they 've been laid off , uh ,
one engineer said it was really an education .
he , he just learned , like you ,
he said he learned a tremendous amount that he never would have able to pick up on his own .
he was very thankful for that , too .
well , this was not a learning thing by any means .
it was just a , uh ,
 to have an office ,
yeah . 
 an assistance trying to find  another job .
yeah .
well , he said he learned so much
and how ,
he thought , he thought he had a ph d in how to get a job after he was ,
 oh . 
 through  the whole process ,
 uh -huh . 
 for ,  for several months .
he did eventually get a job .
well , course i went through this , uh , what , about five years ago .
they may have improved it considerably .
yeah , apparently .
it 's very sophisticated .
and i guess it may be one of the best , uh , that anyone 's doing .
well , that 's one of those little , uh , uh , little extras that you don 't see in the , uh , the , the , the handbook , you know .
right .
you 're absolutely right .
that 's a good one .
it ,
what do you think about pensions ?
anything on that or ,
well , now i have , uh , uh ,
i 'm getting close to retirement .
yeah .
and , of course i 've been looking into it but , uh , since i 'm only a yellow badger ,
 uh -huh . 
 i  won 't be getting a whole heck of a lot from t i ,
 right . 
 as  far as retirement is concerned .
what do you think of a pension that goes from one company to the other like an account like a four o one account .
i , i 've been thinking about that for years , uh ,
i 've never heard of such a thing .
i know .
that 's what i 'm saying that , that pensions ,
you see , just like you were , you 're saying , you 've only got , uh , so many years ,
say you work for two , three companies , you take your pension with you after you 're vested .
uh -huh .
and then just add the money together like you do with a four o one account , you know .
uh , yeah .
uh , it 's your account , period .
it doesn 't matter where you go or anything .
that 's your account to roll over .
i ,
that , that sounds like a hell of an idea .
i didn 't know there was such a thing .
no ,
no
there isn 't .
i , i 'm saying that 's the question .
what do you think could be better
and i 'm saying that pensions , say in the year two thousand or more when social security goes away , which it probably will ,
i think they ought to have a pension at least that you 'd never lose .
so you work for a company seven years ,
yes ,
by all means .
well , what would be the difference between that and social security ?
uh , well social security 's going to go to way , i think
and you can , or you can invest your own money .
you have no control over your social security .
and it 's not paid for by the current ,
like when ,
say we retire after the year two thousand , social security 's paid for by the twenty -five year olds .
you know , they may rebel and you won 't have any social security . where , if your money was in your account , i mean , you can never lose it ,
it 's there .
yeah ,
yeah .
you don 't have to depend on anybody to be putting that money in for you , you know .
that 's just a thought .
i mean , i ,
 uh -huh . 
 if  they say which ,
no ,
i , i like the idea .
yeah .
course , that 's , that 's , some -, something like an i r a
yeah ,
and instead of having a , a socialized pension , it just would be really money that you and your company ,
maybe you had to put some money in it , too ,
i don 't really know .
 uh -huh . 
but i ,  i  can see where they 'd need to do something on that because the statistics are ,
you don 't work for a company twenty years through no fault of your own , you know .
you work for five , six , seven ,
and y -, y -,
a lot of people i know , guys ,
yeah ,
that , that 's what i 've done .
i , i 've bounced around .
about every ten years ,
 yeah . 
 i  change .
i have , too ,
but not , not quite that often
but , uh , yeah ,
i 've only got , uh , i 've got , i guess fourteen now here at t i ,
and i hope to make twenty -five which
say if something happened to me ,
i mean , you know , they lay me off ,
so , you have a pension
but then you 'd have to try to get a pension in another one .
it would be nice if they could get them together .
uh -huh .
i do worry about medical , though .
again , knock wood that , uh , i haven 't used it .
i guess you ,
i 'm sorry ,
you really do use it throughout the year , because you get your teeth fixed and all that ,
i mean , i ,
but i 'm not ,
i 'm talking about major items
i haven 't used it for anything major .
uh -huh .
i 'm glad it 's there , though .
well , knock wood ,
i haven 't used mine for anything major . just doctor visits
and , well , i , i have the , uh , the h o m a
i use h o m a .
yeah .
and i like that , uh , a lot better than aetna
i have the regular .
i , again , i just ,
i haven 't ,
i can 't complain about it because i haven 't used it
and every time i needed it , it , it , it 's , uh , you know ,
 uh -huh . 
 fallen  right in line for the , the , minor things
i guess i 'm the one just supporting most of the others .
well , doesn 't it work , you don 't see , uh , uh , anything until you spend the minimum ?
uh ,
don 't you have to spend the minimum of two , three hundred ?
yeah ,
yeah ,
i think it 's two seventy -five for a family
but the dental is right away ,
 yeah . 
 if  you ,
exams . uh ,
well now , i have the same dental you have .
okay .
yeah ,
the medical you have to have a deductible .
uh -huh .
now , see i don 't have a deductible .
yeah ,
right .
i pay a straight five dollars for anything , a doctor visit or drugs
well , drugs are okay ,
now , i 'm on that , uh , plan , where i take blood pressure medicine .
if you take an allergy medicine , so , anything you need a prescription for , for more than six months , you get it for , used to be six bucks ,
they just raised it to twelve .
oh , that one i haven 't heard about .
yeah ,
that 's a typical , that 's a typical one that 's in there .
the forms are right in personnel .
uh -huh .
fact , you may be able to take care , take advantage of that .
it 's through baxter labs . uh ,
yeah ,
i have high blood pressure problems myself .
maybe you still can do that .
do you , do you buy your pills one at a time ?
yeah ,
thirty days at a time .
well , tur -, turn in your forms .
go right to personnel .
i don 't know whether you have to about an h m o .
i don 't think so .
you turn ,
you get your doctor to give you a more than six months prescription
and , uh , they 're twelve dollars ,
again , they just were six ,
they just raised them to twelve this year . twelve dollars for a three months supply .
um .
or whatever , whatever the , the amount is , uh .
i don 't want to say three months ,
uh -huh .
but it 's a lot cheaper ,
allergy medicine 's really , uh , expensive
and that blood pressure medicine is fairly expensive .
i take two .
uh -huh .
go right to personnel .
they got the forms in personnel
 yeah ,
great . 
and maybe ,  maybe i 'll  tell you go something you didn 't know about in benefits
yeah ,
i just might do that .
i do it ,
yeah ,
you know , it 's a very common thing .
well thanks ,
 it 's through baxter labs ,
tell , 
 thanks for the tip , jim . 
yeah .
i shall look into it .
yeah .
what else .
i 'm sure we 're getting close to our five minutes whatever , here .
yeah
uh , let 's see ,
we discussed , uh , uh , medical and dental ,
 what other benefits , 
 uh , retirement . 
yeah ,
salary continuation .
i think that 's a great one ,
but again a hope i never use that one .
uh -huh .
that means you 're really sick if you have to use that one .
what about vacation ?
i 'm satisfied with the vacation .
i don 't know what else , you know ,
you say , say you get another week and ,
i 'm , well , i only got fourteen years
so i 'll get another week when i hit fifteen .
uh , yeah ,
that 's right .
so that 's , that 's fair ,
i mean , it 's reasonable .
four weeks is a lot , i think .
i know some people who have twenty -five years and thirty and they want more
but , uh , you know ,
uh -huh .
uh .
well , i 'm , uh , i 'm here ,
i 've got just eleven years
and i don 't think i 'll ever see a , a silver badge .
uh -huh .
i won 't , i won 't be around that long .
well , the way things go , i think i 'm going to have to work till i 'm seventy -five whether i quit and , uh , uh , or when i retire get a part -time job ,
so , what do you think of our trial system ?
huh , i don 't really know what to think about it ,
but i do know that they 're not , you know ,
they 'll give somebody twenty -five years and they 'll serve what , eight months .
yeah .
have you noticed that ?
yeah ,
i have noticed that , that , that kind of stuff does seem to happen quite a bit , um ,
yeah .
uh -huh ,
and , uh .
i don 't , i don 't , i don 't even know what to do about that sort of thing .
but i think trial by jury is , it 's a lot better than leaving it up to one person .
yeah ,
i think trial by jury is very good .
i actually ,
they said , i think the tape said something about changing , uh , changing it such that the ,
or leaving sentencing up to the judge only .
i think that 's actually good idea .
leaving it up to the judge ?
we -, just , just sentencing , not the trial itself .
oh , okay .
um , because i think that th -, that , that judges are probably more informed as to what is ,
yeah ,
how serious the nature of the crime is ,
well right
because ,
and stuff like that
an ,
the general public doesn 't know that if , i -, if they 're sentenced to life that they won 't serve life .
right .
course the judge will know when he 'll be up for parole and all that .
so yeah ,
right ,
so he 'll be able to give them the maximum sentence , in some cases there .
okay ,
i must not have understood the whole thing
because i didn 't hear them say that ,
but yeah .
oh yeah ,
the , the ,
uh -huh .
they give that as , as an example of something that , that might happen ye -,
but i think if the entire trial was left to one person
i 've got a four year old ,
you can hear .
oh yes .
but , uh , i don 't know ,
you ,
pe -, too many people can take vendettas out on people ,
right .
and everything .
or just , you know ,
there are two people who say well he just looks guilty , um .
right ,
but that 's true .
that 's actually , that 's a wonderful way to get off jury duty , you know .
someone says to you , you know ,
when they ask you if you , uh , if you want to be on , you know ,
when you 're called for duty say oh yeah , i want to be on jury duty because i can spot a guilty person a mile a way .
yeah .
they quickly let you off jury duty i hear , um .
right
because they , they know that you 're biased .
oh , yeah ,
that , that , that , that , that 's , that 's the way it works there , um .
anyway , i think that probably for , for having it ,
what about , you know , about being unanimous .
i mean , that 's sort of a strange case because i wonder what happens when eleven people thinks someone 's guilty and one person doesn 't ,
one person thinks that , that they 're not guilty
and they can 't decide for hours , unless they convince that one person , you know .
does it have to be unanimous ?
i believe it does have to be unanimous , actually .
well then they consider it a hung jury , i g -, i think
and then they , uh , have a retrial ,
or do they .
yeah ,
i think they either have a retrial eventually or , or they call it a mistrial or something .
uh -huh .
i haven 't been to law school .
no ,
me neither .
so , i don 't know much about that ,
i just know that , um .
i wonder
 'cause sometimes i think about it actually ,
i think well , what if i were that one person and i was completely convinced that , that , that , that this person wasn 't guilty , you know .
well you don 't have to be really convinced that he 's guilty ,
it 's just if they can 't prove he 's guilty
because
right , uh ,
yeah .
but , i mean what if eleven other people are saying one thing , you know , and you 're , you 're the one person saying the other thing .
you know , would you give in .
yeah
 saying 
i would hate to be that person because you would be , uh , you know , bombarded by all the other eleven jurors to , you know , just say he 's guilty so we can get out of here and go
home .  ]
yeah ,
yeah .
yeah .
i wonder about those things , you know , or even if it 's , you know ,
i , i guess if they were to say , well it doesn 't have to be unanimous ,
what 's the cut off number , seven , five , you know , six , six ,
uh -huh .
you know , how do you decide .
is it , you know ,
how do you decide what number of people have to say that .
yeah ,
i know ,
it 's too bad one of us don 't have some knowledge on this ,
huh .
but , but , um , i don 't know ,
i just hope if i ever go to court that they all , unanimous on not guilty
well you 've seen like these t v movies ,
yeah .
to child in kyle , i 'm talking ,
hush .
talking to speaker but , uh , well how they 'll , you know ,
the ,
through the whole movie , you think this person 's ,
i don 't know ,
but one thing that i thought was pretty weird is how somebody can 't be trialed , tried , tri -, uh , excuse me , twice for the same crime .
yeah ,
i 've never quite understood that . um .
well i just think it 's , it 's weird because i 've saw , well , of course , soap operas ,
i 'm an soap opera fanatic .
okay .
this one guy had , uh , framed himself to make it ,
we -,
which
he really did kill the person ,
but then he set it up where it looked like somebody was trying to frame him
and he was on trial for it ,
and then , you know , it came out that he was being framed ,
so then he was found not guilty ,
and then , th -,
directly after the trial they found out he really was guilty
and he couldn 't be tried again .
right ,
and they can 't do anything about it .
yeah ,
beca -,
yeah ,
i often wonder about that ,
i wonder if , if maybe , you know ,
i , i , i don 't , i don 't , i don 't know the law on that
but if they have new evidence , can they , can they retry ,
or can they , you know , bring you back .
no ,
i don 't think they can .
you know , i saw it on l a law , too .
oh , actually , that 's true ,
i 've seen the same thing on l a law as well .
yeah ,
about that woman .
yeah .
w -,
so i wond -, and then i wonder why that , you know ,
there , there must be some sort of deep seeded reason for that ,
yo -, you know , something like , something like , well you can 't be tried for the same trial because that would bias the , the , the , the jury or something ,
or , you know .
right ,
and i 'm sure that , you know , it 's the lawyers ,
yeah ,
uh -huh .
uh , after the , uh , defendant , defending , oh , the defendant 's lawyer and the prosecuting attorney .
i 'm sure the prosecuting attorney could make a real good case if he , you know , knew all the details of the defendant 's , you know , case .
in , in , of the defense  
right
yeah ,
well , well there 's also the issue of , for instance , you can 't , um , you can 't , very often you can 't , um ,
when someone is , is on trial for something , you can 't bring up prior convictions .
right .
which ,
like if they 're on tr -, uh , trial for rape , you can 't have any , you can 't bring up the sexual assaults and stuff , or whatever .
right ,
that 's completely beyond me ,
i mean that 's jus -,
yeah ,
i know , if it 's related ,
i wonder ,
if it 's related to the crime , they should be able to .
yeah ,
yeah .
i mean if this man is , is accused of raping someone , then i think that something like sex , you know , the fact that he se -, sexually assaulted someone is a crucial bit of evidence ,
right ,
yeah .
that adds to the fact ,
and i , i , i ,
but they 're not allowed to do that .
i , i often ,
i never understand , you know ,
havin -, again , having ,
i 'm sure there are some deep seated reasons , you know , to ,
i mean , often times i wonder about rules like this
and i 'm sure that , that , that there are some reasons for good .
well that one does seem , that one does seem out of it , though , because it 's , it , we -, you 're allowed to show their character ,
do you know what i mean .
right .
and if it shows that their character 's , you know , changes , gets capable of lesser thoughts like that and stuff .
then right ,
then , then ,
right ,
th -, that lea -, led to that .
then they should be  
yeah ,
i mean that 's what i think ,
but i don 't , um , but i don 't quite understand .
tell you what we need to do is go into law and then we 'll be able to ,
or vote .
do you vote ?
do i vote ?
yeah ,
do you vote ?
oh yeah ,
i vote ,
yes .
okay ,
we -, you 'll help out a little bit
yeah .
putting the right people in the office , that 's a lot to do with it too .
oh , yeah .
a lot , uh , a lot of the politics will pass laws and stuff that the , um , general public wants ,
so they 'll be revoted and all that .
well that 's , that 's , that , that 's very true ,
but then again oft -, often times they don 't , as well .
right .
often times they don 't , uh ,
right .
they just go , you know ,
they 're
you 've got people like who are , who are , you know , lame , lame ducks
and they sort of don 't care about anything and just want to go ahead an ,
right
they , sit on the fence ,
so . well , oh , i talked about this the other day ,
they won 't say yes and they won 't say no to just certain issues just because they don 't know what the public wants , or the public 's split on it .
that 's true ,
that 's true .
yeah .
i often ,
i mean , that , that ,
like you say , that 's another discussion ,
but i have had that discussion before as well .
where you weren 't ,
i , i wonder about the po -, politics of it all ,
so .
right ,
because most of it is politics ,
yeah .
even in the courts .
well even in the courts yo -, well , well , they 're all appointed .
i mean ,
right .
that 's even another issue , you know ,
should , should , should judges be appointed , you know ,
and , or , or , um , often times i look at friends ,
we had , uh , a serial killer around here , who killed eleven women .
uh -huh ,
now was that the , um , uh , green , oh , i don 't know , some guy that was attacking women jogging ?
no .
ch -, oh , and , and choking them ,
yeah ,
uh , his name is arthur  
well did they have a t v movie about him ?
i 'm not sure if they had one yet ,
but , i 'm sure they will .
um , because he was , he was on some sort of news special though ,
he was , he was , uh , he killed ,
 'cause he was just on trial like maybe a year ago .
well , well , how was he killing the women .
um , he was strangling some of them .
were they jogging on a ,
oh , no ,
usually they were prostitutes , actually .
oh , okay .
because he was , he was
actually this is a very sad case .
the man was let out ,
he was in prison for , um , sexually assaulting two children .
oh ,
see , that 's what i mean ,
then they let them out
and then they 're able to do it again .
right ,
he , he ,
they let him out
and then and then , he wa -, he wasn 't allowed back in the town where he had done this
so he came to our , he came to rochester instead
and they , they , they realized later he , he had killed about between eleven and twelve women , at least
and ,
i think my sister is married to a guy from rochester .
oh , really ,
yeah .
way up north here , huh .
yeah
way up nor -,
well , uh , i 'm originally from kentucky .
oh , okay .
still way up north , sort of , um .
yeah ,
i , i 'm , i was up north too .
but , uh , that 's one of the reasons i think judges should be the ones to sentence people
because they do know , you know ,
yeah .
if you sentence them to three life times , then they probably won 't get out on parole .
won 't get out , exactly ,
yeah ,
this , this , this man was sentenced to , i think , like three life times .
but he was , you know , it was just horrible ,
because , um , his , his , his trial was , you know , was , it wa -, it was televised and this and that ,
and what they were pleading was , um , they were pleading insanity .
uh -huh .
i mean it 's clear to me the man is insane .
well of course .
 and , and he should be just locked up for life . 
 but they just need to do something with him . 
he needs to be annihilated .
right ,
i mean , i don 't know what you do with them at that point , if you 're that crazy ,
but what , what struck me is , you know , they had a psychiatrist testifying for hours and hours
and by the end , i realized that maybe it would have been better if they had , it wouldn 't have been a jury of his peers , but if they had a jury of psychiatrists instead , to sort look at it , you know .
yeah .
i mean , i don 't think it 's feasible ,
but , it would be an interesting thought if you 're ,
well , it 's supposed to be a jury of your peers ,
they couldn 't have a , a bunch of psychotics up there
no ,
or , right ,
right ,
exactly ,
but give them a bunch of psychotics but at least have a , have a , have a bunch of psychiatrists ,
uh -huh .
you know , just to look at him and decide from then .
i mean , they would    ,
did they have a trial by jury for him .
what 's th -,
yeah
they did .
huh , well .
they had a regular trial by jury for him ,
and , and ,
yes ,
what , what major changes have affected your life ?
well , i think that , uh , women , women working is the one that really affects me most strongly right now .
um ,
you mean yourself , or women in general ?
well , women in general , and , and also myself .
uh -huh .
but , um , it used to not really make a difference to me , um ,
or at least i didn 't think so .
but my mother worked ,
and i kind of now wish that , that she hadn 't .
uh -huh .
that , um , that she had , um , stayed home ,
and right now i 'm kind of stuck because i 'd like to have children ,
but i 'm not ready to do that because when i do have children i want to stay home .
so i 'm having to , uh , try to figure out a way to be able to do that .
uh -huh .
and , in , in our society right now that 's really something that 's , that 's , um , not respected ,
uh -huh .
and it 's not , it 's not , um , it 's not easy to do at all .
i mean , there 's a great deal of sacrifice that has to be made on the part of a family if the , if the wife is going to actually be a mother .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
that 's interesting ,
because that relates to the thing that , that strikes me the most ,
and i 'm sure you 've , you 've labelled the cause , because what strikes me the most in the changes in society is the way kids behave .
and ,
uh -huh ,
i think that that   they have to be related .
that 's right ,
that 's right .
and you know , i mean i was thinking it just , you know ,
my complaint would , would be , um , that i think that , you know , the kids in the neighborhood run wild ,
and they , they destroy property ,
and they , you know , steal each other 's toys and stuff
uh -huh .
and there 's just no respect for , for people or property ,
and i guess , you know , when you stop to think of it , these kids have probably been deprived of a lot of attention that they 've needed all their lives .
uh -huh ,
i think that that 's probably true .
scary ,
i just wish there was a way ,
uh -huh
i know that in , in , you know , in sweden , what they have there , it 's really their medical plan , but it also deals with this subject , because if a woman , uh , is working and i think even if she 's not , and has a child , the government subsidizes her to stay home and raise the child .
but for how many years ?
i don 't , i don 't know .
uh -huh .
until it , um ,
i 'm sure until at least school age , and maybe longer .
oh , that 's great .
uh -huh .
what this does is , it allows the government to subsidize her to be the mother of her children rather than to subsidize child care to raise the child for her .
right .
and i think that that 's a real , a much , much more viable solution , really .
uh -huh .
no ,
i agree , a hundred percent , a hundred percent .
i guess i was lucky , because i was teaching ,
and so i was able to just go to a class and teach when my son was little ,
and so i 'd be gone , you know , an hour and fifteen minutes or something at a stretch .
oh yeah ,
that 's great .
and , then , yeah ,
very soon he was old enough to just go and sort of stay in my office
uh -huh .
and you know , nobody seemed to have a big problem with that
so . that 's an interesting issue though .
um , yeah
um , goodness ,
what else ?
oh , there 's been so many ,
how do you just ,
right ,
i 've ,
actually another one that i , a question i would have is ,
i guess i 'm being , you know , beyond the age of thinking of this , this problem .
i had an argument recently with my boss ,
i think it was , about the need for women to work .
uh -huh .
yeah ,
uh -huh .
yeah ,
really .
but i think you put your finger on it , when you said that they 're not respected if they don 't work , because it seems to me that a lot of people i know , women i know , are doing very menial jobs in a certain sense , certainly financially and , i mean , when i see the amount of clothes that they buy and , and how much it costs them to buy fast food on the way home i 'm sure that they 're not making quote making money for the family on this and , and probably you 're right .
i don 't see how they could be , especially not if they have to pay for child care .
well , no ,
even families that don 't have child care ,
i mean , you know , when i think of this one friend who makes probably twenty thousand dollars a year , and i 'm sure she spends at least that in clothes , plus , you know , fast food every day , and out to lunch every day ,
uh -huh .
and ,
you 're probably right .
if she sat down and looked at it she 'd be like , god , what am i doing this for , you know .
exactly ,
and i mean , you know , even though they don 't have children , they , they have relatives
and , you know , the husband would certainly like a lot more attention ,
and , and she wouldn 't have to hire somebody to clean the house , and do the gardening
and , so , i , i guess you 're right .
it 's , it 's
our society demands women to work if they 're going to be respected .
uh -huh .
really sad
yeah ,
religion has changed , too .
oh , that 's true .
um , uh , some people now it seems like are turning back toward actually trying to find out what they 're in it for , instead of just , um ,
it , it 's , it ,
some places still it seems like it 's a social club .
uh -huh .
you know , it 's just a place to go , to visit , uh , to wear your nice clothes , and , and to sit around and talk ,
but , um , i think a lot of people are really , you know , searching now to find , find out who they are , and who god is , and what all that really means now .
uh -huh ,
so that might be a positive change in society .
yeah ,
oh , it 's , it 's , um , it 's beginning , i think .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
i guess i haven 't seen that as much in this area , although every now and then you hear about it .
uh -huh .
uh , but among , you know , people i know , i don 't see a great , you know ,
uh -huh .
there are those people who have , have had serious questions all along , and , you know , are sort of pursuing it but , um , the churches here are growing , leaps and bounds ,
uh -huh .
and i thought it was more because of the , the very transient nature of the area and that people were going basically just as you said , as a social to meet people , and that ,
but , um , it 's hard to judge ,
and there are a lot of things changing , i suppose ,
yeah .
uh -huh .
just , you know , the whole , the whole environment , i find um , sort of , you know ,
i wonder with , with all our chemicals and , and that and , and the foods we eat ,
and , you know , young people that i know are getting very serious diseases
and ,
oh , yes .
well , i guess that 's always happened .
probably .
maybe not as much as now
but ,
well , it 's just ,
it 's , maybe it 's more unusual now , when , you know , somebody quite young gets certain kinds of cancer ,
and in the past , maybe the same percentage got them ,
but we didn 't know it ,
or , i don 't know .
well , i guess we 've sort of run dry a little bit .
okay
it was nice talking to you .
nice to talk to you .
okay .
bye -bye .
bye -bye .
well , do you watch much t v ?
well , i watch in the evening with my kids
your kids .
how many kids do you have ?
i have four children .
oh , goodness .
i have got two .
well ,
that is about all i want
yeah ,
it keeps you busy , doesn 't it ?
yeah ,
they do .
they are still babies .
uh , my children like to watch sesame street .
i watch with them every once in a while ,
but that is not my favorite programs .
oh , well . we have only get two channels .
we do not have cable .
uh -huh .
but i am not crazy about t v much .
it just ,
well it kind of is an idiot box .
uh -huh .
now sesame street is a good program because , uh ,
i do have that on videotape ,
and i will let him watch that every once in a while .
and he has learned to count to twenty from that .
so ,
yeah .
yeah .
it can be very educational .
there are shows th -, that i like .
uh , i like good family shows ,
uh -huh .
uh , though .
uh , i let my kids watch things like little house on the prairie .
okay .
and the cosby show is , uh , is , uh , kind of unrealistic as a family unless you live in upper class and have money .
right .
i think that sometimes the things they show on there though , uh ,
the problems that their kids get into , are , are good to , uh , show that they do have problems anyway .
right .
uh ,
but they also have a lot easier time disciplining their kids than real people do .
yeah .
i mean , like i said , real life is not that easy .
yeah .
and , uh , i watch a show that i like i -, for entertainment .
uh , it is called the quantum leap .
oh , i love quantum leap .
i watch that show every time ,
um , yes .
and , uh ,
that is a good show .
i , i like , uh , how the , how he has to help with the people that he , that he becomes .
uh -huh .
uh , because it is not a show that he just becomes these people and then he lives there for a while and then he is gone .
uh -huh .
he has to do something positive to help them .
right .
so i ,
he always got to change history is what it is .
yeah .
yeah .
usually , yeah .
it ,
that it is so good .
i was glad when they put that back on this channel ,
me too ,
me too .
because like i said , we only get two channels because we do not get cable .
uh -huh .
and still my little boy , he watches videotapes .
he won 't , um ,
this is terrible ,
i do not like him sitting in front of the t v all day .
no ,
that is not terrible .
well ,
i do not think that is terrible at all .
it ,
but it is a not really a good baby sitter
well ,
it is really not .
he needs to get outside and play .
and he is four years old ,
and he just does not like to go out there by himself .
and i will let him watch the t v when i am wanting to get my house work done .
uh -huh .
but other than that , i do not like him glued to the t v all the time .
well , i do not think it is , it is healthy all the time either .
huh -uh .
uh , and my kids like to , to go play with their friends ,
and so i guess i do not mind too much when they do watch a little bit .
now i ,
there are shows ,
i do not have cable either .
and there are shows that i really put my foot down on .
if there starts to be a lot of violence ,
uh -huh .
i do not go for that .
i will not let them watch that .
well , we made the mis -,
if there is a lot of language or ,
right .
we made the mistake of getting robocop .
and that is one of the worst , oh ,
uh -huh .
i do not let him watch it anymore . because the , the pieces , like especially where they kill somebody , it is just not good .
i mean it is just real violent .
i mean ,
well , it , you know ,
today i watched ,
and it is like they show bloody ,
uh -huh .
you know , things ,
and they show it in slow motion .
uh -huh .
and , and everything like that .
and before , in a western or something , in the , in the olden days ,
you would see somebody get shot ,
they would just fall down .
yeah .
and they were gone
yeah .
and , and it was not , uh ,
so graphic .
not like today . uh ,
today it is , it is really graphic .
uh -huh .
they try to make it too realistic .
yeah .
and ,
too much realism i think ,
yeah .
sometimes .
i don 't ,
now he is watching honey , i shrunk the kids right now .
oh , that is a fun show .
it is , it is cute .
and that ,
oh , i really like that one .
little roger rabbit on before that .
uh -huh .
that is cute .
and they have got the he man , uh ,
the cartoon or the ,
oh , uh -huh .
masters of the universe , the movie .
that is a real cute show .
that has good moral values too .
he man ?
uh -huh .
well , uh , i think , uh ,
yeah ,
good versus evil .
yeah ,
huh .
yeah .
oh , well , it sounds like we have the same tapes for our kids anyway .
yeah .
yeah .
at least we have the same ideas .
yeah .
language too .
a -,
language and violence and sexual , y -, you know ,
uh -huh .
things .
i , i get kind of , uh , saying ,  "i am sorry kids , this is ",
yeah .
and i , i think it is important that i see what they are watching .
if ,
yeah .
they do have like those parental control things on the , uh , remote controls . you know , where you can block out what channels you do not want them to watch .
you mean in cable ?
uh -huh .
oh , i do not know , because i do not have that .
but ,
well , my , my , uh , stepfather and them have , my stepfather , my father -in -law , and them have that .
uh -huh .
and , uh , they do not have any kids ,
but they was told how to use that .
but still , when the kids get older , they learn how to break through that parental control .
oh , do they ?
huh .
they are too smart .
i think alls you have to do is push a couple buttons .
uh -huh .
so , it is , it is , i am hoping that he will grow up not really caring much for those movies because , now we have got a lot of western tapes .
uh -huh .
josey wells , now he loves to watch josey wells .
well , i think that is a good show too .
yeah ,
yeah .
clint eastwood .
uh -huh .
and like the man from snowy river , we have , oh ,
my husband likes westerns .
and he also likes star trek .
now star trek is good movies , good shows .
uh -huh .
the , uh , series ?
we have got a lot of those .
uh , i think not even the old one but the new one too .
uh -huh .
i like both of those
the next generation ?
uh -huh .
yeah .
my little boy is crazy about captain kirk .
yeah .
and my little girl has mister spock 's ears
oh , d -,
i told my husband he cursed my kids .
yeah .
they were both born with pointy ears .
oh , well .
not real pointy .
my little boy grew out of it .
oh , that is not a problem anyway ,
no .
but it is fun to , you know , seeing the show anyway .
uh , now i like , uh , everything mi -, oh ,
no ,
not michael douglas , um , oh ,
i can 't think of his name .
kirk douglas ?
no ,
the , the man , right now who is having , uh , who has done , uh , bonanza , and then he did little house on the prairie .
oh , michael landon .
michael landon .
oh , now there ,
there you go , michael landon .
yeah .
i have always liked and thought he did good shows .
like highway to heaven ?
uh -huh .
to here are some cookies , kyle .
talking to speaker yeah ,
i liked highway to heaven ,
and i , and i thought that was kind of neat though .
but i loved little house on the prairie , especially when melissa gilbert grew up .
yeah ,
yeah .
she was kind of like my idol
when i was growing up . because i am twenty -seven ,
so it is , you know ,
she is about the same age as i am .
uh -huh .
i wanted to be just like her , because she is so cute .
yeah ,
i ,
and i liked that show because it , it portrayed , i thought , really well , uh , pioneer kind of days .
yeah
and ,
you know ,
well ,
but ,
i liked it ,
yeah .
but there ,
uh -huh .
that is about the only , uh , show i have seen where every time they sit down at the table , they pray before they eat .
and i thought that was real neat .
yeah .
because there is not a lot of shows that do that .
and , uh , they have this little cartoon that is on sunday mornings with ,
now what is that ?
jot .
i remember him in school ,
but i do not ,
it is just this little dot with arms and feet and little eyes ,
and his parents are there .
uh -huh .
they have it like before one of the church things , uh , you know , church that comes on ?
and it is a just this little dot .
and he will go out and get himself into trouble and come home ,
and the parents will tell him that there is a verse in the bible that will help him with that ,
and ,
it is just ,
oh , i have not seen that .
well , it is ,
usually we go to church on sundays .
uh -huh .
but we will miss every once in a while .
and i will let kyle watch that ,
and he just ,
well , i even like jot .
i mean i ,
it is funny .
what channel is it on ?
it is on channel ,
well , let us see .
you are in plano ?
uh -huh .
uh , it is twelve or ten down here .
well , i will look and , and see .
yeah ,
we go to church on sunday .
about one o 'clock is when our meetings start .
and , uh ,
oh , well , this is of the mornings .
it is in the morning ?
uh , around nine or ten i think .
it is before one of the , i think it is before the first baptist in sherman airs .
okay .
i think that is the one that it ,
w -,
uh , comes on before .
well , we 'll look .
it is real cute .
you know what ?
he is bouncing around ,
and his name is jot ,
and then he has got a friend named cat .
and i think the dog is the only one that is not a , a dot
but it is real cute .
and like i say , they , they teach him stuff from the bible .
and i think it is just a real cute show .
i am trying to get my little boy into reading , uh , like church books and things .
uh -huh .
we have got like noah 's ark and , oh , lord is my shep -.
we have got about eight or twelve books for him , just little bible stories .
uh -huh .
and they -,
he is , he is getting to where he likes them .
yeah .
we got him a little jesus doll , uh , about a year ago ,
and he has always kept that .
he likes it
well , i really like ,
now we get channel fifty -five , although we do not have cable ,
uh -huh .
we do get channel fifty -five .
and that is a , uh ,
like , a , a song ,
they sing songs on there
but they 're , uh , worship through music kind of things .
but they are up to date , uh ,
uh -huh .
and some of them are like , uh , videos like music videos , that go along with the songs about church and jesus .
and , and i ,
so it 's a , a christian songs ?
yeah .
oh , that sounds fun .
the chri -,
it 's called the christian music station or something like that .
that 's something .
well ,
and , uh , i really like that .
yeah .
uh , i turn that on , on sunday mornings .
and i do not , you know ,
and so my kids do not , uh , have an
okay
wow , i don 't know what that was .
what was that ?
i don 't know
uh -huh .
and , uh , to , uh , the brazos river near dinosaur valley state park .
oh , yes .
uh -huh .
uh -huh ,
uh , we have not camped in any of those places ,
in fact it has been a number of years since we have camped ,
but we used to go to tyler state park and , uh , daingerfield
and in texas that is where we camp basically . uh ,
what are they like ?
they are very nice .
tyler is really , really a neat place to camp .
it has a nice little lake
and it has some really wonderful , uh , sights that are in the wooded areas .
uh , the facilities are quite nice
and our children liked , liked it quite well .
uh , the kids are , well they are quite a bit younger than ,  ]
and you know they ,
we felt real safe with their being able to do what they would like to do there in the area .
and , uh , it was just , it was just a really nice place to camp .
uh -huh .
uh , now daingerfield is ,
let 's see ,
i think that 's a little bit mor -, more east , further east , and and maybe south , if i am remembering where that is .
no ,
i think it 's a little bit further north , when i think about it .
at any rate it was , it was very nice as well .
but tyler , we sort of got spoiled with , i think .
uh -huh .
but , uh , we had lived in michigan before we came here and , uh , had done a lot of camping in michigan ,
i think the upper peninsula of michigan , especially ,
and then also , we had done some camping in colorado , in the mountains ,
so , uh , my parents were real avid campers  
and my husband 's parents were really avid campers as well .
so i guess we just kind of came by it naturally
yeah .
do you have a large tent
or ,
yeah ,
it was a nine by twelve .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
and how many does it sleep , uh , comfortably ?
well , there , well supposedly ,
they always say it sleeps more than it does .
right
but th -, they ,
it would have slept three adults anyway .
yeah ,
yeah .
well , sort of early on especially as our children got a little bit bigger , uh , we invested in some stacking , uh , cots , you know , that were like bunk , bunk beds ,
but they were cots , fold up cots .
that really gave us a lot more space , um , floor space and , so , you did not have to be constantly getting things off the floor in order to walk around
and ,
right .
uh , gave us a place to stack things during the day
so that was real nice .
but , uh , we , uh ,
like , my in -laws also had a camper , or , uh , a pop up tent , you know , one of those trailer tops
and those are really nice too .
a little more , uh , luxurious , so to speak , but not much
di -, do they have a kitchen in them ?
yes ,
uh -huh .
it 's really nice ,
in fact , it even had , had a little refrigerator , uh , and the whole business .
it was quite nice in that respect .
uh , and everything was very convenient
and you did not have to , to be hauling things out of your , the trunk of you car ,
trunk  of your car all time , right . 
 and that was nice . 
so , uh , do you have plans for , for any other camping trips in the near future ?
uh , maybe , uh , maybe back to caddo , or ,
uh -huh .
uh , purdis creek .
right .
or , i like bob sandlin too ,
it 's a new park .
uh -huh .
and there is , uh , not really camping ,
but , uh ,
what is it called , cedar hill .
right .
lake joe pool .
oh , yes .
and sometime , i like to go to eisenhower up on lake texoma .
yes ,
yes ,
i have been in that area .
that is a really pretty state park .
uh , just ,
we did not camp there ,
but we drove through it just one time when we were in that area
and it 's real lovely .
it 's close to the lake and close to ,
i think it 's close to the dam up there
so it 's , it 's really quite pretty .
uh , are you , um ,
let 's see what was ,
i was going to ask you something else .
oh , do you have a favorite among all those that you have been to ?
oh , fr -, from those three ,
just , just , uh , from when i have been an adult , i like caddo the best .
yeah ,
uh -huh .
uh , is it true that caddo lake is the only natural lake in the state of texas ?
yeah ,
that 's right .
i , i would ,
i have never been there
and i would love to see what it looks like
it 's not , it 's not very deep .
uh -huh .
and they did build a dam on it ,
but it was there before they built the dam .
it has been there for a hundred years .
oh , i see .
apparently , an earth quake caused it .
how interesting .
yeah .
i guess i never heard the history of that .
huh , well , that might be some place where my husband and i can go .
we are talking about starting camping again in the fall .
um , our children are both grown
and , and so , it 's just pretty much the two of us who do things .
and so , uh , we thought we might take some weekend trips and maybe that would be a good place to , to go to and see what it looks like .
yeah ,
it 's really nice .
yeah ,
yeah .
and i , i don 't know ,
probably spring is probably the busiest time anywhere  in texas . 
 is it ? 
uh , yeah ,
i think so .
especially with , uh , uh ,
when the trees start blossoming out and everything it is really very pretty ,
right .
especially in east texas , it 's really nice .
so , uh , well , i , um , i have enjoyed talking with you .
it was nice talking to you .
and , um , have , uh , some happy camping trips
hope you get to those places you have talked about .
yeah ,
you too .
well , okay ,
thanks .
bye ,
uh -huh ,
bye -bye .
okay .
yes .
uh , well , right now we have one dog inside .
uh -huh .
she goes out
but i mean she 's an indoor dog .
yes .
and two outside cats .
oh , gosh .
 male and  female .
and how long have you had them ?
the ma -,
the dog is probably about , about thirteen , fourteen years old .
yes .
and the cats are , they might be as old .
i 'm not sure
kind of lose track
yeah .
well , that 's interesting because we have a simi -,
we don 't have cats
but we do have a dog ,
uh -huh .
who is an indoor dog ,
uh -huh .
and she is going to be thirteen this summer
so ,
oh , is that right ?
yes , uh -huh .
what kind of dog do you have ?
um , she 's , um , a mix of cockapoo , cock -, cocker spaniel and poodle .
oh , that 's what ours is
is that right ?
yes .
isn 't that interesting
what color is your dog ?
white .
oh , well , ours is black ,
so
oh , uh -huh .
definitely different
i 'll be darned .
yes ,
she 's a female
and she 's , um , been , she 's been a really , a really good companion for me .
um ,
uh -huh .
she 's like a little shadow , you know , kind of ,
oh .
follows me around all the time ,
yeah .
and , and , um , she 's slowing down considerably .
she doesn 't hear very well
and ,
uh -huh .
she doesn 't see very well
but she 's ,
well , that 's to be expected at ,
yeah ,
their age .
at this age , i guess so .
yeah .
but , um , she 's been a good dog to have ,
and i don 't know ,
once she 's gone , i 'm not sure if i 'll get another animal or not
well , everybody always says no more
yeah ,
yeah .
but i , i think animals are really important in the family .
i ,
i agree ,
yes .
um , did you get yours as a pet for your chil -,
do you have children ?
uh , yeah ,
we ,
uh -huh .
have five .
uh -huh .
oh . well , i was wondering if you got your dog originally as a pet for them or just because you 'd had dogs before
or ,
well , we have had , we had had , a , a dog before .
she was fifteen when she died .
my goodness .
and , uh , this one , we bought by accident ,
uh .
a farmer called us and wanted us to call the animal shelter to co -, or the dog catcher or somebody to come and get this puppy that ,
uh -huh .
somebody ,
people drop things like that off ,
yeah .
 up  there ,
uh -huh .
and i said ,  "gee , she sounds like a cute little dog ."
i told the kids ,  "let 's go look at her "
oh , yeah .
go get her .
so that 's how we got her ,
isn 't that ,
quite by accident .
yes .
so that often happens that way .
well , we had , um , intentionally , um , planned to get a dog .
uh -huh .
we had just moved into this house and , um , decided to wait about a year and then went , then we went out then , and found one ,
she was in the litter ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
and , um , she was so cute because all the other little puppies in that litter were just crazy .
i mean , they were all over the place ,
and she was real docile and ,
oh .
came over and just kind of sat next to us ,
and i thought ,
oh .
that 's the dog for me
she picked us
yeah ,
so she ,
and it ,
what was funny was that , um , our daughter must have been ,
let 's see ,
she must  have been  about eight at the time , i guess ,
uh -huh .
and , um , she just loved this little dog ,
oh .
to pieces
but i think she loved her too much because the dog has never been real comfortable with her .
i think ,
oh .
she was always a little bit leery of her .
uh -huh .
our son , on the other hand , who was about eleven at the time , was , um , not very interested in pets ,
but as it turned out , he and this dog have gotten to be really good pals .
oh , for heaven 's sake .
so you just never know how that works out
no .
but they say it 's real important for children to have pets because , uh , well , they can go and talk to them any time ,
uh -huh ,
yes .
they want to and tell them anything they want to
and ,
yeah .
nobody is going to , you know , reprimand them or ,
that 's right .
know their secrets
or
that ,
yes ,
they 're very ,
yeah .
unjudgmental
yes
oh , dear
and the nursing homes now , they 're finding that it 's real important to take a pet into a nursing home .
yes ,
i have been , i have been reading and seeing about that on television .
uh -huh .
uh -huh ,
and how ,
our one , our one nursing home in   has one .
uh -huh .
permanent
is that right ?
he , he kind of has free run of the place , and there is some -, or somebody takes care of him .
isn 't that amazing ?
but he goes out   people ,
and real nice dog , uh ,
and , uh ,
uh -huh ,
yes .
it 's funny how , um , how pets can kind of , um , oh , take on a certain status in certain areas .
uh -huh .
i mean , um , that made me think of , uh , when our daughter was looking at colleges , we visited a campus in , um , saint louis
and ,
uh -huh .
um , there were several dogs on the campus
and ,
oh , really ?
and , the ,
what was interesting about it was that they were very friendly ,
but they didn 't appear to belong to anyone .
and , um ,
oh .
i 'm sure someone , you know , fed them .
they were healthy ,
yeah .
looking dogs .
but , um , our guide that day said that the la -  , one woman many , many years ago had given a huge sum of money to , to the university , on the condition that there be , um , dogs just kind of left to roam aro -, around the campus .
is that right ?
which is the strangest thing i had ever heard
yeah
because most campuses don 't allow pets ,
i know .
you know ,
they just do not allow them .
yes ,
i know .
that 's , that 's kind of great .
yes ,
it really was .
it was just a nice touch ,
yeah .
and it kind of made it seem more homey too
yes ,
yeah .
but , um , th -,
i thought that was most unique .
and it just , you know , kind of goes along with what you were saying ,
uh -huh .
about the dog having sort of free run of the , the nursing home .
uh -huh .
so , um , but , uh , i ,
this is the only pet we 've had sin -,
um .
you know ,
in all our years of marriage , um ,
and it 's been , uh , sort of a , a change for my husband because as a , a , a boy growing up , his father had dogs
but they were always hunting dogs ,
oh , uh -huh .
and so they were never allowed in the house , you know ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
they were always kind of ,
yeah ,
we 've ruined them
yeah ,
right .
that 's what he said .
they say   ruined them
yes .
so having a pet was a little bit different for him .
well , we 've had a lot of different pets .
we had , the kids had rabbits for pets ,
uh -huh .
and we also raised them for food ,
yeah ,
at one time .
oh , yes .
and we 've  had it  we 've had a skunk for a pet .
oh , my golly .
for more years than i want to think about
she was in the house
oh , gosh .
isn 't that interesting ?
i don 't think i 've ever talked to anyone who 's actually had a skunk for a pet .
well , do -, don 't ever get one for a pet .
oh .
they 're okay ,
but like she , uh ,
they don 't ever learn their name .
oh .
uh , you can 't , you could never call her and she would come to you ,
yeah .
you had to go chase her down .
i 'll be darned .
how interesting .
and , uh , their eyesight , they can 't see very far either .
but ,
uh -huh .
i guess i 've heard that , uh -huh .
they ,
be -, before we got her , everybody said ,  "oh , they 're just like a cat ," you know .
uh -huh .
and , uh , they 're not
i mean , they use the litter box .
that 's about it  
isn 't that interesting ?
that 's , that 's really something .
um , how long did you have that ?
oh , my , how , how long ?
probably seven or eight years .
goodness sake .
and finally , my children are the ones  who  said ,  "mom , you 've put up with that skunk long enough ,"
so ,
we moved her to the basement ,
and i don 't think she was there a week till the men moved her , buil -, built her a pen outside
oh , my gosh .
isn 't that funny ?
and i thought , i put up with that all those years
yes ,
and this is what it took finally
and ,
that is ,
we 've had , we 've had cats ,
uh -huh .
 stay  in the house .
yeah .
we had , we had two siamese cats .
uh -huh .
different times .
right .
uh , one of them ran off .
she ran off once ,
or he , i guess it was a male , he ran off twice ,
and the second time he never came back .
my goodness .
and we would see him , uh , several miles from our house ,
uh -huh .
he kind of moved into a woods down there .
i 'll be .
and he got huge down there .
my goodness .
he really grew
but he , he never came back .
that 's in -, that 's interesting .
i , i wouldn 't picture a siamese as being an outdoor cat .
well , he wasn 't a whole lot .
uh -huh .
he was in the house most the time ,
yeah .
but , uh , he did go out sometimes
and , uh , they ma -,
it makes a much nicer cat if they 're outside .
is that right ?
yeah .
the , the cats ,
my son has a cat ,
and the vet had told us they get strange ,
uh -huh .
if they 're kept in the house all the time .
and their cat was not a friendly cat ,
well .
it was , it was not a good ,
i don 't know ,
it got ,
it was just , did get strange
yeah ,
so that that was right .
and since they 've moved to where they are , they let the cat out .
uh -huh .
and it has improved the personality .
american -, americans like me
and whether i night , uh , uh , not ,
i think that we 're paying too much taxes . um , that , including taxes in general or income tax ,
and , um , the other thing was do we get what we pay for ,
i mean , what , what is our , what is our opinion on that
okay .
so are you prepared to talk ?
oh , i guess so ,
go by ear ,
let me push .
okay ,
let me push one here
okay , um ,
well i can just tell you a little bit about taxes in texas .
it 's most interesting because we 're one of the few , if ,
i don 't know of any other state , um , does not have a , a state income tax right ,
so we don 't have a state income tax ,
but we certainly make up for it in other ways here .
um , for instance , the local , um , sales tax is eight and a quarter percent .
oh , wow .
isn 't that awful
how about you ?
what do you have there ?
uh -huh .
uh we have a six percent sales tax .
and you have state income tax also ?
yes .
uh -huh ,
yeah .
well , it 's been ,
people here have just , have this , um ,
they 've been really holding out in the legislature ,
and it 's starting to show , um , in a lot of ways as far as things that are just totally under funded ,
and , and i don 't know if texas is ever going to be able to , to , um , totally avoid having an income tax or not .
uh -huh .
i think eventually they 're going to have to do it but , um . do you think you pay too much there ,
or how do you feel about that ?
i don 't mind my taxes as much as my social security .
yeah ,
oh , really interesting ,
uh -huh .
yeah ,
um , the taxes ,
i don 't know ,
yeah .
i can deal with that because i know everyone else is paying in too , i guess you know .
yes .
but , uh , oh , i don 't know , uh ,
the one thing that ,
uh -huh .
we don 't have , uh , tax on clothes do you ?
um , yes
we do have tax on clothes .
that 's what i thought .
uh -huh .
i know new york also has a sales tax on clothes and i know a lot of kids , like going to college with me , that lived in new york or out of state , and a lot of them would buy their clothes in pennsylvania just for the simple sake of not paying that ,
how interesting .
i guess i didn 't realize that .
uh -huh .
um , we don 't have tax on groceries , for instance , uh ,
no ,
well , we don 't have it necessarily on food ,
yeah .
but then there 's other things that they nail you for it like health and beauty products you know ,
right yes ,
yes ,
i should , i should have , um , delineated ,
yet , your absolutely right .
yeah .
it 's the food , the consumable food parts that , you know , we don 't have to pay tax on .
yeah ,
yeah ,
and you really have to watch your , your , um , bill .
sometimes i think , um , it 's real interesting to look to see how many things that i buy in a grocery store which are not really edible groceries
and that 's when it really starts to add on ,
and , um , so , um , that 's , that is sort of a help ,
but , um , i don 't know ,
it 's just eight and a quarter just seems like an awfully lot of , of tax on uh , any sale , as far as i 'm concerned , um ,
yeah ,
that    ,
it 's real interesting , this last , um , tax season ,
i 'm a student ,
and the last tax season i had a , just a part time job helping out in a tax office .
and the woman that owned the office was saying , she 'd had this business for oh , probably seventeen or eighteen years ,
and she was saying as the years have gone on , there are fewer and fewer things that people can , uh , take off of their income tax .
deduct , yeah .
uh -huh .
and , you know , if you 're not a home owner , or if you haven 't sold property , or , uh , have something major like that , it 's hardly , you know it 's just not much else you can do ,
uh -huh .
and she said it 's really taken the fun out of doing taxes for people for her , because she used to be real creative about helping them find ways of ,
and see ,
you know , accumulating receipts .
i take it she was an accountant .
yeah .
can 't do , oh , really can 't do it any more .
yeah ,
uh -huh .
so .
i know ,
well , i , i , i also was a student ,
uh -huh .
i just graduated in may and , um , i graduated with a finance degree ,
but that was the big joke , the accountants or the people who found ways to cheat on your income tax .
that was the big joke .
how interesting . oh , gosh .
where did you go to school ?
clarion university .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
well , you are , you are the same age as my daughter , because she just graduated from college this year too .
i 'm a graduate student having gone back after many years .
so .
uh -huh .
um , nevertheless , i am a student , and poor
yeah ,
uh -huh .
so , it 's , uh , um , you know , it 's been ,
uh -huh .
yeah .
i guess , as far as people like , uh , our family , we can feel like sometimes we pay more than our share as middle class people with , americans with um , college age students , you know ,
and , and , i , there just , i don 't know ,
uh -huh .
i guess as you say , you just have to look around and decide that most of the other people that you know are paying about what you are ,
and ,
i think they should go back ,
i , i realize , you know , that we have , uh , graduated tax brackets ,
but i think they should still go back
and instead of putting the burden more on the middle class , i think the burden should be put more on the wealthy .
oh , yes .
absolutely ,
yeah .
yeah ,
because it seems like , they still come out okay um , you know .
yeah .
yeah you know , they always have the argument , well , you know , well who 's to say we don 't work harder to get that you know ,
i kind of have my doubts
uh -huh .
well i don 't care how much they take off of you , you know you 're still going to be above , on top ,
and i ,
that 's ,
you now like you said , i 've worked in different places ,
and the ones that get the most pay do the least work .
yes .
seems that way , yeah ,  ]
that the higher they get , the , you know ,
at least ,
i don 't know ,
uh -huh .
it seems like , um , they must feel like they 're paid for all of the years of experience or , um , or something , or just the title , sometimes um ,
and it , it doesn 't seem fair ,
and i , i know a lot of people do make money , um , you know , in , in good investments and things like that ,
but i think that 's a lot of luck and a lot of gambling , and not a , not a whole lot of work
i agree with you .
i do think it 's a lot of luck ,
yeah .
and i don 't like that part of the finance , you know whatsoever .
right .
i don 't know ,
but like what i was saying about the social security , that 's real , you know ,
uh -huh .
it never bothered me until we started talking about it in my classes and then the more i think about it , the more i think , i 'm paying in to something that i ,
right .
granted , you know , i 'm paying for my grandparents but i 'm never going to see that .
probably not .
social security is going to be gone before i ever get any .
yeah ,
yes ,
uh -huh .
or what 's left is not going to be worth anything you know , in terms of how ,
right
they 're going to pay me
 you can actually use it . 
 fifty dollars a month , right 
yeah ,
right .
but that 's ,
well , and ,
i 'm sorry ,
i put in much more than that , you know .
that 's right ,
yeah .
yeah ,
that 's ,
i haven 't heard much in recent years , um , about social security ,
uh -huh .
i mean , for a while there , not too long ago , they were , they were saying that the whole system was going to be bankrupt you know , before very long , because so much was going out for programs that were , it wa -, that originally it was never intended to be used for .
right .
uh -huh .
or , you know , programs just weren 't in existence and then , um , i ,
it sort of calmed down .
i haven 't heard much lately ,
but if you have talked about that in your classes , you know , in the last few years , i 'm sure that you have heard ,
oh , yeah .
yeah ,
well , um , i don 't know ,
i guess we complain about taxes ,
but , i guess , you know ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
 you have to be sort of , 
yeah ,
 you got to look  to what they put , you know you have decent roads at least
yeah .
you have to appreciate , yeah , what , what you do get for them sometimes and , um , i guess it 's , it 's worse , you know ,
uh -huh .
that 's true .
i 'd rather be able to control my money as much as i do with what 's left over taxes than to live in , oh , england or , um , some countries where so much of it is socialized that you don 't see any of that money at all and , so , you know , i guess it 's all relative ,
uh -huh ,
it 's how you look at it too .
that 's exactly right .
i like to ,
instead of thinking how much , you know , that i 'm paying out , i like to just look at it and say oh , well everyone else is doing it too , you know .
that 's right ,
yeah ,
and i ,
my name 's mary dell ,
and i live in the dallas , texas area where there 's a lot of pollution
okay ,
oh .
uh -huh .
and i 'm up in wisconsin uh , my name is terry and , uh , in the small town we don 't ,
but , uh , we 're not that far from the city where there 's tons of pollution .
yes .
okay ,
i 'll go ahead and start recording that ,
okay .
okay , um ,
just in particular here in the twin cities we have a lot of big corporations
and , um oh .
i 'm sure there 's a lot of pollution .
we , uh ,
uh -huh .
before moving to wisconsin lived across from where they were , um , gravel pits and also where they were making tar ,
and so we would occasionally if the wind was blowing the right direction would get the smell of tar
ooh .
and it would , uh ,
smell the continuous ,
you knew that you were also breathing that into your lungs ,
right .
so and it was like miles away ,
uh -huh .
but just the idea of having that come across the way it did in the wind kind of made you know that there was a lot of pollution ,
and that was just one small corporation that was doing the pollution of that ,
uh -huh .
but also , um , where we also lived , too , it was very close to a highway ,
uh -huh .
so got a lot of fumes from , uh , trucks and cars
and you would literally see the pollution on your furniture ,
oh , gosh ,
i mean , it was on your tables ,
you would dust every day ,
and it was dirty , um , type of dust ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i mean , it wasn 't the typical dust that you get way out in the country um for ,
i live in a small , um , town now quite a ways from the twin cities , about an hour away ,
and i may dust once a week ,
and that 's all it needs versus every day when i lived in the city so .
huh i 'd never thought about that being a cause ,
i have to dust a lot as well .
oh , yeah ,
yeah .
it , it comes right on through through the screens ,
uh -huh .
my goodness .
the only way that you could actually live in the , in the city is to close your windows and have an air cleaner system right in your home that would take the air from the outside and clean the air before it would get into the house and so it was quite a dirty city .
uh -huh .
um , if you were well protected by trees , which catch a lot of the pollution then you 're fine ,
but most of the time in the city you have lots of high rises , you have lots of other things that are not catching the pollution
uh -huh .
and it 's just going for miles and miles and miles ,
and it 's landing somewhere with the wind ,
but ,
that 's kind of the way dallas is .
we 're so flat and open ,
sure .
and i live in a suburb that doesn 't have much vegetation , trees it was all cotton fields ,
sure .
so we don 't have that advantage ,
yeah ,
yeah .
and ours i think is primarily cars , where we don 't carpool like we should an airport .
i work in a building ,
uh -huh .
i 'm nineteen floors up and i look out toward d f w international ,
uh -huh .
and there 's just an awful brown haze all the time and i can imagine it 's even worse for people living over near the airport .
oh , sure ,
sure ,
yeah .
it 's ,
uh -huh .
i mean , our air quality , um , in the twin cities is a lot better than what we 've heard about california and maybe in the other areas ,
but , um , they were always talking about the air quality of today is this , you know , the ozone or whatever ,
yes .
and it 's kind of scary because the air is something we take for granted and many people are too busy getting to work , not thinking about , okay , i could have carpooled with a friend ,
uh -huh .
even my husband was , uh , talking to some of the guys at work ,
now he 's , uh , fifteen miles away from work ,
but he was talking , wouldn 't it be nice to carpool ,
and the guy says , well , it 's too close ,
uh -huh .
it wouldn 't pay and , so .
yeah ,
and ,
want to meet my own schedule those are the arguments we hear ,
ex -, exactly , and so , my husband says , well , that 's fine , you know ,
uh -huh .
it would save quite a bit on the wear and tear on cars and , you know , the gas ,
and , no ,
everybody has their preference to drive by themselves
or , if they do , they , they drive with one little buddy , uh ,
uh -huh .
at least it 's with one person but most of the time people are saying forget it .
i don 't want to carpool ,
it 's too much of a hassle ,
it 's too much involvement but yet ,
but we 're paying for it .
yes ,
we are ,
and i think of my daughter
and i 'm sure you think of your children ,
uh -huh .
and you kind of say to yourself , what kind of future will they have when they think back and say , well , my parents did have the choice to kind of make a difference and maybe people are trying ,
but they have to change attitudes ,
uh -huh .
sure .
and it seems to me that it 's already so evident with our children having a lot more respiratory infections than we had growing up you can really see it .
i , i had a chance to go to bolivia a couple years ago ,
and of course there 's no industry , very little trash ,
sure .
sure .
well , they ,
they they don 't even have that much that they burn , because they consume everything down to the thread ,
and it amazed me ,
i , i just had totally forgotten how
uh , the only work i do outside the home is i am an avon representative .
oh , okay .
and i sell family products .
uh -huh .
and , uh ,
do you ,
so i , i don 't really , i don 't really dress up a whole lot .
do you work outside ?
well , i , i work , uh ,
i 'm a c p a
and i do contract work .
oh , uh -huh .
oh .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
and so , and i work with another c p a who just started his own practice and i work with him a couple days a week and so when i go to his office or to other clients ' offices , then i 'll dress up but otherwise it 's great being at home in jeans or shorts or whatever
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
so that , that makes it pretty nice .
uh -huh .
it 's kind of weird because before i used to work , you know , full time
and , and , uh , it seemed like i was wearing a suit every day , just about .
well , you 'd have to dress differently when you 're working every day , i think .
right .
yeah .
right ,
and so it 's , uh ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
some of my suits i haven 't put on for quite a while .
uh -huh .
it 's kind of nice to relax a little bit .
so it 's , it 's , it 's very nice .
yeah .
gosh ,
well , my , my dress up ,
i live out in the country also
uh -huh .
so what i wear depends on the weather .
sure .
uh , so i really , i know a lot of the avon representatives are portrayed as being very dressed up .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
right .
but , i mostly dress , i try to dress nice , but for convenience , because when the weather 's bad , when i go into the home i take off my shoes which i try to wear something easy to take off , you know and put on .
and i don 't too often take off my coat even ,
so , uh , i really don 't have to dress up like y -, you would , like if you 're in an office or something .
yeah ,
yeah .
well , i imagine that where you live , uh , you 're in warm clothing quite a bit of the year .
not really ?
uh , well , not actually because we really only have maybe three , four months of , i 'd say warm weather .
oh , is that right ?
yeah ,
and the rest is , uh , gets into the cooler weather .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
course , they keep saying the weather 's going to change and we 're going to have more florida type weather up here
uh -huh .
so i don 't know .
so you all are waiting for that
but for now , but for now , we have a lot of ice and snow in the wintertime and , uh , cold weather .
uh -huh .
and that type of thing .
yeah .
now , my daughter works all the time ,
so she dresses .
right .
right .
i think , you know , you have to spend more money on your clothing , and that because you do have to have the appearance , a good appearance to do a good job where you work .
yeah .
well , down here it 's sunny most of the time .
uh -huh .
and , uh , usually warm .
i mean , we had a few cool days , uh , this month ,
but not anything , i 'm sure , compared to what you 've had so far .
um , uh -huh .
so , i mean people are still wearing shorts
uh -huh .
and and , uh , usually around halloween it starts getting cooler ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
right ,
yeah .
so you start you know , breaking out a coat at that time ,
but , that , that lasts , you know , for a few months
did you find you wore , uh , slacks when you were working full time
no .
or did you did they wear more dresses and skirts .
no ,
never wore slacks .
no slacks .
it was , i think it was one of those things where , it 's not like someone came out and said you can 't wear them .
uh -huh .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
it was one of those understood things that you just , you know , either wore , you know , a dress or ,
uh -huh .
not ,
not even a dressy slack , a dressy suit , slack suit even if it 's all ,
no ,
not , not with what i did . uh ,
uh -huh .
most people didn 't .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
sometimes , like the secretaries might but even then you didn 't see them wearing slacks too much .
and i really , you know ,
there 's some nice pantsuits out
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
and and i wouldn 't have mind -, minded , you know , wearing those especially when it gets pretty cold .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
but , uh ,
i know my daughter mostly ,
uh -huh .
i don 't think she ever wears slacks to work .
but i didn 't know if the trend changes , you know , if , uh ,
you know , i think it 's one of those things where it 's not viewed upon as being professional .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i guess they expect women to be in skirts or dresses .
look more like a woman , huh
yeah
that 's right
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
and it 's the men that make the rules
uh , well , then you , you , you know why they make them then
that way .
but , no ,
we usually , you know ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
skirt and , skirt and blouse or suit or dress is what you see down here .
so it 's nice with me working at home because i can wear pants .
yeah .
yeah .
no , no one can see me unless i 'm , you know , g -,
yeah .
but , yet , you need to keep up an appearance for your husband , too , though at home .
yeah .
because that 's , i , i believe ,
but , i 'm not going to put a skirt on just for him
oh , you don 't think you will , huh
well , you 'll be excused because considering everything
yeah ,
uh -huh .
yeah .
i think that the main issue at home is being comfortable in your clothing
but i , i look at homemaking as a job also .
right .
uh , being a homemaker
and i , i think sometimes we lose sight of that .
yeah .
uh , by the fact that we don 't sometimes watch our dress ,
what do you do there in lubbock as far as , uh , recycling is concerned ?
well , you know they actually started
and i assumed it was t i wide , uh ,
uh -huh .
they , they started putting out at least recycling bins for the paper uh , i 've you know
either computer paper or different types of paper .
uh -huh .
i 've had some ideas on how i think they could probably do it a little less expensively and accomplish the same purpose ,
but i , i guess i need to put it on paper and turn it in
oh , yeah .
 uh . 
 wha -,  what would be more efficient about it .
wha -, what ,
well , the way they have , you know , they have boxes located at certain areas throughout a module , or down the hall 
 uh -huh . 
or  a lot of people aren 't going to get up , walk out of their offices and go there .
uh -huh .
you know , where i use to work we had what we called tree boxes .
that 's just what we called them .
uh -huh .
and they were recycled cardboard .
they were eight and a half by eleven
and you set it by your desk and you know as you got rid of a piece of paper you stuck it in there
and when it filled up you called , you know facilities whoever to come pick it up
and they brought you another box .
so not only is it , you know ,
i think more people would take advantage of it and use it , uh ,
oh .
i think you save a lot of the cleaning service 's time and effort and money that we are paying for them to , to empty the trash cans and combine it and bundle it and things like that now when it could all be done in one step kind of type thing .
i see .
so ,
yeah ,
right .
i , i , i , uh , was going to say cause i know i have right here a trash can for trash and a trash can for for paper on it you know
 if . 
and , uh ,  if  if i have a , if i , i printed up something that i don 't need it , just chunk it in the , in the paper .
right ,
that 's true .
but somebody still has to collect all that and bundle it together
and whereas if you had a box that pretty soon it got full , you close the box , it 's already bundled , it 's already done for you .
certainly  that 's a good idea . 
 so you 're  saving a lot of time and effort .
yeah .
i just need to put it on paper and i guess recommended it to somebody and see if they thinks it 's feasible
uh -huh .
so , uh , what else do they do in the dallas area ?
well , uh , as far as t i is concerned , i 'm not sure .
uh , and i have heard , you know , uh , in residential situations .
i live in a dorm
uh -huh .
um .
and i have heard in residential situations , uh , like in plano uh , that they are doing , uh , stuff like having recycle picked up where , uh , the city , uh , i guess the sanitation department , uh , as part of their responsibility picks up , uh , the recycled items as well , you know , the plastics and the paper uh , and aluminum
and , uh , the only responsibility of the , of the , patron is to separate them
and then the , the ,
uh , i guess the department takes them and and does what they do with them
and it doesn 't cost the patron anything .
doesn 't really cost the , uh , department .
anything extra .
right .
they don 't pay , they don 't pay for the recycled items .
that sounds good .
there 's ,
i , i 've been wanting to put like two of three bins like right out my garage door where , you know , from the kitchen where you know you can throw cans in one or the glass in the other
or the , the even , uh ,
uh -huh .
there are areas that can recycle the , the tin cans , like your you know , vegetable things come in
and , uh , so i , i 've not done that ,
but that 's kind of what i want to set up so . because we do go through aluminum cans , you know .
that 's probably the one we use most .
uh -huh .
uh , but ,
well , wh -, what kind of services do you have there in lubbock as far as ,
uh , where can you take your recycle items ?  ]
i , i lived in abilene for a , uh ,
i went to school there at abilene christian
and i ,
it was so hard to , uh ,
 find a place . 
 you know if you  you wanted to recycle you newspapers it was impossible .
well , uh , uh they , they do have facilities for recycling the newspapers , aluminum cans , those are the two major items .
you know , we can take oil , like car oil , recycled oil to ,
um .
they have , uh , uh , dump areas like at the fire departments throughout town .
uh -huh .
uh , i don 't know that they yet have the facilities here to do the tin cans .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh , i think they can do the plastics , like the liter bottles things like that .
uh -huh .
uh , but , i , i don 't know .
i know for sure though they have the newspaper and the aluminum can and then the oil at the fire departments .
uh -huh .
so ,
well , that 's good .
i do that
i think people are becoming more aware .
yeah .
you know of , of the waste
and you know i , i like to see , you know ,
uh -huh .
you drive through burger king now and the bags are recycled paper and you know , so , you know i feel like people are more aware of it or becoming more aware of it .
you know , maybe it 's making an impact
uh -huh .
do you tend to buy more recycled items that , if something , uh , the pack says recycled and something else doesn 't ?
do ,
would you tend to chose the one that does
or ,
uh -huh .
um .
i 'm not as good about searching something out like that but if i am there and the choice is there i would probably take the recycled product .
uh -huh .
so , you know , that 's just where i probably need to be a little more responsible , citizen wise , you know , looking or searching those out because you figure if we as the citizens do that then the manufactures and producers will start packaging it that way .
sure ,
yeah .
so , uh , you know , they are getting away from the styrofoam ,
okay .
well , discussing air pollution today , i guess .
uh -huh .
um , uh , well , give me your first impressions .
uh , i don 't know ,
there 's a lot of air pollution .
yeah .
uh -huh .
um , i think industries and companies provide a lot of it and , with , uh , i guess with the oil burning over in kuwait and stuff , that would have a lot of air pollution in it .
uh , puts a whole ,
yeah ,
gets a whole new picture to what real air pollution can be ,
but , uh , that stuff going on over there .
what , what , uh , what part of pennsylvania are you in ?
um , i 'm north of pittsburgh ,
so .
okay ,
okay ,
so , it 's , it 's amazing too , you know , with that , with the oil wells burning over there , that 's the exact same stuff that 's coming out of cars every day , just in , uh , just in a little different  grade , i guess . 
 yeah . 
but , uh , in dallas , we 've got , we 've just , uh , brought in a whole new set of requirements on inspections and things like that for cars , because , uh , people just don 't use mass transit and stuff in dallas .
everybody loves their car ,
and you see an awful lot of , uh , one person vehicles on the road on , during rush hours .
that seems to be our biggest problem down here .
um , you know , there 's , uh , there 's a lot of industry around ,
but , uh , it 's not , it 's
any pollution that industry 's dumping around here is not going into the air .
it 's typically water type situation .
yeah .
um . we have a couple , we have like a steel mill and a couple refineries and stuff ,
and i know there 's a lot of air pollution going in there ,
uh -huh .
and like they , they get fined whenever they do the air pollution but the fine is nothing , you know ,
yeah ,
 it 's , it 's , 
 it 's like  nothing to them .
like , like two hours of output or something like that .
yeah ,
yeah ,
that 's true ,
that 's true .
uh -huh .
yeah ,
i , a , uh , i grew up in south dakota ,
uh -huh .
so i was never , i was never exposed to anything of , of the , of the sort .
uh -huh .
um , there were always e p a people and what not were always telling us that , uh , farm chemicals and what not were destroying our water system and all that but we just , we just never saw the results .
there was , there was dust in the air during planting seasons and what not ,
but that , that was all we ever saw ,
and then five years ago i moved to dallas ,
and i suddenly started to understand what burning eyes , and all that stuff is about that i 'd always heard about .
it , uh , it 's , it gets , it 's real depressing .
in the morning sometime you can tell if it 's a good day or a bad day by , uh , how far out from downtown , uh , you can be on the road and still not see it .
oh , my god
and , uh , yeah ,
i mean , it 's not ,
i don 't think dallas is considered , uh , a real bad place for air pollution ,
 uh -huh . 
but , you , you can tell , you can tell the differences in the days , when it 's , when the haze is kind of yellowish gray instead of just being a , a foggy , misty  color  and , uh , it , it 's a little , it 's a little disappointing sometimes you start to realize what you 're breathing .
uh , yeah ,
but , i don 't know what they can do to really prevent it , you know .
like , how ,
what can they do about the oil burning over in kuwait ?
what , you know ,
i mean they fine the industries ,
 right . 
but you know , that doesn 't seem to stop them  there  i don 't know what else they can do .
right .
it , it 's that there really isn 't a whole lot .
it 's one of those , uh , it 's one of those things that if they do a little bit and , uh , and , you know , e -, every little bit does help ,
i do believe that .
um , but i also believe that the earth is a kind of a self -regulating system ,
and , uh , it will clean itself up , eventually .
it ,
uh -huh .
the whole idea is not to , not to push the limit too hard , i guess let the , you know , let the natural , natural systems take care of the problem as much as possible .
yeah ,
i , i ,
yeah ,
i just don 't understand , you know , what else anyone can do about it .
i don 't think it 's something that people really think about , either .
uh -huh .
you know , it 's , i mean , it , it should probably be a big issue , you know , because it 's , it 's doing a lot of damage ,
but i ,
it 's something , you know ,
i don 't think many people really think about it , because it 's nothing they ,
i don 't think we really have too much control over it .
right .
and it 's one of those things ,
uh -huh .
it , it 's so hard to measure what , what the damage is it 's kind of like , oh ,
i guess it 's kind of like , kind of like cigarette smoking , you know .
uh -huh .
it , it could go on for years and years until they start to see some results and people can actually , actually say , yeah , it 's , it 's , it 's doing , doing some damage and something 's got to be done .
um , there 's , you know , there 's a lot of things like that .
it ,
you can , uh , you can pound on something for a long time before it finally breaks ,
but until it breaks , you don 't really know that there , you were doing anything to it .
yeah ,
exactly .
but , uh ,
well , i really don 't know too much else about it .
yeah ,
well , that 's , that 's ,
i think we both agree it 's , it 's one of those deals that , uh ,
uh -huh .
i just think there 's a lot of other problems right now and , uh , we 've done a lot to take care of it .
yeah .
and , uh ,
yeah ,
we have tried ,
i mean , you know , and , um , i , i know where , you know , where a couple of the mills that have ,
i know they put things on their stacks , you know , to filter the smoke , and do all kinds of things ,
but , i mean , every now and then it breaks , you know ,
oh , sure .
and and you just have smoke going out into the air for a day or two , until you can get it fixed .
sure .
and so , so , you know , it 's something we , we have tried to help .
oh , there 's no doubt about it .
yeah .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i don 't know if you ever happened to see some of the like , twenty twenty and what not about rumania and east germany when they first got pictures out of there about how some of their systems had been running for twenty and thirty years and , uh , you know , they had absolutely no regulations , no controls whatsoever ,
and they had destroyed entire forests and what not , just because the air was so polluted .
that 's , that 's the kind of things that , uh , you don 't see in this country ,
and that 's , that 's why i think that , you know , it 's ,
i don 't know if you can ever do enough ,
but , uh , i think it 's all relative to the , to the time and place ,
and i think right now it 's , it 's pretty much under control .
yeah ,
okay ,
well .
all righty .
uh -huh .
it 's been nice talking to you .
well , you bet .
okay ,
bye -bye .
bye .
well amy it 's been , uh , kind of overcast today and cloudy .
yeah .
we have ,
our ,
i have a son in kindergarten ,
he was having a kite day ,
oh , boy .
and i was really worried about it raining because it has , there 's been some dark clouds
and it 's been , um , and it 's been pretty rainy looking .
yeah i 've been trying to put weed spray on the lawn for the whole week
and you can 't put it on if it 's suppose to rain within forty -eight hours ,
uh -huh .
and so i keep hearing the forecast it 's going to rain , it 's going to rain , it 's going to rain ,
but it really hasn 't rained
i know .
i know it just has that ,
i ,
it looks ,
yeah .
several times in the last couple of weeks it has looked rainy that day and not , not done anything .
yeah .
and we have a lot of trees in our yard
and i probably ,
they 're pretty old , big tall trees ,
uh -huh .
and so if it 's an overcast day then the weather is pretty blah
yeah ,
yeah .
because i really have to catch some sunshine or else i feel like i live in a cave all the time ,
well , i get tired with the ki -,
i have two ki -, preschoolers , a three year old and a two year old ,
uh -huh .
and if it 's not nice and they can 't go out , it 's really the pits
oh , i bet .
but i appreciate it when they can at least go play in the backyard for an hour or something , you know .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
that makes a big difference but i , uh ,
we 're kind of new to plano
and i 'm working on a carnival that 's going to be in a couple of weeks for our school
and i 'm thinking that this has been pretty , you know , rainy season ,
and it 's been kind of scary ,
it 's kind of been sc -, cloudy every day ,
and
yeah .
i thought , well , i 'm just not anxious to have worry about the weather .
yeah .
well , yeah .
well , my three and half year old , he really wants to have the pool out in the backyard you know any day ,
i mean all winter long he 's been wanting a pool in the backyard .
so , i 'm hoping , you know , that ,
it just seems like the weather around here goes so quickly from being winter to , you know , muggy , and hot ,
uh -huh .
and it 's just you never really have like nice cool sixty -five or seventy degree weather with sunshine you know ?
i really miss that ,
i 'm from chicago originally ,
and i miss the   seasons that , you know , that we used to get up there that you just don 't have down here .
well , i know in , um ,
i 'm from missouri
and we always had pretty nice four seasons
and , and you know , ex -,
we have some extreme weather in each season ,
yeah .
but , uh , i like that
and we moved here from houston in , in , uh , july
and everyone kept saying , oh , you 're going up north it 's not going to be so hot ,
it 's not going to be so humid ,
oh
yeah ,
that has just not been the case .
oh , really yeah .
it has been ,
it 's pretty hot here during the summer gosh .
oh it was extremely hot ,
i thought i was going to die ,
my car , i thought it was going die last summer
but ,
do have air conditioning in your car
or ,
well , the air conditioning was broke ,
but broken ,
i guess it just couldn 't handle ,
yeah .
the stress , and the heat , the record heat ,
and , you know , i was worried about every time we came to an intersection the car started idling rough , you know ,
yeah .
yeah .
because of the extreme heat .
yeah .
uh -huh .
i know , my husband doesn 't have air conditioning in his car and he , when he comes home from work , you know , during the summer he 's just wa -, he feels like he 's burning like he 's been baking for an hour
oh , i  know . 
 gosh . 
that 's really awful ,
yeah .
but , but i , uh , understand that this is kind of typical for this time of year that rainy season .
what i hate is ,
uh -huh .
i hate having to water so much around here you know ,
no .
sure .
we never used to have to water our lawns you know in chicago it was always enough rain here and there so here if you don 't water it just looks awful .
brown .
i just hate to spend the money just going down the drain and watering grass , you know .
yeah .
that is , that is awful and it , it takes time
and the , the kids , they ,
you have to water your lawn
and they want to go out and run in it and get all muddy ,
yeah
you know ,
so you 're going do i want a di -, a green lawn or a muddy feet
in the house .
yeah ,
we have a dog too
oh , no
so that adds to it you know , traipse in and out with whatever the weather is like out there
so ,
well , i don 't know ,
do ,
the nice thing i 'm looking forward to is , uh , not having a hurricane season .
oh , yeah ,
because houston was really hurricane alley , wasn 't it ,
weren 't there a lot of hurricanes there ?
yes ,
we always had , uh , big concern about hurricanes ,
and they 're close enough to the coast
oh , boy .
and , you know , you had to have a supply like , uh , emergency supply on hand all the time during the hurricane season ,
and , and it was pretty spooky
yeah ,
that would be ,
gosh .
because you always have to think , you know , what 's the weather doing ,
keep the weather radio close by and stuff like that ?
right .
yeah .
and do we have enough , you know , um , food storage , and enough , uh , batteries and all the kinds of things .
yeah ,
really , every time i store batteries , i wind up going to use them and they 're dead
they 've been stored so long .
that 's right .
oh , boy .
so ,
uh -huh .
well , now this is a little bit of relief , although they still have warnings all the time around here for , you know , tornado season hurricanes and stuff ,
so ,
i ,
well i , yeah , i don 't really like tornadoes either ,
yeah .
but , uh , at least there isn 't ,
we fe -, i feel like i got rid of something ,
hurricanes ,
so ,
not too much of that .
yeah .
well , i 've been worried about mostly with having little kids now with taking them out in the summer and getting them burnt up ,
yeah .
i mean i have to keep the sun screen on them just constantly when they go outside because they say it 's just so dangerous for little ones to get a bad sunburn so ,
and it is ,
yeah .
and , i just , i can 't believe the , the record temperatures that have , were here last summer that ,
a hundred and ten degrees
and ,
oh , it was just unbelievably hot .
and i can 't stand to be outside at all when it 's like that ,
i just don 't even want to go out , you know , of the house to get the mail even
leave me in the air conditioning .
that is pretty bad .
we had our air conditioning broke , break last last summer .
the switch got something wrong with the switch
and we had to call somebody out to fix it , because i couldn 't take it more than a few hours without it on .
oh , i know .
i can 't imagine .
yeah .
even ,
well , that would ,
it is just pretty bad ,
but i guess , um , i guess the weather hasn 't changed too much from here to houston
yeah .
and , but it is ,
like you say coming a little bit further up north .
yeah ,
yeah .
it 's a little bit nicer to have a spring and a fall season ,
yeah .
where you have some pleasant weather everyday where you can feel like you just want to open your windows
and ,
yeah ,
that 's really nice
i hate having to leave the house clo -, you know , closed up all the time .
uh -huh .
yeah .
and get some fresh air in the house
and , it feels good
yeah .
but , but , i guess ,
well , have you been here during the real heavy , heavy rains ?
i mean i can 't remember what time of year ,
i think it 's usually this time of year when we get some , just torrential down pours .
gosh flooding .
no but i remember ,
our neighbors had flooding ,
so badly it was like a foot deep in their house last year .
oh , no .
they had to replace all their carpeting and everything ,
it was miserable .
now , that sounds awful .
yeah .
that would not be fun .
now , i have seen those .
uh -huh .
i have driven around in the neighborhoods and seen those little flood gauges that will be at little yellow signs ,
it 's , you know , has it like from one foot to four foot
oh , really .
and i thought i would never buy a house with a flood gauge down the street .
oh , gosh ,
no kidding .
talk about asking for trouble , huh ?
yeah ,
that would be awful .
yeah ,
yeah .
well , i 've got some kids out on the trampoline i need to go look and see what they 're doing .
okay ,
well , have a good day .
well , you too .
thanks .
 bye -bye . 
 bye -bye . 
so , what is your latest experience with painting ?
well , i don 't ,
i haven 't done any painting since i was a child
and my father would be painting and i 'd ask him if i could , you know , take a turn or something ,
but , uh ,
uh -huh .
when we bought our home it was recently updated .
they did that , maybe improvements , so they could sell it and things ,
so we didn 't have to do any painting .
right .
and the condominium we moved in before , my husband went over and painted ,
but i ,
the experience that i 've had is that , um , whatever time he gave , said , oh , it would take me about , just about four hours ,
because it was only about like eleven or twelve hundred square feet over there ,
and he said , oh , it 's going to be just about four hours .
well , he was gone the whole day ,
and he said , well , all i got done was the taping around
isn 't that amazing ?
it , it looks so easy just slapping paint on .
uh -huh .
i had an addition put on and , um , we , and i decided ,
because my inner room looked so dingy ,
uh -huh .
because i put these beautiful french doors in and , so i decided , okay , i 'll just , you know , have them paint this little room , you know , a little ten by ten dining area .
uh -huh .
it took four days .
and even the painter couldn 't give me a good estimate .
uh -huh .
he said , well , i 'll be done this afternoon , you know and pretty soon , before you know it , you know , he 's run into so many problems ,
and it 's just ,
there 's nothing there to be a problem i thought ,
but , um , it just took him so much longer ,
uh -huh .
and and he was there to paint the french doors also .
um , and if you 've ever painted french doors , which my husband just finally said he wasn 't going to do
because it looked so formidable ,
yeah .
um , then , then just
we , we got this painter ,
and i just called him because i got a little ad out of the , you know , the  adcose  or whatever in the mail , and , uh , you know , just got this painter person over here .
and he said , yeah , i can finish it in a day .
oh , right .
so the whole project basically took a week
oh , i know ,
it 's just awful .
funny .
and i go what makes you a professional ? you know ?
how much , you know , more do you know than i know about this whole situation ,
but he just kept painting on those french doors , you know ,
pane .
and each little , um paint stroke , you know , the paint wasn 't going on right is what it was .
uh -huh .
so he had to redo them like three times before i was happy with them , before he was happy , you know , that they even looked halfway decent ,
um .
and so it 's just been painting , yeah ,
i mean , hire a professional ,
but that doesn 't guarantee anything
no ,
and it really ,
like you said , always takes way longer than anyone , um , is able to guess , because i know my husband he , he painted , when he ,
it was just the preparation time was so long .
right .
that when he actually got down to the painting part ,
he , it was like ten times longer than he already thought he would be done ,
and , and , uh , he did part of the , in the , at night because we were trying to hurry up and get it ready so we could move in ,
and , um , and he didn 't notice until the next morning that the shades of paint between the two paint cans , he had finished one can off and started another one .
oh , no .
and then we went in there , you know , one was , bu -,
they were white ,
but one had more blue to it .
oh , and that can make a difference ,
uh -huh .
too .
uh -huh .
i mean , and they bring the , uh , you know , little samples and you 've got like maybe , five hundred ,
well that 's an exaggeration ,
but there are just so many tints upon tints upon tints ,
and you don 't know what you to want to ,
put up there ,
and by the time it 's on , i , i
selected a , what i thought was white ,
uh -huh .
and it was like you said , you know , it was blue blue cast to it .
uh -huh .
and it looked awful on
so that was the next problem .
he had to redo that too .
i
yeah .
this was a ,
and it was a major project getting the money together to do it too , by the end ,
right .
of the whole project ,
but , you know , we worked something out , because he was kind of apologetic that it took so long .
he really came over here to paint , i think , because he kept offering to paint the outside of my house
i don 't think he did the interiors very well
oh , boy .
and , yeah .
well , i don 't recall my parents having that much trouble
no
i mean , you know , they painted our rooms all the time ,
and we had a , a wooden ,
we hardly ,
uh -huh .
we just had brick on like as accent on a certain area of our home growing up ,
and so he had to paint the outside all the time .
and , um , i just don 't think , you know , that there was that big problem
it wasn 't a big deal for them .
no ,
i don 't know .
but to us , you know ,
we 're going , oh , we 're so glad we have a brick home , all we have is like trim around the windows or something ,
i think my husband 's really glad about that
for sure .
and no , uh no painting to have to do .
i , i don 't know that w -,
like , uh , say , we 're freshly graduated from school and things ,
so we haven 't gotten to the point where we 're hiring professionals to do too much of our needs .
you just , you just get in there and do it yourself .
we 've been trying ,
yeah .
you know , we 've done that the whole time we were in school . like ,
uh -huh .
trying to repair our own cars ,
and ,
yeah .
so i , i want to get to the point where i could feel like i could just hire someone
well , it 's , it 's not that easy .
it 's like , it 's , uh ,
i don 't even know if i , you know , i would not even recommend this person again to anybody .
i don 't know .
uh -huh .
a ,
i guess you ge -,
i , i don 't know if you get into the mind set where you just say , well , i 'll accept something , or you just really have to get on their back , i mean ,
uh -huh .
about things and , and working with what they say are professional painters .
i mean ,
i tell you what , the fumes that the , the paint gives off makes you wonder what these people do any -,
that 's true .
i mean the fumes are amazing ,
and i , i don 't think i could stay sane ,
you know
no .
and working with all that .
so , i mean , i know it 's not lead based any more , paints ,
but ,
but , still ,
my goodness
it 's harmful ,
i ,
well , yeah ,
i , think so
and they have to live with that every day in , in their clothes and everything .
oh , it does .
the only painting job that was really painless for us was in this condominium that the , um , association that manages it , they have to take care of like the structural damage .
there was a roof leak ,
and that was not something that we had to pay for .
so they sent their painters in to , to repaint a corner of the ceiling and then , you know , repaint the whole ceiling ,
oh .
in a certain room .
yeah .
but they came in , and , um , they came in and did it and left in just no time at all ,
and i think it 's because they , you know , they were accustomed to working in that environment , in those particular condominiums ,
and i don 't , i didn 't watch them ,
but i couldn 't imagine that they came in and painted it , the whole ceiling , you know , just within a couple of hours .
right
and , uh
well , maybe there are some professionals out there
it makes you wonder
uh -huh .
really , it does ,
uh , for all that .
um .
well , um , i hope you have a nice day today .
well , you too ,
and you take care .
i guess it 's ge -, getting to be lunch time ,
i need to go take care of the kids
but ,
okay .
you have a good day .
okay .
bye , kay .
bye .
well a lot of women are knowl -, as knowledge about football as i am .
can i guess your favorite team , if you had one , might be the steelers .
yes ,
uh -huh .
well , i can understand that .
i , you know , i kind of like the cowboys , too .
 do you ? 
 they 've had  some great games in the past .
uh -huh ,
i , i always enjoy watching the stal -, the , dallas and pittsburgh together .
uh -huh ,
me too .
you know .
it wasn 't nearly as much fun when bradshaw was playing for you guys , i 'll tell you .
he lives in the dallas area now , as a matter of fact .
does he really ?
well , actually , it 's probably closer to fort worth ,
but it 's , it 's in the same area .
he bought , uh , bought a big horse farm out in a little town called roanoke , texas .
uh -huh .
but he pops up on the dallas scene quite often .
as a matter of fact , there was some talk about trying to get him involved with the team management in some sort of a coaching job .
oh , wo -,
i wonder if he 'd ever do that .
i don 't know ,
he 'd be good at it .
he 's such a motivator , he ,
 yes . 
 primarily ,  you know , with the quarterbacks .
 uh -huh . 
 that  would be his specialty .
i wished , i wished they could work something ,
i really like him .
i really do .
uh -huh .
well what about the houston oilers .
do you like them ?
yeah ,
okay ,
i 'd love to see dallas and houston play in a super bowl .
that would be really great .
uh -huh .
that may not ever happen ,
i don 't know .
 uh , houston  has had some wonderful talent , you know , down through the years
and in the earlier years they really had some super teams .
uh -huh .
and warren moon ,
 that 's right . 
 is , is  proving himself quite well right now .
he certainly is ,
he 's very good .
uh -huh .
he 's very good .
he 's one of the few , uh , black quarterbacks that there are .
that 's right .
randall cunningham was with philadelphia , i guess last year ,
but he 's no longer with the team .
so , you 're right ,
there are very few black quarterbacks , or at least that are starting anyway .
uh -huh .
how do you think the steelers are going to do this year .
you have any idea .
i don 't know ,
i hope they , they do better .
they , they
during the past couple of years they 've been doing a little bit better .
uh -huh .
but , uh , i think they still have a little , i think they 're still such a , a young team i think they still have a little bit to go before they reach the potential ,
 yeah . 
  that it did when ever bradshaw was playing .
oh , yeah ,
that was just such super team .
or , if they even reach that potential again , you know , they may never reach that again .
yeah .
well that 's a tough ,
it would be tough to do ,
it really would .
uh -huh .
they have such a super team for years , that won what , four super bowls ?
yeah ,
four in a row .
four in a row .
i don 't know if that could ever be duplicated again or not .
oh , i don 't know .
 yeah . 
 shooting  for one for the thumb now is what they were saying .
that 's right
and ,
but basically everyone that was on the team then is gone now ,
so .
that 's right .
i think mike webster was left
but then he , he just left .
uh -huh ,
yeah .
uh .
he may have been the last of the old guard ,
i don 't know .
yeah ,
i think he is ,
i think he was .
uh -huh ,
yeah ,
they had such a super team .
uh -huh .
have you been following the big draft that occurred yesterday ?
no ,
i didn 't .
i see .
huh -uh .
there 's quite a bit of activity now ,
of course they had so many , you know , nice , uh , choices because their record was so lousy the last few years .
they picked up ,
 uh . 
 you  know , quite a few of the ,
of course you never know .
the guys they pick , you know , m -, may never play a game .
you jus -, never know ,
it 's , it 's a gamble ,
it really is .
yeah ,
uh -huh .
they may get hurt , or , not be able to participate at that level , if you know ,
well who would you say is your favorite player , or has ever been your favorite player ?
ever been ?
uh -huh .
probably an old guy that played , probably before you were born
his name was sam huff .
he used to play for the new york giants .
oh .
that was one of the toughest guys that i 've ever seen in my life ,
 really . 
 as  far as , you know , dedication .
he just went all out every single play .
uh -huh .
of course , there have been some other great ones too , dick butkis , and bradshaw , you know ,
there 's been so many .
yeah ,
ye -,
but if i had to pick one , i would probably pick sam huff , as a matter of fact .
oh , you know , that 's really funny , um ,
well , i , i come from a large family
and , the -, there 's quite a few boys
so that 's kind of how i got in with the football .
either watch that or watch nothing .
that 's right .
and , um , at one time i could name all the players on the steelers , you know .
uh -huh .
and , but , even when bradshaw was playing , i , i don 't know , i , i didn 't particularly care for him ,
 uh -huh . 
 i  thought he was kind of cocky or something .
 he is ,
he is , 
 uh -huh . 
of course the -, a quarterback has a big ego .
yeah ,
uh -huh .
they really d -, they have to have ,
they can 't survive .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
they always think they can win , you know , which is the way it should be .
uh -huh .
boy , he never gave up , i 'll tell you .
yeah
him and franco harris ,
i really didn 't care for the either two of them .
 uh -huh ,
uh -huh , 
 i mean  they were good ,
but , i , you know , you couldn 't deny that .
 oh yeah . 
 but i  didn 't , i thought , you know , well i just didn 't really care for either one of them .
uh -huh .
uh , today , my favorites out of those guys were probably , um , lambert ,
uh -huh .
ham ,
 uh -huh . 
 and ,  uh , stallworth and swan .
uh -huh ,
absolutely ,
i can 't disagree with that .
they were super players ,
they really were .
uh -huh .
they really ,
 uh -huh . 
i , i , i like , not just with the pittsburgh , i like watching on saturday afternoons when they 'll have like the plays or the , the best plays from ,  you  know , from the week or something .
yeah ,
highlights , yeah .
yeah ,
i love watching that .
then i like watching their bloopers too , you know
yeah ,
yeah ,
that 's kind of funny too , as a matter of fact
some of them a , a bit embarrassing .
yeah ,
well they make mistakes too , i guess .
yeah ,
uh -huh ,
 absol -, 
 it 's  funny that more people don 't get hurt .
absolutely .
you know , especially , i would say the receivers ,
 uh -huh ,
oh they , 
 when they 're in  the air and they get tackled .
they take such a beating .
oh , yeah ,
it 's funny some of their necks don 't get broken .
absolutely ,
i don 't know how they do it .
it 's , it must just take a hundred percent concentration , i guess , because they know they 're going to get hit ,
it 's just a matter of how hard , you know , or where .
yeah .
an they have to be in ideal physical shape , basically .
oh , absolutely .
they look like sometimes they 're just broken in two like a match stem .
gosh , what a beating ,
they really do take a beating ,
they really do .
yeah .
well what did you think of , um . a couple years ago for the bears , the refrigerator .
i think he was just probably a passing phenomena , i think
i don 't know ,
i , i 'm knowing what , you know ,
of course , mike ditka was in dallas for years and years as coach , is knowing his , or , you know , knowing of his temperament , i 'm just surprised he ever , you know , kept the guy around ,
i really am .
he 's such a , he 's about a half hot head anyway , such a temper .
oh , you know , and to me he does , um , oh , he 's just so big and fat ,
 uh -huh . 
 he  doesn 't even look like he 's in shape .
he 's just so big , no one can move him .
that 's right , yeah ,
absolutely .
there 's just so much mass there , i guess they just can 't ,
i don 't know , you know ,
i ,
probably the guy is , you know , probably physically strong .
i , you know ,
obviously not very fast .
uh -huh .
but i guess it 's just , like you say , a mass that nobody can seem t -, to get out of the way .
as far as him scoring touch downs , you know , i think that was kind of weird .
i don 't know ,
dallas has a guy , uh , his name is nate newton ,
now he has a real weight problem too .
he fights it every single year ,
but , he manages to still keep playing ,
but ,
 yeah . 
 he  has a terrible weight problem .
wow .
they wa -,
the coaches watch him all year long .
they , they weigh him several times a year just to make sure he 's not , you know , completely out of control .
uh -huh .
but i guess most every team has so -, has someone like that ,
i don 't ,
oh , yeah ,
there 's , there are some really big guys playing in football .
absolutely they get bigger and bigger , it seems every year .
uh -huh .
i guess you have to to , you know , to stay in the game i guess .
yeah ,
you would , uh -huh .
yeah .
um , now who ,
would you say that you have a fav -,
i mean other than dallas , would you say that you have , uh , a favorite quarterback .
i mean the quarterback 's seem to get most of the , the attention , you know .
oh , yeah ,
sure ,
well , you 'd have to , uh , or i would have to say , you know , someone like montana , i guess , who 's done so well for so many years .
yeah ,
i re -, i , i enjoy watching him play .
yeah ,
his age is about to catch up with him though .
he 's no spring chicken anymore .
 no ,
but he 's still performing . 
 and like you say warren moon 's an excellent ,
warren moon 's an  excellent .
but he 's very exciting to watch .
yes he is ,
 uh -huh ,
sure . 
 i , i ,  i enjoy watching him also .
uh -huh ,
absolutely .
what about , uh , marino ?
uh , i 'm ,
obviously he 's a very good quarterback ,
i 'd , i never was , you know , too , a whole lot of , a big fan , you know .
i think he 'll get better as he gets older .
yeah ,
he may , uh -huh .
because he , he well wa -, he was the youngest quarterback there was , wasn 't he ?
yes
he was ,
i believe that 's right at one point in time .
ye -,
but he 's a very young fellow .
uh -huh .
yeah ,
of course a quarterback can look so good if he 's got a lot , if he 's got a good supporting cast , you know .
 that 's true ,
that 's true . 
 if not , he gets  beat to death like poor old troy aikman has the last couple of years anyway ,
you kno -,
we -,
dallas did better last year ,
hopefully they 'll do better this year .
to someone else in the room >>. uh , probably around twelve , uh -huh .
yeah ,
uh , i didn 't , i don 't know ,
i , i just think , you know marino will get better
and , uh , his team 's not as good as what it was when he went to the super bowl ,
 that 's right . 
 you know ,
 so .
yeah ,
miami 's had some down years , too .
yeah .
but they all do , i guess ,
it 's , it 's cyclical , i guess .
uh -huh .
as the players get older , get slower .
yeah
that 's true ,
ye -,
and with age comes ,
 yeah ,
with
yeah , 
 you know ,
the ,  the
i 'm sure arthritis sets in with them ,
oh yes ,  very much so . 
 you know . 
hip injuries and things like that , yeah .
right ,
yeah .
yeah ,
that , that forces a lot of the guys to get out of the game .
uh -huh ,
and they 're so young ,
 that 's right . 
 but , they 're  retired , you know ,
and their so young still .
