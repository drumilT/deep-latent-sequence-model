uh -huh ,
yeah ,
i read not too long ago that the average , professional career only lasts seven years .
oh .
when you think about it , that 's really not a very long time , of course .
yeah ,
then you think about how many have been in there longer than that .
if the average is seven years that means a lot of guys don 't make it seven years ,
yeah ,
a lot of them would have to get out in just a couple .
that 's right , yeah ,  ]
that 's ri -,
holy smokes , that doesn 't seem like very long .
that 's a pretty short career on average .
uh -huh .
of course they play their , cards right and do some good investments , they 'll do all right .
uh -huh .
a lot of them don 't , unfortunately .
yeah .
what do you think of the , l a raiders ,
used to the oakland ?
yeah ,
they 're always branded , as a bunch of outlaws
None
 if their , arrest record won 't let them play anywhere else , they seem to go to the raiders .
  that just may be , perceived ,
perception ,
i don 't know .
 yeah . 
 al  davis he 's a kind of strange character , strange looking guy .
apparently he 's kind of a wild guy ,
i don 't really know for sure .
they 've had some excellent teams , though , obviously .
yes ,
they have .
i 'm not sure they 've yet decided where they want to play ,
they keeping talk about , going ,
okay .
okay .
i 'm not exactly sure
i wasn 't really , paying attention as to what particular , parts of capital punishment we 're supposed to talk about ,
it was , basically what 's your views on , whether you thought there was certain cases that should be used , that sort of thing ?
yeah .
right .
i don 't know ,
uh -huh .
i 've always thought that any , crime that , intentionally where someone goes out and premeditatively takes another life would be the ones where i think that capital punishment would be necessary to keep that person from perhaps , doing it again , and even more so to get people on the outside who are professionals to realize that , there 's a very steep penalty to , be paid when that 's done ,
yeah ,
how do you feel about it ?
i believe in it , too
uh -huh .
i 'm catholic
we 're not supposed to ,
i feel that it ,
like you ,
uh -huh .
on the premeditated murders i feel if it 's beyond a doubt that you did it , i would say go ahead and execute that person as well .
uh -huh .
it 's the cases , like sometimes you , you hear of people that they say they went to jail falsely ,
they really didn 't do it .
you got that point well , what if a mistake is made and you put someone , to death that really didn 't do it .
right ,
exactly .
there 's always that chance ,
i don 't know ,
i would say that , for that many people to all of them agree that you did it and it was premeditated , it would be kind of hard for ,
uh -huh .
you know what i 'm saying ?
None
right .
if the   evidence wasn 't overwhelming , right ?
yeah .
uh -huh .
i ,
i think that should be likewise decided by the jury , because , i don 't know , i think a jury would be less likely to just send a man to death just for , any reason ,
 uh -huh . 
 i  don 't know a judge might be a little more cold -blooded about it .
exactly .
i 'm not sure about pennsylvania , whether we have it or not .
for some reason i was thinking that we do ,
it 's not very often .
yeah ,
i don 't think we ,
i think maybe last year was the first time in like eighteen years or something like that , that anyone from pennsylvania had gotten it .
i don 't ,
do you know if virginia has it ?
no ,
huh -uh .
no
we don 't .
uh -huh .
yeah .
i know florida has it .
uh -huh .
yeah
they 're always   in florida .
florida and louisiana , i think , and , some of the ,
 uh -huh . 
 other  southern states .
yeah .
course they have such a crime problem because they have such a unemployment rate .
None
get that unemployment way up
then people , tend towards crime ,
they start stiffening the penalties .
yeah .
it 's funny that ,
i said i think last year was the first time in like eighteen years for pennsylvania .
i 'm not even sure of that ,
for some reason i think that , it was something like that .
it surprised ,
even florida , i know they have it ,
you don 't really hear about it real often , how many people ,
in florida seems like , two or three times a year .
it 's constantly on the ,
yeah ,
you think that ,
if you think of how many premeditated murders are committed ,
 yeah . 
 compared to that and to how many people are being sent , that doesn 't seem like very many .
no ,
that 's true .
course they have a requirement that every single appeal must be permitted .
yeah .
of course , the attorneys ,
 everyone would appeal . 
 take them through  the whole chain .
that 's true , too .
even if the case is open and closed ,
they go all the way up to the supreme court ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
they almost always get thrown right back out again ,
they have to have every single appeal made open to them .
it 's sort of strange because it almost seems like the attorneys are doing it for the money or something because , the guy knows that , whether it 's , a month or two , or six years , he 's still going to get , the chair when it comes around
uh -huh .
None
yeah .
some of these guys are really , violent son of sam killers and stuff like that ,
yeah ,
uh -huh .
they ,
 they get out . 
 everyone knows they 're  not going to get out .
yeah ,
they get out in three years on probation ,
 yeah . 
  they do it again ,
uh -huh .
it 's like a slap on the fingers for them .
uh -huh .
i don 't ,
i think that it should be ,
if it 's beyond a doubt that someone did premeditate a murder , then i think , that someone should take their life also .
would you draw the line there with just the premeditated murder ?
i think so .
yeah .
a lot of the other violent crimes i don 't really feel that strongly about .
although , stiffer sentences and lessening the effects of parole ,
 uh -huh . 
 these guys are certainly not going to , be ,
they can 't ,
they 're getting into drugs and fights and all that stuff in prison .
i don 't think the parole system is really helping that much
yeah .
reduce the violence in the prisons .
uh -huh .
yeah .
i think that 's its only purpose is , to reduce , the violence in the prisons so people behave themselves a little bit better if they think they 're going to get off earlier .
some of these guys just don 't care ,
None
None
i think some of them would rather be in jail
yeah ,
right ,
uh -huh .
yeah .
they probably have it better in jail than what they would out in the streets .
that 's possible i guess .
i don 't know ,
i was just going to say something ,
i forgot what it was .
i don 't even remember what it was now .
where do you live in pennsylvania ?
in clarion .
i live in butler ,
i 'm at college .
i 'm at clarion university .
okay .
i don 't think i really know that .
yeah
because ,
that all depends , too , on where you are at .
uh -huh .
that 's , sort of interesting to get opinions as to where different parts of the country are . because the more grass root parts of the country tend to support capital punishment , where the places that are , less in contact with crime the more urban , less ,
yeah ,
okay ,
i 'm in kind ,
okay ,
we only have seven thousand students in the entire campus .
uh -huh .
yeah ,
that would be pushing it .
this is definitely a college town .
we 're about two hours north of pittsburgh if that would help you out any .
two hours where ?
north of pittsburgh , pennsylvania .
okay .
near polk ?
i 've never heard of polk
None
polk institute .
it 's , an old , university that turned into a place for the mentally retarded .
i never heard of that .
very old , historical place there .
it might have a new name .
sharon , pennsylvania 's up there .
yeah ,
yeah .
yeah .
we 're probably about an hour away from sharon .
okay .
uh -huh .
i ,
most of the kids here , i ,
just from dorm mates and stuff , they 'll say that they don 't believe in it ,
then after i would say my point of view , then they 'll say , yeah ,
da -,
in that case , maybe ,
yeah .
i think people can be persuaded one way or another .
i 've never seriously ran into someone , other than my priest , who definitely says you can 't take anyone 's life .
anyone that is so against it that you couldn 't persuade them in any instance .
right .
that 's true .
yeah ,
it ,
you get certain circumstances where you hear about these people that have , stolen kids and ,
 uh -huh . 
 done  terrible things to them and killed them and , that sort of thing ,
you just
i don 't want that person sharing the earth with me ,
exac -,
yeah
that is just terrible .
uh -huh .
we had a case like that here
on the other hand , people are saying that because the criminals know that the , penalties can be very severe ,
they ,
there 's less criminals that are , turning themselves in , or , pleading whatever , because they know that the judge , if they find them guilty has the opportunity to sentence them , for the death sentence .
yeah ,
i look at that and say , they should have thought about that beforehand .
yeah .
None
i 'm just saying that , that 's what , the client , lawyers are saying .
uh -huh .
they 're saying that , more of my clients would have pleaded guilty if they would have gotten a light sentence instead of possibly having to get a death sentence because you can 't plea bargain what the sentence is going to be .
uh -huh .
you can plea bargain what you 're guilty of ,
yeah .
but not how they 're going to  sentence you   ,
that 's something ,
whether they plea bargain or not , if they 're guilty of murder , they 're guilty of murder ,
right ,
uh -huh .
i don 't think that they deserve anything less
yeah ,
right .
it 's just ,
i don 't know ,
i just
uh -huh .
i was just saying that way ,
what they 're saying is that they can 't get people to turn themselves in then .
we have to go through a trial then to prove the person 's guilty .
uh -huh ,
that costs money , yeah .
perhaps we can
perhaps we can 't
the guy might get off .
uh -huh .
although usually the guys that are turning themselves in are guys that are , going to get caught anyways
None
there 's always a few of those people that lost their head or whatever .
yeah .
yeah ,
we just had a terrible case in virginia where some girl disappeared
the guy , like i said , he just , said that he took her ,
he won 't admit that she died or whatever ,
he won 't say where the body is because he knows the penalty 's mandatory life sentences for murder .
okay ,
what do you read ?
i read everything , i guess ,
wh -,
what is your favorite ?
i like all kinds ,
in fact i was just reading , a magazine now . an automobile magazine .
i like historical , books , time magazine , newspaper , how to do it type things ,

uh -huh .
i have read some of that .
i did not ,

is very interesting , without question .
uh -huh .
i do not really know that they have the answers in those books .
yes .
they , make conclusions in them that may or may not be true .
oh .
they are very interesting .
uh -huh .
that , they have ,
what they have discovered .
i like far out facts or whatever .
yeah .
i like to read stuff like that .
i am a superficial buff .
i cannot  take a day  i just ,
you are what kind of buff ?
superficial ,
okay .
i like it if it is fun .
i do not get too into it .
yeah .
right .
yeah .
i am kind of a hobbyist
i read all those things that ,
being an engineer , all those books that would bore everybody else , how to do things .
uh -huh .
yeah .
None
i am one of those crazy people that reads the directions .
it always make my wife mad .
i ,
because you read it
when she ever there is something , i say , have you read the directions ?
another  "no ,
i hate reading the directions ."
you are an engineer ?
i say , engineers , we are the few people in the world that read the directions . yeah  ]

yeah .
okay ,
i worked at t i for a little while .
uh -huh .
we have got a book that says , how do they do that ?
yeah .
it answers everything .

not everything
a lot of silly little questions .
yeah .

like what makes a firefly light ,
None
None
yeah .
those are , interesting .
you like science things ?
i have not gotten them in a long time .
what is that , one that is on t v ?
that book , national geographic is really a fascinating book ,
None
if you ever get those
e -,
yeah ,
uh -huh .
that , do not ,
i have not gotten them in years ,
they were kind of expensive .
i know people just collect them like they are ,
yeah .
None
yeah .
they have wonderful photographs and just amazing photographs that they have done .
we used ,
my little sister was blind and going to school ,
she would have to come home at night , cut out different ,
she was not fully blind , just legally blind .
yeah .
she would have to cut out different colors ,
it is .
that is the best book to go through , those national geographic .
it is .
they ,
they are great .
the photographers just got fantastic pictures in those things .
i do like national geographic and stuff . because like i said , i like reading about , i don 't know , animals .
i love reading about animals .
uh -huh .
the gorillas and stuff .
yeah .
the sloth , it fascinates me .
that 's something moves that slow
yeah .
it is just weird .
i have not ,
of course , was it all books and things
was it any ,
did it say anything about newspapers ?
i have forgotten what the question was exactly .
None
None
what do you read , i guess , in general ?
None
yeah .
we can talk about anything we want .
yeah .
i glance at all newspapers .
i do like ,
since the re -, since the economy is doing so bad , i never have read the , financial pages more often than now , and trying to analyze and look for some good news in , in there ,
to see if the ,
for me there is no imme -,
wh -,
the financial pages does not hit me directly . which i am sure it does if i get into it .
like i said , i do not keep up on all that .
i have only been more interested because of things are doing so bad and everything .
yeah .
the ,
i thought see if there is anything in there that , would be positive ,
yeah .
you always look for things with this terrible recession that we are in ,
to see if there is any go -,
with everything going down ?
yeah ,
yeah .
it is ,
hopefully , we will recover here ,
yeah ,
i know i heard bush say that , we are bottoming out seem to be .
yeah .
that is bush saying that
yeah .
right
he ,
yeah ,
i know ,
i do not really know if , any one person knows ,
what some of the problems are .
there are some interesting things in the paper ,
yeah .
i like ann landers
yeah
no .
i like getting the paper and reading the want ads
just ,
i do skim over it .
it ,
mainly i am a front page person .
i do not go into the details .
yeah .
no ,
i glance at it .
i
with the , so much ,
you sound like you have a family too .
with a family and everything , there is just so much going on that i am more of a r -,
not more of a radio buff
it is easier to do when i do some chores ,
or yard work or anything , put the radio on and listen to that .
None
None
i know at t i they have most of the stuff on the printout , don 't they ? on the computer where you can read the daily news ?
yeah .
i do ,
every time i come in , i will punch up ,
they call it t news and all that .
uh -huh .
i do get ,
it gets a little bit of everything .
even the last page , is sport , listings and different things . and world news ,
uh -huh .
None
yeah .
when i wor -,
you can read it in one minute ,
None
when i worked at t i , i read that more than i read the regular newspaper .
uh -huh .
because i would read that every day because you would find ten minutes here that you do not have anything to do .
i know you do , being an engineer .
yeah .
there are some times when you have got ten or fifteen or even an hour off
yeah .
not much ,
not in the area i worked in
we had an engineer in there every ten minutes .
yeah ,
yeah .
None
yeah .
it is , interesting , with the computer to read the computer news and ,
all that .
i guess that is a source of reading .
i hadn 't thought about that in that respect ,
yeah .
it just encouraged me to read it .
yeah ,
yeah .
it does have a good , simple ,
again you can read it in a lot less than ten minutes .
it is usually ,
uh -huh .
you can page through it in ,
yeah .
i do not read everything on ,
some of the stuff is pretty boring .
i skip over some of that .
None
uh -huh .
it is ,
that is me with the newspaper .
yeah .
especially financial page .
yeah ,
yeah .
i do not ,
None
i read it so less
i watch so little t v , i did not even know what the deal was with this ,
i cannot remember his name now .
him and his wife are getting divorced ,
he is tycoon or something .
yeah .
what is his name ?
trump .
donald trump .
yeah .
yeah .
trump .
i still do not know what the whole deal was with that .
i guess because he was so rich ,
when you are that rich , you always get into the paper , whatever , if you have a family problem , whatever .
oh
he had a young girlfriend .
he is well into his forties ,
i guess he got a young girlfriend who ,
every time you take ,
you are that rich , you just get , in the news immediately ,
yeah .
immediately .
which is tough .
that is all it was ?
he was just having an affair on his wife ?
that
his business is going down the tubes so bad ,
None
he was , essentially like you said , a tycoon .
donald trump had it all .
he was high roller for about ten years ,
he is now , essentially bankrupt ,
oh .
h -,
yeah .
that has got to be hard to go from really rich to poor .
yeah .
which i am sure he ain 't poor .
no ,
right ,
who knows ,
what he has really got .
he was kind of an arrogant guy ,
i think the newsmen , enjoyed , writing about him on his way down ,
yeah .
his wife seemed to be very smart . and actually running some of his business .
she was actually somewhat of a business partner of his , did very well .
None
ivana trump ,
yeah ,
they have been on all the news and everything . in the papers and , on barbara walters and everything else .
that is like i said . i do not watch much t v any more either .
None
i have got three kids
yeah .
i can imagine .
it is hard to watch t v .
right ,
yeah .
except for donald duck .
i know what you mean , really .
i have enjoyed talking to you .
okay .
yeah ,
hang in there .
good luck with those kids .
yeah .
have a good holiday .
right .
bye -bye .
bye -bye .
basically , my husband and myself use the credit cards in regards to major purchases .
we really don 't get into small little purchases .
if we 're going to purchase something quite large we might put it on a credit card ,
other than that it 's not something that we use a lot of .
we may have only two or three versus , i know a lot of people have up to a half a dozen or , up to a dozen credit cards ,
ours are just major credit cards that we have and , use only when we feel it 's necessary to make a big purchase .
yeah ,
yeah .
is that like visa and mastercard .
yeah .
do you have department store credit cards too ,
None
yeah ,
one sears .
uh -huh .
sears is pretty major with us simply because we do ,
appliances .
appliances and things like that
they 're real good with their appliance and stuff like that
None
yeah .
we try to avoid them with a passion because of the percent of interest rate .
if you 've got the cash to pay for something , it 's better to do it that way than versus credit cards , unless it 's a small enough sum that you can do it within a two , three month period ,
yeah .
right
if it 's , any large purchases , you 've got to kind of think about , how much you 're going to put down as far as , payments on it so that you 're not getting eighteen percent or twenty percent interest taken off ,
None
my husband and i do basically the same thing ,
we end up sneaking a few in there that surprise us .
uh -huh .
yeah .
we still pay it off every month if it kills us
yeah ,
yeah .
we do it mainly for , the cash flow ,
what is that , float .
that 's the word , float .
uh -huh .
sure ,
sure .
uh -huh .
i often will keep track of what i 've charged and sometimes deduct it from my checkbook already .
sure ,
you know .
sometimes just ,
sure .
keep a list and make sure i don 't go over a certain limit .
yeah .
especially around birthdays ,
exactly .
oh .
exactly
if we go out to a restaurant , just to float it ,
i don 't know .
yeah .
yes ,
my husband has a ,
if it 's a business transaction a lot of times that 's important , too to keep a better receipt of it .
yeah .
anytime like a plane ticket , or ,
uh -huh .
even if we have the ,
i 'm sure we 'd have the cash before we got it ,
uh -huh .
sure .
sure .
for the month or whatever .
yeah .
the float for more than a hundred dollars seems real nice for that thirty days or whatever .
exactly .
None
we have a new one from a t and t
we haven 't used that one too much
uh -huh ,
yeah .
be interesting ,
that 's nice , because you can use it for a calling card also .
exactly ,
sure .
it 's a mastercard , too ,
None
sure ,
yeah .
it 's kind of fun ,
you get a lot of junk mail about them .
yeah
you always get these preapproved , credit card things coming through ,
your credit is great ,
let 's send you another credit card
yeah ,
it 's preapproved for ,
you 're such a wonderful person
that 's to entice you to get more credit cards .
yeah .
we 'll give you five thousand dollars up front
we always laugh about that because it 's quite a bit
you always constantly getting those preapproved stuff ,
None
right .
do you have , an annual fee on yours
do you get yours through a bank
None
ours is through a bank , yeah .  ]
yeah .
we had it a long time ago through a bank
it just a
None
yeah .
i can 't see paying an annual fee for it .
i almost
you 're already paying them , if you don 't pay it off within that month , interest , anyway ,
yeah ,
that 's exactly it
None
yeah .
okay .
it sounds like i 'm being paged otherwise .
okay .
None
all right ,
thanks a lot .
good talking to you .
bye now .
okay .
did you want me to go ahead ?
i 'll let you go ahead and start , yeah .
okay .
one thing ,
i guess both of us are very much aware of the equality .
it seems like women are , just starting to really get some kind of equality not only in , jobs but in the home where husbands are starting to help out a lot more than they ever did .
it 's not uncommon to see men doing dishes , making supper , or taking care of the kids
som -,
the generation of my parents and my great grandmother they did everything .
they went to work
they took care of the family ,
None
i think that 's changed just in the last generation .
exactly .
just in the last little while . because i know my father -in -law doesn 't do that much ,
exactly .
yeah .
of that kind of stuff
my husband is wonderful .
yeah ,
that 's the way my husband is too .
it doesn 't bother him at all to do the dishes .
yeah .
it doesn 't bother him at all to do the laundry verses , men from way back .
there is that ,
if you did that you were henpecked or whatever .
None
yeah ,
yeah .
men are starting ,
there are still some that aren 't cooperating
None
yeah ,
those are very few .
i think those men don 't last very long in relationships because i think women know what they want .
they 're not accepting that anymore .
right ,
exactly .
yeah .
it 's hard enough to be a woman out there trying to do everything , and then kind of real light pay .
there 's just no way that we can be happy trying to do it all .
it 's kind of a , neat thing to see as far as equality in the households ,
i think that 's even going to get better .
yeah .
even more so .
i think it 's just going to be where men will do as much cleaning as women do and that it won 't be your job description instead of your role definition is this .
it will be ,
hopefully for my daughter who i instill into , it doesn 't matter if you want to drive a truck , honey ,
it doesn 't matter if you want to be a nurse ,
it doesn 't matter if you want to be , the president ,
it doesn 't matter if you want to be a lawyer or a doctor ,
it doesn 't matter .
it 's what you want to be .
i have always instilled into her ,
i think mothers , are doing a really good job in raising their daughters to say , hey , you don 't have to stay with nursing ,
you don 't have to be a secretary ,
you don 't have to be ,
you can be whatever you want to be . whether it be a welder or trucker or whatever
yeah .
as long as you , go to school for it and get the education ,
None
yeah .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
if they want to , right .
i feel like , to an extent that , it is important for women who need to work or are in a position that they want to that they can do that .
uh -huh .
i also think it is important for them to be with the children .
i do too .
there 's a certain part of me ,
i think there are some things that women just are designed to do better than men .
uh -huh .
there are some things that men are designed to do better than women .
yeah .
i don 't think it should ever be totally equal .
yeah .
you know that 's not ,
we 're not made like that .
emotionally i think ,
that 's right .
women do a little bit ,
i think the gap is coming closer as , what i 've learned in , just being out there .
it seems that men are now starting to get into groups called men 's gatherings ,
they get together
they talk about issues of marriage , talk about manhood , talk about what they didn 't have with their fathers .
None
are expressing more emotions , learning what emotions are .
it may be in the future that some men may be better parent or mothers than mothers themselves .
yeah .
i know of some mothers that i guess i 'd rather be with the father because the father is maybe more understanding , more , low key , more apt to be a better father than some mothers that i have seen that have been raised , to develop whatever skills that they have ,
some of the men are developing , very good too .
None
yeah .
it may come down to where it 's individual basis . where everybody is treated an as individual ,
yeah .
and not by sex .
if you want to stay home and take care of the kids , honey , that 's fine .
i will go out and take care of the , money making .
it wouldn 't matter if it 's a woman or a man saying that .
on one income ,
uh -huh .
one of the frustrations that i have with the way things have developed is that , it 's difficult for a family to make a living on one income .
it can be done ,
yeah .
you make sacrifices .
yeah ,
that ,
it 's ,
kind of like what , my husband and myself are doing right now .
my daughter 's three , even though at this current time she 's ready to get involved with ,
she 's an only child .
i don 't know ,
 yeah . 
 if you 've  only got one ,
all righty .
okay .
what type of home do you have in dallas ?
we have a , four bedroom split brick home in richardson
uh -huh .
we bought it back in about nineteen seventy -three .
we 've seen it go up in value wise real well
good
yes
it 's probably typical of your neighborhood .
yes ,
yes .
it looks like all the others .
it 's ,
i 'm in plano just , north of where you live .
uh -huh .
we live near coit and legacy in a relatively new development that just has gone in about two years ago .
i know where that is . yeah .  ]
my home is typical .
it 's a brick home .
a two story brick home ,
it 's typical of the other homes in our neighborhood too .
yes ,
you 're in the styles that they have started building in the last couple years with the real high ceilings ,
yes .
uh -huh .
those are lovely .
yes .
the one thing we did do instead of having a twenty foot living room ceiling ,
we 're from the north
we just couldn 't stand the wasted space ,
we had them ,
we have a high entry hall
we had them level off our living room and dining room ceiling to , nine feet so we could get bedrooms above .
oh .
nice .
that way we sort of have the entryway that looks typical of the area
we don 't have so much wasted space .
yes .
we could get more bedrooms per square foot that way .
have you , found in talking to your neighbors that your utilities are quite a bit higher with those high ceilings ?
mine are actually the lowest in the neighborhood .
are they ?
yeah .
uh -huh .
i would expect so .
i have wondered about the cooling and the heating .
yes .
especially the cooling .
right ,
i know .
our air conditioner , during the summer we ,
it 's over three fifty a month .
wow .
uh -huh .
yeah ,
just to air -condition it ,
None
how many bedrooms do you have in your home ?
i have , a master bedroom and a den on the main floor ,
upstairs i have three bedrooms
i have ,
i 'm a writer
i work in my home
None
uh -huh .
above the garage area i have a studio .
how nice .  ]
it 's not really a bedroom .
it doesn 't have a closet
uh -huh .
it 's the size of a three car garage .
that 's where i work .
that 's a pretty good size room .
yes ,
yes .
that 's neat .
we ,
this is our dream home ,
we just absolutely ,
love it .
i ,
it sounds like a real nice one .
yeah ,
we 're really proud of it .
i just hope we never have to move again .
this is al -,
right .
where did you move from ?
detroit this last time .
uh -huh .
we were there two years
None
uh -huh .
do you like the dallas area ?
we love it .
i would imagine that you have found that the homes  down here  are , a much better value down here ,
yes ,
they 're much ,
aren 't they , than they are ,
much better constructed down south than they are up north too .
really ?
the ,
that 's interesting .
uh -huh .
the quality of the workmanship , we noticed a tremendous difference .
up north they just kind of throw them together . because we had homes built in detroit also ,
uh -huh .
they just didn 't care .
if the trim work didn 't line up that 's just what you get
that 's interesting because i 've heard so many people down here say that they don 't feel like the quality of the homes , are that good down here .
oh .
that 's interesting .
yes .
the carpenter and painter and , everybody the marble man were just there in the house everyday when we would come to check on it as it was being built ,
they 'd say just look at this ,
None
they seemed so proud of everything they did .
that 's good .
it really made a difference to us .
i know as i said our house is about seventeen years old
we 've been very pleased with it .
we 've had no major problems with it .
knock on wood
yes .
it is with the , two children growing up and now three grandsons roaming through it ,
oh .
all the time .
we like our neighborhood .
it ,
yes .
has grown
the majority of the people , keep up the neighborhood .
uh -huh .
that 's important too .
that 's very important
as i said it has risen in value .
uh -huh .
we bought back when housing was so low ,
oh .
now i -, i -,
then it started jumping by leaps and bounds .
yes .
it seems to have leveled off and actually dropped back down a little bit ,
yeah ,
we 're still fine .
ours is pretty much level in the two years
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
that we 've been there .
we 're hoping it takes off again ,
yes
i don 't know with the e d s building and penny 's and everything going in up on legacy , we 're hoping that brings in more people .
it should bring up your property values a little bit .
that 's what we 're hoping because ,
your pricing .
we 're just real close to where that is .
uh -huh .
None
uh -huh .
i think once the economic situation in the dallas area improves , i think the housing will go up .
i hope so too .
right now there 's a lot on the market for sale because of people having lost their jobs ,
yes .
and everything
yeah .
that keeps prices down and value down
i 'm sure the  packs   , or
  would like for it to go up .
yes ,
i 'm sure
for that reason it can stay the same ,
that 's right
None
that 's right
we love being where we are .
okay .
basically i am a mother of a three year old ,
uh -huh .
right .
i kind of relate to trying to find a good day care because it 's , extremely hard thing to do to trust somebody else with your child , trust their emotional and their safety and all the rest of that .
i 've been pretty selective ,
what i 'm finding is with , day cares that are like day care centers like , for instance , learning tree or kinder care and all of that .
uh -huh .
what i find is that they 're highly structured , highly organized . almost too rigid for the children if you bring a child in at a certain time .
uh -huh .
like nap time or whatever time , because of parents ' hours they are differ -,
when i bring my daughter into such a system like that , they only have one thing going on
that 's nap time .
everybody is napping ,
uh -huh .
whether they came there an hour before or they came right during that time .
with that kind of a system my daughter just isn 't likely to enjoy it if she has to good there immediately and lay down ,
uh -huh .
on a cot .
home day care has been an option .
i 've looked into that .
the only thing is you raise the question of if it 's safe , can you trust the people ,
that 's right .
None
you never know .
i have , an ex -sister -in -law that ,
uh -huh .
currently has a child abuse case on a home baby -sitter .
sure .
sure .
sure .
that 's really scary .
None
uh -huh .
to the point that you kind of say to yourself , especially home day care
right .
i think center day cares there 's so many people coming in and out that you 're better off if you 're going to put a child into that type of system for eight hours , it 's fine .
it depends on the age of the child .
some children do real well that are at the age of four or five or children that have been in that kind of system for a while
right .
home day care works well if it 's an infant .
uh -huh .
if you want to have kind of a family structuring where there 's a home that they can be provided . because i 've seen things at the day care where they can 't keep up with all the kids .
the kids have ,
right .
colds
they 're sick all the time
the -,
okay ,
i don 't ,
do you have an opinion on that , on the u s r ?
the ,
i think i 'm skeptical about the whole thing . and still a little bit worried about them because of the history of russia .
uh -huh .
sure .
they 're in a state of flux right now changing a great deal primarily because of the economic distress .
uh -huh .
sure .
even in that situation , it seems to me from what i 've read in the history of russia and different authors , there has always been a paranoia
they 've always suspected everybody
sure .
that 's why they put a lot of people in prison for years and years ,
that 's why they put a lot of people to death .
sure ,
that happens .
yes ,
uh -huh .
stalin was a classical example i guess of that paranoia because he probably killed more russians than , the russian army killed anybody else .
sure .
i guess in particular my viewpoint is that they financially cannot go into a war .
they are desperate at this point in time to keep their country together ,
i could not foresee them severing what they have with the u s . because they need us at this current time because of their financial situation .
yeah .
from what i 've been hearing is the u s , s r has been , almost bankrupt for years it 's people are desperate ,
there might be a revolution within the people .
sure .
i don 't think the u s would get involved with it because , there 's too close of ties to where i think they understand that gorbachev is trying to make a change , and that we cannot run them like we run the u s and that they have to make their own independent decision .
i guess i really have no fear at all of the u s s r verses ,
you get these small little , places like iraq and all of that , that might be something that i 'd be more concerned about with nuclear weapons verses , as big country of u s s r .
i have no feelings that they would ever start a war with us because to them it would totally destroy their whole country because our technology is far advanced from what theirs is at this current time .
yeah .
sure
they have weapons to kill us over and over and over ,
to them that would be a suicide
they ,
the russian people are not suicidal type of people .
if you get the iraqis and iran which will do it for the country for the pleasure of , doing whatever , for their country , they 'll do it .
yeah ,
i think you 're right .
there 's a little more craziness down there
sure .
the russian people i think are not that much different from us .
you know i think
sure .
that it would be the leadership that i , mistrust .
uh -huh ,
sure .
i have a daughter that 's frustrated .
she 's on a stool that she can get up on yeah .
i -,
if she can 't get down on it it 's like , get me down right now
it was really good talking to you ,
you have a good weekend .
you too .
thank you .
uh -huh .
thank you .
bye now .
bye -bye .
okay ,
uh -huh .
as far as , universal health care i guess i 'm all for it .
i think it 's time that we start looking at , getting into that .
health cost has continued to rise
i think , there 's people that to me it 's the fundamental ,
life of a person .
it doesn 't matter if you have money or all the money in the world ,
you would ,
you should still be
everybody should be able to have surgeries that will save their lives or things that will make their life more comfortable verses than just the rich people that can afford to pay or to work for corporations that have wonderful health benefits .
i think if , they looked at it as a way of business helping out financially for universal health care and , individuals , helping out in some sort of way whether it be taxes or some how .
the expenses right now for health care , are just unreal .
they really are even when you 're not talking about surgery .
if you 're just talking about basic care ,
yes .
we 've got four children
uh -huh .
sure .
in the past month they pass things from one to one
your constantly ,
it just can devastate your budget ,
exactly .
None
yeah .
the only ,
i know a little bit about the , european , universal health care
there 's some pros and cons .
one of the things , of course , is everybody gets health care ,
sometimes health care , when you get into a universal system lacks in , what would be considered ,
how can i say it ?
over like in poland , where my father -in -law lived for years there their health care system is ,
no financial gains are available for doctors .
they may just go into being a doctor just clearly just to be a doctor for the full reason ,
most people that go in to being a physician here in the u s do it for financial gain .
yeah .
they say , jeez . if i get into this area of dermatology , i don 't have to do this ,
i can do this ,
i can ,
can still make big bucks
yeah ,
plastic surgery
if i become a , heart specialist i 'm going to make this kind of money ,
there 's , financial gains toward that .
in a universal system i don 't think there is a financial gain for the doctors .
do you think that the quality , it would would be as high ?
yeah .
the quality i think goes down . when you have a universal system .
yeah .
the only way they could do that is by having a real good quality check , and also offering some kind of ,
i think , anybody , likes the ability to kind of , get themselves financially , situated .
right .
i guess that 's the whole u s concept is to come here and ,
more motivation
yeah ,
i don 't know if you can have that with a universal system .
maybe , there 's a way of working that out ,
i know that in poland in particular the doctors just go to do their job and that 's it .
that 's what they look at it as .
yeah .
there 's no ,
that 's sad because if that 's the case , if doctors aren 't going in to be doctors to help people then maybe they shouldn 't be in that area anyway .
right .
yeah .
that might be one way of weeding out those that are greedy for the money and those that really want to help mankind .
that 's true .
yeah .
None
i ,
i think we have to head toward that way .
uh -huh .
we 're going to have to do something because there 's just too many people in the country that are uninsured you cannot ,
it 's just ,
i 'm worried when i get older .
sure .
let 's say for instance you , get maybe laid off from your job .
you no longer have insurance .
right .
uh -huh .
you 're sixty some or fifty some years old you try to find insurance .
yeah .
i mean you 're uninsurable .
that 's right .
unless you want to pay five hundred , six hundred dollars a month
i know people that are paying two hundred , three hundred dollars a month for insurance .
yeah .
how they can do it i have no idea .
i know working for small corporations
health insurance , myself , it would cost for a family
this was back three , four years ago to put my entire family up
this was working for like a med center , health plan .
it was like eighty dollars out of my paycheck .
yeah .
None
ours is three hundred for our family
we pay that instead of a car payment .
None
None
yeah .
i 'm driving a piece of junk ,
we do the same .
it 's ,
i think , people are changing their viewpoints of ,
it 's getting harder and harder to survive .
right .
right .
that 's why , if they don 't go to a universal system , something is going to happen .
yeah .
we 're going to have , a larger amount of people dying .
okay ,
what do you all do for camping ?
we don 't do so much now ,
uh -huh .
when , i was , a child , we went regular old camping , tents and everything like that .
with our children , we had a pop up tent camper .
uh -huh .
we used that to go camping .
where do you go ?
years ago we lived in oklahoma
oh .
uh -huh .
we went to , lake murray all the time .
when we did it with our children , we lived in , tennessee
oh .
we went up to the smokeys . which was just absolutely fantastic .
i bet it was .
uh -huh .
around gatlinburg , or somewhere up in there ?
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
None
along the ,
uh -huh .
there 's a ridge that goes down from tennessee through , georgia and into alabama
i think it was called , white cloud or white mountain .
and went up on it .
did you all sleep in sleeping bags
did it get real cold at night ,
None
it got real cold ,
yeah .
the , camper had , beds in it , when we had that one ,
we had our bedding .
we didn 't have to go with sleeping bags .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
the when i was a teenager and growing up , that was sleeping bags and joining blankets and sleeping on ledges or , ground
that got kind of rough sometimes
we only did that once .
since we 've been married , we go real often to colorado to the mountains ,
do you ?
we 'll stay in cabins .
uh -huh .
and , call that going camping ,
we 're really not .
the one time that i did go camping when i was about , i guess sixteen or seventeen with my family ,
we drove up by cosa springs , colorado .
uh -huh .
and went back seventeen miles back in the back where you couldn 't even get a forest ranger if you tried to the tent for a week .
oh .
at night it was so cold , you thought you 'd never feel your ,
feet again .
the smell ,
the stars were just five feet above you .
they were just right there .
just beautiful .
it was the most bonding , most wonderful time .
we enjoyed it .
yes .
about the fourth day , i thought , if i don 't get a hot tub and shave my legs , i 'm going to die
yes ,
i understand that
i got enough of it right then .
when we can go to a cabin as long as we 've got running water i 'm a little bit better off .
yeah my husband and i , he says his idea now of roughing it is the regency hyatt .
 i know that 
i agree with him .
i agree with him , too .
our children are grown ,
that 's true .
i know that we liked it when our kids were teenagers because we got away from the t v and the phone .
uh -huh .
we got just strictly by ourselves .
we ,
some of the time we would not allow them to take friends along so that it was just the four of us .
uh -huh .
that 's ,
we could , get back in touch with each other
they can 't believe that they could survive it .
i know .
once they 're there they think it 's kind of cool .
i know .
yeah .
they just thoroughly
yeah .
enjoyed it .
we would hike all day .
uh -huh .
yes ,
yes .
mom did the whole , pork and beans and , the slice the potatoes and fry them outside and all the little stuff that we just were so amazed that she knew how to do
couldn 't believe ,
yes ,
yeah ,
with bacon .
i know that , breakfast , we 'd have these big breakfasts cooked over this little coleman stove
None
yeah .
yes ,
it would just absolutely taste wonderful .
yes
daddy would always try to prove he could catch fish for breakfast we usually had a bite apiece
one .
one ,
yes ,
yes .
one .
my goodness .
i know that as a teenager growing up and going to lake murray , there would be maybe twenty , twenty -five of us because it would be all of my mother 's family , and all my cousins .
it ,
is that hot camping .
is that where you 're hot , like on a beach ,
is that ,
no .
a lot of our friends will ,
we were in the woods ,
a lot of our friends will go to east texas in the summer and camp
i 'm thinking , how could you stand it ,
you ,
we didn 't notice it back then ,
yeah .
yeah .
that was back before air -conditioning was so prevalent and all .
yeah ,
yeah ,
that 's true .
we didn 't ,
it always rained on us .
i don 't care what weekend ,
we went and when it was , it always rained on us .
i like that ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
especially in the tent every afternoon it would rain you would get your book and just kind of cuddle up .
cuddle up , uh -huh .
i thought that was fun .
i don 't know ,
i remember one time , some cousins were in a tent
it was married cousins ,
they had the tent
this , frog strangler that we used to call them ,
came through
they had put their tent over kind of ,
i don 't know what ,
it wasn 't a creek bed ,
uh -huh .
it was kind of like a little , little , gully or trench or something ,
the water rushed down
no .
they said they looked down and there went bud 's boots
None
no
there went several things floating down this water ,
we just used to have balls .
golly
it was more fun .
as i said , it just rained every time .
None
my folks had a cabin at one time at lake tenkiller
we went up there ,
it was never quite the same thing .
yeah .
None
yeah ,
i understand that , too , because some of the places we ,
in fact , the more urban we get with the television and the cabin and the whole bit , it loses it 's flavor .
yes ,
yes ,
it does .
None
it really does .
i 've gotten in the mood to go now
yeah
yeah ,
even i would kind of like to go .
yeah
i ,
i know if i go home and say , let 's go camping , my husband says , you 're crazy
you 're crazy
listen , i enjoyed talking with you .
i enjoyed talking to you , too .
okay .
have a good day .
thank you .
bye -bye .
bye -bye .
any vacations recently that you would highly  recommend ? 
  that is like my favorite hobby
really ?
yeah ,
i would travel everywhere
wow .
i have been all over europe and a lot of the united states and hawaii
None
wow .
so , when i can that is what i do
uh -huh .
what , has been your favorite trip do you think ?
i am not sure .
i guess hawaii is one of my favorite places .
really ?
yeah .
better than europe ?
no that is exciting .
i have been several times
after the first time it is like anywhere .
oh .
it loses that newness ,
yeah
i love it .
i love to go over to europe .
i do
mostly i travel through germany and switzerland
we have good friends in england
uh -huh .
i have been there quite a bit
i just love it all .
sure .
i love to look at the different people and the different cultures and to see how different they are from things are from the way we do them .
uh -huh .
the most interesting part , more than the museums , and things like that .
uh -huh .
how about you ?
yeah .
i have been to canada several times
that is about it for me .
uh -huh .
i am from denver growing up , we would spend most of our vacations right there in colorado .
my family is , real into camping and four wheeling ,
several ,
i , think , maybe , four summers in a row , we spent , our vacation time in the summer , four wheeling through , portions of , the southern half of colorado
every time , my mother had ,
i have two other sisters
my mother had us , do some studying of the , area which we going to visit
no
we had to write , reports about it during our vacation . which , was really fun .
it was really fun .
we , each got to write little books .
 uh -huh . 
  it had sparked an interest of mine ,
my fiancee is a very very good photographer .
uh -huh .
that is what she had originally gone to school to do . was photography i , am close to receiving my english degree , as , well as my , graduate degree ,
we have thought very seriously of trying to , incorporate travel into and writing a book about , some portion of travel ,
uh -huh .
we are hoping maybe within the next ten years to get to take a trip over to europe and take , a trip from the northern portion of france down to the southern tip of spain , and follow .
uh -huh .
it is kind of a backward s shape , trail that the pilgrims use to take , back in the medieval times , to see the relics , in , southern spain and in italy
right .
we would like to take pictures of the gothic and romanesque monasteries and , just take that journey all the way down and then right a book about  it . 
 that  would be quite a project .
yeah ,
yeah .
it would be it is our big dream .
it would be a lot fun .
there is good and there is bad
my experience in italy was not my favorite for sure .
None
su -,
really ?
i flew into milan .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
my daughter is , a twirling champion she had to perform over there in turin
we had to fly into milan
sure .
oh .
we got on the subway after so much trouble because the italians , even if they speak english , they do not want to let you know they gave us all the wrong directions there were just two of us .
at the airport they put us on the wrong bus
finally , we saw a policeman .
he put us on the subway .
uh -huh .
we sat there ,
we did not know italian .
we looked at each other .
we said things like spaghetti
uh -huh .
things like that .
we finally followed some kids who told us where to get off .
we followed these kids with , gym bags
uh -huh .
we figured that must be the sports arena we lucked out
when we needed to go to the bathroom there was nothing but a whole in the ground .
wow .
it was kind of a nightmare .
that was our experience
i guess all of italy is not like that .
right .
where we were , it certainly was
the hotel that we stayed in ,
we stayed with our english friends , their team in the hotel
it was beautiful .
it was very modern .
uh -huh .
it was very far away on a bus .
oh .
it was interesting .
you always learn something .
yeah ,
yeah .
you always have a fun experience
it is great .
you said that you have been to england several times ?
uh -huh .
i wonder , have you ever been to a small town ,
it is actually about thirty minutes from salisbury .
it is called , bemerton ?
no ,
i have not . huh -uh .
okay .
our friends live like an hour outside of england , like ash , around there .
okay .
 alright ,
yeah . 
 uh -huh . 
the reason i am curious , i ,
the other place i would like to visit ,
i guess you heard our topic for today was clothing ?
yes ,
i certainly did .
how you dress for work and season to season and everything .
uh -huh .
how do you dress for work ?
about the same i dress for school .
i am a graduate student
i don 't have to worry too much about , what i wear too much of the time .
sure .
which is nice .
you bet .
although i do , a lot of ,
i am a speech pathology major
i do a lot of clinical work
when i do clinic work then i have to , look my best .
look professional
yeah .
unfortunately .
yeah ,
i understand .
i am a ,
i own my company .
i am in the , manufactures rep sales organization
my office is a small office
uh -huh .
i am very casual and wear slacks and sports shirt and things like that then when i travel it is a little different situation .
yeah ,
sure .
suits and sports coat , tie and the whole bit .
uh -huh .
cause you go to meetings and you are required to look your best and look professional of course .
yeah .
yeah .
do you find that , on the average do people give more credibility or less credibility to professionally dressed  individual . 
 yeah ,
uh -huh .
i think  in today 's society , there is more credibility to be quite honest i will always remember ,
i will tell this real quick story when i graduated from college ,
my first job years ago , thirty years ago , twenty -nine years ago , in fact , was selling agricultural fertilizer .
uh -huh .
i worked for the , smith douglas division of borden chemical
i sold manure .
uh -huh .
i would go out and call on farmers
i would always try to look my best wearing sport coats and things like that ,
i was calling on guys that wore bib overalls .
uh -huh .
one day i got up and thought i will just go casual and you know that i called on a guy wearing exactly that , bib overalls ,
uh -huh .
really ?
he sort of told me that he expected me to be professional he sort of expected me to dress as a professional it was sort of ,
even the farmers .
wow .
you bet even back then
uh -huh .
i been aware of my dress ever since then and try to look my best ,
here again i dress casual quite a bit
None
uh -huh .
yeah ,
certainly .
it gives you confidence .
in my business if i call on the the j c penney company here in dallas or say someone say sears and roebuck in chicago , then i wear coat and tie .
if i call on just , a normal little dealer of mine , i might be casual .
uh -huh .
i call on oshman 's sporting goods , again , it may be casual or it may be coat and tie .
 it depends . 
 yeah ,
it  depends .
sure .
you don 't ,
if you had the choice would you wear a tie or not ?
probably no .
uh -huh .
probably , no .
uh -huh .
because , today i believe you can get away with ,
then it depends on who you are calling on .
who you 're ,
you like your minister standing up in front of you with no tie , he would be missing something .
uh -huh .
although , he shouldn 't be evaluated on that .
right ,
right .
its ' just different .
uh -huh .
yeah ,
that ,
if you wanted to , really get into a hot issue ,
at least in some in some beliefs , how people dress when they go to church is sometimes a pretty hot topic .
yes ,
it is .
unfortunately .
i am , a catholic
the people that go to my church ,
uh -huh .
catholics dress very casual a lot of the times .
people in jeans and in whatever ,
yet the way i was raised ,
i am a converted catholic ,
the way i was raised ,
i was raised a baptist
as a youngster i use to always dress up all the time .
i guess that has changed also .
uh -huh
yeah .
i go to the church of christ .
i have been raised in the church of christ
right .
i , too many times you hear you hear a lot about what you 're supposed to look your sunday best and dress and proper attire
sometimes that really disappoints me , when i see in other economic areas like in kentucky .
sure .
people just don 't have that
None
they are afraid to go to church or afraid to go  simply because  they don 't have the clothes to wear .
that is a very good point .
i am from west virginia
uh -huh .
i understand what you are saying there it 's a very good point .
yeah .
what 's the old saying , you shouldn 't judge a book by its cover .
certainly .
evaluation of an individual . course , all of it depends on the type of job responsibility you have .
i think you have to dress sort of accordingly .
uh -huh .
you certainly should not judge a book by its cover and , or evaluate a person by that .
uh -huh .
what about season to season .
does ,
i guess your dress changes .
yeah
a little bit .
of course in the summer if i can get away with it , i wear , a pair of shorts
that 's it .
run around barefoot ,
no shirt or anything
None
okay , ron .
okay .
welcome to the net
what did you do about your last auto repair ,
might you say what kind of cars you have and so forth .
larry , my last one , unfortunately , was an expensive one because i had a brand new lincoln town car
None
a couple of ladies ran a stop light ,
the lights weren 't working properly ,
it wasn 't their fault ,
they didn 't run it .
we both had green ,
she hit me and did about eleven thousand dollars worth of damage to my car ,
None
my goodness gracious that 's ,
that was a huge repair bill .
that 's still not enough for a total , is it .
i know ,
i hated that .
it 's a very expensive automobile .
it wasn 't enough to total it ,
that 's been my most , expensive repair probably in the last year , with the except of just service work , because i buy a new car every two years
None
do you buy one every two years ?
i travel a lot ,
uh -huh .
this last one i leased ,
i don 't know ,
i leased it on a twenty -four month program .
first time i 've ever done that .
i 'll probably go back to buying them , because i don 't care to lease them
did this car have one of these expanding balloons ,
just are there normal safety belts in it , that you had .
no ,
it has the expanding balloons .
did that help you ?
it ,
they didn 't go off .
they didn 't go off .
no ,
i guess we weren 't going ,
that sort of upset me ,
we weren 't going fast enough acco -,
when i called the dealership about it and called ford motor about it ,
no , sir ,
didn 't go off ,
we were it was a bad , rainy , dark , dreary day ,
the street lights .
you were hit in the side , weren 't you ?
yes .
that may be the problem .
yes .
you may need to be hit leaning towards the forward to activate it .
took off my whole front fender and hood and everything .
my goodness .
i tell you , just took it all off .
it was
uh -huh .
my doors were okay front and back it did , right eleven thousand dollars in damage .
it was a expen -,
then i get it back and two weeks after that , i 'm driving it in front of the local high school , and some young man just wasn 't paying any attention and runs in the back of me .
that 's another twelve hundred dollars worth of damage
my goodness .
i 'm going to get ,
when my twenty -four months is up on this car , i 'm getting rid of this car .
i would think so
 this doesn 't sound like you 've got  very good luck with that one .
my golly .
how about you , larry ?
i 'm relatively fortunate about that .
here we , somehow , don 't have many people run into us , although at the beginning of each school season , students move into town who are from big cities ,
they sort of drive kind of wild for about two , three weeks , then they finally settle down and ,
 realize that they don 't have to  drive that way here .
i understand .
that takes the strain off of everyone that , is driving a vehicle ,
i find that the most of the repairs i have to do here is body damage due to the salt that we have to put on the road to , take care of us in the winter time .
i understand .
i have a sixty -nine cougar and a seventy -seven pontiac , so forth ,
i have to ,
i drive a honda most of the time ,
like hand over the telephone i have to make sure that , salt and so forth are kept off of it ,
sure .
once in a while we have to replace some of the plates in the bottom of it because it 's rusted away .
i understand that because i 'm from west virginia ,
we had the same thing up there continuously salting the roads for snow .
uh -huh .
sure .
i had this cougar totally rebuilt , to get some of the rusts that were in the fenders done , and then it all repainted ,
winter got here
i put the cover over it then to keep the ice and snow off ,
like hand over the telephone i haven 't had a chance to drive it very much
are you going to buy this next car
you going lease it again ?
no ,
i 'm going to buy it , larry ,
i don 't like the rental ,
i think , i 'm getting ready to retire myself ,
are you ?
i 'm going to be , driving a car for longer ,
i usually drive a car for three years ,
uh -huh .
last couple of cars i 've only driven for two years ,
i 'd leased this one for two years .
i 'll probably go back and buy one ,
this next car will probably be my retirement car .
that 's an awfully big one , that one that you had , that lincoln ,
 no sir . 
isn 't it too large for normal town driving , finding parking places  and getting in and out the doors ? 
not really ,
 uh -huh . 
 not really  no problem at all .
my wife and daughter ,
we have , two toyotas in the family , one nissan ,
we have the lincoln
None
the
not really ,
no problem there at all as far as finding parking places ,
yeah .
it 's convenient in that regard .
yes ,
it is .
that certainly would be a wonderful , comfortable machine to take on long trips i 'm very much aware of that .
i travel ,
i 'm like a traveling salesman ,
don 't travel a lot any more ,
when i do take it , it is very comfortable to drive .
yes ,
i 'm sure it is , because that 's the way that i enjoy this pontiac that i have .
yes
it 's ,
it only has thirty -eight thousand miles on  it ,
 is that right ? 
it 's  very quiet and very smooth riding machine .
my wife 's toyota is soon to be four years old ,
it doesn 't even have thirty thousand miles on it ,
gosh , been in such good shape , that 'll probably be an eight or ten year car .
uh -huh .
do you feel that ,
i don 't know .
my personal perception of government and , the way things are at this current time , is that nobody can really be trusted .
i don 't feel that too many of the candidates are out there to , be self -serving to the community .
i think that they have their own , wishes to , be in the limelight and to kind of say , hey , i 'm a public official , i don 't have to do , certain things
they just stand out more . involving themselves more and more with politics
it 's really ,
after all the things that i 've seen in the last ten years about government and now the overdrafts , of checks , before that it was the wonderful , escapade that they had with , the new ,  god   , chief of ,
supreme court ,
i 'm trying to think of his name and , what they put , him through in  regards to , 
 thomas ? 
yeah ,
thomas .
uh -huh .
the sexual harassment , that kind of thing and just to see our government react to that and then just little things that have added up where people have taken vacations on taxpayers ' monies and things like that .
i just think it 's very corrupt and in whether or not they need to start with people that are extremely poor ,
and send them into government versus people that are rich .
it 's always the rich person that gets into government . that has the money to advertise , the money to do this .
there 's no more abraham lincolns out there , that can get into government , even if they were poor .
i know that 's my personal viewpoint of things .
doesn 't wisconsin have a , state , medicare program or  health program ? 
 they 've already put through the health bill
yes .
it just went through
it was passed
that is going to be a heavier tax burden on a lot of the taxpayers and a little bit more on to the medical .
i don 't know if that was done out of just let 's be the first state to do it or if it was done really for the needs of the people .
you know what i 'm saying ?
it 's ,
right now every little state around here is thinking about we need to reform the health , system
of course , they think , minnesota , our neighbor , passed a state law , the health bill
it 's kind of like we 're the first to do it .
i don 't know if it 's done because we want to be standing out as being innovative in the health system or whether it was done for , a real good purpose to help people that can 't afford , health insurance , that  kind of thing . 
 right .
 i think one of the biggest problems that , we see in government today is a reflection of society in and of itself .
uh -huh .
 sure . 
sure .
uh -huh .
 that  is , we become so debt ridden and credit oriented instead of , cash and carry or debt free therefore , that puts a lot of undue pressure on municipalities , state and federal governments .
it sure does .
  i think it is reflecting .
like you said i think society as a whole , you can 't expect ,
when we have t v and we have things that are kind of bombarded at us for , immorality and this and this and this , that we can expect somebody to come off that 's going to be totally clean
right .
and come into government .
down the line it does hurt .
when somebody 's corrupt and somebody 's doing something , it does hurt each individual of the society when you find out that somebody 's done something or the overdraft policy or , the other things that have occurred ,
None
what is ,
uh -huh .
the thing is when a lot of things become acceptable practice it 's hard to discern what has become muddy as to what is ethical and what is not ethical .
 exactly . 
  someone blows the whistle and says , this is not ethical and yes i did it too .
yeah
that 's exactly what happens in government all the time .
they blow the whistle on each other .
i hear that you 're doing this ,
i 've done it
boy ,
it 's not going to get out .
ex -,
yeah ,
exactly . it 's ,
 yeah ,
we just had , 
None
 there 's no  secrets in the government .   i don 't think anymore .
right .
the mayor of dallas is ,  steve bartlett . 
 uh -huh . 
he also , was a congressman .
uh -huh .
to congress .
uh -huh .
he had been in that position for years .
sure .
uh -huh .
he was elected mayor of dallas overwhelmingly .
uh -huh .
however , if the vote was taken today , the whole thing might change because he was part of that , check kiting scam
sure .
None
okay .
i just got back from taking my little girl to her brownie meeting ,
uh -huh .
we had a bag filled full of cans they 've been recycling at their school .
she wanted me to just wait and let her dump them off tomorrow .
uh -huh .
they were filled with beer cans
hm
uh -huh .
i hated to take a big old sack , like a lawn bag full of them .
i ,
no ,
we 'll just taking them up there and put them in the bins anyway .
uh -huh .
they had tickets at their school that they recycle newspapers cans ,
i think that 's all .
oh .
speaking in the okay ,
they 're taking the money that they earn to plant trees .
that 's a good idea .
yeah ,
they 've got their bins that stay there ,
uh -huh .
they 've decorated real cute , with a bunch of big old flowers and stuff .
they 're getting into it .
i don 't know what they get for the tickets , though .
to someone off the what do you get for the tickets , if you bring stuff ?
the class that gets the most tickets gets a party
that 's good .
it 's not bad , yeah .
i know ,
we are kind of getting into recycling now .
i 'm in college ,
i live in a dorm ,
we recycle paper .
uh -huh .
i know that there 's a glass plant up here ,
they recycle glass ,
we recycle old aluminum cans and all that kind of stuff .
in each of the dorms you have a place for that ?
uh -huh .
that 's really good .
uh -huh .
yeah .
when our dorm ,
whenever our bins are all filled up , we take them and turn them in ,
we get money for that .
for the dorm ,
who decides what you do with it ?
yeah ,
we just keep it with the dorm .
what do they do with it ?
we buy things for the dorm , whatever the dorm needs ,
we have access to a microwave and an oven if we want to cook things ,
we buy , like , cooking equipment and stuff .
uh -huh .
we play games , like board games .
we buy board games .
it 's just different things , whatever ,
we vote on it ,
whatever the dorm would want , that 's what we buy .
i graduated from college in nineteen seventy -two ,
uh -huh .
we were just , not aware that this was a problem , that we ever would need to recycle .
yeah .
of course , you just threw it away .
uh -huh .
a little different .
i wanted to do this thing that you can get through target , to recycle .
i had my school do it ,
my principal said since we 're doing this thing called operation desert shield , we 're sending letters to all these servicemen and making video tapes and all that
yeah .
the whole school ,
it was just this big project ,
she didn 't want to get into that .
i could do it in the center ,
i just never got around to it .
it 's like a club ,
you know about that ?
no .
a little boy that had died of leukemia , i think ,
he had started this , save the environment club .
oh .
his mother is carrying this on .
uh -huh .
you can get the information to set it up , and join ,
you don 't have to join it as a group or anything , i don 't guess .
that 'd be go -,
you could start your own anyway .
get a pamphlet ,
is that what this target is ,
what you 're ,
do you all have target stores up there ?
no .
no .
huh -uh .
that 's a department store .
oh .
uh -huh .
kind of like k mart except it 's a little better than what k mart sells , i think .
oh .
i would like ,
let 's start up a target .
no .
i don 't really know any other recycling that they do .
no .
you 're not having it picked up at your houses or anything .
no ,
huh -uh .
we have to take it to a recycling place .
None
now in some of the towns around us , they 're already picking up the newspapers .
uh -huh .
they 're doing that here , too , now that i think about it voice in once every so many weeks ,
you have to pull out all the slicks ,
you have to wrap them up with string .
oh .
i think that 's all they 're picking up .
in minnesota , they 've got their bins where you put plastics and your bottles .
i didn 't know that .
yeah ,
my brother -in -law lives in minnesota ,
they 're are just nice , plastic bins ,
you fill them up and put them out with your other trash ,
they pick them up .
i never heard of that in background >>.
do you all have can banks ?
not that i know of
no ?
no .
in i sus -,
a big old bin ,
you just feed your cans slowly into the slot ,
your money comes out , every once in a while , for however much poundage you 've got .
if you keep feeding it until the light goes off .
my gosh .
you get instant cash .
they had one that i was putting my stuff in ,
i went to take some today ,
it was gone .
None
i don 't know .
i located another one today on the way to work .
yeah ,
we have places where we go
what we do is we unload our cans .
it 's like a conveyor belt ,
the belt separates the aluminum ones from the steel ones because it has a magnet on it .
they weigh , your aluminum cans ,
you get money for your aluminum cans .
they don 't give you for the other .
no .
now they 're going to start giving us money for the other ones , too .
before , they didn 't .
i know they 're going to start now .
uh -huh .
they 're certain places , where down there you can take your leaded cans .
i don 't know where they are .
they publish it in the newspaper if you wanted to get into it .
uh -huh .
i don 't know .
i 'm trying
None
i just can 't recycle everything .
yeah ,
yeah
i 'm not that dedicated .
yeah .
None
that 's all i really know about recycling .
me , too .
if they would .
i know , we 're saving our grocery bags now .
really ?
yeah ,
they 're taking those up .
you can take them to the stores background >>.
kroger 's doing it .
i think skaggs .
do you have those up there ?
we have kroger , but not a skaggs .
we ,
they 're taking our milk cartons and our plastic coke bottles there , too .
oh .
None
None
that 's pretty good isn 't it .
you guys are getting into it more than we are .
it sounds like it ,
you 'd think you would be .
uh -huh .
huh -uh ,
i 've never seen any , places that do .
i know , we reuse our grocery bags now .
we take them back , and use the ones that we have .
you can like ,
if you have grocery bags you can take them and use them instead of getting new ones .
you mean where you sack your own groceries .
yeah .
yeah ,
we don 't have any place that collects the grocery bags .
None
i don 't want to go with those canvas bags right now , i 'm sorry .
i 'm not that european
they do that like ,
i went to europe , nineteen seventy -three .
uh -huh .
they go all the time .
it 's like they would go almost every day to the store .
uh -huh .
they had their little bags way back then , and fill it up .
they had this little bitty old teeny refrigerators .
my .
that 's why .
they couldn 't put anything in it hardly .
None
None
what are you going to do when you get out of college ?
i 'm a finance major .
that 's why i did what i did .
i went into teaching
here in texas it 's a real mess right now .
really .
definitely .
there 's no .
let 's see ,
we 've had the funding ,
we 've run out of money .
we 've frozen the money .
right ?
they had until the fifteenth of april to come up some formula that would be more equitable to different districts according to finances , because the poor districts were getting less money , so not as good an education .
uh -huh .
right ?
now they 're trying to take some money away from the richer districts , like the one that i 'm in , in dallas , and make us pay our money to the smaller ones and make it more equitable .
if they can 't come up with something by the fifteenth , then the state 's supposed to decide , the courts .
what do you think the outcome will be ?
i think they 're maybe going to give us a state income tax .
do you have one ?
yeah
i 'm not looking forward to it ,
something 's got to be done .
yeah .
yeah ,
we 've had one as long as i can remember
it 's going to hit us .
yeah
i don 't know ,
did -,
doesn 't seem like it work to take it away when we 're using it .
maybe ,
i know we 're not using it so wisely .
uh -huh .
yeah .
we have too many administrators in some of these big districts .
uh -huh .
other than that . can you think of anything else we need to talk about .
i can 't think of anything on recycling .
me , either .
anything else ?
no .
what about people from , pennsylvania .
what do they think about texans ?
what do we think about them ?
uh -huh .
i don 't know
have you thought about that ?
no ,
i never really thought about it
  what you think about pennsylvanians .
probably a lot more civilized , more , refined than a lot of the people would be down here .
really
i would hope so ,
you 've been together a little bit longer than we have .
i don 't know ,
i really don 't know anyone from texas or anything .
no .
i 've never been there ,
i 've never ,
let 's see ,
i think i have too been to pennsylvania .
gettysburg ?
yeah .
yeah ,
uh -huh
we went up there . now that i think about it . on one of our long trips we take off on .
None
shboom .
child in what are you saying , holly ?
talking to my little girl is in the second grade , told me to tell you that shboom means good -bye in the israeli language .
oh .
child in   is what you say it is , holly ? in israel .
on she 's got this little girl from israel in her classroom that she 's befriended .
oh .
she 's into this .
is it like a foreign exchange type student ?
huh -uh .
you know we 've had a lot of the jewish people
colorado springs .
right ,
up in , t i out there ?
yeah .
right
did you hit one .
yeah .
i just hit one then .
all right .
None
the savings and loan scandal .
it ,
i , got to ,
this is going to be fun .
are you republican or democrat ?
kind of neither .
okay ,
i 'm a democrat
i was going to say if you 're a republican , boy we would really have a good time .
i do have some republican leanings , because ,
i am division one ,
i ,
to answer that one before we get to our subject , i always get a kick out of republicans who take credit for all the military hardware that was bought for the war and how successful it was , though when it comes to the budget they say well the democrats control all the money
they 're the ones wasting all the money .
i always wondered how they can play the money either way they want ,
i get a kick out of that .
the subject , go ahead .
you first .
i think it 's a stinking shame that there isn 't capital punishment for those assholes that stold our money .
yeah .
i don 't think it 's over .
i think that , so many other things have taken over , in the media .
i think it was just plain greed ,
i think it was deregulation really when they said do anything you want banks .
go ahead loan your money out ,
i agree with you .
i think it had something to do with deregulation ,
i believe , more of it was just greed .
yeah .
i was talking to someone ,
i can 't remember who it was ,
he was a small businessman ,
he said that the banks were calling ,
he borrowed some money
the banks were calling and just looking for people to give their money away .
they just got totally carried away with buying property and reselling the same property
yeah ,
there should be thousands of people in jail as far as i 'm concerned .
None
not just a couple .
we 've watched and watched t v and seen that a lot of these people were doing things , not just playing in the gray and not just reselling property at a profit , but financing the same property three and four times ,
right .
None
the list goes on and on .
i agree a hundred  percent . 
 of just the crimes committed .
yeah .
much less for criminals that should be indicted .
it may have started with hud too .
i noticed that hud was in terrible shape
that was property
they lost a lot of money there ,
some of these big , these rich people started to ,
even murchison here , who owned the cowboys , had a lot of property down in florida .
this was several years ago
he lost , all of his money before he died .
yeah .
not all of it ,
i don 't know how much he lost ,
they were just buying property and buying all kinds of real estate and thinking that there was a bottomless pit
it always would increase ,
it always would , be more than what you paid for it
they just never even got conservative with our money at all .
yeah .
it ,
everyone forgets whose money it was .
right .
everyone forgets that there are several of these people that are wanted by the federal government currently and are overseas where extradition is merely a funny american word .
yeah .
i ,
as far as being a republican or a democrat , i think no american could stand for criminal action .
the reason that i said that is because i was going to blame all , reaganomics for ,
you spend your way to prosperity
when you opened up the bank deregulation without any controls , i thought , that was the philosophy ,
just keep spending until taxes are lower ,
i thought , that 's not going to work ,
i knew that it wasn 't going to work originally .
None
it hasn 't  worked now . 
  in theory , a healthy economy has a lot of spending going on .
right ,
no doubt ,
no doubt .
if people are making money , people can spend money ,
it 'll generate taxes .
yeah .
i agree with that ,
there 's got to be some control
apparently there was ,
the problem is ,
the problem with reaganomics is that the people at the top are the ones getting rich .
yeah .
for what they would cost
we weren 't producing anything .
yeah .
we , as americans weren 't producing anything .
it was all inflation .
yeah .
i 'm sorry we don 't get into a real argument over it ,
we agree too closely ,
None
 yeah .
 i know ,
you can 't say that that was right .
no ,
i ,
no intelligent person can say that we could spend our way rich .
right .
remember all we 're doing is delivering pizzas to each other .
not high quality ones at that ,
yeah .
None
  i do have a lot of confidence in the american people and the economy and everything else .
i feel bad when i see the inefficiency , even here at t i ,
i think that the ,
it still ,
a lot of the workers don 't understand that , they need to put out the best that they can because it comes right back to them ,
it is a life and death struggle ,
right .
with the japanese .
i know ,
when i ,
of course i 'm in facilities ,
i work with a lot of mechanics
i just cannot understand why they 're just happy to spend their time here rather than produce ,
they think that , i 'm paid anyway
it doesn 't matter ,
i 'm very tired of it all pays by the hour .
right .
right .
i 'm nonexempt .
yeah ,
really ?
you don 't sound like a nonexempt , jim .
what ?
you don 't sound like a nonexempt .
what does a nonexempt sound like ?
you 're too informed .
they 're very , not interested .
they wouldn 't even talk probably about some of the things we 're talking about now .
None
i guess i 'm dealing with too many texas mechanics here .
i don 't know really .
 that 's , 
 i 'm being  a yankee , i guess i 'm letting my yankee come out ,
i ,
now maybe i 'm not the , typical nonexempt that you deal with .
the badge is silver .
yeah .
i am degreed , though nonexempt .
that 's good .
no
that 's not good
None
no ,
right ,
that 's good that you 're degreed ,
your time will come .
we ,
i know a  few people , 
 no ,
i  do not wish my time to come .
really ,
what ,
are you in a tech ,
do you do technician work or something ?
no ,
no ,
no .
i ,
government tool control is my specialty now .
i did p c protection control work for ,
quality , okay .
about ten or twelve years ,
right now i 'm just trying to tool crib and   chips .
yeah .
times are bad .
yeah .
is , really terrible .
i 'm , management level facilities ,
when the cuts came , three of us got , bounced back ,
we 're just ,
i 'm calling you from work .
i 'm covering , weekends and nights now .
i 'm one of the manager reps ,
there 's three of us to cover in dallas facilities
just we 're essentially standby and problems , all nights and weekends .
that 's my ,
i only get one weekend off a month right now .
i call it my recession job .
 it 's , 
  being basically an engineer and liking , doing installation work , there 's not any .
there literally is no installation work going on .
they turned all installation up here off .
yeah .
they told facilities they could not work .
yeah .
i don 't care what the jobs are , you will not work .
yeah ,
it ,
as far as our conversation goes , i would really be interested to know how much of t i 's problems now are related to ,
banking ?
the banking structure .
i think that , not only t i , but a lot of it , when they talk about ,
there was one point i was going to make .
i think the last i heard ,
i , i have to admit i 'm not as informed as them ,
there 's something like about eighty six billion that they admit .
i always double that .
i figure if they claim that it 's going to cost us eighty -six billion , it 's got to be twice as much because no one admits their mistakes
if that 's true , it may mean that two hundred billion dollar category that went down the tube somewhere .
it really hurts me ,
yeah .
it 's amazing really .
it 's amazing that ,
to realize that a lot of people out there are trying to retire on their home values .
yeah .
i know what you mean .
one of our  senior , 
 course your value of homes  up there are pretty good .
here they 're not really that high ,
are they pretty good up there ?
no .
really .
our economy in colorado springs fell completely apart .
we 're in the metroplex here ,
None
right .
it ,
i die every time companies like general dynamics ,
they lost several contracts
i don 't know if you noticed yesterday , you probably don 't pay attention to the bell helicopter ,
they were going to have big , award ,
secorski got it . which was boeing secorski , which is up in the north somewhere ,
yeah ,
it 's northwest .
i don 't know  how , 
 seattle . 
 bell didn 't get it . 
 seattle ,
 also , they do some of that in wichita , kansas .
i don 't ,
they were advertising here that it was bell , t i .
t i was getting the , electronics with bell ,
it was a double .
one that bell is in the metroplex
two , that t i was doing the electronics for them .
None
they advertised that it was t i bell all of a sudden ,  secorski got it , yeah . 
 secorski boeing . 
secorski , boeing ,
boeing doesn 't need the money .
something ,
i almost think there 's some politics around here , because the metroplex here , in the dallas , fort worth area , with t i ,
i don 't know if t i has lost as much as everybody else ,
general dynamics and l t v and bell have lost project after project ,
you realize
there you go .
uh -huh .
jean , the subject is jury trials
should the jury recommend , sentencing .
uh -huh .
my personal opinion ,
i don 't know .
here lately it seems ,
up until a few years ago , i guess , there just too many liberals about and permitting too many ,
they just broaden the human rights to cover just about everybody , i don 't think those guilty of committing capital crimes should be permitted to go spend a few years in jail and be turned lose on parole .
uh -huh .
it 's just not right .
i think i agree with that very much .
i ,
do you ,
therefore i think juries should be able to recommend sentencing .
do you think a lot of people , when they are listening to a trial , put themselves in a position like that and say , i would never do something like that ,
it 's for them to believe that somebody else could do the things that have been done ?
yes ,
very possibly .
uh -huh .
so many of us have led sheltered lives that , when we sit in on , a jury ,
i never have either .
i 've never done it myself unfortunately ,
i wish i could have .
is there a reason why you have never ,
i 've just never been called up .
uh -huh .
my husband works as a police man ,
i always assumed that that was why i was never called .
that 's possible .
uh -huh .
i was called up as an alternate once ,
uh -huh .
i never made it to the jury .
uh -huh .
do they have such a thing now as a six man jury ?
not that i know of .
somebody told me the other day that there is ,   what they call a six man jury ,
i had never heard of such thing ,
i wondered if it was true .
uh -huh
i 've never heard of it .
i never had either ,
i just wondered .
another question was , a criminal case , should the jury be unanimous on their decision ,
that i wasn 't sure on either , whether it should be unanimous or not .
there again , i suppose it should be .
exactly .
that would mean they all would have to decide one way or the other .
is it guilt or innocence .
then again , so many times you get one or two holdouts ,
uh -huh .
it permits the criminal to get a retrial .
yeah ,
yeah .
there ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
that 's not too bad in this sense , because you might get someone in their that 's a victim of circumstances that 's happened and giving them another trial might give them additional time to , prove their innocence .
bring some of these things out .
yes .
uh -huh .
we can 't overlook the fact that there are innocent people that do get involved in jury trials .
apparently there are .
i ,
uh -huh .
since my husband worked as a policeman , i can 't believe there are very many people that come to trial that are not guilty of some part of whatever they 're accused of .
uh -huh .
i still have a little bit of a problem with that .
i would suppose there are circumstances , you 're in the wrong place at the right time , or know the wrong person at the right time .
that 's it ,
you just might resemble somebody .
uh -huh .
out here in texas we had a , great miscarriage of justice .
after nine years , it was finally , taken care of .
uh -huh .
we had ,
oh .
a black man was accused simply because he resembled someone who held up , a , seven eleven , i think it was .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
even though he had witnesses that said that , he was at work ,
he had all sorts of character witnesses and what not ,
they still found him guilty ?
they found him guilty .
when people said he was at work ?
they said this happened during lunch time .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
he could have gotten away at lunch time and committed the robbery .
yeah .
after nine years ,
as a matter of fact they made a t v show about it , after nine years , they finally came up with evidence to prove that he was innocent .
for heaven 's sake .
there 's nine years of that man 's life gone .
exactly .
uh -huh .
that just was not fair .
no ,
huh -uh .
None
yeah ,
i guess that 's where a lot of the problem lies ,
we bend over backwards protecting the guilty people , the one 's that are on trial .
yes .
unfortunately , that 's what happens .
we often forget about the one the injustice has been done because i they still say our system is the best in the world .
it 's not the best system ,
it 's the best one in the world .
yeah ,
it 's the best one that exists , i guess .
uh -huh .
unfortunately , we just have to put up with a lot of things ,
they try to solve them and everything ,
i don 't know ,
the supreme court ,
i 'm still rancled about their decision to permit burning of the flag .
i think a lot of people are .
i think they 've lost sight of some things that are very important to our country .
it ,
uh -huh .
the first amendment definitely says freedom of speech not freedom of action .
yeah .
that just rancles me
no ,
i swear , if i ever saw somebody burning a flag , i 'd try to kill them , i would .
that bad ,
i wouldn 't like it ,
i don 't know if i 'd go that far .
i happen to be a flag freak .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i was in the service i was in korea i saw what the red in the flag represents .
yeah ,
i think pride in our country and our flag is so important .
it 's important in so many facets of our lives .
uh -huh .
i feel like if people don 't like what our flag stands for , they 're welcome to go some place else .
yeah ,
what they ,
there 's nobody holding them here .
how they 'd like it under another flag .
right .
they 'd soon be back ,
i 'm sure .
uh -huh .
yeah .
jean , we seem to be of the same opinions here .
uh -huh .
i hope they get something out of this .
yeah ,
i don 't know about the judge making the decision , if that 's ,
do you think that 's good like if a jury ,
passing sentence ?
uh -huh .
yes ,
i think the jury should be able to recommend ,
make a recommendation ?
yes .
do they sometimes make a recommendation ?
yes ,
yes .
that 's what i was thinking they sometimes do .
i don 't know if that 's a regular procedure or what .
i know i 'm always hearing that ,
the jury came in with a guilty verdict
they recommended ,
 they recommend . 
 twenty years or  something .
yeah .
yes .
the judge has the final decision on what does really happen . yeah .
of course , the jury may not be completely aware of all the ramifications of a sentence .
uh -huh .
they may not know that if you give him twenty years he can get out in five .
i think that 's where a lot of people think , boy they 're getting put away for a long time ,
actually , their chance , course , when ,
a lot of times when they come up for parole , they 're denied .
uh -huh .
it depends on what they 'd been guilty of , and a lot of different things , i guess .
yeah ,
too many times they are permitted to go out on parole
None
uh -huh .
a lot slip through the protective whatever they have to do .
there are bad ones that do slip back out and end up hurting somebody again .
yes .
they just go out and repeat their crimes .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
there ,
they say after three offenses its automatically life in prison ,
i think they ought to make it two offenses .
uh -huh .
i always thought there was wrong ,
it seems sometimes that like somebody who is stealing a loaf of bread to feed his family got more jail sentence than somebody maybe that killed somebody .
uh -huh .
it seemed like sometimes there 's not a good ,
the balance isn 't right .
it doesn 't make sense .
yeah ,
very true .
here again now , there is where race seems to rear its ugly head so frequently .
uh -huh .
race or nationality even .
uh -huh ,
yeah .
like you said , it 's not the best system ,
it 's the best one we 've got .
yeah ,
right .
let 's put up with it , i guess .
uh -huh .
improve it if we can , if we ever get a chance .
sure enough .
None
jean , it 's been awful nice talking to you .
it 's been nice talking to you , jack ,
i hope you have a real good day and week .
let 's hope neither one of us ever has to run into this subject we were discussing .
i hope not .
take care now .
you , too .
bye .
bye -bye .
okay .
where are you from ?
just here in dallas .
uh -huh .
okay because i talked to a professor in , what was it , north carolina , who got the t i system ,
he gave to all his students .
my daughter 's even talked to ,
i 've talked to several people from north carolina .
i was just curious .
that 's ,
yes ,
yes ,
that 's true .
have you ,
i 've  talked , 
 too ? 
uh -huh .
people from virginia and all over . yeah .
yeah .
i talked to the professor ,
i asked him about it ,
he says , i think i 'm the guy that , gave it to all my students .
  that 's why so many people are from this college .
go ,
 uh -huh . 
 ahead , 
you first ,  eve 
okay .
the subject we 're supposed to be talking about , let 's see , is , food .
food .
what type of foods do you cook
what would you , cook let 's see , if you were giving a dinner party ?
the only reason why i may know a little bit about this , is that i 'm planning on having a barbecue pretty soon .
great .
to me , that 's the type of thing that i like to give in , cooking for people .
if he 's cooking outside where it 's cooler and , you don 't have to do all that much work . you just , slap on some food and slap on some barbecue sauce and away you go .
yeah .
we have them too ,
i 'm trying to think which is the , best , that i prefer .
my wife , doesn 't like to have all that work on the very day that you 're doing it ,
we haven 't catered out very much ,
i always worry about the barbecue in that you have to be ,
the man always gets that chore ,
you ,
have to make it perfect .
i 've made shish kabob , which i like .
it 's fairly easy and fast .
uh -huh .
where -,
uh -huh .
i guess i 'm thinking of the easy thing to do for having , dinner .
uh -huh .
i do cook ,
not ,
i 'm mostly the easy cooker .
 yes . 
the breakfasts  and  the steaks ,
although i would like to experiment with , the meals my mother made ,
uh -huh .
so to speak ,
i haven 't gotten around to that yet ,
what kind of meals did she make that you liked ?
she was polish
she would make very economical meals .
we were very poor .
uh -huh .
different rice and ham and things that ,
uh -huh .
she would throw things together and  galunkies  and all that .
i would like to try that one day .
she would make spaghetti with pork chops and special meat balls and everything .
my wife ,
None
of course , thinks i 'm crazy , which i may be too
None
no .
sounds interesting , uh -huh .
yeah .
yeah ,
that 's great .
dinner parties are a lot of work ,
yeah ,
yeah .
 yeah . 
that 's why i like the outdoor stuff  a  lot better .
people can entertain themselves , i think , a great deal more , when you have a barbecue . especially when you have hot dogs and hamburgers and ,
 yeah . 
  nothing really fancy , like your shish kabobs , where you have to do a whole bunch of work .
yeah .
that ,
shish kabob is , just because it only takes a few minutes to cook ,
 uh -huh . 
 you  get it ready ,
you have to do a lot of work beforehand , i agree , and buy special stuff .
far as getting out there and putting it on , it only takes a few minutes ,
right .
i 'm thinking of the easy way , rather than ,
 my  guests , i guess ,
None
yeah ,
yeah .
i think you do a lot of work .
even if people do bring over things , you still do , all the ,
 right . 
 housework  and get everything prepared and utensils and just everything .
right .
my mother used to make an armenian rice dish .
uh -huh ,
yeah .
i 'm thinking about , special dishes ,
yeah ,
it was made out of rice and consume soup , and bacon and onions .
yeah .
you 'd simmer it all day long .
right .
it would ,
you 'd get the odor of it , yeah .
yeah .
it was just wonderful .
that 's something that i would really like to try and find the recipe for .
we used to have that at thanksgiving time .
uh -huh ,
yes .
because you can put it on top of the stove , and do this ,
there 's so much broth and juice in there ,
 great . 
 that it  has to , soak up into the rice , all day long , in order for it to come out fluffy and nice .
that was ,
when you were talking about the polish dishes , some goulashes and things like that .
that 's what i thought about , was that armenian rice dish .
yes ,
we probably ought to try this .
it probably will never taste as good as we remembered .
i guess it gets better and better as we remember it ,
 that 's true . 
 back , as  we get older ,
that 's true .
we probably should try it , to do that .
the recipes are really interesting ,
we 're probably going to lose them
we 'll probably forget all about them ,
uh -huh .
since we 're trying to make everything so sim -,
here i am talk about trying to make everything easy ,
right ,
right .
i ,
you talked about thanksgiving , there are interesting meals at different times .
something , s -,
my wife 's from texas ,
i remember we were first married
we were living in new jersey .
we were going over to my mother 's house for christmas , to have a meal .
uh -huh .
we were on the way over ,
we were just married that very year ,
she said , i 'm looking forward to a nice turkey .
i said , turkey ?
i said , we don 't have turkey at christmas
oh .
i said , we only have turkey on thanksgiving .
i said , we 're going to have a ham .
uh -huh .
she said , what ?
yeah !
i said , yeah .
i said , no , turkey is only for thanksgiving .
she had turkey a lot ,
uh -huh .
that was surprising in the east ,
we always had ham ,
right ,
right .
a -,
that 's one thing als -,
that 's another recipe , i guess , we could talk about .
the hams just kind of , go take it out of a can or , a package , sliced ,
uh -huh .
the cans were cooked for hours and hours and were just wonderful ,
uh -huh .
i 'd like to try that too .
yeah .
yeah .
you know what i found was , at sam 's , wholesale stores .
what they have is this honey baked ham ,
yeah ,
i saw them .
they ,
 that 's good . 
 have you had any of those ?
no ,
i know about sam 's .
my wife i think goes
None
if you ever get a chance to buy one of those , i think it was , twenty dollars , for , i don 't remember how many pounds it was .
uh -huh .
you cook it in the bag that they send it in .
really ?
all the juices and everything are all sealed in .
i tell you what , it 's never failed to come out tender and juicy ,
 i haven 't heard 
of that , yeah .
 and just delicious . because i normally don 't like ham , because it 's so salty .
yeah .
with this honey bake that they have , that 's the only one i have been able to find there at sam 's warehouse .
it is absolutely delicious .
yeah .
i 'll have to ask her about that .
it slices great . uh -huh .
because we have a delivery guy that comes around , that sells ,
i 'm trying to think of his name of it .
i don 't know ,
i see a can here , a box here of gourmet choice .
he delivers ,
what is the name of this thing ?
i got a box ,   distributor , marked on it ,
it doesn 't say , gourmet choices .
he ,
it 's a company that has , a truck that comes around .
they recently had hams .
 uh -huh . 
they have steaks  and ,  pirogies and all that stuff that ,
i wish i could tell you the name of the company ,
i don 't know what it is .
they recently had a ham , that was supposed to be ,
yeah .
it was boneless we tried it .
it was real nice ,
it was fully cooked and everything .
uh -huh .
we had it for breakfast a long time .
it was really great .
wow !
that sounds like it .
yeah .
that 's the only ham i have found that i thoroughly , thoroughly enjoy .
i would like to try the old recipe though , of cooking it ,
i keep saying this , to do the different things that we did .
i would like to put one in the oven , the old fashioned way and put it in there for hours and hours , and see if ,
i don 't think in my married life , which is , twenty -six years now , we 've never done that ,
wow .
i remember that when i was a kid ,
 uh -huh . 
 to  have the ham cooking . rather than that , we just ,
ham is just something you have for breakfast occasionally ,
right
that 's it ,
in the old days , hams were the meal ,
i don 't think we ,
 right . 
 really  have it as a main meal .
that 's true .
right .
i don 't think so anymore , not with more , becoming more conscious of , fat and cholesterol and all those good things .
that 's an interesting point .
how have you changed your meals now ?
have you ,
into that ,
 yeah . 
 looking at  those things ?
my parents actually started it ,
 uh -huh . 
  getting ,
parents , that 's unusual .
it 's true .
yeah .
i think my parents are very unusual because , we grew up in the south , where , you have all the , biscuits and gravy and , fried foods galore .
gradually they started switching over to , plain rice , no gravy .
that 's amazing .
it really is .
they actually , led us through it , versus , us teaching them , the finer points .
my mother has really high cholesterol ,
yeah .
it was one of the reasons which started them off .
they started doing this , like in about the middle seventies .
that 's amazing ,
 yeah . 
 they 'd go ,
 that they have started .
usually it 's the younger people doing it .
yeah .
it 's true ,
it 's true .
i agree with you .
i ,
None
 it 's really neat . 
 my wife 's mother  is the only grandparent left ,
None
 uh -huh . 
 she  has high cholesterol .
of course , i have too , but not like hers .
uh -huh .
i always get after her about salt and everything else .
she just will , she 's going to eat the same way she ate ,
 that 's right . 
 her whole  life .
she just tells , more or less tells me to shut up ,
right
i like to ,
i 'm trying to do something about my cholesterol in the same way .
uh -huh .
None
 uh -huh . 
  it 's not the  
i listen to , larry  newarth  on the weekend .
he 's a fitness expert
uh -huh .
he talks about , the chicken and the rice and everything else .
throwing away peanut butter and all
 the things not to eat , ever .
i think the peanut butter and mayonnaise he would throw away for ever .
he 's got me into making eggs without the yolk .
wow !
try that sometime .
uh -huh .
my wife says she can 't stand it .
when i make scrambled eggs now , talking about a recipe ,
 uh -huh . 
 i ,
 if i have four eggs , not for me ,
if i 'm making four eggs , even for my daughter i 'll take out all the yolks but one .
wow !
it 's fine .
you don 't miss it ,
None
in fact , when i make eggs for myself , if i fry them , throw them in there , i will almost hard fry them so i can not eat the yolk at all .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
you don 't really miss it .
you get the flavor of the yolk ,
you don 't eat it at all ,
you don 't ,
they 're hard .
you get a bite at the most .
uh -huh .
for cholesterol , i 'm trying that .
it has worked .
my cholesterol gone down twenty points .
although ,
 wow , that 's good . 
 i haven 't gotten  on the , butter or not cholesterol , margarine and all that .
i don 't know , whether any of that is true , out >>.
uh -huh .
whether the margarines or butter ,
okay .
okay .
what can we do about crime ?
i don 't know .
the one thing that keeps coming to mind to me is that they don 't have enough space in the prisons to put people
they keep letting out people that have , these horrible records .
uh -huh .
maybe we need to have more prisons or use the old army bases and make them into prisons or something .
that 's one thing i guess i could think of
uh -huh .
it 's definitely a big concern ,
every day it 's , all ar -,
we live in a little small town ,
there 's just rapes and murders and burglaries and everything all the time .
you just can 't get away from it no matter where you live .
yeah .
i ,
it 's pretty scary .
i 'm from butler ,
i can 't say that there 's too much of that there .
uh -huh .
i know the bigger cities have problems with it .
yeah .
i really don 't know what we can do about it .
yeah .
it 's rough , because
unless they start enforcing the ,
like : t , t , t , t , start giving more people death sentences .
that 's the only thing i can think of .
yeah .
yeah ,
even some of the sentences just seem ridiculous .
you hear about people , six and seven times have committed burglaries
they 're still , only serving six months in prison .
that 's definitely something .
they could have a more automatic sentence instead of having the judge having the choice of like , from one month to ten years or something
uh -huh .
that would be one thing that , i think could help is having the laws be changed so that they were more stiff penalties and more automatic penalties , for certain crimes
yeah .
yeah .
i don 't know what they 're going to do with the problem because it just keeps getting worse and worse .
yeah .
one things that they 're saying , now ,
are you going ,
are you a student
are you in the work force
None
i 'm a senior at clarion university .
okay .
one of the things that i 've heard so much about lately is the situations on campus where crime has gone up so much .
apparently especially like in date rape , many of the , perpetrators seem to be getting off because the universities kind of cover up .
None
they don 't really ,
not only that , a lot of them 's not even turned in .
you know ,
wow .
what i mean ?
yeah .
a lot of times the girls don 't even report it .
yeah ,
yeah .
i 've heard of a few case up here ,
i can 't say that i 've heard of , any significant amount .
yeah .
then again you don 't know how many girls are reporting them or not .
yeah .
they say like only one in ten are reported .
i believe it .
uh -huh .
that 's awful .
one thing they could do is probably support people more reporting it .
i know some police agencies try to have women police officers that the women can report to and this kind of thing .
i 'm sure it 's still terribly traumatizing , for people to report it .
uh -huh .
that 's probably something else they could do .
yeah .
i don 't know ,
it seems like something else in terms of crime is certainly involved with drugs ,
None
that 's like as long as ,
it almost makes me feel , in a way , like making drugs legalized just to get all the money out of it and not have ,
these kids are saying why should i go to high school
i can go out and work at burger king , for four dollars an hour or whatever , when i can make four hundred dollars a day selling drugs .
that 's certainly a big problem .
i don 't know what the solution to that is .
having more drug treatment centers available .
jeez , i don 't know .
you see now i would say that that 's a bigger problem up here than even the date rape or anything .
yeah .
i know a lot of people that partake in that .
i 'm not saying they 're bad people ,
i would say that 's a bigger problem .
yeah .
it ends up ,
even if it 's just kind of like this social drug use , you 're still ending up supporting these big drug pin ,
huge amounts , thousand and millions and millions of dollars are getting spent , on higher and higher up ,
uh -huh .
on drugs ,
it 's definitely got to do with crime .
you hear about people selling their babies , to get some crack .
just ,
gosh , horrible stuff like that .
one of the things they 're doing is they 're prosecuting the women who are having these kids that are addicted to crack .
uh -huh .
they said , some of the statistics show like one out of every ten babies being born in these public hospitals are addicted to crack ,
their moms are crack users .
that 's , another way of looking at it is as the woman is being a criminal , for doing that to her child .
uh -huh .
i don 't know who 's the victim there .
the kids are the victim , it seems like a lot of times the women are victims because they 're addicted .
it 's a very complicated problem .
i don 't envy the government trying to cope with it . gosh .
no , i don 't either .
yeah .
i guess that 's about all i have to say .
None
is there anything else you would want to ,
no .
okay .
i can 't say that i just know that it 's really bad in some areas
something 's going to have to be done sooner
None
yeah .
i don 't know what they can do .
yeah ,
yeah .
it 's frustrating .
uh -huh .
None
okay .
None
 it was nice talking to you . 
 thanks for talking .
 have a good day .
you too .
bye .
bye , bye .
basically i 'm at home
uh -huh .
i have two cats and my husband ,
my husband 's great .
uh -huh .
it 's wonderful ,
 yeah . 
None
i 'm about forty and whatever ,
uh -huh
around there ,
yeah .
you 're just a youngster then
yeah ,
i passed the fifty .
i 'm just a spring chicken , i guess
i guess our topic 's going to be changes in the women 's roles ,
None
it should be real interesting .
righto
you think we 're ready ?
i think i 'm ready
okay
okay .
you want to start off ?
let 's see ,
the changes i 've seen in women 's roles ,
uh -huh .
since i am in the forty age , i 'm a fifties baby
from my mother 's generation to my generation it 's been a big change .
very much , yeah ,
yeah .
very much ,
i think you 'll have to agree
yes .
since we were in , sort of the ground level , the bra burning of the sixties ,
 uh -huh ,
uh -huh . 
uh -huh .
  we didn 't really know what the agenda was going to be
i think , it got off to a really radical ,
it has a radical fringe to it that , i 've sort of backed away from .
i think all things get started sometimes in that manner .
yeah .
they come in that way .
to make a change , you have to make a splash .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
to continue in that vein , i think it got a little bit warped and off the track in several areas ,
uh -huh .
i really do think that women have made a contribution to human beings , to be human and what it 's like and have feelings and emotions
it 's okay
i think , on the other hand , i don 't know that men have changed that much .
in contrast to the women 's changes , the men stay steady ,
 uh -huh . 
 the women change around them .
i hadn 't thought much about that ,
that is true .
that ,
i think men are trying .
uh -huh .
some of them .
they don 't have a national organization of men ,
 no . 
 to ,  help them out
no .
what 's changing them , though , is the economic situation ,
 uh -huh . 
very much .
 where  it has to be a team partnership now ,
 uh -huh . 
uh -huh .
  they both have to work they both have to raise the children ,
 uh -huh . 
 if  we 're going to have any kind of future at all ,
 uh -huh . 
  that , i think has been the downfall of the last ten years .
uh -huh .
the me ,
i don 't know ,
the yuppiedom ,
 uh -huh . 
 the  whatever it was , the , women didn 't know how to go about doing the careers
they wanted to compete with men ,
they wanted to be like men ,
 uh -huh . 
  that 's wrong .
yeah .
i think they finally discovered that they don 't want to be like men
not ,
no ,
they hurt themselves a little bit in that way .
absolutely ,
that 's ,
they sort of threw the thing back another , ten years ,
 uh -huh . 
 that  they 've had to , restructure ,
i saw the greatest t -shirt the other day ,
i got to get some for all my men friends ,
 it  says , let men run the world , women have more important things to do
there you go
there 's a lot of truth in that .
right .
yeah .
uh -huh .
i think men and women both have valuable assets to offer we shouldn 't ,
we were made differently ,
 that 's right . 
 however you  come to that conclusion ,
we were biologically , physiologically , made differently
there is great wonderment ,
 uh -huh . 
 in  that ,
we should respect that in each other
None
yes ,
it shouldn 't be destroyed .
right .
yeah ,
yeah .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
just sort of all swooshed into one channel sort of thing ,
it 's viva la difference
 yeah ,
yeah . 
yeah .
 someone said  that i think that you can truly respect the other person ,
tom is just always saying , what a mystery you are ,
depends ,
that 's kind of makes it exciting .
yeah .
None
that depends on what day of the month it is .
yeah
i don 't know ,
i guess we 've gotten more of a ,
uh -huh .
in terms of that , i think we 've got more of a sense of humor about each other and our roles ,
it 's still a challenge being in a marriage and trying to figure out those roles
None
i think now when both are working they have a more of a chance of working together because they 're starting out that way .
yeah ,
that 's a very different way to do ,
 yeah . 
 the woman doesn 't start off at home ,
 right . 
 raising  the kids and goes back into her career ,
 right . 
 twenty  years later .
yeah .
None
because you get set in your ways
it 's ,
 you do . 
 really hard  to really to get help .
yeah .
to get the work load shared .
are you married ?
yes ,
uh -huh .
our ,
do you have children ?
we have five children ,
None
my goodness .
they 're all grown and on their own
None
my .
they 're ,
how did you do ?
how do you mean that ?
okay ,
did you have boys , girls ,
how did ,
how ,
we have , two girls and three boys
 my . 
 our baby  girl just had a baby girl
my .
last week was her first baby .
how exiting .
it 's been real exciting .
i tell you what .
i don 't know what i would do without my friends having all their kids .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i just love the babies since i 'm sort of in a medical situation where i can 't do that , it 's ,
yeah .
have you been that way long ?
just eight years ,
just eight years .
just the most important years of my life
that 's a long eight years , though .
yeah ,
it has been .
uh -huh .
there have been major , major adjustments ,
 uh -huh . 
  that 's another story .
uh -huh .
my husband has
that makes a big difference .
i couldn 't ask for a better life .
uh -huh .
if this is the way it had to be ,
 uh -huh . 
 this  is the best way ,
 uh -huh . 
 i  could possibly do it
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
that has a lot to do with his strength and his , just pitching in and his being able to , all , all ego aside , do a lot of things that really ,
when i say men haven 't changed i guess i should look at my own backyard sort ,
 yes . 
 of  thing
None
probably your role
the way you are also has changed , though .
yeah .
compared to what it would have been twenty , fifty years ago .
yeah ,
that 's true .
boy ,
i would have had so ,
i had so much guilt to begin with
the changes that had to take place ,
 uh -huh . 
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
 where  i couldn 't do a lot of things and , just adjusting to that ,
 uh -huh ,
uh -huh . 
  that was a major change ,
 uh -huh . 
  i guess in the end , you each take your own situation and you deal with it the best you can ,
the best you can , yeah .
women i think are a whole , sort of riding the course ,
they 're got a little wobbly and a little shaky there ,
i think the future of this whole thing is going to be what happens with the day care situation .
i ,
yeah ,
that 's the only thing i worry about is the child 's love and security .
that ,
i think that 's being damaged ,
 i think , 
 a lot . 
we 're going to see a generation of kids that , are just going to be a little bit , not very nurturing .
uh -huh .
i think ,
i do , too .
i think ,
some women can do both .
they 're very capable of working
None
yeah ,
i wish they weren 't so many ,
i wish they weren 't role models for everybody ,
 uh -huh . 
 because  it 's so dangerous .
it really is , yeah .
it 's dangerous for the woman , too , to think that she can do that
when she can 't , the failure of that is ,
 uh -huh . 
 her life sort of falls apart
she doesn 't know who she is
she 's ,
many have to work to make a go of it , it seems ,
 absolutely . 
  they say they do anyways ,
i think ones that don 't have to , the ,
it 's not as much of a stigma not to work as it was for a while there .
i think it depends on what part of the country you 're in .
that could be .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
i would almost just say that because , down here in the south a woman 's role is ,
None
 a  woman 's role ,
 yeah . 
 sort  of thing ,
 yeah . 
None
you  mean  it 's stronger there ?
yeah ,
yeah .
much stronger .
i think that , career women still have a lot of problems here ,
 yeah . 
 with  the good old boys ,
 right . 
 here  in texas sort of thing ,
 right . 
 making  career moves
None
right .
in terms of women staying home and being appreciated for their talents , it 's just like the way it has been for years .
uh -huh .
since the days of the pioneers , around here .
yeah ,
yeah .
that 's the woman 's role ,
 yes . 
 it 's hard for her to ,  watch  her peers be appreciated , i think sometimes ,
then i 'm not there ,
i don 't know that .
yeah ,
yeah .
i have women that do both
i see a little jealousy on the part of , the woman what has two little boys
she has an au pair , which is a live -in college kid working for her
None
she has her business in the back my other girlfriend that has , just runs the whole household herself and just has two kids and goes crazy ,
 uh -huh ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh . 
 all the time .
 i see i little bit of that
i always wish there was a balance ,
 uh -huh . 
 with  the one and wish she could spend more time with her kids
the other gal i wish she could just get out of dodge ,
 right . 
 for  a while
they 're both ,
get some peace and quiet .
yeah ,
they 're both different people , too .
yeah ,
definitely ,
you 're right about that .
that 's where the trouble lies .
yeah .
some people can adjust and have both , do both well ,
 that 's , 
 others  can 't .
that 's true .
that 's so true .
how did your daughter do it ?
i have one daughter that works full -time .
she has two little boys .
uh -huh .
they seem to do fine .
she has talked about quitting , and staying home for a few years .
then , it 's real hard because she 's got an excellent job .
right .
None
all right ,
what type of things would you fix if you 're having company come over ?
i have a really great one that i make in the summertime because it 's cool
it 's just really pretty easy .
it 's pretty much dumping things in and stirring .
uh -huh .
i like that .
the only thing you have to do is cook the rice that goes in it
you 're supposed to do chicken ,
i just use those little cans of chicken .
uh -huh .
it makes it so much easier ,
you dump the rice ,
you dump the chicken
you put in fruit like pineapple and mandarin oranges and grape ,
now grapes are the ones that you have to pull all that off ,
i get my kids to do that ,
None
oh
i don 't have to do that .
it really ,
you mix it all up with ye -,
there 's a little dressing that goes in it that you have to stir up ,
it 's so simple
it tastes really good because it 's cool in the summertime .
yeah .
you serve it cold ?
uh -huh .
yeah ,
that sounds good .
yeah ,
it has to sit in the fridge over night ,
it 's really good .
None
i like that one .
yeah .
usually when we entertain we do something really simple , because i like to visit with my company ,
yeah .
and not be scurrying around in the kitchen ,
None
exactly .
a lot of times , we 'll barbecue
like , for memorial day we had some friends over
we just bought a brisket and marinated it overnight in one of those adolph 's meat marinate ,
uh -huh .
and put it on the smoker and cooked it .
that sounds good .
it was real good .
you can buy a fairly cheap piece of meat that way
people think they 're eating steak or something
yeah ,
yeah
these days that helps , doesn 't it ?
yeah ,
yeah .
yeah .
it really does .
i know what you mean .
i don 't usually just pass on any recipe that 's got more than five or six steps to it because i just know i 'll never take the time to do it .
now spaghetti 's such an easy one .
i do that a lot .
uh -huh .
i do spaghetti a lot .
yeah ,
it seems like most people like spaghetti .
yeah ,
i don 't like to do that if it 's real hot though .
yeah .
i don 't know ,
i have a real thing about being hot in the summertime .
uh -huh .
i guess .
i think when you heat your kitchen up it really makes a big difference ,
yeah .
in your whole house .
yeah ,
i think that 's right .
we don 't entertain that often ,
when we do , i 'm like you . i like it to be fast and easy .
uh -huh .
yeah .
and something so that we can talk and not have to worry about being in the kitchen all the time .
most ,
we don 't entertain people from work or stuff often .
it 's usually friends from church and stuff ,
yeah .
it 's usually kind of like , you want to come over , and they say what can we bring .
yeah .
it 's real easy because you just make one or two things
everybody else brings something .
that 's exactly like us , from our church , we just do it ,
yeah .
yeah ,
yeah .
None
it 's a lot more relaxing .
i don 't know if i could take the pressure of having to put on this really fancy dinner for someone .
you see all that on t v
i could never be that person .
huh -uh .
i 'm just not ,
i 'm pretty laid back .
yeah
w -,
i know a lady in my church
she does her own bread and does her own stuff
when she , does food , she really goes all out
i don 't know how she can do it and be calm
yeah
i guess ,
do you work ?
no ,
i don 't .
do you stay home with kids ?
uh -huh ,
yeah .
yeah .
i 've been working ,
we 're going to have a baby this summer ,
i 'm not going to work anymore .
how exciting .
yeah .
hopefully , i think i 'll enjoy cooking more , when i don 't have to work all day .
i don 't like to come home and stand in the kitchen and spend an hour fixing something and then have to clean it up
by then it 's eight thirty or nine o 'clock at night ,
None
yeah .
i usually start about six and cook and then eat at seven .
yeah .
cook at five and eat at six , rather .
eat at six , yeah .
yeah ,
my family and i , we 're a sit down together family .
that 's good .
yeah ,
i don 't like the run in and out part .
yeah .
i like to be able to sit down after school and have them talk with me and my husband about what 's happened
None
yeah ,
that 's neat .
i think that was ingrained in me during my family time at home .
uh -huh .
we could learn to talk about things
i think that 's good .
yeah ,
that really is .
it keeps the family in touch with what 's going on with each other .
yeah .
i think ,
right now we eat in front of the t v
since it 's just the two of us , it 's
yeah ,
yeah
that happens to us sometimes too .
yeah .
sometimes if something , is on that they want to watch i leave it on ,
we eat in the kitchen
their heads are always poking past the door .
uh -huh ,
to see what 's happening .
yeah .
food is , a real life -style kind of thing
some people don 't like to do this
i like to cook with my kids .
uh -huh .
if they 're going to have other kids over then , then they help .
we make real simple things , those ,
i don 't know if you 've ever made them , maybe not since you don 't have kids yet , but those jell -o , gelatin things you can pick up with your fingers , i can 't think of what they call it .
i 've seen those in the magazines .
yeah ,
they 're so simple .
uh -huh .
the kids love to do that .
finger food is a biggie with them .
yeah .
now one thing i wish i could find a better way to do are celery sticks and carrot sticks , because they love to do that
it 's just really hard
if you have to work with a knife , i don 't like that .
yeah .
that 's ,
they like to eat it ,
it 's a hard one to have to prepare .
yeah ,
they like that with the cool ranch dressing that goes along with that .
yeah ,
yeah ,
we like that .
yeah .
that 's a good way to get kids to eat vegetables too .
yeah .
my son 's getting to be a real good cook
None
neat .
sometimes he fixes me breakfast
wow , that 's great
yeah ,
i like it ,
i like it a lot .
how old is he ?
he 's eleven .
eleven ,
wow ,
uh -huh .
that 's good .
yeah ,
hi -,
do you cook a breakfast every morning
None
not every morning ,
mostly during the summer it 's hit and miss
None
yeah .
we usually have cold cereal or something like that .
yeah .
during wintertime when they 're in school , then i try to vary it so that we only eat that twice a week or something and then have when it 's really cold , i even cook oatmeal ,
uh -huh .
because i like oatmeal
they like it all right .
yeah .
sometimes we do something ,
it has to be fast because they 're on their way to school ,
we do eggo waffles and stuff like that ,
None
uh -huh ,
yeah .
yeah ,
i try to ,
sometimes we do eggs if i get up early enough to do that .
i used to do them in the microwave ,
they don 't like that .
do they get rubbery ,
None
None
i 've never tried it .
it depends .
uh -huh .
if you let them cook too long then they 'll turn a little bit gray .
you can tell if they 've gone to long because they 'll turn a little bit gray
they will be a little harder ,
i don 't like that .
yeah .
you have to just let it cook a little bit less than what it says in , if you have a microwave book ,
you cook it a little bit less and then let it sit with a plate over the top .
oh .
let it steam .
uh -huh .
stir it up .
None
yeah ,
that turns out okay .
yeah .
uh -huh .
it 's funny  'cause if i turn them out on to a plate , for them to take what they want , they don 't know i 've ever done it in a microwave .
it 's really funny ,
it 's very deceiving ,  'cause if they see it with their eyes they go , i don 't want that ,
yeah
None
yet if they don 't ever see it , then it 's like , this tastes okay ,
None
yeah .
None
we had ,
my grandmother used to do that to us with things like squash .
everybody would say we don 't like squash , we won 't eat squash ,
she would make these fancy casseroles and hide it in there ,
yeah
we 'd go , this is really good .
okay .
it 's not such a bad idea to think about judges , taking the idea of , sentencing into their hands versus , the jury , especially if it 's a highly publicized case such as , you 've got cases right now that are going on that everybody 's very well informed of or have read , certain , things in regards to cases like the dahlmer case in milwaukee and stuff .
it may be an idea to think about , cost .
yeah .
trying to find a jury so you can get a jury as far as , they may say they 're not biased ,
deep down they are against this person or whatever ,
i don 't think it 's such a bad idea to think about .
None
right ,
that it ,
i ,
exactly .
a judge would be more consistent from one case to the next and , not depend so much on the emotions of a particular case , but be able to put it in overall perspective .
uh -huh .
yeah .
i certainly haven 't thought much about this
None
catches you off guard , doesn 't it ?
yes ,
yes ,
some of them do
some of them don 't ,
this one ,
i was trying to remember back .
uh -huh .
it seems to me that , when i studied civics in school or stuff , that the juries being involved in the sentencing wasn 't so much .
i 'm trying to figure out whether i 'm remembering wrong or whether that 's by state .
i didn 't think they were either .
i thought the sentencing was done by the judge .
yeah .
it 's either guilty or not guilty .
yeah .
i guess ,
changes .
uh -huh .
i don 't know whether it 's by state or whether there 's been some supreme court decision perhaps that said that , that , as part of the trial by the peers that had to include the sentencing or too , or whatever .
i ,
yeah ,
i certainly wouldn 't be , worried about that .
sure .
yeah ,
yeah .
i guess in terms of having a judge do it would seem to me to be more fair and , unbiased .
in terms of doing away with the unanimous jury , i guess i , would be a little more leery of that kind of a change in the trial system .
exactly .
exactly .
yeah .
yeah .
that 's just such a tradition that it 's got to be a unanimous jury that , i don 't know where you 'd draw the line anywhere else . two -thirds or three -fourths or whatever .
uh -huh .
i certainly wouldn 't feel comfortable with just a bare majority .
exactly .
None
uh -huh ,
yeah .
that 's kind of how i ,
yeah .
yeah .
in certain cases i can see them going , just basically with a judge , guilty or not guilty verdict simply from a judge in highly publicized cases versus the small , maybe , you did a crime that was , burglary or whatever
it goes into the court case or whatever
it 's not highly publicized .
yeah ,
whatever .
when you get into these highly publicized cases where everybody knows details whether it 's through the national enquirer or whatever .
yeah .
it 's the idea that person might initially have this thought , jeez this person 's guilty no matter what .
yeah .
i 'm not going to listen to the facts and con their way into , getting past the lawyers and getting through that .
also there 's aspect of cost
i 'm not quite sure how much cost it does take for , the judicial system to try and call a jury , whether it 's very costly , or if it 's something that 's not costly or what .
being that i 'm not in that area i really don 't know .
yeah .
i wonder if there is some big expense in trying to call a jury to trial and then having to pay whatever they have to pay if there 's something that they have to pay .
yeah .
i know companies have to pay for these people to be off from work . or at least give them the time off from work .
whether it 's ,
i think it 's with pay .
if i remember , jury duty is with pay .
None
it 's not ,
i 'm ,
i ,
i 'd ,
i know it is where i work .
uh -huh .
paid , right .
i 'm not sure that that 's necessarily required . by law that it has to be paid .
i suspect that 's a benefit of a bigger company .
uh -huh .
some that may decide not to .
there are certainly some that wouldn 't ,
yeah ,
i don 't know if there 's going to be solutions to the u s budget .
now it 's in pretty disastrous shape for sure .
uh -huh .
yes .
it 's only getting worse exponentially it seems .
exactly .
None
there 's , maybe some short -term things that they can do
it hurts everybody 's pocket , of course ,
uh -huh .
i know that state has , cutback , raises for a year to help , the , state financial or whatever you might want to say to get better in a better condition .
that ,
which state is that ?
state of minnesota .
uh -huh .
there 's the potential that perhaps , the u s budget might want to take a look at it 's , federal employees and take a look at saying , let 's freeze wages .
uh -huh .
everybody 's doing it so it isn 't like , private business has had to do it
right .
it might have to be something that they might consider doing that 's got to be very short term .
right .
the only other avenue that i can think of is , looking at where they 're spending the money and not so much as saying , we 're spending too much in that area as perhaps looking at what is costing them the money .
yep .
as for instance , i think you probably remember the military getting caught , with toilet seats that cost them four hundred , five hundred dollars .
right .
it was just ,
yeah .
you can go to k -mart and buy them for , eight dollars or i think six dollars or whatever for toilet seats ,
yeah .
it gives you a -, idea that ,
definitely i think that there 's probably a lot of waste in defense and in government funded research in the first place .
sure ,
sure .
None
uh -huh .
there was , people at stanford who were soaking the government , using millions of dollars of research money for the president to buy beach homes or whatever it was .
uh -huh .
than we think .
sure .
i think that maybe more widespread than we 'd like to have think .
sure .
then it 's something that 's hard to enforce too i 'm sure .
uh -huh .
it sure is .
the , as far as ,
i think there was something with the government official that went on conferences for two days
the conferences were nothing
they 're getting paid for this ,
it was something more than just the conferences .
they were using it as eating out ,
when you think about people , taking vacations these big government officials taking  descendants  in congress .
uh -huh .
the rest of them taking these vacations and using the taxpayers ' money for that .
right .
uh -huh .
it 's a real big crunch , of course , when they get caught then they 're guilty of course ,
during that time i 'm sure there 's hundreds of , thousands of people that are , spending money that does not belong to them .
None
that 's right .
uh -huh .
i think that , politicians talk a lot about waste i 'm not sure that that 's really that much of the problem .
sure .
uh -huh .
when you look at something like the gulf war it cost us god knows how much . at a million dollars ,
a pop for patriot missiles .
exactly .
i don 't think , it 's ended up being ,
yeah .
it gave people jobs i think it also cost , quite a bit as far as because after they 're done with the war , a lot of things were no longer put to use .
it was kind of like , we 'll do this during this point and time
right .
after that they didn 't want to do it anymore .
uh -huh .
a lot of things that are saying that they 're no longer going to be doing for next wars that are coming up that they did for this one in getting rid of a lot of things .
uh -huh .
i don 't know .
right .
okay ,
it was good talking to you
okay
have a good evening .
all right .
you too .
uh -huh ,
thanks .
 bye -bye . 
 bye now . 
okay .
what kind of pet do you have , gail ?
i don 't .
i have children
you have children
i have little children .
both of my kids are under two so right now we don 't have pets ,
we 've had lots of them in the past .
have you ?
uh -huh .
what have you had ?
we had a dog before we moved here .
we couldn 't bring her with us .
we came from colorado ,
we 've had hamsters and fish and birds .
oh .
 okay ,
i 've   ,
you 're going to have lots of pets with your children growing up .
uh -huh .
we had a schnauzer that we lost this summer ,
he was fourteen years old .
we 've had two schnauzers
before that we had all dachshunds ,
i think my husband wants another dachshund ,
we 're trying to debate because our children are grown
i don 't know whether we really want to be tied down to a another dog .
we do have a very loving cat that 's , kind of our baby .
uh -huh .
we like pets .
we like them around .
we have grandchildren that run through
they think we should have a dog ,
that 's because they have a great dane
huh .
yes .
they 're just huge
definitely .
we ,
if it were just more peaceful ,  with  the little ones , we would definitely have a pet .
i just think it 's nice to have around .
we had a cat   that had kittens .
any pet that i get from now on will definitely be spayed or neutered .
yes ,
yes .
i did .
that experience was awful
yes ,
i have never wanted to ,
that 's why we 've never gotten a female , in anything .
uh -huh .
our male cats , we had ,
to baby very  what you doing   ?
neutered right away ,
of course , he doesn 't know it .
he 's still out partying .
oh .
i do think that maybe we 'll get a female next time and just have her spayed ,
None
yes .
a lot of times now when you buy them from the s p c a or from the humane societies or whatever , their adoption includes their spaying .
yes ,
yes .
None
which i think is a good thing .
it just breaks my heart to see these poor little old dogs wandering the streets looking starved
None
None
uh -huh .
it ,
you know the safety factor and stuff .
we enjoy having pets .
i think they 're a lot of company ,
when my mother lived with us , the cat was really hers
he was kind of wild .
our daughter found her and brought her to us ,
that cat walked in and walked right up to my mother and jumped up and curled up in her lap .
oh .
she was the only one at first that , could really hold him , because he was really skittish .
uh -huh .
it was like he knew
he would sleep with her ,
he was a lot of company to her .
yeah .
and just love her .
cats are usually so independent
this one he comes up
he crawls up next to my husband now ,
he 's ,
before the dog died , we have a queen size bed and the dog would sleep on my side ,
the cat would sleep on my husband 's side ,
when everybody turned we all four of us turned in a row
my husband that 's one thing he hated was our cat used to sleep with us .
uh -huh .
our dog wasn 't interested in even coming in our room ,
our cat would sleep with us
he hated that .
did he ?
uh -huh .
he just thought that they belong ,
uh -huh .
when she 'd walk on the couch along the back behind his head he hated that .
i guess probably if we get another animal it probably wouldn 't be a cat even though i love cats .
i think it would probably be a dog ,
it would definitely be an outdoor animal .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
i think that 's one of the reasons our ,
because as i said our schnauzer was old .
he was becoming incontinent .
then i would just have messes in the house ,
i think that 's one of the things that both of us are not wanting to start over with ,
uh -huh .
yeah .
it was new carpeting
it just really , upset me no end .
uh -huh .
None
that would , greg ,
my husband 's grandparents have a dog
they just ,
it needs to be put to sleep
it 's grandpa 's dog ,
he 's really getting too old to take care of it .
the dog messes all over the carpet
oh
my daughter is just nine months old then she crawls on the carpet
uh -huh .
the smell it 's just really awful
that 's one real drawback ,
i guess you 'll do just about anything for your pet if you love them enough
yes ,
you will .
you will .
we were trying to decide about putting him to sleep .
he was getting so old and had other problems too .
fortunately the decision was just taken away from us which made it a whole lot easier .
again going through that because our animals are almost like our kids in some ways ,
uh -huh .
you grieve just as much over them when they go as you would a child .
our son and his wife and our daughter and her husband and the grandkids all say , get a dog , get a dog ,
 little  thing .
be quiet ,
be quiet .
i can tell my husband , deep down he real -,
brian in plano , texas . how are you doing today ?
hi ,
fine ,
i 'm nancy .
how are you ?
great , nancy .
i 'm in plano also
you 're in plano also ,
yes ,
we 're not too long distance today .
good to hear .
i was just talking to someone the other day from pennsylvania .
that was good .
utah , i 've had a couple of ,
that was it .
really ?
yeah .
all right .
good to hear ,
good to hear .
learned about their basketball team
which one ?
jazz .
yeah .
yeah .
the utah jazz .
yeah .
yeah ,
they 're pretty good .
that 's what i heard .
yeah .
they 've got some good , good players out there .
yeah .
you ready for new year 's eve ?
i am .
good .
should we , start this so we can ,
okay .
what was your name again ?
nancy .
right .
nancy , that 's right ,
i 'm brian .
right .
just a moment
right .
okay nancy , then i guess today 's subject is benefits in the job other than salary .
uh -huh .
what do you feel are important to you or other people as crucial benefits ?
i 'm a little different than other people because i don 't have benefits with my job .
uh -huh .
i 'm a nurse
oh
i work ,
uh -huh .
right .
i float so that i have no benefits except higher pay for doing that .
uh -huh .
i find that it makes up for what i pay for insurance
i make enough money by the hour to make up for that .
right .
to compensate for some of the benefits .
uh -huh .
oh .
yeah ,
it 's cheaper for me to buy insurance by the month than to work staff someplace .
yes .
i have my freedom .
i can work seven days in a row and take a week off or whatever i want to do .
that 's an excellent ,
that is a benefit ,
it is to me .
most people prefer the security of nine to five ,
yeah .
and weekends off and knowing that their insurance is paid and their retirement ,
right .
i 'm just really not interested in all that .
right ,
i guess that 's a good point ,
uh -huh .
i do belong to a large corporation
that where i 'm currently employed
there 's some different things , one that you 've already mentioned is health insurance .
right .
i think through our health insurance that i can get better rates through a group plan as opposed to going out and getting health insurance on an individual basis because i had to do that at one time when i wasn 't employed with a large corporation
that got to be somewhat expensive ,
yeah .
i think one of the benefits i see is the group discount .
right ,
especially if you have a family .
yes .
then i think it makes a big difference .
yes ,
that 's one thing i do have .
yeah .
if i didn 't have a family , i don 't think i would have , as a male or as an individual in this stage of my life ,
i don 't think i would have insurance ,
right .
i don 't think i would go through that expense .
one other benefit that you mentioned is the flexible work hours
yeah .
in my previous job , i really enjoyed because they had what was called flex schedule where i could go and i could work , nine hour days and have friday only work four hours i could do , work four days a week at ten hours a day and have a , three day weekend .
right .
and make my job flexible in that case .
could you change that as you felt like it
did you have to do it the same every week ?
yeah
i had to do , that , the same , for about every quarter of the year .
uh -huh .
i was in a position of management i had responsibilities over people that , i needed to make my schedule , so that if i was not there i would have coverage by some other management personnel ,
yeah .
i think that , that was an excellent benefit that i really enjoyed
i don 't have that in my current operation ,
you mentioned , flexible work schedule
that 's good .
yeah .
what other benefits do you think are important ?
i guess ,
retirement , that kind of thing which i don 't worry much about
yeah ,
yeah ,
that 's true .
i just prefer to worry about today ,
probably not a practical attitude
that 's who i am
None
that 's an individual thing .
uh -huh .
yeah ,
with our current , organization , we do have a nice retirement package
right .
also a nice thing that we have in our corporation is a profit sharing plan where we can , participate in the profits of the company . if we 've been there a while and we 're vested , which means that , we have an interest , in the company that we can , get some of the benefits of either the profit high times or in a sense , suffer during the low times
also , in one of my wife 's , companies where she worked , they 'd had a real nice profit sharing plan that ,
okay ,
some of the t v shows i like to watch are , mostly evening shows
for instance the one i 'm looking forward to tonight is twenty twenty .
i usually watch those prime time programs .
right .
i like to watch forty -eight hours .
never miss that and , sometimes prime time live .
the week goes by
i don 't think i ever watch anything else .
the sunday night movies , i watch those kind of things . but basically a lot of documentary things and , what 's going on and that kind of thing .
i have a few , favorite shows that i try not to miss .
uh -huh .
l a law is one of them .
uh -huh .
although this year 's , it 's a little easier to miss than last year .
yeah .
with the new cast and everything .
yeah ,
it 's hard to follow .
right ,
i like rosie o 'neill .
i 've never seen that one .
the trials of rosie o 'neill with sharon gless .
okay ,
yeah .
she ,
i 've seen the previews for that .
it 's very good .
it 's probably very much a woman 's show .
uh -huh .
there 's a new sitcom on that is , tim allen 's , handyman .
that 's not what ,
home improvement .
we never miss that ,
we try not to miss that .
it 's hysterical , isn 't it ?
we think it is ,
so funny .
did you catch the christmas ?
just part of it
i thought it was ,
it had such a good story , too .
uh -huh .
did you see the end of it ?
no .
the little boy , the little one was trying to decide if there was a santa claus .
uh -huh ,
that 's right
the neighbor ,
they thought it was the neighbor .
they thought it was the neighbor .
he gave the two doubting thomases a rubber band and a paper clip .
yeah .
i thought that was wonderful .
it appeared that maybe it probably wasn 't the neighbor .
used to be on sunday nights , now i can 't figure out where they 've moved it .
on our , public television , they had a show at ten thirty that was a computer show .
uh -huh .
it showed the latest , developments from all the computer companies .
uh -huh ,
i 've never seen that program .
it 's ,
uh -huh .
unless you 're really into computers , and software , you probably wouldn 't be interested ,
uh -huh .
i don 't know ,
it just really gave me kind of an outlook of what was available out there .
oh .
oh .
they covered everything from entertainment to spreadsheets , and then also , the hardware .
uh -huh .
you could see what the new developments were and what to look for
None
uh -huh .
i enjoyed that .
it was just a thirty minute show with no commercials .
okay .
public television , course , doesn 't have the commercials during the show
None
yeah ,
right .
i like the frugal gourmet .
i do , too
i do , too ,
i just seem to miss a lot of these programs .
i don 't know why .
i just ,
if i can catch them , i do . or if i remember .
there 's very few that , my life would stop if i didn 't catch .
now i do ,
before i go to work , i tape my soap opera .
yeah .
i watch one
None
i watch two ,
one 's a half -hour
one 's an hour
they lead into each other .
oh .
that 's the bold and the beautiful and as the world turns .
okay .
i 've watched the , as the world turns since i was a little girl
yeah ,
that 's been on for years .
it 's just ,
it 's , something i 've done for the last probably twenty -five years .
you get to come home and watch them
yes ,
i don 't have anyone else at home ,
yeah .
i have freedom to watch whatever i want .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
i like
i like the comedies
uh -huh .
i do like good movies .
i subscribe to h b o .
yeah
we ,
i can get some of the movies .
yeah ,
that 's a good idea .
we did have h b o ,
we just canceled it last week because it seemed like it was so repetitious ,  
 it is . 
it 's just ,
i don 't sleep a whole lot
i ,
at two o 'clock in the morning , there isn 't anything on regular t v
oh .
None
yes ,
if you 're up then
that 's ,
you don 't get good reception without cable
yeah .
right .
it doesn 't cost that much more to have one of the pay channels ,
right .
that 's primarily why i have it right now .
yeah ,
yeah .
i thought when i got my v c r , i 'd probably drop it ,
that was years ,
say you did , starters and bendix springs such as that on an old one .
yeah ,
helped my wife replace some carburetors .
yeah .
some that , she had to , label everything
she had to label everything .
yeah
None
what was she driving ?
it was a cadillac .
uh -huh .
they quit making those , the  quieter jet  carburetor
they quit making it .
yeah .
they rebuilt it
it never did run right again .
yeah ,
 quad    not really easy to get rebuilt just right .
yeah .
what were you replacing the starters and bendix on ?
a maverick and also , a chrysler station wagon before that .
yeah .
did you replace just the , bendix on the chrysler station wagon or the whole starter ?
the ,
i 'm replacing the , two or three starters on the chrysler .
yeah .
they ,
the starters are kind of fragile .
yeah
the ,
especially if you need a tune -up .
uh -huh .
they kept saying that 's what chryslers did , is they wore out starters .
yeah ,
if they start real easy , you just hit the key
yeah .
it starts up when it 's properly tuned up , that starter will last for a long time .
uh -huh .
they built that starter so it would fit every v eight and all the slant sixes that they 've built in thirty -five years .
right .
they all take the exact same starter .
they 'll interchange completely .
i mean completely .
one starter will fit all of them .
they 've got a whole lot of torque ,
to do that , they did it ,
use an underdrive system ,
uh -huh .
they geared it down so the motor spins really fast so it 's got , to spin for very long ,
it 's kind of tough on the bushings .
yeah .
usually what goes is the bushings .
right .
you take a little time , replace the bushings , you still got a perfectly good starter .
most places don 't rebuild them with good enough bushings .
uh -huh .
it 's ,
after you get rebuilt one , you have a tendency to go through them pretty quickly , especially if you need a tune -up .
yeah .
what are you driving now ?
my chrysler van
it 's pretty maintenance free ,
at the beginning of the year last year drove a chevrolet cavalier station wagon
it didn 't give me any trouble at all .
that 's good .
yeah .
it was a late model ,
is that chrysler van ?
it 's a eighty -seven .
yeah ,
one of the little mini vans ?
uh -huh ,
yeah .
is a ,
do you like the way it rides and stuff ?
rides or runs ?
rides rough ?
it ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
it rides rough ,
it runs good .
yeah .
i kind of ,
it took me a while to get used to a four cylinder engine .
yeah .
you have to kind of wait for it , especially when you get on the highway .
yeah ,
right now , without getting some of the sportier models , the four cylinders aren 't real peppy .
yeah .
they 're starting to change that out in the last couple of years , too .
you driven american cars all ,
yeah ,
i 've driven one im -,
i drove a volkswagen beetle for a while , about a month .
in a month i think i put , three oil coolers on it .
go -,
every time i turned around i was having trouble with it .
uh -huh .
everything else i ever owned was american built . mostly older cars .
i 've been a mechanic ,
i starting working my father 's service station when i was about , twelve .
uh -huh .
i 've been around cars a lot , but , driven a lot of old pontiacs .
my first three cars were , seventy model pontiacs . a g t o and a bonneville and a station wagon .
i had a couple of chryslers .
had a super b for a while with a four forty in it .
uh -huh .
it was a lot of fun .
None
not much gas mileage , though .
i don 't know ,
gas mileage wasn 't too bad .
it got about seventeen .
wow .
till you got crazy with it .
you get the four barrel all worked up
suddenly
yeah .
long as you didn 't spin the tires too much or spend too much time with the secondaries kicked in it , it didn 't do too bad on gas .
didn 't have to work too hard to move the car around .
do you think since they started with electronic ignition that it improves the way the car runs ?
yeah ,
yeah ,
definitely .
uh -huh .
yeah ,
the ,
my last g m car was a seventy chevy station wagon
it still had the points and condenser in it .
when i rebuilt the engine on that , about a hundred and thirty thousand on the car .
yeah .
i , pulled that old points distributor out and got , an h e i electronic distributor put into it .
i really enjoy reading the newspaper ,
we get the daily , dallas morning news
i try to look at it .
if i get busy i don 't get a chance to pick it up , like this week i noticed several copies haven 't been touched
None
do you have time to read the paper in the morning ?
not in the morning ,
if the ,
i have two children
if they , go out to play or something i like to keep my eye on them so i 'll , maybe go outside and read the paper while they 're playing or sit in a chair by the window or something .
a lot of people don 't take newspapers at all .
we took the morning news for a while ,
uh -huh .
we 've been taking the times herald for ages
dog just ran off with my shoe ,
went outside , picked it up and ran off .
we switched the morning news
we found we couldn 't read enough of it
by the time i got home and had time to read some ,
i guess the issue is , beside the newspaper , do you take any news magazines ?
i don 't take , time , or newsweek or anything like that ,
i do like to watch , c n n .
i have several chores and things to do ,
it comes on at , nine o 'clock p m
i will turn that on while i 'm doing some work
i can hear the news , not have to sit right down and listen to it .
did you hear what schwartzkopf had to say about , pete arnett , and , the news coverage ?
he didn 't have too good of opinion of it ,
no ,
yes i did hear that
i do try to keep that in mind that whenever you 're reading a paper it usually has a particular flavor .
any , time magazine and even the news that ,
sometimes that ,
that 's why i like some diversity the idea that , we have time which we take from time to time
we ,
the problem is they call up and make this deal ,
None
uh -huh .
we 're taking that
we also hit the garland , garland daily news ,
i guess it comes out sporadically , like ,
uh -huh .
twice a week or some -,
i think what 's interesting is that as difficult as it is , or as much as they try , they put some bias ,
i had the chance to hear tracy rowlett speak to a group
it was interesting that they think that they 're basically impartial .
None
that ,
people accuse them of controlling the news he says , we don 't control the news we just report it the way it is .
uh -huh .
None
i would really say that that 's not true , because it seems like certain newspapers always espouse certain candidates ,
yes .
news stations always tell the story from a certain angle
that 's why it 's a good idea to get a wide variety of coverage so that you get a lot of different opinions .
you may never get the truth ,
you 'll have a variety to choose from .
yeah ,
i thought that was particularly interesting in the gulf war , that there were pieces of information that were apparently , leaked just as , a ploy .
uh -huh .
which was ,
i find that fascinating that ,
yeah ,
i do , too .
do you ever listen to the radio
any ,
i listen to k r l d , and , k l i f , the news talk radio .
uh -huh .
i actually listen to c n n radio .
do you know it was on radio now ?
no ,
i don 't .
it 's on eleven ninety .
i really , have gotten out of the habit of listening to the radio from any kind of , even music
None
when i go to work i listen .
yeah ,
my husband does
it 's how come he usually calls me sometimes ,
and says , i just heard on the news that such and such happened , if it 's something really interesting
yeah .
i 'll know to keep an eye out for it ,
i 've got out of the habit of listening to the radio .
with your ,
if you 're around the home , though and can watch t v and read the paper , the problem is that about twenty minutes of news radio , or thirty minutes is
they start repeating everything .
uh -huh .
it 's kind of a ,
that 's what 's interesting is the c n n ,
i 'm trying to think if it 's much local .
i listen to a little of that
i listen to a little of ninety point one .
i 'm inveterate switcher .
uh -huh
that and ninety -eight point seven , i 'm eclectic approach .
do you have a particular local channel that you watch ?
i watch channel five
that has to be ,
that 's another bias .
uh -huh .
that has to do with the weather reporting .
i 'm not sure that ,
i think channel eight is probably ,
i know dave fox ,
he goes to our church
None
we 're fairly new to the area
we 're still shopping
the ,
for a favorite channel .
channel eight when they came here thirteen , fourteen years ago , dave fox and tracy rowlett came together ,
uh -huh .
from oklahoma city
apparently channel eight was way down
now they have turned it all around and done a pretty remarkable job
they 've been some people move around
john chriswell is , the ,
i don 't know ,
do you seem to ,
can you tell much difference between the local radio , t v stations ?
i really think so .
i noticed on channel eight that there 's all of the , anchors , seem to be like white anglo saxon protestant type people
they all seem to be , fairly similar
i kind of prefer some females ,
i don 't recall that they have any female anchors
i like the anchors to be different kinds of people .
i think that adds to the diversity ,
i think that , i like that .
uh -huh .
there , i know , john wylie price ,
i don 't know if you kept up ,
he 's been protesting ,
yes
i have
i prefer to have a little bit of variety like that because i think you 're more likely to get ,
yeah ,
i think he has legitimate argument .
you can ,
i grew up in alabama
i have some prejudices .
uh -huh .
i think that from a justice standpoint , because we have the option of not watching that station .
uh -huh .
i 'm totally in favor of affirmative action in some of the programs
yeah .
i think that , in some cases this should be some real opportunity and some diversity , and this kind of thing
i think that , dallas , it turns out , though from what i understand , has quite good ,
i occasionally go to saint louis .
uh -huh .
and , there for a few days and watch the news and think dallas really does have quite good news .
i think channel eight is the number one , a b c affiliate in the u s .
i think tracy rowlett was saying that he ,
really ?
course he pumping his own
we ,
all of the stations seem to be pretty good ,
it 's just we haven 't found one that we 've snuggled into .
where 'd you move from ?
houston .
we had a favorite ,
i did , have a favorite channel that i usually tuned into for local news .
i guess because you get use to , you like the anchors ,
yeah .
you feel comfortable with them
None
it is interesting though ,
it becomes a little of personality .
in fact , the guy that was on , the weatherman on channel eight worked for me , long time ago ,
uh -huh .
twenty years or so , even longer than that . twenty -one , twenty -three years ago or so , twenty -four , long time ago
shortly after we got here fourteen years ago
they had fired him , because he was too t -,
he didn 't have the personality ,
uh -huh .
and wasn 't drawing the crowds
that 's interesting .
that 's what the t v stations do .
they 're trying to get ratings .
that 's true .
i think ,
their job .
if we remember that they 're out after the ratings .
that 's true .
that really effects how they report the news .
it 's like the dale hansen on channel eight sometimes a little too cutesy
None
is he the sports ,
i wonder if we 're coming up on ten minutes .
have you been on the conversation when they beeped you at ten minutes ?
yeah ,
i guess it is time to close now , so i can run go help put the kids to bed .
okay ,
good talking to you .
yeah .
goodnight .
bye -bye .
are you a t i -er ?
no ,
no ,
i work there as a temporary .
really .
are you at t i ?
yeah .
you have to do the random drug testing .
yeah ,
yeah ,
yeah .
in fact with me , it 's not much to talk about ,
i 'm so much for it .
i don 't really have much to comment about it .
there 've been some interesting subject that they 've called about .
how many times have you called ,
have you been participating in this ?
about ten or eleven calls .
you got ten ,
right .
you 've passed me up .
this is about six times .
oh .
as contract person we have to do random drug testing , too .
yeah .
it doesn 't bother me .
i don 't feel like it 's really a violation of privacy or anything .
no ,
i think it 's good .
in fact , i don 't know what the statistics were ,
i think that they were surprised to find it so low .
i think they were expecting to find , the national average at t i .
i think it was tremendously down .
as far as the number of drug users , you mean ?
huh .
yeah as far as the number of people they actually found that were drug users .
i think that on when i was at t i of course , we had all the information before they started .
right .
they said that a certain number of people that the heavy drug users would either quit or go in rehabilitation programs .
i think that 's what helps , that in the warning that you have a drug program , the people that are worried about it or are taking drugs , actually go
usually a lot of them partake in some of the benefits of rehabilitation and everything .
right ,
yeah ,
that 's real beneficial for the company and the employee .
yeah ,
our numbers have been way down .
i don 't know what they were .
when i worked for the temporary agency as a permanent person ,
we had ,
when we sent temporaries to t i , we had to have their drug tested .
yeah .
we did have a couple of cases where the person said that they hadn 't used anything ,
their test came back positive ,
normally we didn 't retest them .
there were a couple of people that we really thought that they were telling the truth
we retested them the next day ,
really .
they came back negative the second time .
that 's the only thing , i think , that might be a little bit of a problem .
you 're ,
that 's a good point ,
at t i before they had the testing , i 've forgotten , seems like it 's a year ago september , something like that , they told us that the agency that did it was the one that did it for the government .
of course , that 's critical , just as the point that you brought up that whoever does your testing 's got to be , have a lot of quality control , that they keep track of everything .
they don 't make mistakes .
right .
that would be terribly embarrassing for someone to really come back positive
they were not .
i haven 't heard of any ,
i 'm not in personnel or anything .
yeah .
they say that there , it 's almost down to zero where people come back and say they are positive and they 're not .
in other words , there 's very few mistakes ,
that , of course , has got to be critical .
it 's got to be , if you have a drug testing program ,
it 's got to be with a very , very good agency .
you don 't just have some local group do it .
it 's got to be a highly qualified agency .
right ,
yeah ,
not just some doctor 's office somewhere .
no ,
you don 't want to do that .
it 's got to be a laboratory that does quality control and double check .
i think that t i is latched themselves up with an established group .
that would be good for any company that does it , and not to have just a very casual thing .
it 's got to be with a , first class , totally independent agency . not local of course .
ours , i think it was in the south somewhere ,
it wasn 't even in dallas , the one that did us .
really .
yeah .
do they have a policy where they counsel people if they come back positive ,
do they fire them right away .
no .
they 're not fired .
they have one chance to then go in a program .
you come back positive , you have one chance to go in , and go into , they have a lot of , rehabilitation , both for alcohol and for drug use ,
they have an agency where you can go for personal problems , financial or whatever .
right .
they don 't ,
no ,
it 's not firing first .
it 's , definitely trying to encourage people to rehabilitate .
in fact , again , before you go , that 's why i said , when they first started it , they had a rehabilitation program in effect that said if you worried about this and you may have taken drugs , go ahead and get rehabilitated first ,
they won 't say anything about it .
right .
i think that 's really good .
sure .
i know some places just fire people on the spot if they come back positive or something .
yeah ,
no ,
that 's not right .
it 's really an illness , or whatever you want to say that it is .
it 's a weakness and all ,
all of us have weaknesses of one kind or another .
i think that those people that have that and however they got into it ,
i have children ,
i always worry about the classical thing that you see on t v , where the drug pushers give it to the kids for free , and get them sucked in ,
they sell it to them .
right .
you know the classical thing is to give it away .
i always worry about my teenage daughters going to some party
they slip it to them .
i don 't know ,
i don 't even have that much knowledge to know whether that would get them addicted or not ,
that 's a real worry .
yeah ,
some of the stories you read about cocaine , that 's like people try it one time and they 're addicted .
my husband is a counselor ,
he works , mostly with adolescents .
you know a lot about that .
yeah ,
i hear a lot of horror stories about things like that .
uh -huh .
most of the time it 's they get into the wrong crowd first ,
they start a drug problem .
yeah .
it 's usually not a one time accidental thing , i don 't think .
yeah ,
i know ,
i 'm glad of that .
i have , pretty good luck , or very good luck with my daughters on so far ,
that 's my conference call ,
i have one daughter still at home .
one 's at u t
one 's at home , gets dozen calls a night .
i 'll let you go if you want to go ahead and take that ,
no ,
no ,
i don 't care about that ,
she 'll be on the phone all night .
yeah ,
right .
it seems if you watch what kind of crowd that start running around with and kind of keep up with who their friends are that 's best way to avoid trouble , from what i can gather .
do you have children ?
no
not yet ,
great ,
we 're expecting a baby in july ,
we 're starting .
fantastic experience .
i 've got two , as i said , i 've at u t now in austin , and one at home ,
i always say that i 've learned so much more from them than i ever taught them .
yeah .
it 's a fantastic experience .
we 're really excited about it .
yeah .
one thing my husband believes is if you suspect your kids are having any kind of problems , he believes you should take your kids in for a random testing , on a saturday morning , if they 've been out at a party friday night .
yeah .
if you 're not too sure what 's going on , he tells parents all the time , haul them into the doctor 's office and get them checked .
the key thing that i think , that we try to do , is that bring all the friends over here .
right .
have our house as a place where they can come at any time , so that you always see their friends rather than make them not welcome
they 're always over in someone else 's house .
we 've been lucky that our house is usually the place where the kids could come ,
uh -huh ,
yeah ,
i think that 's a really good thing to encourage .
you can make judgments and make comments or whatever you want .
at least you see what 's going on ,
you always have your house welcome , then your children think that , you 're cool parents and all that .
right
good luck with your expected baby there .
thanks .
my wife was talking in my ear ,
she reminded me to say that they 're very cheap until they get to start driving .
uh -huh .
we have one , of course , i say , in college driving . and one going to drive this summer ,
kids cost you practically nothing , because you always get so many things from your relatives and everything .
you wait until they go and get a car , insurance , that 's when they get expensive .
yeah .
as they get older they cost practically nothing from one to five ,
slowly but surely starts to creep up when they start to take lessons ,
it 's well worth it and everything .
yeah ,
yeah ,
i think it 'll be neat .
be a great experience really .
you still there ?
yea .  ]
okay ,
i thought i was cut off there .
i don 't have much to say about drug testing .
no ,
i can 't think of anything else to say about that either .
you 've done this ten times ?
yeah .
did you get the booklet on how to get the gifts and all ?
no ,
i don 't work for t i ,
i get cash .
okay .
i didn 't know what they were going to do .
they sent us a little booklet ,
i just got it a week or so ago saying , so many calls will be something a prize and everything .
right .
that great .
what kind of cash ?
i 've forgotten what they going to do .
None
was it five dollars a call ?
yeah ,
five dollars a call .
hope they follow through and everything .
technically we 're not supposed to talk about the phone calls while we 're on them
i guess we better get off .
right ,
yeah ,
it was good talking to you .
alright .
bye -bye now .
bye .
wayne , i 've never done any , auto repairs myself at all .
uh -huh .
i may have screwed in a little screw that looked like it was falling out on the door or something
i personally haven 't done anything .
maybe i 've , changed wiper blades or something
i have noticed since , i got married that my husband , he hates to do auto repairs ,
he would rather do them himself than to pay someone else .
i guess , he can 't make himself pay someone to do the repairs when he knows how to do it ,
he 'll do it .
he hates the time that he takes ,
he has changed , the brakes
he has done all of the tune -ups
the   like that
recently he changed the steering mechanism in  the  car .
i was really impressed with that
we had to have it to get the car inspected ,
it wouldn 't pass inspection
he priced around
everyone wanted several hundred dollars for it
he thought , i can get one in a junkyard for like fifty dollars , which he did
he did it
i guess , he 's been pretty good about keeping our cars up ,
what 's your experience been like ?
i have a long experience with cars .
when i was younger , my brother had a corvette
i bought a corvette
when you have a corvette you more or less do all the work
i 've done everything from build the motor from the bare block on up .
i 'm the same way as your husband is when it comes to my car , i hate to go pay somebody good money ,
i hate to pay somebody twenty -five dollars on hour for something i can do myself .
uh -huh .
it just , to me it makes absolutely no economic sense to do that .
right .
in fact , i , just this past weekend put new plugs in both , my car an my wife 's car .
uh -huh .
i pretty much try to troubleshoot and do everything i can do myself
i 've gotten to the point in my life , where i don 't want to crawl underneath the car anymore
that makes sense .
i don 't know whether i 've just reached a point ,
it 's real rough in the winter time .
yes .
i try to make sure that , by the time fall runs around ,
right
that , the car 's in pretty good shape enough to last through the winter
springtime i usually end up giving them , a tune -up and make sure that they 're running well ,
it 's like i had the muffler go out on my car , shortly before it was required to go ,
in maryland they have , emission tests .
uh -huh .
you 're required to get your car and go through the emission test ,
my muffler , of course , starting going bad right before i was supposed to go to the emission test ,
i had to do that job ,
of course , that was back in december when it 's nice and cold outside
yes ,
i 'm sure it was .
the thing was that i could do the job myself ,
the parts cost me , roughly a hundred dollars .
uh -huh .
if i 'd taken it someplace and have it done it was going to be three hundred twenty -five .
right .
    who 's got that extra two and a quarter
i know i don 't .
yeah .
that 's exactly the way he feels is that , he really hates to spend the time ,
it takes a lot of time
if he thinks it 's going to be two hours , it 's four if , whatever , it always takes him twice as long .
then when he 's finished he always says , now you owe me three hundred dollars
he thinks that he has the money that he can spend on something
he hasn 't given it to someone else .
yeah .
he gets some satisfaction out of that although , generally i think he does not look forward to or anticipate ,
there 's some people that enjoy tinkering around on cars .
there 's a lot of people
he just isn 't one of them .
yeah .
i don 't mind it ,
there was a time when i had my corvette ,
of course , i loved it ,
if ,
i 've got other interests now
there 's a lot , other more important things i think i should be doing with my time .
i have the same problem ,
you can tell him from me
it doesn 't matter ,
i 've had greasy fingernails for years
it still takes me twice as long as i think it 's going to take to do the job ,
yeah .
i think the difference is that , when you own the car you take more care in what you 're doing ,
uh -huh .
you want to make sure that it 's done right and put back together right ,
i 've in the past i 've had brake jobs done by someone that when i went back and looked at it some months later i 'd find something drastically wrong with it ,
right .
like a spring that was put in incorrectly which could have resulted in brakes failing and me having an accident .
right .
those kind of things ,
when you have a vehicle that 's being used by , other members of your family , you don 't want that kind of a situation to come up .
no .
it 's very , very difficult to find a mechanic these days that you can trust .
i only have one guy that i know that i trust to work on my car .
uh -huh .
he 's about sixty miles from here .
it ,
if i have something that 's really major that i can 't handle or feel i don 't have the time to handle , i 'll take it to him to do it .
right ,
you know , that  it 's ,   , really has a bad reputation is to feel that people in general feel and have rightly so , i think been cheated many times ,
 uh -huh
 yes .
i know once when we had a ,
we usually   inspection time we find out there 's something wrong with our car
once the muffler needed to be changed
he had looked at him himself
we saw a commercial for fourteen or twenty dollars or something for a change
he said , that 's really , really good
he went in
when they quoted him a price they really wanted fifty or something .
the car that the muffler people had , at least my husband felt that they had damaged the muffler further ,
they had punctured a big hole in it when it really could have just been patched or whatever ,
uh -huh .
since then , i don 't think he 's ever even seriously considered any kind of job he thought he could do himself .
i know from his childhood , he says that his father always buys and restores cars just as entertainment , i guess .
kelly growing up , he felt like that was a good way on saturday 's that he developed a good relationship with his father .
uh -huh .
they used car repairs kind of as a way to have something that they did together ,
uh -huh .
yeah .
he thought that turned out pretty good because it helped him to understand and be functional now ,
it helped him to have a close relationship ,
that 's one way he looked at it .
yeah .
that 's probably , something that , is good for both of them .
i know that , my older son i could never get him interested in cars
i couldn 't ,
i just like ,
you sure you 're a boy ,
your not interested in cars ,
uh -huh .
he just would not have anything to do with them .
later on and like when he , grew up , got out of the house , got his own car , he didn 't know how to do anything to it . absolutely nothing .
he couldn 't even check the oil .
that 's how uninformed he was and disinterested .
uh -huh .
i guess there are some people out there like that ,
i always thought maybe , if he took more of an interest and , what i was doing
maybe we could have communicated better .
uh -huh .
yeah ,
i think that 's great .
yeah ,
it didn 't always work .
i feel like i could myself , do some things but , that i have enough responsibility that if i have someone like my father when i was living at home , and my husband , that 's willing to do it , i go ahead and let them do it .
i don 't feel the need to , be a feminist on that issue and say i can take care of my own things .
i 'm happy to let them run the cars because i have so , many other responsibilities
i haven 't tried to do a lot myself .
i trained my wife in the hou -, in doing things ,
in fact , when i , first transferred down to , texas instruments back in nineteen eighty -seven ,
uh -huh .
when i left here , she had to change a set of plugs on the car
uh -huh .
because she was up here for a month or so , after i was
it was an interesting experience for her .
she 'd always assisted me and done some other things
for her to actually get in there and do it herself it was something , a little different .
it 's a good experience ,
it helps you feel , i think comfortable with your car and feel like , it 's not so , scary if , your driving it and you might get stranded somewhere that you might , think , i 've been under that hood
i know what 's going on
None
yeah ,
yeah ,
i think it 's important that everyone know , basically how the darn engine works ,
uh -huh .
it helps you figure out what 's wrong with it ,
uh -huh .
None
i 've been out with my sister before when , her car died on the highway
i happened to be with her and managed to get her to the other side of the road because it was dark and all ,
women ?
yeah ,
the changing roles of women , how roles changed
what do you see coming in the future .
okay ,
that 's not a broad enough topic
okay ,
yeah .
sounds good .
i 'm ready when you are .
okay ,
hold on .
okay .
are you there ?
yeah ,
i 'm here .
my goodness ,
i can 't believe i did that .
okay ,
hold on .
that 's okay .
okay ,
i .
okay ,
i don 't know ,
are you in your thirties ,
None
no ,
i 'm twenty -three .
okay .
 uh -huh . 
  then i can tell you that roles have changed .
i 'm thirty -eight
 uh -huh ,
uh -huh . 
 they  changed quite a bit .
 uh -huh . 
  i ,
this was my twentieth high school reunion , in chicago .
uh -huh .
basically , the choices ,
you probably heard that in the fifties women liked to stay home and all that .
right ,
uh -huh .
that 's kind of , the opposite of what it was in the sixties and early seventies .
right .
it was sort of just to go protest ,
 uh -huh . 
  just , everybody be damned and live with some one ,
None
 uh -huh ,
i know that , th -, 
 social morals were a  little bit lacking .
uh -huh ,
i know that , in the early seventies , i think women were the first people to make a move as far as individuals .
uh -huh .
before that a lot of people that wanted to protest were large groups like , black people , or , just large , large groups of people ,
the ,
right
it was more civil rights oriented ,
right ,
or race oriented rather than gender based ,
yeah .
i think the women 's movement kind of brought in individual lives where you had women 's movements
you had gay movements ,
 uh -huh . 
 and  just the smaller groups of people .
 it did . 
 i  think since then is when a lot of the women 's roles have started to change .
it did
some of the other stuff that , i think that changed it , when i first got out of college fifteen years ago , they were always saying if you were assertive you were a libber ,
you were aggressive not assertive and independent .
 uh -huh . 
  in terms of the corporate community , i 've seen a big change in terms of men finally being quote , unquote , used to women ,
 uh -huh . 
 who  are in , controlling positions ,
 exactly . 
 in the corporate hierarchy .
 uh -huh
 i  think that 's good .
i think that , you can just look at home life and see , i 've been talking to a lot of people about education and things ,
 uh -huh . 
  and what affects the school system
i think that a big thing that effects it is that the mother is not home anymore ,
 right . 
  like she used to be .
she used to be kind of a rock ,
 the mainstay ,
yeah . 
 in the house ,
 yeah .
since everyone is going out and working now , whether it be because of finances or just the economy ,
 and restructuring , stepfamilies ,
yeah . 
 the mother 's not  there anymore
the children are ,
i think a lot of society is suffering .
not to say that women shouldn 't , go out and do what they want to do
i think that ,
 right . 
 society 's  really going to have to get used to it .
they 're not quite used to it yet
that 's i ,
the schools or the parents ,
yeah .
yes ,
uh -huh .
i 'm trying to think of what else .
i have a lot of opinions on this except all of a sudden i went blank
a lot of the things , the demographics do ,
there are more ,
i don 't have the numbers in my head right now ,
a lot of the things that brought feminism , there are just more women in the demographics , just generally ,
 right ,
uh -huh . 
 in the  united states , in terms of being ,
 uh -huh . 
 i 'm the typical baby boomer ,
i hate that term ,
 yeah . 
 yeah . 
 in  terms of  women  going out , twenty -three , i remember that .
what 's it like to be twenty -three as a woman today ,
when i was twenty -three the issues were either go to graduate school or get married ,
 uh -huh . 
  those were the general issues .
speaking of getting married , i was talking to someone yesterday on this , on the project ,
 uh -huh . 
  we were talking about child care
he asked me if i had any kids .
he was about forty or fifty years old
i said no , i 'm just twenty ,
 he was ancient ,
yeah . 
 i said no ,  i 'm just twenty -three ,
 uh -huh . 
 because i don 't think of myself as needing to have children
the first thing he says is , don 't you miss that part of your life .
i just ,
i ,
my mind just went ,
you didn 't know what you 're going to be missing .
i went , what .
None
it really doesn 't even occur to me right now to have children ,
becau -,
i don 't have any either
i 've been a married for eleven years ,
None
yeah ,
it just ,
i think that i 'll probably have children when i 'm about thirty , thirty -five , something like ,
 yeah ,
when it 's time ,
uh -huh . 
 just because , i 'm not sure  if it 's just me , or women in general that are twenty -three right now , because , i 'm really into my career .
 yeah ,
you want to establish , 
i 'm trying to go somewhere ,  and get there quick worry about , because right now , in my career i 'm really starting out ,
it 's going to take me a while to move up .
 uh -huh , 
  i don 't need anything kind of holding me back ,
right
you 'll find that that 's the other big thing that has changed in terms of ,
 uh -huh . 
  women don 't feel like they need to get married anymore .
 right ,
uh -huh . 
 i was  twenty -seven when i got married
i just at the time ,
my husband actually even jokes about it .
 uh -huh . 
 he  was twenty -three when we met
i was at a point where it was like , i didn 't date ,
i just , went out to have a good time ,
 right . 
  i didn 't have to have male companionship .
right ,
right .
a lot of the , friends that i had in school at that point , who had gone back and gone to law school , or m b a programs ,
uh -huh .
which i also had done , they were very sad .
then by the time i got married ,
 uh -huh . 
 it  seemed like they were on their second or third around the marriage track .
yeah ,
yeah ,
i guess that 's a big change in terms of , just , the attachments that women feel like they need to have , the dependency ,
 yeah ,
yeah , 
 their self -identity  is stronger .
it 's just really not there anymore .
 yeah . 
  that has to do with , the women getting out and other women seeing other women ,
 right . 
 out  in the corporate world .
 uh -huh . 
 that 's  like , i can do that .
maybe ,
right ,
 i don 't know 
 i don 't need to get married . 
how old your mom is ,
she 's probably ,
let 's see my mother 's in her early sixties ,
None
 she 's , she 's about forty . 
 okay ,
i 'm thirty -eight , 
your mother 's for -,
i just turned thirty -eight .
  yes
i 'm laughing ,
my god .
it does start to creep up .
 uh -huh . 
 no , 
it 's okay ,
don 't ever let age ,
i don 't thi -,
 okay . 
 nobody  talks about it for women except other women and other men .
i just turned twenty -three ,
 uh -huh . 
 april  twentieth ,
i 'm still going , my god , i 'm getting so old .
i just ,
me , myself , i just like to move really , really quickly .
 yeah ,
an , 
 i like  to ,
anything i do ,
i got out of school quick .
None
 uh -huh . 
 i 'm  working quick .
i want to move up quick .
i want to make money quick .
i want to retire quick .
 yeah . 
 anything ,
when the age creeps up , where i 'm twenty -three and twenty -four ,
 uh -huh . 
 i 'm  thinking my time is running out .
i 'm actually very , very young .
yeah ,
you are , because what i was going to say is , what you will find is , my background is in journalism and corporate communications ,
 uh -huh . 
  what you 'll find is ,
i 'm just now finally to a point where ,
i don 't know why i didn 't do it sooner ,
 uh -huh . 
  this is probably typical of the women 's movement too ,
 uh -huh . 
 is  the idea that you 're going to be forty tomorrow anyway , if you want to go back to school .
i 'm seriously considering going back to school for law .
None
  which is a complete , i wouldn 't say career change , it 's a  subway   ,
 uh -huh . 
  it 's still is a different application .
if you think about it , i still can have another career .
i 've worked for over fifteen years in what i 've done .
 yeah ,
yeah . 
 when you 're saying quick , i think that 's probably one thing that your generation coming up after mine ,
 uh -huh . 
 is  thinking that , they have to do everyth -, sort of ,
 right . 
 i call it a chewing syndrome .
they have to eat real fast
 uh -huh ,
exactly . 
 they have  rapidity of speech ,
they have to just go through everything .
 exactly . 
  you 'll find that probably by the time your twenty -eight , thirty , if you haven 't slowed down ,
 uh -huh . 
 something  will slow you down .
do you know what i 'm saying ?
yeah ,
yeah ,
it 's just , you find out that you 're really not , smelling the roses ,
i know that sounds trite ,
 yeah , 
 and  all that .
i think a lot of , people probably feeling that way ,
i know , i 'm probably feeling that way because everything 's geared towards young .
 uh -huh . 
None
whether i want to realize it or not , everything on television is young ,
 it is . 
 young , young , young .
 you can 't be a model after thirty ,
you can 't do this after twenty ,
None
 that 's right . 
  everybody that 's in the music business is starting out at fifteen .
 uh -huh . 
None
i feel like i 'm old .
it 's like  i  sing
i would really love to become ,
 uh -huh . 
  a professional singer ,
i think i 'm too old now ,
 you 're not ,
no . 
 i 'm twenty -three , 
 no . 
  everyone i 've seen coming up , they 're fifteen .
 that 's true
it 's , 
None
i 'm going ,  i 'm so old
i really have to always tell myself , no , you 're not , you 're very young .
 no ,
you 're extremely ,
yeah ,
it 's ju -, 
 it 's , 
it 's like us , we 're getting ready to do , if possible , for an adoption
i have friends that say why would you do that ,
 uh -huh . 
 if  you know you haven 't been able to children , which we do know ,
uh -huh .
why would you do that now , at this point ,
it 's just individual choices .
 yeah . 
 i  stopped comparing myself a long time ago to somebody who had ,
in my family my brother 's children ,
 uh -huh . 
 he just turned forty ,
his children will be out of high school before he 's forty -five .
wow .
that 's like your mother ,
look how young she is ,
 uh -huh ,
yeah . 
 compared to  where you are out of school and everything .
 right . 
 it 's  just , it ,
what you find is you don 't compare the woman , because you just get into trouble .
it 's all independent and choices .
uh -huh ,
yeah ,
very true .
what i was going to say about mothers is , your mother probably just won 't say it ,
my mother and her sisters are always saying , to my cousins and i , my female cousins ,
 uh -huh . 
 you  girls are so lucky because quote , unquote , you have all these choices ,
you went to school ,
 right ,
uh -huh . 
 you can  do this ,
you can do that ,
 uh -huh . 
 we  couldn 't do that then .
my cousins and i go , why couldn 't you
yeah ,
that 's why i say i feel really lucky right now , because i 'm not married and because i don 't have children .
i 'm out of school ,
i 'm twenty -three ,
i can do anything i want to do , anything .
 uh -huh . 
 even some days i 'm looking for another job now ,
i get so depressed not because i can 't find a job , but because i can 't figure out what i want to do .
that 's normal ,
None
 yeah , 
 i think  that 's the world today .
i thi -,
i 'm lucky though , because not a lot of people can sit there and go gee , i don 't know what to do .
i have so mu -,
 right
that 's exa -, 
None
not  a lot of people ,
 yeah . 
  it 's depressing too .
None
 what  do you that you 're ,
what , i 'm right now .
uh -huh .
i 'm a free -lance writer right now .
 oh . 
 what i 'm doing is working at , an electronics company ,
 uh -huh . 
 for  their company newspaper ,
 oh . 
 right  now on the side ,
i 'm also ,
i 'm excited , tomorrow i have a ,  luncheon  appointment with a perspective client to do ,
 huh . 
  marketing communications for them .
okay ,
i 'm a news reporter , now ,
 you are ? 
 what i 'm  looking for is something in , i really don 't want to stay in news ,
i would like to stay in journalism ,
 we -, 
  i 've been looking for something exactly like that jus -,
here 's what you shoul -,
d -,
this is off the topic ,
those people probably won -,
 uh -huh ,
okay 
 did you go  to baylor by any chance ?
no ,
i went to u t at austin .
 okay ,
that 's even better . 
 i just happen  to work at a waco station , because
i went to ,
you in radio , or television or news .
broadcast news , t v ,
my journalism degree is in ,
are you still there ?
yes .
okay ,
it worked out fine .
okay .
we just ate out , had a big lunch because we both have been working late
we had italian ,
have you ever been to the olive garden ?
no ,
i haven 't ,
is that good ?
yeah .
do you really like italian food ?
it 's not my favorite
None
 then don 't , 
 i like  it 's okay .
then this will probably ,
this isn 't really excellent italian food ,
uh -huh .
that sounds terrible to tell you to go somewhere where it 's not that great
it 's ,
you 're not going to believe this
i have to tell you this if i don 't because you 're in plano ,
 that 's okay . 
 my ,  softball unit here is acting like he 's dying of  tramane  poison
it wasn 't that bad ,
it 's very good it 's all of these   run adult males ,
uh -huh .
which i 'm not italian ,
no ,
 , it 's all the garlic bread and all the ,
 oh . 
 salads  you can eat with an entree .
that sounds really good .
it wasn 't too bad it really wasn 't
i was more in the mood for french toast any way
 yeah . 
  i really like italian food though ,
do you have any favorite ?
are there just the two of you ?
yes ,
uh -huh .
okay ,
when my husband and i go out we have four children .
you 're kidding .
that makes a difference .
for us when we go out with the kids obviously we want to go somewhere that we can ,
the fast food ones are probably the ones they like the best .
sure .
we don 't like to go there because that 's the most expensive ,
we like to go to a pizza place where you can buy a pizza for one price and feed the whole family ,
 yeah . 
 and  like that .
you can usually get a variety of what you 're looking for ,
 right . 
  at gatti 's or something like that .
right ,
when my husband and i go out we like to go somewhere with a little atmosphere
we usually head on down , what 's the freeway down here ?
six thirty -five ?
yeah .
uh -huh .
all along that freeway there are restaurant
one of our favorites is pappasito 's .
yeah ,
pappasito 's .
 no ,
we love to go there . 
 we went there on my birthday  in march it 's great .
it always kills me cause i don 't like the decorations so much
it 's too ,
too much like a bar naturally ,
 yeah
 and mexico , 
yeah ,
i know ,
i 've seen it .
i love the food ,
 the food is probably , 
 the food is great . 
i 'm not a i 'm mexican food gourmet by any means
it 's probably the best tasting ,
i don 't know would you classify that as tex -mex ?
yeah ,
uh -huh .
the shredded beef the type of ,
 yeah . 
 spices  or sauces they use .
uh -huh ,
i like to get that ,
it 's a shrimp dish ,
 really . 
  i don 't remember the name of it ,
 uh -huh . 
  it 's rolled up into something ,
it 's really good .
i 've never had anything there that wasn 't delicious .
yeah ,
they are really good .
even though you have to stand in line and all of that , that 's the only thing i don 't like about it too
it 's a little bit with the meat market atmosphere ,
yeah ,
yeah .
even though we don 't have kids we 've been married long enough to , not be around that .
yeah .
i 'm trying to think of what else we like to eat .
the one thing i notice is it 's just , about dining out that you probably can relate to with four children and two of us getting ready to adopt , we find prohibited ,
 uh -huh . 
  just to   cost any more ?
yeah .
lunch today was eighteen dollars .
yeah ,
it 's very expensive .
yeah ,
i don 't know how you feel about that
i think that some of it 's over priced .
yeah
i 'm glad i 'm talking about food normally these conversations are
sometimes it 's hard isn 't it to keep a ,
yeah ,
it is i don 't know ,
no ,
sometimes mark and i , that 's my husband mark ,
 uh -huh . 
  go to the august moon which is down there
it 's a chinese ,
 yeah ,
my husband likes that . 
 restaurant with the lions in  the front ,
yeah ,
off of arapaho down there ?
yeah ,
None
yeah ,
august moon ,
uh -huh .
it 's pretty good as far as chinese ,
chinese isn 't my favorite
None
i don 't like it at all usually
None
he likes it kind of
he  heats us up a good fight 
me i 'm like i said seafood i 'm ,
i like that .
yeah ,
i love seafood ,
None
  i like a lot of different ethnic foods .
i like japanese food .
there 's a place on greenville called  sagar 's 
None
we haven 't been in years down near  presby   ,
i had a meeting down there today
i saw that
i said , gee i remember that they offer you , authentic japanese feeding ,
 oh . 
 or  american or piano bar ,
i remember when we went
 we  were married with another couple that was just dating
i had never had saki .
uh -huh .
it made all raw fish tastes great
if you 're looking for a very ,
it 's very pretty inside ,
 is it ? 
 the  girls wear kimonos and ,
how nice .
if you 're ever looking for that .
yeah .
what other kind of foods ,
i don 't know
we went to a place called grishman 's in greenville ,
 i don 't know that place . 
 which was really over priced . 
was it ?
uh -huh .
they had a great desert bar .
None
that 's what we need isn 't it ?
yeah .
no ,
there 's a lot of nice barbecue places here ,
i like barbecue okay , texas barbecue .
yeah ,
i like ,
 it 's good . 
 barbecue ,
have  you ever been to i think it 's called spring creek barbecue ?
yeah ,
None
 that 's real good , 
 they 're real good . 
yeah .
they are good .
there had ,
my husband 's going upstairs ,
he says free ice cream
yeah ,
free ice cream ,
yeah .
i didn 't know they had that .
yeah .
i can 't talk i had chocolate bavarian tort , for desert ,
 oh . 
 today ,  which i never eat at lunch
it was wonderful .
just to die for exactly .
it was ,
 oh . 
 in heaven 
 in  fact if i could pick my , restaurants on how their coffee is and how their french bread is and the butter and the desert  i  would be in hog heaven .
how are your kids at an age where they can contribute to what they want
do you still order for them ?
my two littlest ,
i just had a baby ,
 congratulations . 
 she 's  six months
my four year old he still ,
my other older two they can .
None
 uh -huh . 
  they 're kind of ,
my littlest girl she 's still wants mcdonald 's , mcdonald 's , mcdonald 's
yeah ,
every child that i even know that eats vegetables , looked five years old still after a certain age realized that there is something called a mcdonald 's .
i 'm telling you .
it 's really sad isn 't it cause it 's hard to get them away from junk then .
it 's kind of funny is sometimes we all want different things ,
 uh -huh . 
 there 's a h avenue down here ,
 uh -huh ,
i know where that , 
 and along are these fast  food restaurants
right
that 's all ,
we all get to go to our own little thing and drive through and get our own thing ,
 we go to park over there so we can all have our own .
 that 's all right as long as , 
 that 's on the nights we can 't decide . 
i was going to say because with six people how do you ,
cause with two we have a problem ,
i can 't even imagine , trying to ,
you sound like you 're doing pretty well with four children .
five of them , they 're good ,
that 's the way the ,
kids .
yeah ,
we 're getting ready to
i shouldn 't say this on this conversation ,
it 's just on my mind ,
we 're getting ready to go overseas to adopt .
how nice .
yeah ,
we 're excited ,
it will be neat .
i think it will be worth it
somebody said to me in terms of ,
this is food so i can say this ,
you have to bring a formula ,
i said what 's that
they laughed
i said i 'm .
 food 's , food . 
 thirty something , 
 yeah . 
   i think that  that would make them drool any way .
yeah ,
yeah .
i guess are you is it a little bit of constricted , because a lot of restaurants don 't take ,
in terms of talking about restaurants , a lot of restaurants , how are they when you have children let alone three or four children ?
 uh -huh . 
you have to be careful if you go to a restaurant  that  really is more adults
 sure . 
 with  the atmosphere and everything ,
they ,
if you 're ,
 uh -huh . 
like we could probably take our oldest son  and  our oldest daughter .
uh -huh .
they know how to act ,
 yeah . 
 i  don 't think i would chance it with my younger ones because they 're just too much of a distraction
some restaurants are really trying to go for that atmosphere kind of thing .
that yuppie kind of crowd , yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
None
i 've been in some places where they say they take children ,
i 've just seen where the wait attendance the wait staff is rude ,
yeah .
that always just bothered me
on the other hand sometimes the children or the adults are themselves
yeah
i don 't know what other kind of restaurants
really pappasito 's we love ,
we went to one italian ,
back on the italian , we went to some place across from collin creek mall that absolutely putrid for italian food .
oh .
i can 't remember the name of it
it 's on ,
is it tia 's , not tia 's ,
no ,
that 's mexican , right across from on the dillard 's side there ,
yeah ,
i know which one it is ,
i can 't think of it .
i can 't ,
yeah
it 's in the strip , yeah ,
it had white tablecloth ,
i think it was paper where you could write on them , or something with crayons
it was just terrible .
dear .
i was shocked ,
the dish was dirty ,
it was one of these you have bad experience and ,
 yeah ,
where you felt 
 say i don 't think i 'll  come back here .
like when you 're in a bad part of italy or something .
dear .
None
oh .
boy ,
other then that i don 't know we do our share of pizza eating too , but more like go get it and carry it in cause we 're too ,
 oh . 
 cheap  to pay the delivery
yeah ,
yeah ,
yeah .
i don 't like strange people coming to my door ,
i 've got selv -,
one of my favorites were
i can 't really think of any other , places .
no ,
except that this makes me fat .
no ,
i 'm just kidding .
yeah ,
you have to watch it if you go out to eat
that 's true .
yeah ,
that 's true ,
you can always blame it on having children ,
no
yeah ,
there you go .
i enjoyed talking to you ,
i guess ,
good luck .
maybe we 'll see you in the restaurants somewhere .
yeah ,
maybe .
okay .
 okay .
bye -bye . 
 bye -bye . 
we 're just starting a family through adoption
i don 't really have a lot of , concrete , opinions .
just what i know out of my peer group , has gone through .
none of it has been good
really ?
yeah .
the ones that can afford to have live -in nannies ,
 huh . 
 they  seem to be having an okay time .
uh -huh .
a lot of the other ones that have , are professional ,
i 'd say fifty percent of , my peers in my circle of friends have tried it and then stopped working until they 're , going to get their children in kindergarten or first grade .
uh -huh .
i ,
 right . 
there must be some good service out there  if you  really look and pay for it .
what age child are you thinking in terms of ?
in terms of what they 're talking about .
no .
for yourselves
oh .
infant .
okay .
 infant . 
 you 're  starting from the baseline .
yeah .
after eleven years of marriage . we are .
it 's happening now .
we 're just going through the process .
i see
the question is , very appropriate .
i 'm not sure how strong the maternal instinct is going to be .
they tell me it 's going to be strong
 right . 
 do you  have children ?
i have one son .
did you put him in daycare
is he older now or younger
None
he 's now eighteen . and has completed a couple of years of university .
sure .
he 's out of daycare  
 i ,
right . 
that ,
 you ,
uh -huh . 
i was working full -time ,   when he was born .
i was very lucky because i was a college professor .
oh .
i was able to , 
  flex  
 yeah . 
it was  walking distance  from  my apartment .
i went up there
i sort of left him with a neighbor .
uh -huh .
i left him in a carry cot when he was very little
i said , he doesn 't need anything except , look at him if he cries .
 yeah . 
don 't pick him up  and  this sort of stuff .
i was gone only an hour at a stretch or an hour and a half .
that 's wonderful .
i was able to , get , his schedule just , cooperated .
right .
None
that 's wonderful .
 yeah . 
 yeah . 
i guess , because of your , profession .
i 'm in corporate communications .
i 've done free -lance writing in the past ,
uh -huh .
what we 're hoping is that ,
my husband thinks i can do it .
i 've just never worked out of a domestic base ,
 uh -huh . 
 i 've always  been in a corporate , environment .
i 'm hoping that possibly i can do something where i can go flextime or part -time
if they don 't have that ,
my boss ,
i 'm very lucky though , again too , my boss is very akin to family building .
 uh -huh . 
i think that 's th -, something that couples need  in going  into this .
right .
i don 't know .
i do think there 's good daycare out there .
what part of the country are you in ?
i 'm in maryland .
you 're in  maryland . 
  i was out of the country when , my son was little .
the thing is , if you have this flextime and that , you might be able to do something similar to what i did .
 right . 
that 's what i 'm hoping .
 which  is be there short times
later on when he was ,
uh -huh .
this ,
we 're talking about , i went back to work or taught some classes a week after he was born .
my goodness .
None
 you were  fortunate .
yeah .
yeah .
 yeah . 
that 's when  i was  saying , don 't pick him up and stuff .
then later what i did was i brought a woman into the house .
uh -huh .
sure .
she was supposed to help me a little bit with cooking and doing the baby 's laundry and this sort of stuff .
uh -huh .
i also came home and sort of was able to see from a distance what she was doing .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
in a sense she carried him around a lot , too much . for my taste .
right .
it was constantly ,  i don 't want him , 
to explore anything .
he might hurt himself  
  do you think that that was in a way though , good objectivity that , that doesn 't really ,
that 's not a correct english 
   ,  in a sense , you see what i 'm saying though .
from a mother 's standpoint , in a way , it was quote and unquote good objectivity .
i think it worked out very , very well .
uh -huh .
 see . 
what he learned to do by the time he was two or so , he would sit next to the desk where i was grading papers  or  writing lesson plans .
uh -huh .
he had asked for a paper and , sort of scribble
 yeah . 
he realized that  there  were quiet times
there were active times .
right .
he also learned that , there were times that you had to be gone , so you probably minimized ,
we 're getting ready .
you 're far enough away now i can tell you since this is locally , i make sure , we 're going to romania in a few weeks .
oh .
that 's ,   just  
 did you  say romania or armenia ?
romania .
okay .
 yeah ,
yeah . 
 as in ,  what twenty twenty we 're real excited because we 've just developed a contact .
good .
through professional people
it 's private
it 's hospital .
we 're just very excited
None
  great .
what 's the word i 'm looking for .
when you deal with issues like that , in terms of family building through adoption , and then you have people responding to you , if you go through that why would you put them in daycare .
 that 's silly . 
  issues are being raised prematurely in my mind .
i guess they 're not because it 's something i 'll have to deal with sooner than later .
what i 've learned to do is just tune out everybody 's opinion .
i feel that if the child is healthy , and as long as we make it feel secure , i 'd love to do something like with what you did .
uh -huh .
i don 't think i could be dumper where i could take it from , eight in the morning till nine at night or six at night and leave it there .
right .
maybe after two or three years old .
i don 't know .
in my opinion , it 's even than .
 yeah . 
 your  kids need you
they need a schedule i think .
i don 't think the united states ,
what country were you , in europe when you were
no ,
i was in the middle east .
that 's
that 's the same thing .
i don 't know how they are there
in eastern europe ,
my stepfather 's from england ,
it just seems the united states does not provide for either child care or elder care , as i call it .
right ,
right .
we 're just not set up for that .
  with the  
 i ,
yeah . 
go ahead .
no ,
i was just going to say , i guess , my sensitivities are much more with the , to be at home .
uh -huh .
i had my grandmother with me from the time she was ninety -two until she died at ninety -seven .
i think that 's wonderful .
that was recently after my son , was going off .
yes ,
in a sense , i went to work
she was at home alone some of the time .
 to . 
still , it was much better than being shipped  to  a daycare center .
right .
which is much my feelings on kids and the elderly .
 we cast off . 
i think we 're too much  towards it 's somebody  problem , 
 right , 
 right .
th -,
i 'm that way .
yeah . 
 i want to work .
shove  them in some school for twelve hours a day .
right .
it 's easier
i agree with that .
yeah .
that 's why i y -,
what is amazing to me is now your son is already grown
you can probably empathize with this .
it 's amazing to me how forthcoming people are with their opinions and thoughts
right ,
right .
in terms of what to do .
i just don 't think there is a good daycare system .
my company , i 'm particularly fortunate that they 're in tune with that .
i 've been at companies where , the trend is , or the definite mood is , we made conscious decisions not to have children .
  that 's sad .
None
in ,
a couple like us building through adoption , there , it 's almost radical to some people .
right .
what you just learn to do is tune everybody else out
i respect , there are some women that i know that are divorced or on their own or in single parenting and men that they may have the need for child care like that .
uh -huh .
i agree with you , that it 's just , i call it dumping
yeah .
 i 
 no ,
 i think that certainly there is a role , for this type of help .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
as long as one can supervise it and , make it work into one 's own schedule without it seeming like dumping or , giving it , the whole job to somebody else to take care of .
then , yeah ,
 it 's  in tandem then .
yeah ,
 yeah
 i just , 
there are trade -offs too i think .
one of the things that is a problem is in terms of compensation to some of the child care providers .
uh -huh .
it 's just , it 's so low
yet the overall cost for somebody doing it on a daily or even a weekly basis , it 's prohibitive .
yeah .
some people that are not making more than twenty thousand a year
there seems to be an alternative in my neighborhood .
 really . 
 is  there are several , mothers who stay home .
uh -huh .
they take ,
it 's probably not completely legal
i ,
maybe it 's legal up to one or two additional kids .
sure .
they take care of another child
i could name five or six people around my neighborhood that really do a good job on this .
uh -huh .
 they ,
yeah . 
 that 's  another possibility
you might want to stay home one year
some other lady might want to stay home for a few years
None
i haven 't thought about that .
yeah .
my neighbor has an eighteen month old
she 's at home part -time paralegal .
i 'm thinking ,
 yeah ,
yeah . 
we get along fantastically
i 'm thinking ,
that 's the way you have to ,
how wa -,
i 'm just real curious .
how was the middle east in terms of that with children ?
is child care or that type of idea completely foreign to them ?
no .
actually there was a daycare center , where my son did go for a year .
i think from when he was two to three .
uh -huh .
then he actually started kindergarten at age three .
uh -huh .
it wasn 't like prekindergarten ,
it was real kindergarten .
really .
he must be  smart .
yeah . 
 yeah .
 he was ready to go to school at that point .
uh -huh .
yeah ,
they do have such facilities .
uh -huh .
for the most part , with the extended family , you can usually find somebody . which is much like our neighbor sharing responsibility .
also there aren 't that many women  who work . 
 the professional . 
yeah ,
i was wondering about  that . 
 yeah . 
there ,
i 'm in dallas
there was just a very big , series about moslem women
uh -huh .
there were enlightening things that broke some of my stereotypical thoughts .
i 'm digressing here
 yeah . 
i was just real curious when you said middle east ,  if you  didn 't mind me asking .
no ,
no .
i didn 't mean israel .
 you assumed right 
 no
that 's okay
 even if you did , that 's okay actually .
 i think 
 no 
at first thought , when i said that not many people work , i 'm thinking she 's going to , because certainly in israel the women do work  
 right .
right .
they fight ,
they work . 
are you a vietnam veteran , dudley ?
no .
no ?
do you have family who were in the vietnam war ?
no .
my father came in right after world war two .
okay .
he was too old ,
you were too young , right ?
i am too young , yeah .
all right .
do you know some folks who have been there ?
yes .
okay .
a couple .
okay .
how did it influence them ?
the one guy i worked with down in austin hated it .
he was a lineman down there .
uh -huh .
while he was there , he caught some kind of a strange disease .
uh -huh .
all his hair fell out ,
he had a hundred and five fever for a while
uh -huh .
None
what about long lasting effects on him ?
has he still suffering from those problems ?
i do not think he was in combat ,
uh -huh .
None
i have talked with a number of vietnam veterans ,
i had no one directly related to me involved .
uh -huh .
my sister 's husband was in vietnam .
it really made a completely different man out of him .
uh -huh .
he went to vietnam one man and came back another , not better .
yeah .
then , another friend of mine went ,
he was in combat .
he came back ,
he said ,  "okay , that is it . that is behind me . i am going on with my life ."
much like what roger staubach did .
right .
he was a vietnam war veteran .
yeah .
None
he was in the navy , though ,
yeah .
 he was 
that is true .
it makes a lot of difference .
right .
most of the folks that i have met that were actually on the land , or in combat , still carry a lot of anger .
uh -huh .
they really do .
i really do not think that we did those young men right .
huh .
i think that , desert storm ,
shows a lot of learning since that time .
yeah .
None
the armed forces did so much to , agent orange ,
they did so much to their own people all during that time .
yeah .
that is true .
yeah .
even now , they take a free hand as far as medicine and , how they treat the war casualties ,
if you come back and your leg is blown off ,
uh -huh .
or it is hanging by a thread , they still can 't put it back together now .
uh -huh .
what they do afterwards and how they rehabilitate you .
uh -huh .
one of the most troublesome things that i have encountered as a result is the incredible influx of southeast asians into this country since that conflict .
yeah .
not so ,
much that i say ,
i do not want you here .
there is just such a surge of southeast asians .
it has affected the culture of this country ,
yeah .
very much .
it 's about nine or ten percent now .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
the culture is changing .
look how much more oriental food we have , restaurants now ,
uh -huh .
for example .
even ten years ago , there were not that many .
a lot of shops are operated by southeast asians .
 that 's true 
a lot of people have complained in the schools .
there is a culture change there .
the southeast asians seem to be very hungry ,
there seem to be very studious .
tends to cause our kids to really have to buckle down to keep up with them , which is not bad .
no .
not really .
it might in the long run you can see where scholarships , for example ,
uh -huh .
even jobs . jobs that would normally go to an american , with a lesser education , might be going to some of these people here .
that is all a result of vietnam .
you see a lot of men that were over there , brought families back .
yeah .
that is ,
it concerns me that there is probably a lot of mixed breed youngsters still there .
uh -huh .
i would be concerned or interested to find out how they are doing now .
they are probably not doing very well at all .
i know that there ,
i know there is still people even in the dallas area .
there are still people trying to get some member of their family back from , vietnam .
None
None
you are talking about p o w or missing in actions ?
native vietnamese people .
native vietnamese people .
yeah .
okay .
they were lost , when they were little ,
they never did get back
None
i had not .
that had not occurred to me .
yeah .
None
that would be an interesting concept .
as is really a big waste because they didn 't win ,
they didn 't regain any of the land that they had .
it spilled over into , now i can 't even think of the country .
None
cambodia ?
yeah .
cambodia .
uh -huh .
and to laos ,
uh -huh .
all they did is run and hide .
uh -huh .
they were not really fighting ,
it would have been the same as desert storm if all they had been fighting was north vietnam .
uh -huh .
i am not even sure who was involved more . whether it was china or russia .
uh -huh .
they were pouring weapons in there and digging tunnels for them .
uh -huh .
None
there is no way that they could ever catch them .
i think the terrain had a lot to do with the success of desert storm as opposed to that in vietnam .
yeah ,
that is right .
uh -huh .
there is incredible cover in vietnam .
yeah ,
you can 't find much cover in a sand dune
yeah ,
all they can do is dig in ,
they ,
that is right .
None
they try to camouflage the top .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
i think even now , and in vietnam they could probably have done a better job .
they could kill all those plants , which would devastate the country as far as farming from then on .
the corps of engineers i think do a better job now , like they did in desert storm .
None
they had ,
uh -huh .
he dug a bunch of moats and filled them with oil he set a lot of booby traps all along the way as they went .
uh -huh .
they had to blow them up or disarm them .
uh -huh .
they had to fill in little bridges all the way where he had made those moats .
what world war do you think they found the experience for that ?
None
don 't you think they learned from the mistakes in vietnam ?
w -,
yeah ,
partially .
part of it is that ,
uh -huh .
part of it is technology .
yeah .
part of it is technology , yeah .
all ,
go ahead .
when you get into trouble like that in a place like vietnam , you do tend to analyze the problems that you get into ,
you say ,  "never more ."
yeah .
you overcome those problems ,
you are prepared next time .
i think that is one of the reasons they have pretty much avoided getting involved in south america .
uh -huh .
look what happened when they were looking for noriega ,
they lost him for four hours when they were right on top of him ,
right .
None
uh -huh .
he probably just went right down into a tunnel .
sure .
sure .
sure .
i know that , from a personal standpoint , people was one of the finest assets that we lost .
we did not actually physically lose them .
they did not lose their lives ,
they lost a whole lot of the life they might have had .
yeah .
that is right .
being entirely different people .
i had dinner monday night with a vietnam veteran who is just now beginning to recover from the drug and alcohol struggle that he had .
uh -huh .
that is a long time to suffer .
yeah .
they really need ,
everybody that has stood there ,
it 's ,
when i -,
in vietnam i think it was much closer contact .
you stand there with a rifle and blow a piece of somebody apart ,
uh -huh .
or blow their head off ,
uh -huh .
that has to affect you if you are human ,
yeah ,
yeah .
i can 't ,
they had to work all that anger out , and the nightmares that come along with it .
yeah .
you bet ,
you bet .
i do not really think that anybody can ever forget that ,
uh -huh .
they can reason and try to adjust to why they were there .
yeah .
you see that is what the veterans are so angry about now .
they say , we 're ,
going to listen to this and we are going to look at this , find out what our mistakes were , and we are not going to make them again ."
that does not undo the ones that were done .
that is what makes the veterans angry .
right .
i cannot blame them .
i do not know a solution .
uh -huh .
i sure cannot blame them for being angry .
on the other hand , you can be angry about something for a very long time ,
you can say , that is the way it is ," and go on with your life .
None
right .
for the most part , i wish that it had not happened .
yeah .
it did .
None
that was in the era when kennedy was president that they were afraid of everything ,
that is right .
None
they initially got into it because of eisenhower .
he did not want to be in it any more than what we started out in august with desert storm .
yeah .
it just blew up into the war .
it has been that way for a very , very long time , though .
i can remember when i was in the sixth grade ,
that was many years ago .
uh -huh .
french , yeah .
uh -huh .
we were reading about the french struggling with that in southeast asia .
the asians historically have always had these kinds of wars going on .
right , yeah .
there has not been a lot of peace in that part of the world .
uh -huh
i do not know ,
we should not have maybe gotten involved .
if we did , we certainly should have supported our people who were there .
yeah .
more so supported them when they got home .
right .
i am afraid that they were treated as castaways for the most part .
exactly .
i saw the movie ,
born on the fourth of july ,
i think it did a good job depicting the temperament of the times .
uh -huh .
yeah .
more than , apocalypse now
uh -huh .
dudley , have we pretty well discussed the subject ?
yeah .
i think so .
i think so .
i enjoyed talking to you .
yes ,
it was nice talking to you .
uh -huh .
okay ,
bye -bye .
bye -bye .
okay .
are you a t i
no .
no .
is somebody in your family a t i
no ,
my fianc3e works for the computers , for the government
that 's how he got it .
okay ,
who do you work for ?
i just graduated from college .
you don 't have any benefits at all to talk about .
no .
you 're just going to have to imagine what you would like as benefits
what i 'm looking for .
okay ,
okay
in interviewing have you ever discussed benefits with some of the potential employers ?
no ,
huh -uh .
didn 't get that far .
no .
you normally just try to sell them on your , aptitude and not , how much vacation do i get
None
None
  i 'll tell you a little bit about what t i has as benefits .
we do have ,
like most companies , we have medical insurance .
although they 're tending to try to really cut costs more and more . what they started with a few years ago is that they only would allow you to go to , set hospitals in the area .
they call it network hospitals .
they 're hos -,
 yeah ,
i 've heard of that . 
 yeah ,
they 're hospitals that they 're ,  agreeing with , t i that they 'll be a certain rate , for rooms and care and all that kind of stuff to keep costs down .
uh -huh .
now they 're going to start to do the same kind of thing with doctors .
yeah .
it 's almost like an h m o kind of thing that , only certain doctors are you going to be allowed to go to and get the full coverage .
if you go to a doctor who isn 't in the network then it will be less benefits that you get .
uh -huh .
we have some dental coverage now ,
you have to pay a little more to really get something worthwhile .
like , i 've had a couple of crowns recently
if you didn 't have the extra dental plus , you only get like a third of your cost , which can be kind of expensive with a crown .
 yeah
 it can  
 i  pay ,
yeah ,
i pay for the extra dental plus , so much more per month because it always seems like if you 're going to have a crown or something major done it pays a little more .
uh -huh .
we do have pension , although i 've realized recently that the pension doesn 't seem to be too good
i know when you first start out working you 're not thinking about that
i like to think about that .
after you 've been working for a while and you look at your pension account and you go , is that all that 's in there .
i don 't think 's it 's going to pay too long when i get out .
we do have a new thing that they 've started a few years ago ,
it 's not an i r a ,
it 's called a four oh one k plan .
it 's kind of like pension .
you put in so much money
t i , meets you half way up to a certain maximum .
i put in a dollar , they put in fifty cents .
uh -huh .
that grows pretty good
i think that will be more of something i can see of a pension than the regular pension plan .
 uh -huh . 
 of  course you can buy stock in the company ,
that 's not always a real , for sure kind of thing .
cour -,
not always safe
yeah ,
especially with this one , it kind of goes up and down .
i don 't know if it 's any different than other companies ,
you hate to have it fluctuate
last year it was forty dollars a share
now this year it 's thirty six dollars a share ,
you go , i 'm losing money
doesn 't quite feel as good .
yeah .
we ge -, vacation normally after you 're here for six months
you start to get five days every six months is kind of how they accrue it to you .
it 's , one nice thing about t i is after you 've been here , for five years ,
 uh -huh . 
 you  get three weeks .
that 's nice .
which , a lot of places make you work like ten years or so ,
 yeah . 
 before  you get that much .
uh -huh .
we get , decent holidays .
at thanksgiving we always get the two days off which is nice , to make a nice long weekend .
at christmas we always get two days at christmas .
they float it around depending on which day of the week christmas falls on .
uh -huh .
that 's nice , so you always get two days at christmas .
a lot of people just take , that week ,
i normally take that week somehow ,
yeah .
you only have to take three days of vacation
you get the whole week at christmas time .
yeah ,
i can just tell you like ,
from my dad and my fianc3e , like my dad ,
  there 's twelve kids in my family .
whoa , okay !
the dental was very important , to my dad .
uh -huh .
i think they took the dental away now .
he worked for united telephone system ,
None
None
 it 's  just another , telephone network .
 uh -huh . 
  they took the dental away ,
now i think they 're going to start getting into eye .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah ,
i think ,
i don 't use the services
i think sometime last year , or just recently they started to give some kind of eye coverage .
you get discounts on , glasses
i 'm not quite sure , there 's certain places you can go to that have , discounts for people that work here .
uh -huh .
you can get glasses and contacts and stuff through those particular stores or something like that .
yeah ,
now for his pension he pretty much just has the stock .
my fianc3e ,
None
 he 's on  that same kind of pension as what you said only ,
 uh -huh . 
 for  everything he puts in they 'll match it , up to a certain amount .
yeah
like if he puts in a dollar they 'll put in a dollar ,
 yeah . 
 he 's only allowed , i think , i don 't know if it 's maybe five percent , or something like that that he 's allowed to put in
they 'll match it .
uh -huh .
he works for the ,
did you ever hear of the national bureau of standards ?
yeah .
okay ,
he works for them .
they changed their name now
that 's where he works
his vacation is really nice .
he 's going to be there three years at the end of this month
he 'll be getting three weeks vacation .
gee ,
that 's pretty decent .
yeah ,
yeah .
ok -,
of course , it 's for the government
he has all the holidays off .
right ,
you get some extra ones .
federal workers always seem to get ,
you get columbus day , and veterans day ,
 right ,
right 
 and those ones  that you couldn 't really care about so much but you get the day off anyhow .
yeah ,
uh -huh ,
he has it really nice .
it 's nice where he works ,
he seems to be very happy ,
like his hospitalization
he has all that
with his doctors and stuff , they have , a list of doctors that the employees can go to
it only costs a dollar as long as they go to that doctor .
 yeah ,
okay . 
  i think it works the same way with his prescriptions and stuff if he needs any .
you have to go , to certain ones
still that works out really nice .
it ,
yeah ,
we 're doing an h m o right now ,
when we go to get prescriptions it 's five dollars ,
None
 that 's not bad either . 
  sometimes when you go , the prescription ,
like my husband always takes   which is kind of like , contact stuff , only better .
you
that 's a buck a capsule .
uh -huh .
if you 've got thirty in there it normally comes out to about thirty -four dollars so when you pay five it 's a pretty good savings .
then there 's other times that , maybe the prescription wouldn 't cost more than seven or eight dollars
you pay five anyhow .
it isn 't a ,
hi
you want to start first
of course .
we are talking about the elderly and ,
right .
whether or not we like nursing homes
None
uh -huh .
as a matter of fact , i can tell you something about that .
you apparently have somebody there , in one .
no ,
my grandmother owned and operated a nursing home for years
her mother ,
you are kidding ?
no ,
she did .
oh .
my mother also owned and operated a nursing home ,
uh -huh .
for years .
i will be darned .
and then , went on back to school and became the director of nurses at a nursing home
uh -huh .
my mother and my older sister both are geriatric nurses .
for heaven 's sake .
i do know something about that .
you are very , very much aware of what goes on .
absolutely .
that is great .
the motivation for grandmother entering the business ,
uh -huh .
was that her mother was very old ,
uh -huh .
and couldn 't seem to find companions .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
she was lonely .
right .
she needed company ,
right .
for her mother
opened a nursing home and initially started with eight ladies .
i will be darned .
it grew into a ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
very prosperous business from that point .
then they ,
that is a nice attitude to go into .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
it seems like they must be waiting until it is a necessity there is no chance of , good companionship or doing anything .
that is not really true , either ,
uh -huh .
i think that is a stigma and an impression that has come from some few bad experiences .
those who had bad experiences talk about them .
right ,
right .
those who do not may write ,
uh -huh .
a letter to the nursing home and say you did good ,
uh -huh .
they do not talk a whole lot about that .
that is true .
what i mean is instead of maybe entering a nursing home ,
uh -huh .
when you are still able to have good ,
uh -huh .
relationships with ,
uh -huh .
sure .
now ,
maybe other friends they wait until they are , unable .
that is right .
that is because they wait until the children make those choices ,
right .
they choose to not make those ,
right ,
right .
choices themselves .
however , my daughter -in -law also is a nurse in a nursing home .
uh -huh .
she works for one here in dallas , which is more a retirement village than it is a nursing home .
these ,
uh -huh .
i love watching these elderly people come , they will come and tell her . i am going for my ,
uh -huh .
tennis lessons .
would you , call down and have the van come around and take ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
us for our tennis lessons ."
they are very active and very enthusiastic
they have ,
uh -huh .
some excellent programs right there on site .
yeah .
their dining room looks like , luby 's cafeteria .
yeah .
that is great .
or one of the lovely cafeterias .
they have , pink linen napkins for their dinners .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
and , a well equipped library .
yeah ,
that sounds great .
i am certainly very much for a nursing home
i think when the parent gets old enough ,
yeah .
to the extent where they just do not want to be bothered with keeping house ,
uh -huh .
and with taking care of themselves ,
uh -huh .
anymore . that is a wonderful alternative .
uh -huh .
it is expensive .
it is costly .
if they could get this idea across though , better than what it is ,
uh -huh .
None
now my daddy 's mother , lived in a retirement village
she and her sister had side by side duplexes ,
uh -huh .
one bedroom duplex .
she still had her individuality ,
uh -huh .
they were there close
they did have , the button that you could push the central office if you got into problems
None
uh -huh .
there were lights that you could flip on and so forth .
they   have security .
uh -huh .
no ,
i am very much in favor ,
i have heard horror stories ,
you have that with anything .
i know that the elderly can easily be abused ,
 yeah 
i would be willing to bet they are far less abused in a nursing home than they are in ,
in the homes , yeah .
homes of their own children .
None
uh -huh .
we used our nursing home as ,
uh -huh .
like when my sister was real bad before she died we took her the last month and a half ,
uh -huh .
into a nursing home .
uh -huh .
they were super with her .
absolutely .
they were ,
now , my grandmother ,
uh -huh .
of course all of my folks lived to be very old my grandmother developed hodgkin 's disease ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
when she was in her late seventies ,
uh -huh .
she went to the doctor ,
she had surgery ,
she got the treatments
during ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
the period of time that she was undergoing those treatments she was in a nursing home .
uh -huh .
she got better ,
she got well ,
she got out and went dancing again .
a lot of people do that .
 they   ,
uh -huh .
 left them  temporally maybe they had a ,
that is right .
broken hip or something or ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
i think it is a wonderful interim place ,
uh -huh .
it is a place that you do not have to struggle with hospital ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
problems
yet it is not ,
you have ,
it can become home to them .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
it certainly is .
it depends upon the individual .
it certainly does ,
we have had excellent experience with that .
i did not put my husband in a nursing home when he became ill ,
None
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
i would not object to going to one .
uh -huh .
i might like to be , coherent enough to make my own choice .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
i would not particularly think i would want my kids to say , i think this is what i need for mom ", and ,
this is  
None
then dump me there .
i would  like , 
 there has to be  consideration taken on everything .
that is right .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
i think you would shop for a nursing home , just like you would shop for a church ,
yeah .
or a doctor or anything else .
that is right ,
you would look into it thoroughly and ,
uh -huh ,
sure .
do the best job you could in choosing one .
uh -huh .
when you get to the point where you are in trouble ,
uh -huh .
and you have got to have that help , you are in no position to make those choices .
no
you do not have the time to look ,
that is what ,
that is right .
i am saying ,
uh -huh .
most people will not even look at that until it becomes a necessity .
absolutely .
i think that one of the best ways to do that is for families to realize they are going to be needing those facilities one day ,
uh -huh .
and to actually get involved and participate on a community level with community service .
go out to the nursing home , help guide some craft programs , perhaps , work on some music programs ,  whatever their talents are . 
 whatever their talents ,  yeah .
and work with ,
uh -huh .
those senior citizens .
yeah ,
i have a cousin who is ,
she had a son that was epileptic from birth ,
he did fine ,
uh -huh .
at home ,
they lived on a farm ,
uh -huh .
she made arrangements , so that when she was gone ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
she did not want her other children burdened with his care .
that is right .
she has made arrangements that when she was gone , that he would go into the nursing home .
uh -huh .
he adjusted very well
he has been there quite a long time .
uh -huh .
he don 't know me usually
yeah .
he goes wheeling down , the hall to bingo .
somebody else ,  is helping  him out ,
that is right .
None
None
he has adjusted very well .
one of the things , i think that is most desirable for the elderly is routine .
uh -huh ,
yes .
yes .
routine and ,
uh -huh .
constancy .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh
the only real problem with that in a nursing home is that the staff turns over .
i do not think they pay ,
the nursing home staff sufficiently ,
uh -huh .
to get the dedication
to keep them there , uh -huh .
that they have in some other profession ,
true .
that is sad , because , i think the health profession is one of the most critical ,
yes .
   ,
None
for some reason people resist , the fact that they should be paid as well as businesses and that type of thing ,
that is right .
it seems to be a resistance .
care for the elderly and care for the children ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i cannot imagine a more costly and a more , better area to invest ,
right ,
right .
your money .
 there seems to be a resistance . 
 you are  preserving your heritage and your future there .
yeah ,
yeah .
None
as a matter of fact , i do not see why they do not have children 's programs in nursing homes .
around here , we have some , the churches ,
uh -huh .
take the children
None
uh -huh .
i know our kids thoroughly ,
the children thoroughly enjoy ,
okay ,
my name is karen .
okay ,
my name is terry .
okay ,
this ,
they said about magazines .
i 've probably personally take just two okay .
that 's because my mother -in -law takes every one they print and gives them to me ,
a month later
i get all of them .
the one that i really especially enjoy ,
you may be familiar with it from wisconsin , is called country .
yes ,
there 's country living ,
there 's country ,
None
this ,
yeah ,
yeah .
this one is the one they have all the pictures of scenery from places we wished we live , like wisconsin
gorgeous leaves and trees and all the lakes and the mountains and things .
sure .
i get that , it has recipes in it ,
that 's my very favorite .
that 's great .
what do you take ?
i actually take country living ,
uh -huh .
yeah ,
decorating .
it 's a country magazine on house beautiful , because i like , that kind of stuff .
uh -huh .
decorating and , getting ideas for a garden .
are you ?
in fact , right before you called , i was planning my tulips and , putting them on blue print on where i 'm going to put them ,
oh .
i 'm really into that ,
and decorating and how to do things .
uh -huh .
i really get into magazines that are kind of basically into , housing type things , be decorating and gardening and recipes , that kind of stuff .
yeah .
i 'm pretty much in the same category as what you 're looking at .
we tried for a while to take a news magazine .
uh -huh .
sure .
we took newsweek i think we took it especially just during the war to kind of catch up on everything and have it be digested .
yeah .
we 've kind of discontinued that right now we 're going to start taking that , u s news , newspaper . u s a today ,
i think it .
yeah ,
yeah ,
i 've had time before .
yeah .
uh -huh .
i think with that what happens is , it 's interesting to read you kind of just put the magazine away
that 's right .
you never read it again unless there 's some big article in there that you 're going to keep for your kids ,
None
that 's exactly right .
i did the same thing .
we saved the ones from the election
we saved the ones from the war and one from the earthquake .
yeah ,
None
uh -huh .
it sounds exactly like what we did we just saved everything we could for our daughter
uh -huh .
that 's pretty similar ,
you sound like you ,
i find that with these country magazines , i keep going back to them , getting ideas , looking back and saying , there was a flower garden in there that i would like to have some ideas , i get a lot of ideas from them .
that 's the thing , you sound like you have the facilities to do that .
yes ,
we do .
oh .
we 're out in the country we 're right across from a river ,
you 're right , the leaves are beautiful ,
they are falling now ,
None
oh .
it just peaked , last week ,
it was just gorgeous out here ,
None
i bet it is gorgeous .
yeah ,
it 's beautiful .
i agree ,
the other thing about magazines , the only thing i don 't like , is they really get heavily into advertising
it 's fine ,
uh -huh .
yeah ,
right .
i 'd rather almost have i know that part , probably half their money comes from these people that are saying , put my ad in your paper and i 'll pay you or whatever ,
there 's been some magazines i 've looked at ,
every page .
it 's a real turn off to see every other page ,
i  do the same thing , 
 some kind of ad , 
yeah ,
vogue is ,
i think i opened vogue the other day or something  it was just nothing , uh -huh . 
 heavily into that . 
i thought , why buy this ?
yeah ,
exactly ,
what 's the point ?
that 's right .
it 's almost you could go into a store and get bombarded the same way ,
None
uh -huh .
yeah ,
exactly .
my number one pet peeve in a magazine , is when they put the perfume in it because , real often , i don 't like very heavy perfumes very often , like , in my bills , also , magazines and bills , and they 'll ,
come out just stinking the whole thing .
exactly ,
yeah ,
they 're really getting into that
None
uh -huh .
pretty much like i said , the magazines i 've had , better homes and garden ,
now i need a switch ,
oh .
i 'm going back to gourmet cooking , because , i 've had the magazine before , back in nineteen , eighty -six ,
i thought , i 'll give it a try again , because you get tired of one magazine ,
i understand .
you need to try a change .
do you tear out of your magazines , your recipes
do you keep it ?
yes ,
i do ,
and most of the time i tear them out .
uh -huh .
a lot of times , if i got a chance to sit down at my typewriter , i 'll go ahead and type out recipes ,
type it out , uh -huh .
what i usually do is i 'll try it out in the magazine first , and , without tearing it out , and then give it a ,
see how the family liked it
yeah ,
if we like it it becomes part of the recipe collection ,
None
that 's a good idea .
yeah .
i 'm going to pay attention more when i 'm in the store to that country living , i remember seeing the cover .
uh -huh .
back when i decorated the house with a lot of the little country , primitive things , the little pigs and the ducks , and that , that was the big rage here , couple of years ago .
sure ,
sure .
i bought a lot of the country magazines it seems like when i put some of that away , i quit buying it ,
uh -huh .
i had forgotten the recipes i 'm going to ,
i 'll have to check that out ,
yeah ,
that 's what i just went through , we just recently moved from minnesota to wisconsin .
uh -huh .
i went through all this ,
i had this huge stack of house beautiful i had colonial times ,
i had gourmet yeah .
you don 't want to part with any of them because there 's one thing in each one
it was hard ,
that 's good .
i ended up , reducing them down to fifteen magazines out of , hundreds .
i just said , there 's one picture in there that ,
uh -huh .
right .
right .
it really doesn 't , it 's got to have more than that it 's got to have some good ideas it 's got to have everything .
i just kind of went through ,
i find that most of the magazines i really like is around christmas time because ,
i know ,
okay ,
basically i can tell you that i like just about every music there is except for , real hard , hard rock ,
i really can 't get into that
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i go from classical all the way to , jazz and country and soft pop ,
i pretty much have a wide range of , what i like ,
uh -huh .
yeah .
there isn 't any particular music that i enjoy more than just listening to all kinds that 's about it .
i can even take the  
it 's pretty neat music that they came out with ,
None
i 'm pretty much the same way ,
uh -huh .
there 's certain types of country western i can 't handle that twangy stuff ,
uh -huh ,
sure ,
the old , old stuff that came out , i think it was , hank williams ,
you talk about twangy .
yeah .
yeah .
my in -laws listen to the kind of music i hate
yeah ,
the old , old country ,
the old , real old , yeah .
yeah .
other than that , i like pretty much everything .
yeah ,
yeah ,
that 's the way i am , too ,
other than ,
as far as instruments , i can go from piano to the saxophone .
uh -huh .
lately , with the new music that has come out , some of the really good , music they have the saxophone playing ,
it 's so funny , because you can take an instrument and forget what it really sounds like when it plays by itself .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
to are you okay , tiana , come here honey .
talking to my daughter just fell .
do you like kenny g ?
yeah ,
a little bit .
uh -huh .
i can pretty much , to
it 's all wet , tiana .
talking to i just did the floor ,
she slipped .
on ,
no .
yeah ,
uh -huh .
i can take all kinds of music pretty much except for when you get , like i said , into the real hard rock ,
yeah ,
the heavy metal ,
yeah ,
i have no interest in that ,
i don 't have interest of losing my ears ,
let 's just put it that way ,
hearing , anyway ,
yeah ,
i saw peter townsend on t v last night ,
uh -huh ,
sure .
he said he 's lost most of his hearing i thought , no wonder
None
uh -huh ,
exactly .
None
okay ,
it was good talking to you then .
same here .
okay .
you all have a good day .
you , too .
bye -bye .
bye now .
okay ,
uh -huh .
do you have any ?
scott , let 's , talk about advice that we can offer a parent where the child is going to go to a university
do you have any kids
None
i have some children .
i have three boys .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
they 're all quite young we want to plan for their education
we 're saving right now
we 're getting bonds , and hopefully finances set aside so that they can choose a college that they want to .
how about yourself ?
do you have any kids ?
no ,
i 'm in graduate school right now
yeah .
i imagine you 've gone through the experience yourself of selecting your own college .
yeah ,
definitely .
in fact , i 'm selecting again for my p h d .
it 's a close subject right now
very good .
None
what do you use as a basis to determine which college or university you go to ?
i have used , several techniques depending on what ,
uh -huh .
for undergraduate , my criteria were much different than for graduate school .
when i wanted to go to an undergraduate institution , i was looking for something that was , rather small and easy to get around ,
uh -huh .
and what i thought would be easy to get through .
yeah
what you thought ,
yeah
my choice of graduate schools it changed a whole lot .
just the degree itself .
i got to where i wanted to , graduate with a name behind me , rather than , yeah ,
yeah .
that 's good , because i did quite a bit the same thing in my undergraduate work .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
yeah .
i wanted to get a school that was small enough , that was personable that you didn 't have a lecture , hall with about fifteen other students competing for the professor 's attention i felt that i got a pretty good , undergraduate ,
where did you go ?
okay .
uh -huh .
i went to utah state university which is in logan , utah the nice thing about it too is , i knew that i wanted to get into business and that their college of business , was accredited
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
known at least there in the state of utah and around the surrounding states and so forth .
i feel like , number one , you also need to see what kind of name the ,
yeah .
like you mentioned before , the name the college and university can give you and another reason why i chose that was the finances .
i wanted to make sure that i would be able to afford it , that i wouldn 't get through three years of the undergraduate work and have to leave .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i did a lot of talking with friends , with family with , counselors at high school , and also read some books on the subject at the library .
uh -huh .
it was kind of unusual because my two older brothers and i all went to three different universities , depending on what our choice was .
None
right .
hopefully we chose the one that was best for us ,
i felt very comfortable and good about that .
None
uh -huh .
do you worry any about , being able ,
obviously you 've taken precautions , or measures to , try and pay for your children 's education ,
do you think that that 's going to be enough ?
i don 't think so .
no .
i don 't know .
yeah .
yeah .
the way that tuition is increasing , exponentially it 's kind of hard to set aside money and have that money grow at the same pace that the college tuition is increasing .
yeah .
i ,
all i can hope for is that i land a professorship at a nice heavy university .
yeah
and that your children can use the benefits of that university .
that 's an excellent idea ,
that 's an excellent idea .
one thing that we did , and my parents , and our family , is that we weren 't able to afford , the kind of education that we all desired .
uh -huh .
my parents stressed that we get excellent grades so that we apply and try for scholarships scholarships were very beneficial in my case to help pay for my education , because my parents couldn 't .
uh -huh .
yeah .
what the scholarship could not supply i was able to work for and save and get .
uh -huh .
also , my brother , he 's a medical doctor right now .
he had to ,
once he got past his undergraduate and graduate degree , he had to take out some loans ,
he 's working to pay those off .
yeah .
i think that once you get past , the initial stages of it , that there 's different options you can use
yeah .
the student loans are good options .
yeah ,
that 's my biggest option right now .
yeah
yes ,
as you 're well aware that tuition 's not ,
what do you think about a year or two of public service ?
uh -huh .
i know it 's hard for young people to think about giving up their carefree years people that i have known that have done that , like from other countries , especially ,
yeah .
yeah .
from germany and finland , they have such a better , more mature , outlook on life
uh -huh .
i think they 're better people because of it ,
they 're much more responsible .
i know , the church that i go to , the young men give two years of their life when they turn nineteen ,
uh -huh .
they 're encouraged to do that , missionary work ,
i really believe that the people that do that are better people that make our ,
society better .
i really agree with you .
though i 've never done that myself , i , was a basically an education major when i graduated from college
i accepted a job that at the time was just slightly above the poverty level to teach to , very rural children in a very low income district
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i spent a year teaching there i think it was probably one of my largest eye -opening experiences because i come from nice middle class white suburban home i did it , for one reason i wanted ,
i was working on a masters degree
uh -huh .
i wanted to stay close to where i was working on a masters degree , but also because i just thought that it would be interesting to live some place else so totally different than my own up bringing i ,
it probably changed my political views
uh -huh .
it changed my understanding of the world around me i think , in fact , if i had to do it all again i ,
after that , you never think of it i guess because i paid for all of my college education myself , i never thought about doing that because i had all these college loans i 'd started paying back .
huh .
so that was one reason why i never considered it
now that i 'm further along , and i 'm still paying these college loans ,
i think realistically , you can have your college loans delayed now , because i had them delayed because i 'm back in graduate school at thirty years old ,
yeah .
and rattling in
i had them delayed because i 'm back in graduate school and on that form it says if your joining the peace corps you can have them delayed i thought that was , very interesting
i would have thought of that earlier
i probably would have done , just like , is that the mormon church ,
yes .
that does that ?
yes .
one of my neighbors , did that in pittsburgh , from pittsburgh .
uh -huh .
i thought , that really ,
now that i 'm thirty years old , i think that one or two years out of my life would have ,
probably like you said , to be able to travel some place else whether it be the united states or outside the country ,
uh -huh .
i think it would have been a very good , experience for me .
i think so ,
it puts you out on your own
uh -huh .
in a time after high school , there 's kind of a selfishness ,
uh -huh .
teenagers in our country are kind of a year that parents don 't look forward to and things like that
i think that it would help people to become ,
yes .
less self -centered ,
uh -huh .
and to be more responsible when you 're out on your own
uh -huh .
thinking less of your own needs but ,
yeah .
of other people .
i think , we have such a need now ,
i taught ,
uh -huh .
i think i was paid , about nine thousand dollars to teach for the year i worked in a very rural school district
uh -huh .
one of the things i taught was a computer class these kids , every girl i taught , except for one , was pregnant .
no .
many of the boys in the room had children
they were high school juniors .
uh -huh .
i just ,
there , they came from poverty ,
they were going to condition in poverty
it was , the school district couldn 't hire many people ,
it was very difficult for them to hire ,
right .
i think , in the sense , that aspect of public service for education in some of the inner cities for , just social workers in some of the inner cities and some of the rural areas where they just need advice on medical , things ,
uh -huh .
i think it 's a really good idea . and even if it is overseas .
i never ,
i tell you sometimes i worry about things over seas because we have such problems right here in our own country .
yes .
uh -huh .
it would really ,
i don 't
yeah .
the people that i 've known like from germany and finland that have done that they do military service which ,
uh -huh .
i don 't exactly recommend
yeah .
still they have benefited from it .
right .
uh -huh .
although i wouldn 't want it   to make people to go off to the military voluntarily
uh -huh .
it has helped them
they are just a lot more mature ,
uh -huh .
than the average student
like she 's washing dishes >>,
yeah .
i think it would also help them if they then went on to college .
i know that my first couple of years of college were , probably too carefree at the ,
uh -huh .
beginning
at the end i had to be too serious .
that 's right .
a lot of people they flunk out
uh -huh .
they just get so excited to be away from home ,
uh -huh .
they just spend all there time partying
yeah ,
that 's true .
they do a lot of things to themselves that we really don 't want our young people to be doing
None
uh -huh ,
that 's right .
None
i ,
yeah ,
yeah .
i think this was a very interesting topic because it 's something that , we don 't talk about in this country probably enough .
uh -huh .
None
be -,
uh -huh .
yeah ,
that 's true .
we love our freedom and our freedom of choice and , having people like ice >>.
our ,
uh -huh .
like in our church , it is , your free to do that or not you 're encouraged to do it because , it helps you ,
of course , we think it 's helping other people .
 i think it is . 
None
i really think ,
i think , people ,
you should ,
i ,
the kids today i teach ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i spend a lot of my time teaching college students i find great disgust in them , in their self -centeredness and their inability to understand , multicultural or multiracial situation i really ,
they don 't understand , how other people live ,
they don 't understand ,
they 're preoccupied with ,
uh -huh .
drinking .
yeah ,
i think that 's , just having a good time .
uh -huh .
None
i ,
a friend of mine is a psychologist
he always refers to it as short -term pleasure oriented .
i guess he 's a technical aspect he likes to apply to it ,
uh -huh .
None
today 's young people are short -term pleasure oriented ,
 that 's true .  paper
 everything  has to be an immediate reward
it has to be fun .
that 's really true .
uh -huh .
yeah .
yeah .
i don 't know how that would ever happen here
at least ,
they say ,
i think i , have read recently that , the bush administration has increased the funding for the peace corps .
really .
uh -huh .
i guess because of the changes in eastern europe , they 've increased funding for the peace corps .
i guess it 's some of the peace dividend in the sense ,
uh -huh .
when they 're decreasing some of the military spending ,
None
some of that money has gone into the peace corps
some of the are the overseas programs .
i have seen a big change , i think , in high school kids that my relatives paper >>,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
and friends , that , i know when i was in high school i had an idea of what i really wanted to do with what i was going to study
at least i had some interest in ,
a lot of the youth that i come in contact with they say i want to be a doctor , i want to be a lawyer .
why ?
they make a lot of money .
yeah .
yeah ,
that 's true .
they don 't have a goal ,
they don 't have a goal ,
they don 't have an interest in their own field of study .
uh -huh .
they 're just looking what 's going to pay the biggest cash .
yeah ,
that 's very true .
how many ,
is it they say we have so many lawyers in this country ,
i guess , i live near washington , being in baltimore , it 's something like one in four people ,
uh -huh .
in the washington ,
 area . 
 area ,  are lawyers ,
yes .
i just sort of think that 's ridiculous .
yes .
yeah ,
there 's just too many people .
uh -huh .
with the great needs that we need today in science and biology and , the problems we have with aids and cancer and how come everybody is a lawyer ,
that 's right .
uh -huh .
not enough people want to do that for , because of a service that they could provide .
right .
uh -huh .
if you want to be a lawyer because you know that you can provide a service that people need because you have to have lawyers in this country , but if you 're just doing it because you think that 's the best way to ,
yeah ,
you saw ,
be rich .
statistics that lawyers and doctors make the most money in the long run .
uh -huh .
yeah ,
that 's true .
that 's kind of sad .
None
that 's interesting . uh -huh .
i guess i better go .
okay .
hey ,
thanks so much for the conversation .
good luck to you .
i enjoyed it .
thank you very much .
bye -bye .
thanks .
bye -bye .
okay
was i supposed to do something ?
no .
i had to press one .
good
let 's see ,
were we right in the middle east ?
sure .
should we have been there ?
uh -huh .
did we do what was correct there ?
i think we should have stayed longer .
should we have fought them harder ?
used more weapons equal to their chemical weapons that weren 't used ?
i think what we did was good ,
i think we just should have stayed there longer and continued doing what we did do .
you agree with schwartzkopf who says , drive on into baghdad .
yeah .
i think we should have stayed and kind of helped the people in iraq out now because it 's kind of like a civil war going on now .
it 's almost like they 're killing each other off
there is not going to be anything left of iraq at all like zipping >>.
would that be so bad ?
was there anything there to begin with ?
i don 't think it would be good if we were to completely lose it ,
it wasn 't ours .
no ,
i just mean that , the world in general
we 've got to talk so it 's just as well we argue .
yeah .
i don 't know ,
i think we should have helped the innocent people in iraq out a little bit more ,
i agree .
rather than just quitting where we did .
wouldn 't it have been wonderful if we could have freed the country .
yes
i think that 's almost impossible , next to impossible .
yeah .
other political things that 's going on .
i heard president bush say that he , wanted to improve the highways .
i haven 't really been keeping up with them
i really don 't know what he said .
what did he say about it ?
uh -huh .
he wanted to take the current secondary highway system and turn it into interstates like the rest of the country .
we don 't have the money for that .
wouldn 't it be wonderful .
it would be really nice because i 'm kind of tired of driving in pot holes
and back east ,
you all drive at fifty -five , don 't you ?
what 's that ?
i dropped the phone
okay ,
i say back east you all drive at fifty -five don 't you ?
yeah .
uh -huh .
out here in the west a lot of our secondary roads are fifty -five we drive sixty -five .
really .
yes .
  is
i , last weekend , went home to visit my parents .
my dad 's in the hospital .
uh -huh .
between here and west texas , there was probably three and four hours at sixty -five miles an hour .
i didn 't realize that .
nonstop .
have you ever been out here ?
no ,
huh -uh .
how far west have you been ?
only in ohio .
you 've never ,
i 've never been past ohio .
you 've never seen the great american desert .
no ,
huh -uh .
i never seen the great ,
i 've seen ,
the rocky mountains ?
i 've never seen ,
i 've seen pictures of it
None
yellowstone ?
i 've never been there .
i 've seen pictures ,
i 'm a student
i 'm paying for my own education
i come from a large family
we 're never able to take vacations because there 's twelve kids in the family .
None
None
my college educa -, thirty -six ,
worked for texas instruments for seventeen or eighteen now .
my .
virtually nothing else .
uh -huh .
yeah .
uh -huh .
i got my b s in general science .
really .
yeah ,
i know ,
it 's a funny degree
anyway , i know nothing other than the west .
yeah .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
in fact , down in east texas where the company 's located there 's streams and water and things i don 't understand . trees and the gulf
it 's really interesting .
uh -huh .
tell me about where you live .
i 'm originally from butler
that 's about an hour away from where i am now .
i 'm at clairon .
it 's pretty , windy and hilly .
how high is the highest elevation ?
i couldn 't even tell you .
it 's not like a mountain .
it wouldn 't be like a mountain .
it 's ,
probably three thousand feet ?
i don 't even know .
i have no clue .
close to sea level ?
i would say it 's closer to sea level .
okay ,
uh -huh .
right here in colorado springs where i live it 's over six thousand foot .
None
yes
when i lived in texas , every year i had to drive ,
i drove every year to the gulf
uh -huh .
i could have a feast of fresh seafood six , eight , twelve hours away .
None
just for fresh .
i 'm really interested in the basic concept differences between west and east coast and the central parts of america .
uh -huh .
how many hours have you been from home ?
the farthest away from home ?
yes .
i 'd say five or six .
yeah .
uh -huh .
now when i was growing up in the panhandle of texas ,
uh -huh .
look at your map later and see the town of amarillo fifty miles north of that up in the panhandle .
to just go buy a pair of jeans , we 'd drive an hour .
my
my gosh .
when i was growing up ,
uh -huh .
now things are different
people buy jeans in town ,
we thought nothing at all of waking up in the morning hopping into your car , grabbing the fishing poles and driving four hours .
yes .
for me , that 's a long ways .
yeah .
it is i imagine .
uh -huh .
even , i 'm in a little town right now .
it 's smaller than butler
butler is about an hour north east of pittsburgh .
that will give you some idea of where i 'm at .
okay .
okay ,
i 'll look at my map later .
i 'm about two hours north east of pittsburgh .
wow .
how neat .
just this little town here is basically a college town .
without the college here , this town would be nothing .
it would be absolutely dead .
it 's completely made up of fast food restaurants
in the summer when we co -,
my fiancee 's family lives up there ,
we come up here in the summer ,
it 's ,
there 's just no one around .
are you working your way through college ?
i go home in the summer
i work in the summer
between what i make in the summer and student loans , that 's how i go to college .
how neat .
what 's your major ?
finance .
finance .
uh -huh .
that 's interesting .
uh -huh .
what do you plan to do with it ?
like i said my fiancee ,
savings and loans ,
no
no ,
no ,
no ,
my fiancee works down in d c
i 'd actually like to work for a company rather than a bank or something .
i 'd rather work for a company and , be their financial advisor or something .
that would be great .
that would be neat
let 's see , we 're all excited in colorado springs .
uh -huh .
apple computer is coming to town .
really .
yes .
the , new employer is in the city .
uh -huh .
we 're expecting our local economy to
take a boom a little bit .
maybe not a boom , but , at least , recover to where we can all hold regular forty hour jobs still .
what would be the unemployment rate out there ?
unemployment runs approximately six percent .
that 's what it is here too .
now under employment i would suspect to run closer to eighteen or twenty percent .
uh -huh .
the problem is that there are no good permanent full time jobs for people without a technical four year degree .
yeah .
it 's even getting hard for the four year people to find jobs .
yes .
it is .
i know people they are out of school for two or three years
they have a job that has nothing to do
okay
i 'll let you go ahead
okay .
i have five children all together .
uh -huh .
my oldest two are already out and about in the world
oh .
i , have a set of twins that are fourteen my youngest is twelve .
that 's great .
i always thought it 'd be great to have twins .
yeah .
if you like doing everything twice
yeah
at any rate , my first two children , i didn 't spend a whole lot of time with them .
uh -huh .
and , was a problem with having five children needing to work a full -time job that ,
uh -huh .
was more than a full -time job .
i ,
uh -huh .
worked about fifty -one hours a week , because i worked eleven hours every sunday .
uh -huh .
i didn 't get to spend as much time with them as i should have , as i really wanted to .
your first ones you mean , it ,
yeah .
the ,
was this way ?
yeah ,
the f -,
it was with all of them ,
uh -huh .
it was , more an impact , i think , on the oldest two .
uh -huh .
about the time i got out of working that long hours was when the twins were about three years old .
i don 't think they noticed i wasn 't around that much .
oh .
with all the children around the house , it 's ,
right .
kind of hard to notice that dad isn 't around ,
very much .
what i 've tried to do , now that i 've ,
went back to school and got my degree when i was thirty years old .
uh -huh .
i came out and was making as much money forty hours a week as i did fifty -one hours ,
uh -huh .
a week .
i 've tried to spend more time with , the children since then .
uh -huh .
what i 'm currently doing is , taking a lot of time .
i 'm helping the kids more with their homework in the evenings .
we just started a thing where every other week we go to , movies .
there 's a movie theater that offers dollar movies on wednesday nights .
uh -huh .
every couple of weeks we will go to the movies because that 's how often they change the ,
uh -huh .
movies .
it 's working out pretty well .
we 're spending more time together .
i feel like i 'm a lot closer to the three that are still living at home than i ever was to the two that were living there before .
uh -huh .
in fact , i found that i 'm a lot closer with ,
i have one son who 's gone
i don 't even know where he 's at .
huh .
he 's taken off for parts unknown ,
that 's difficult .
yeah .
yeah .
a -,
my daughter has moved out of the house .
her and i get along a lot better now that she 's moved out of the house
uh -huh
it happens that way
it 's been difficult to try to find the time ,
i think it 's important that we do , because , i notice that , when i had spent two years down in dallas , down there they all have a me kind of attitude .
uh -huh .
i noticed parents not spending time with their ,
uh -huh .
children and going out and doing things .
i knew the kids next door were all into cocaine
None
uh -huh .
it just ,
i saw the family falling apart down ,
texas is ,
there .
much worst for the drugs .
it was bad enough every place else ,
drugs in texas , are extremely bad .
yeah .
i think it 's kind of important that i , nurture the relationship i have with my children now .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i 'm doing my best to keep that up .
that 's all you can do .
yeah .
what 's been your experience ?
i was going to ask , too , does your wife work ?
she didn 't up until the last , six months .
uh -huh .
None
she just recently started working then .
she just recently ,
uh -huh .
started working .
she worked a job until we moved to our new house
she quit that job because it was too inconvenient .
None
uh -huh .
she starts a new job tomorrow , which should take her out of the house about four days a week .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
that sounds great .
we also have five children .
huh .
ours are all out of the nest
when they were growing up , probably we had a lot of similar things like you had , having the time .
when you have younger ones to take care of , you maybe sometimes do not take as much time for the older ones .
yeah .
we 're very active , of course , at church , and , boy scouting , and girl scouts , four h ,
those activities helped a lot in ,
uh -huh .
giving us things to do with the children .
we try to take a vacation with them every year , camping of some sort , something that wasn 't expensive .
our youngest is , expecting her first baby .
they 're all out and on their own .
they 're ,
we have one to get married yet
they 'll all be married .
they 're all doing pretty good .
they ,
 t  lives in pittsburgh , you probably don 't know where that is .
certainly do .
okay .
two of our children live there .
one , like i said , lives in around maryland , d c .
he works right on the border of d c .
uh -huh .
one lives in connecticut skips on speaker a 's
our baby lives just a mile over the hill
so , we 'll get to see her a little more than , what we do the other ones .
yeah .
that sounds great .
i 've noticed , another thing , when i was younger my father was always working .
uh -huh .
None
None
they have to .
yeah .
yeah .
he worked a full -time job and a part -time job ,
uh -huh .
i never saw him .
uh -huh .
i didn 't have much of a role model to go by .
to go , to follow .
None
uh -huh .
know , to learn how to be a father and ,
uh -huh .
a parent , and that kind of thing , because ,
yeah .
i can 't ever remember playing ball with my dad or ,
uh -huh .
catch with my dad , or doing anything with my dad .
that does make a big difference .
yeah .
it ,
if you don 't have ,
i don 't ,
i ,
uh -huh .
it 's my feeling that if you don 't have a role model to follow then it 's kind of tough .
uh -huh .
everybody 's not father knows best .
uh -huh .
yeah ,
None
that 's ,
none of us are .
let 's face it ,
yeah .
we 're not none of us like they portray it on those shows .
None
yeah .
life 's much more difficult than that .
yeah .
None
None
mean , the capability to , create children doesn 't necessarily mean you have the , the mental capacity to raise them
right .
right .
None
our daughter , she 's our second oldest , she 's the only other one that has children .
she has two boys .
she works full time
i have mixed feelings about that .
she 's able to do that
i don 't know if she 'd be happy to stay at home .
yet , on the other hand , i 've got the mixed feelings that i think you should be at home with your children .
i 'm kind of old fashioned , i guess , that way .
yes .
they seem to give , quality time to those children when they are together .
it seems for them that it works out all right .
i don 't know .
i don 't think i ever would have had what it would take to work full time and raise a family .
   ,
yes .
 i   ,
it 's not easy .
yeah .
i 've helped out extremely ,
i can 't say that ,
i 've helped out
uh -huh .
as best i could at home .
uh -huh .
as you know , with five children it takes a lot of work .
yes .
it does ,
None
it ,
yeah .
if , even if someone 's home all the time , there 's still a lot of things that have to be done .
yeah .
what line of work are you in now since you went to school
 ]
now i work for texas instruments .
None
okay .
i 'm in computers .
okay .
a lot of the people i 've talked to work for , for the same .
yeah .
None
i 've ,
prior to that i worked in a food store .
uh -huh .
wor -,
which your income would be a lot better ,
 ]
now .
right .  ]
yeah .
yeah .
it was a smart move to make .
uh -huh .
None
uh -huh .
i was more intelligent than the position i was holding .
right .
None
it 's ,
it was ,
kind of a waste of a person .
yes .
i ,
you know .
felt that it certainly was ,
None
uh -huh .
i was smarter than most of the people that i was working for .
uh -huh .
every time something new came up , i was explaining it to them .
uh -huh .
None
uh -huh .
i ,
had ,
you recognized this and ,
no
was able to ,
yeah .
i ,
do something about it .
yeah .
i , started back to school .
in fact , i was going to school while i was working fifty -one hours a week
that 's why i ,
uh -huh .
if you 're working , if you 're taking twelve credits at night and you 're working fifty -one hours a week , there 's not much time left to spend with ,
it puts a strain on everybody , your wife and your family .
yeah
the only thing you can remember is to try and stay together as much as you can ,
yeah
because it 's very easy to , go your own direction when you 're working so hard and going to school , too .
yeah .
it all paid off .
that 's wonderful .
i got my degree and got the better paying job ,
uh -huh
i think as a family we 're a lot better off .
uh -huh .
it sounds to me like , you 're doing well .
my husband 's retired ,
he 's been retired for three years now .
uh -huh .
yeah .
that 's quite a change .
yeah ,
my goal is to try to retire by the time i 'm fifty -five .
he made it at fifty
great .
it was a magic number for him
he went at fifty ,
he still works part time at other thing , same job as he was doing , only he 's retired and doing it independently .
uh -huh .
but , nevertheless retired .
i 'm out >>.
did you want to go first , then ?
i can .
i don 't own my home .
okay ,
right .
i live in a nice area
i rent my home
uh -huh .
we aren 't sure we 're going to buy a house yet because we don 't know if we 're going to be staying here .
sure ,
uh -huh .
in , texas ,
None
yeah .
i think as far as , our home , it 's , in a small residential area .
we 're out of the cities quite a ways ,
it 's kind of more of a country setting
it 's just a typical , three bedroom type of home .
it 's nothing , elaborate where it has , this or this or ,
uh -huh .
it 's just a typical home with , three bedrooms , two story type home .
i think as far as if it 's , for put it into standards of , what other homes are around here , it would be just about fitting right into the middle part of where the homes are .
there 's a river across from us which has more elaborate homes
and yet there 's ,
where we can view the river from that distance , there 's still homes within our area that are , pretty typical of what our home is ,
uh -huh
it 's , pretty much that , type of , home
None
yeah .
None
our house , we 're renting it from an individual who bought it
he lives in korea .
uh -huh ,
really ?
he 's recently moved here
sure .
uh -huh .
he 's owns eight or nine properties near here
yeah .
the houses around here , there 's five houses on my street for sale right now .
yeah ,
yeah .
yeah .
which is just , in trouble to me .
they 're not very expensive either .
it just seems like ,
we have a three bedroom house .
ours is one level only .
uh -huh .
we ,
it 's the rambler style .
yeah ,
we have two living areas and a dining room and a big kitchen
None
uh -huh .
the bedrooms are a little bit small except the master bedroom 's a little bigger .
yeah ,
yeah .
None
it 's kind of like what ours is .
one of our bedrooms is really small
we 've made that into a den because we only have one child ,
that was our best way of going with , the small bedrooms because they are making bedrooms smaller and smaller .
it seems like they get incredibly small
yeah .
okay .
that sounds great ,
i don 't know if we need to talk any more or whatever .
have you done this before ?
the t i ?
uh -huh .
yes ,
about three times before .
have you ?
i 'm fairly new to it ,
it seems to be going okay .
yeah .
are you in texas ?
no ,
huh -uh .
no ,
yeah ,
no ,
i 'm out of state .
i 'm in wisconsin ,
None
really ?
yeah ,
yeah .
oh .
it 's ,
sounds interesting .
other than that , sure , yeah .
is this your first time ?
no ,
huh -uh .
i 've gotten several calls .
uh -huh .
None
i 'm always the one that initiates the calls because i kind of like it because it 's like i can get it done with
yeah .
i don 't have to wait until somebody calls me even though i have a feeling what 's going to happen is i 'll probably get tons of calls , sooner or later .
yeah ,
yeah ,
i 've talked to some people from cleveland
uh -,
uh -huh .
i did talk to someone else who lives here in the same city i do ,
yeah ,
yeah .
that was kind of interesting
yeah ,
sure .
they 're sure getting their people out ,
yeah .
it was nice to talk to you , anyway
None
okay ,
you take it easy , gail .
okay ,
thanks .
bye , now .
bye -bye .
okay ,
for as far as , i would think probably the , worst substance that 's probably ,
started to say the ,
probably so ,
what causes the most air pollution is probably the car whether or not , they 'll ever get into huge transit systems into big cities where people would all travel on a high speed , train or something like that
None
yeah ,
it 'll be hard to get people to give up their mobility .
yeah ,
that 's exactly it ,
uh -huh .
that 's what we 're finding , here , where we 're at , in minneapolis area , is that people don 't want to carpool that there are inconveniences to that ,
maybe you don 't like the person you would want to carpool with , that kind of thing ,
it 's kind of a thing where , i think the majority of the people do not carpool .
i think so too .
uh -huh .
yeah .
exactly .
i 'm in texas very few people carpool the people that i know don 't want to because , they never know for sure what time they 're going to leave their job they never know when they want to run out and do an errand at noon ,
uh -huh ,
they just feel they need their car .
or if somebody gets sick .
yeah ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
if somebody gets sick , and it 's not the other person and they want to go home , and that one person 's got the car then they 're stuck ,
that 's right .
you 're definitely right ,
 ]
yes ,  ]
uh -huh .
sure .
sure ,
that happens quite a bit ,
yes ,
yeah that 's very true .
people don 't want to give it up now i think we 've made great strides in changing a lot of that by going to the unleaded gasoline and to change the car itself i don 't guess we can get away from it a hundred percent yeah .  ]
other than that , i don 't know ,
okay .
my other line is ringing we 're going to ignore it
okay ,
we 'll try to be real quick here .
i 'm sorry for these beeps ,
the other thing then is , because i don 't know how long they want us to talk ,
close to five minutes , i believe .
five minutes , okay .
you 're in minneapolis ,
minneapolis area ,
is the pollution really bad up there ?
no .
we have , quite a bit ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
the only problem that we have and that 's all over the whole world is ozone and of course hay fever season you get some pollutants such as those ,
yeah
those are natural there is starting to ,
in minneapolis itself , because of so many people on the highway , there is becoming a problem of pollution ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
they just put in a strict law that as of every year when you get your license tabs you have to have your car inspected to see if it 's releasing any , lead into the air or other pollutants ,
if that 's the case , then you have to get your car fixed ,
at least where you  
that 's the way it has gotten here .
sure ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
it 's not a bad idea .
uh -huh .
sure ,
sure ,
exactly ,
uh -huh .
sure .
uh -huh .
we have just had that law , i think , about a year , maybe a year and a half here in texas i think it 's a good idea because a lot of people still want to drive the older cars which you can 't blame them for that if they are polluting the air , they do need to have them fixed there 's a big move , especially in the industrial part in texas right now of controlling the c f c that the big manufacturing companies are producing into the air they 're having to change the type of products they use they can 't use ,
uh -huh .
sure .
uh -huh .
sure .
uh -huh .
yeah .
i have a friend that 's in the air conditioning heating business they have to pay a penalty for every ounce or pound of this certain type of freon that they use in the air conditioning systems therefore , the individual , every time they have a service call , if they have an old unit that 's still using this twenty -two freon or whatever it costs them three times as much to get it fixed if you have a new high efficiency system that uses the new type of freons that do not release as many c f c into the atmosphere it doesn 't cost as much so eventually people are going to have to go to newer systems ,
None
uh -huh .
right .
sure the other thing when you 're talking about freon with cars , air conditioning , i 'm sure over there it 's a necessity versus something up here we can live without it
uh -huh .
it 's uncomfortable this year my husband recharged our freon because it needed to be done ,
None
one of the cans released entire amount of freon into the air because he opened it ,
uh -huh .
i don 't know if there was something wrong with it , or his directions weren 't quite fully instructed onto that ,
it 's probably happened to millions of people ,
i was thinking how many other people sure ,
uh -huh .
if you take it into a service station ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh
they want to charge you forty dollars just for , freon , which only costs you about three dollars i have this feeling that freon probably will increase in price because it is something that people will have to take into consideration and say , that 's right there .
yeah .
i think it 's like three or four dollars a can it takes about four to five cans to fill up a air conditioning unit in a car ,
i thought about that ,
inhaled so much of it ,
uh -huh .
my husband even was kind of woozy after that because i 'm sure he breathed it you think about that , all the people that are using freon and things like that
 ]
yeah ,
of course in the ,
uh -huh .  ]
exactly .
i think you probably noticed in the discount stores and places , in the hair sprays we 're not seeing as many aerosol cans down here nearly everything is in the pump squirt ,
pump , yeah ,  ]
okay ,
you want to tell me first how you feel about the proposal ,
i just think the way that things are going that , it would be good for young people to go ahead and dedicate themselves to at least something .
uh -huh .
i know , the mormon religion , they require two years of missionary service right ,
the boys not the girls ,   the boys .
the boys yeah ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i think it would be good for all young people to be able to do something like that so that , i just feel it would be good for them to do that .
uh -huh .
i thought it would be good , too ,
yeah .
uh -huh .
i did not think it would be good that they all do something like the peace corps because not all young people would have , what it takes to go like that because i think it takes a certain person to be able to do something like that ,
sure .
there 's a lot of other public service things that could be done .
yeah ,
uh -huh .
right .
right .
yes ,
yeah .
even in our home towns there 's a lot of public service things that they could do drug rehabilitation and alcohol and just , helping old people , and , helping cripple , just helping somebody else i think that art of giving is something that , we don 't have very much any more .
uh -huh .
yeah ,
i think it would be that .
when they say this proposal , is this something that they 're just suggesting ,
are they actually ,
why did they call it a proposal ,
that ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
that 's what i wondered .
i think they just gave it a title is this not something that 's , in legislation or in work some yeah ,
no ,
it 's not ,
it 's just a topic ,
it 'd be good character builder .
i think so , too .
i think so , too .
there 's so many , kids who have , so much money and so much free time and , nothing to do , and nothing to give their time to .
uh -huh .
they don 't even have a direction to give their time to ,
right .
uh -huh .
i think it would be really good for people to be able to give their time in , some kind of public service , even in our government , as , aids to , congress , people yeah ,
uh -huh .
it 'd be really good i think .
uh -huh .
right .
people that have received sentences in jail , they have to go out and do public service activities which to me is good .
yeah ,
yeah ,
i agree with you .
uh -huh .
this is something that , is it 's character building learning how to give to others , and being less selfish
None
uh -huh .
right .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh ,
yeah .
i think sometimes it gives you a better picture of what some of the other people live like , what some of the other parts of the world are like or even other parts of the neighborhood some of the people , how they live
None
i agree with you ,
i agree with you ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i think , young people are so , focused just on themselves and their activities , and whose going out with whom , et cetera that , to get a taste of what the real world is actually about doing that public service would be great .
uh -huh .
yeah .
yeah ,
right .
uh -huh .
that 's one thing that 's hard , with young people , you can 't tell them how things are they have to see for themselves now of course this might be after they 've gone through their teen years ,
i don 't know what their thought is on what age that this should be done .
yeah ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i would think so , like right after , high school even if it was that summer right after high school  three months , 
uh -huh .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
 of course  they 've already gone through the period of time where they need more direction their teenage years and that they really sometimes need a little better direction to go and something ,
right ,
right ,
course now peace corps , that couldn 't be done of course , until they were done with school  ]
uh -huh .
something that was outside of school yeah ,
yeah ,
uh -huh .
right after you graduate from , high school , because a lot of people are just , gee whiz , what do i do now if they 're not focused on going to college ,
uh -huh .
having that , gung ho plan that 's , setting their life goals .
uh -huh .
kind of an in -between time .
uh -huh ,
yeah ,
to me , that would be the greatest time for , teenagers to do that , would be right after they graduated from high school .
uh -huh .
yeah .
huh -uh .
as for its being required we 're not based on that , type of a system .
no ,
like i said , now all young people should be able to do something ,
uh -huh .
not all certainly would be geared to , even the mormon boys that go out , not all of them go ,
right .
it 's disaster if they don 't go ,
right .
some of them are not ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
they 're just not made to do that type of thing they just aren 't able to do it .
yeah ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
it 'd be good
like i said , requiring it would be ,
okay ,
it 's pressed .
are you still there ?
i 'm ready
okay
what 's , things that you look for when you go out to dinner ?
uh -huh .
i just like a nice , quiet , nice atmosphere and of course good food
None
that sounds pretty .
yeah .
that 's always a concern , but just a nice quiet easy place maybe candlelight something just to relax , because i don 't really go out to dinner that much ,
None
uh -huh .
we don 't go out to dinner that much either .
uh -huh .
we try to get out maybe once every month and a half or something like that ,
i definitely want to go to a place that 's nice and clean ,
right .
i 've been to some that 's been terrible .
oh
you see cockroaches crawling around and everything ,
i try to get one that 's nice and clean
i like good food and good service .
yeah .
None
yeah ,
yeah ,
right .
right ,
right .
where you don 't feel rushed , you can just relax , and stay as long as you want .
is there some nice places to go to eat in plano ?
nearby .
we 're almost in dallas .
we 're just north of dallas .
uh -huh .
we have quite a bit between us and there .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
it 's about ten miles there is all kinds of restaurants
i had one that was a favorite for a long time ,
it changed hands and doubled the prices
it finally went out of business .
None
it was really nice .
it had a fireplace .
that sounds beautiful .
yeah ,
it was really nice .
they had entertainment sometimes
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
you could just really relax there and enjoy it .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
None
it 's gone
this is only a little small city .
we have ,
i didn 't think my coughing would come back .
we have only one , restaurant that 's kind of nice .
uh -huh .
they have prime rib on , weekends they have about six miles from here is called , a little city called wesley ,
they have a wesley hotel there that they serve food ,
the atmosphere there is really , really nice .
that 's nice .
uh -huh .
if we really want to , something different we go to modesto which is like twenty minutes away .
right .
we don 't have any fast foods here in this small city
that is probably very fortunate for you .
do you have kids ?
do i have kids ?
yeah .
i have a son ,
he 's grown up .
i have a twelve year old that would eat a happy meal every night ,
uh -huh .
now 's she 's graduated to two cheeseburgers ,
something 's happened here ,
mcdonald 's is definitely at the top of her list ,
i hate these places .
yeah .
all the kids seem to love mcdonald 's don 't they ,
uh -huh ,
they do ,
i don 't think there 's an ounce of nutritional value in anything they have .
no ,
no ,
i 'm sure there isn 't .
uh -huh .
we have all kinds of fast foods everywhere around it 's tempting when you come home from work
you 're tired
you just are tempted to give in to that ,
it costs a lot of money to do it too .
 i know . 
 it  adds up
it 's not healthy ,
i really got into that habit for a while ,
yeah .
yeah .
i got out of it again because i just felt like it was just too unhealthy .
uh -huh .
None
let 's see , what else can we talk about ?
how 's california today ?
it 's foggy and cold here .
is it ?
that 's what i 've heard , yeah .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
yeah
it 's .
have you always lived there ?
oh .
i came from iowa when i was sixteen i 've lived out in california for a long , long time .
you like it ?
yeah ,
i like it real well .
yeah ,
we 've been .
we used to live in oakland ,
yeah .
we used to have a lot more restaurants to go to there
then i quit work and everything
i bought a house .
i had a condo in oakland ,
that would be fun .
right in chinatown , so we went to lots of chinese restaurants ,
they were really good ,
i really miss them .  
 yeah .
 do you miss living there ?
no ,
 no . 
i really don 't miss  living there .
yeah .
 i just like to go in there and have a nice chinese dinner once in a while ,
yeah .
as far as missing living there , no .
None
yeah .
it 's close enough if i wanted to go there , to san francisco for dinner or something , why , an hour and fifteen minutes we could be there and have dinner and then come on back .
have you ever been to california ?
yeah ,
i go all the time .
really ?
yeah ,
None
uh -huh .
i have a twenty -one year old daughter in college there she , is a world champion twirler her coach is in california .
she went there for six years .
None
i went out a lot with her .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
yeah ,
i know california pretty well .
uh -huh .
i love it , 
 we tug back and forth who 's going to move ,
i think he 's going to move because i 'm the person with more to lose here .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i have my twelve year old in school she 's happy .
she always lived here in the south ,
i have my house ,
uh -huh .
i have too much to lose ,
i have to admit that we just moved to plano recently and that i hadn 't voted in an election yet ,
although i did go down and register and i ,
that 's the first time i 've ever done that .
what 's been your voting experience ?
my voting experience ?
do you feel like ,
i ,
uh -huh .
personally i 've been very diligent until recent years .
uh -huh .
when i felt my vote was absolutely kind of washed down the drain .
yes .
 uh -huh . 
for the issues that i felt really strong for , i think apathy has set in to a lot of  people  because of the way our politicians are and the way our country is being run .
that 's really true .
that 's kind of the way i have felt .
i also feel guilty , not knowing and not going the extra mile myself and studying out the issues and studying out the candidates .
course , we only have mostly the representation given in the media ,
i have felt since i 've been here that i haven 't known what the issues were because it was a new community .
uh -huh .
you really do have to study to get yourself , up to par with what is truly going on that takes a lot of research
 it does . 
  people today are very busy
yes .
that is an excuse because we are always , invo -,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
no .
i know i 'm heavily involved in other things to take time out and , study the issues in depth would take quite a bit of time i don 't have the time to devote to that you hopefully find you want the candidates that are running to be honest and aboveboard .
uh -huh .
unfortunately they are not .
no .
it 's really a dilemma , that we find ourselves in , i believe .
right .
i kind of just have taken a back step away and , hopefully that someone will clean up the mess that 's there .
uh -huh .
take it ,
it is a task that is , to me , kind of overwhelming .
yes ,
i also feel , especially in the presidential elections that , since we 're back on the old system of electoral votes and that your vote doesn 't necessarily elect president .
right ,
they just want to see how close the electoral votes are with the public votes .
right
yeah .
it 's kind of ,
it 's awful ,
it 's hard to feel like one person ,
i know that it 's important ,
i feel guilty that i haven 't done that here , haven 't taken the time
i know that , people can make a difference ,
it 's hard to face the corruption , like you say , and to know what you 're up against .
it makes me feel bad that ,
i 'm glad ,
i am thankful for the ,
nineteenth amendment is it that gives women the right to vote
None
yes .
i 'm glad that that happened and everything
i hope that i will make a better difference
i haven 't done that so far .
i know that when you 're in a smaller community ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i live in mesquite when we have , a local election , for our mayor and so forth they really , give a lot of information in the local newspaper , not in the bigger city dallas newspaper ,
they just give it a small portion of the newspaper ,
uh -huh .
the local newspaper really goes into , quite a bit of history about the candidate they raise two sides
uh -huh .
there 's a pro and a con side you can really , feel comfortable in , evaluating that , candidate by , that method .
uh -huh .
i feel pretty confident about the way it 's put forth .
uh -huh .
i wouldn 't say that about the larger cities though , and the country on , the presidential .
right .
right .
they 've got people that are running that are admitted , criminals and admitted crooks .
right .
i 'm sorry ,
uh -huh .
i don 't believe in them turning a new leaf unless they have the lord that has done that to them .
right .
without the lord , they can 't do it .
yeah ,
it 's not very likely .
it seems like th -,
you want to go first ?
i believe that the voice , that , initialized this call asked about , if we thought that it should be something that should be put into action .
yeah ,
should the government make it universal or something like that .
yeah .
yes ,
i would be committed to that , becau -,
uh -huh .
you would be in favor of it ?
definitely .
yes .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
i know that there are many countries that , are very successful with the operation of the government , providing that plan .
uh -huh .
do they have options on like choices of doctors and that type of thing ?
do you ,
i 'm not sure how their program is run ,
i know it has been successful .
uh -huh .
i would really have to , read the history of , the country that has fared very well with it ,
i 'd like to see the data on that .
uh -huh .
that 's the way with me ,
i don 't know a whole lot about it .
i woul -,
that 's the only concern i would have , because i think personalities plus the type of doctor it is has a lot to do with the care ,
i ,
if you didn 't have any choice in who you go to ,
yes ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
i think that 's primary , is if you have a good relationship with your doctor that you can feel free to discuss anything with him .
uh -huh .
None
or to change even , if you didn 't approve or didn 't think you were getting good service .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
absolutely that , the choice would be yours if you felt that you weren 't being , given the proper guidelines for your health that you should be able to make , a choice there .
uh -huh .
there , that 's one of my main concerns .
i have a friend that their boy has been sick for several months ,
they just have found out what 's the trouble .
they have gone through , one , two , three , four , five doctors and then a team of doctors ,
they finally determined what the problem was .
it took that long .
yes ,
the expense of that , yes .
that , something like that , i thought , if you couldn 't change or look elsewhere , for help ,
i don 't know how that program works , if you can do that .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i would think that they would have that as part of the benefit to the health care program , that you would indeed have a choice that you could select that individual yourself .
i 'm sure that they would have a history of each doctor , and hopefully that they would have their , accreditations there too .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
i guess that 's primarily was one of my thoughts , because , you know how government is
yes ,
those guidelines have to be set up ,
i think they should be voted on by the public .
uh -huh .
None
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
for them to have a choice on if they 're in favor of it or not .
right ,
yes .
 it would . 
 of course  they would give a full plan of what their intentions would be ,
uh -huh .
i think that 's primary , if they were going to have a universal health care plan .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
that , they would have all the facts and the figures and , what it would mean to each individual family or an individual perhaps being single .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
i 'm not sure what else that , we could address , on health care , other than the fact , i think , the eyes and the ears and the , whole self should be , included in all of that .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
dental , eye care , and , our body as a whole should be included in that because there are so many avenues that needs to be , undertaken in a program like that .
i wouldn 't want to have to go for a private doctor for anything and not be covered by the program .
uh -huh .
i know where my son works they have , an option right now where they can have their own physician
uh -huh .
they can choose one that their company has elected that costs them less if they take the doctor that the company has selected .
he ge -,
does he have an option if he doesn 't care for the personality ?
only to the point that he could go to somebody at his own expense .
i see
otherwise he has to take the physician and the hospital that the company has chosen as the one they have taken .
there again , he 's gotten good service .
he took the less expensive one of course .
if he 's pleased with it , i guess that 's , the bottom line .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
None
i would be afraid of what would happen if you had a personality conflict or something .
right ,
right .
yeah .
yeah ,
there 's always that opposite story there .
uh -huh .
that 's the first i 've really known anybody that , works for somebody that they had that option , to make the choice of what kind of hospitalization they wanted to take .
it 's quite different from when i was , under doctor 's care , that 's for sure .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
i 'm very thankful that i 'm not under any doctor 's care
if you have your health , you 're wealthy .
that 's right
you really are ,
yeah ,
yeah .
yes .
we live in a rural area up here .
uh -huh ,
what part of , pennsylvania do you live in ?
are you familiar with any of the area that all ?
i have a brother that lives there
where ?
near , philadelphia .
that 's a ways away .
we live in clarion county .
okay .
we have a cousin that lives in philadelphia ,
None
are you a native pennsylvanian ?
yes ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
okay ,
i 'm a former michiganian
None
uh -huh .
that 's a nice state ,
that 's a real nice state ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
yes it is ,
it 's very lovely ,
it 's a very lovely state .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh i 'm sure it is ,
uh -huh .
i suppose really our situation here is even different that it is in , more populated areas as far as , the doctors that are available
of course we have good physicians here too ,
we 've been pretty fortunate .
we 've had some of the most outstanding doctors in our area for some of the different fields .
uh -huh .
we 've been pretty fortunate .
uh -huh .
that has broadened so much also .
yeah ,
yeah .
that is , the fields that , are opening up are , just phenomenal .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
they ,
uh -huh .
yeah .
look at the aids , case that 's a whole new field in itself .
uh -huh .
it 's an auto immune deficiency it sure is a dilly one .
it sure is .
i still wish they could do more with the cancer situation , though .
yes ,
i do too .
they just don 't seem to be ,
i know they 're making progress , but not like , that i would like to see , yeah .
to eradicate it entirely , yeah .
yeah .
there 's guidelines that people have to follow ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
if they 're determined to , have their cigarettes and the other carcinogenic causing items then how do you teach them ?
i guess you ,
a lot of them don 't do these things even ,
it doesn 't seem to matter .
that 's true , too .
it rea -,
it 's ,
i really believe our environment have a lot to do with it .
they say second hand smoke and that , is worse than smoking
yeah .
what do you do ,
yeah ,
yeah .
you just have to ban the smoking to their little room that they want to ,
take their rights away from them , they say
i never had the desire ,
i haven 't ever had that problem , as far as that goes .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
i can 't take any credit for not smoking even .
None
it 's a bad habit tha -,
it 's hard to break ,
it 's a hard one to quit .
yeah ,
yeah .
yes .
it 's ,
they say that it is .
it was nice talking with you .
yes ,
very nice talking to you too ,
you have a good day .
you do the same .
we 'll be i guess talking around the country .
right
okay ,
you ,
bye -bye .
okay ,
bye -bye .
kate , where do you like to eat out ?
yes .
we really like the mexican food , here in texas we try and go around to different mexican restaurants trying them out ,
tia 's is probably our favorite , restaurant there ,
i think they have one of the best services that we really like it .
do you ?
have you tried mother mesquites ?
no .
where 's that at ?
uh -huh .
that 's at skillman and l b j there is ,
uh -huh .
it 's where skillman , curves into forest lane it 's real good mexican food .
another real good one is , rafael 's down on mckinney avenue .
oh .
they 're both very good .
really ?
uh -huh .
that ,
no ,
we haven 't explored , too many places .
chains ,
uh -huh .
lot of the big name brand , i guess , chains yeah ,
we 've tried places , down , by the collin creek mall ,
the , alvarez ,
we tried , what was across the street , el paso 's el chico 's or something ,
yeah ,
el chico 's or el fenix one ,
uh -huh
something like that ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
i like tia 's better than i do el chico 's or el fenix .
yeah ,
yeah .
much better .
mother mesquite 's is one of our favorites
then fajitas are one of my ,
yes .
yes .
i like it better than just about anything they make very good fajitas there in their own , homemade flour tortillas that are just absolutely wonderful .
oh .
especially with butter and honey on them
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
i know ,
i tell you what .
they 're excellent food .
i wish i could make them here at home .
yes ,
yes ,
so do i .
just can 't make those flour tortillas .
None
what else do you like ?
uh -huh .
i love seafood i notice they have the louisiana purchase ,
razzoo 's has opened up down , close to six thirty -five .
yes ,
i haven 't eaten there .
have you eaten there ?
yes .
i have eaten there .
now the only problem ,  ]
i love the food .
uh -huh .
it 's a lot of cajun food and good seafood ,
the service has always been so strange , every time i 've been in there .
uh -huh .
mostly it 's been at lunch time i hear at night though they have , the outdoor , bar ,
that 's it 's really , kind of lively .
uh -huh .
it 's really good . all their blackened grill stuff .
uh -huh .
for the spicy , we like atchafalaya 's out on belt line , in addison it 's a good restaurant .
that sounds great .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
 ]
for one of the best fish restaurants in town is either vincent 's there in plano or , i believe it 's a rusty scupper over on , dallas parkway in addison , which is absolutely wonderful .
uh -huh .
the service is great .
uh -huh .
they have every kind of fish that you could imagine you 'd want the atmosphere is wonderful too .
uh -huh .
if you want a really special night out and fish food that 's a good place to go .
i have children and work ,
we can eat a lot of fast food
fast food , i can understand that .  ]
i can remember when our children were small .
uh -huh .
we lived in the chicago area at the time ,
yeah
we had a lot of mcdonalds when they were first coming out .
i know .
i can 't look a mcdonalds in the face now .
i know ,
i 'm so sick of mcdonalds ,
we used to eat there all the time .
now we branch out at this wendy 's or some other fast food joint .
taco bueno 's good
and cheap too .
and cheap ,
and cheap .
yeah ,
the kids , they 've got those expensive tastes
they like tia 's
yes ,
they can sit down and all that good kind of stuff .
yes yes .
sounds like my grandchildren .
yeah ,
i know .
they 're just spoiled rotten ,
None
no ,
we love to eat out ,
yes .
of course , it 's just so much easier and simpler yeah .
we usually eat out generally two or three times a week .
it 's just my husband and i ,
it 's either t v dinners at home or we go out to eat .
yeah ,
yeah .
i would much rather go out to eat than t v dinners
me too ,
me too .
i know that i just work
i 'm just tired when i get home
i just don 't feel like cooking .
no ,
no .
on the weekends there 's always things to do ,
we like to go out to lunch on saturdays especially .
i like breakfast out .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
i like the ihop there in plano .
yeah ,
oh .
we 've been there twice both times the food just didn 't quite settle with me i don 't know what it was .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
now that 's surprising because normally they 're real good .
yes ,
i love .
i like because even if they 're crowded , they 're fast service ,
uh -huh .
don 't have to wait forever for a table .
uh -huh ,
yeah .
family restaurant .
we also like owens , country sausa -,
uh -huh .
yeah yeah .
we think it 's good .
i haven 't been there befo -,
i went to one i think in ohio or somewhere up there ,
i 've never been to that one here .
i know it 's just down the street .
uh -huh .
it 's good .
have you been to applebee 's .
yes ,
yes .
yes .
we like applebee 's .
yes ,
i really like that too ,
that was ,
yeah ,
it 's fun .
i like up there in plano , that , country steak house .
oh .
have you tried it ?
i 've been there twice ,
uh -huh ,
yeah ,
None
we like it because it 's fairly reasonable
we go for the salad bar .
salad bar ,
yes .
nancy , do you have any children ?
yes ,
i have a twelve year old ,
i 've been very lucky .
i haven 't needed child care except for my mom .
None
oh .
i 've been real lucky .
i 'm a nurse ,
i go to work early ,
that 's nice .
my mom comes over in the morning and gets her ready for her school or just hangs by while she gets ready drives her to school ,
then i 'm home to pick her up .
i 'm very , very lucky
that is lucky .
how old , does a child have to be before you get to stop making arrangements for him , i wonder .
i could do it now .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
she gets lonely in the morning ,
i feel better .
she has a crazy father out there somewhere that i just don 't let her out of my sight .
 you never know . 
 it 's nice for them  not to be alone .
yeah ,
yeah ,
she feels that way ,
uh -huh .
we have a neighbor on the next block that she could always walk over there and go to school with ,
we just feel better doing it this way .
None
 not after wor -, 
 i don 't know  what day we 'll stop .
we were about to stop one day this year ,
her father called the school and made all kinds of threats ,
no .
we didn 't stop .
you realize that it only takes one second for something to happen .
yeah .
even though she 's twelve , she 's still a kid ,
she is .
you got to be careful
i 'm glad you have that , opportunity to have your mom .
yeah ,
i 'm glad too
uh -huh .
i have two kids five and six , a girl and a boy ,
uh -huh .
so far i haven 't had to make a lot of child care arrangements for them because , i 'm at home now full time .
yeah .
when i was going to school , i would go to school a time that my husband when he was at home that we would just switch back and forth like that .
it 's really scary ,
i would really hate to be in a position to have to find child care
uh -huh .
 no . 
i would , too , because even though a place can look pretty good on the outside , we 're finding out now that it 's not always on the inside i just don 't know what i would do if  i had  to do that .
i know the hospital that i work in is a big hospital
they provide child care ,
uh -huh .
of course they charge for it at least all the nurses can leave their children ,
they 're always watching them ,
they can eat lunch with them ,
if they feel sick they can call them at work and they run over and check on them ,
oh .
they feel a little better than if they dropped them off somewhere on the way .
 ]
that 's nice .
yeah ,  ]
it is nice .  ]
i know that i have , done some babysitting myself ,
None
when i was in school and needed extra money .
right , right  ]
i know how i felt as a provider of child care that , even though you 're taking care of someone else 's child and you 're forcing yourself to , treat them equally and , better , usually , better than your own it 's not the same ,
that 's right .  ]
it made me realize that , no one will love your child as much as you and your mother ,
yeah ,
right .
and , the family
no one will look out , after them ,
so far i think my preference would be rather than to have a big day care
right .
what is that kinder care and things like that ,
rather than having one where they would deliver the children to school in a van or something ,
yeah .
i would prefer to have in home care , either my own home or a neighbor or something .
yeah .
just never know .
i babysat for the little girl next door for a year or so when her parents first got divorced ,
uh -huh .
it was hard to treat her equally with my child .
they were the same age ,
they played together ,
they were good friends ,
right .
you said , you tend to go more for the other one 's side just because you are responsible
it is hard .
it got hard ,
my daughter got jealous
it just wasn 't the same as when they were just playing as friends , because she had to be there every day .
no .
no .
i stopped that after a year , because it was difficult to balance it ,
None
i know , when i pick my kids up from school they want to come home . 
 they do . 
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i know , i know .  ]
i would hate for them to have , be picked up by a day care and be taken to another large group situation .
yeah .  ]
i think , my preference if i had to find day care would be a small , someone that i knew
yeah ,
well , i would rather do without some things  ]
uh -huh .
i know that some parents , they both do have to work ,  ]
a lot of people where i live are working just because they want bigger and better ,
i would never do that .
no .
i never have done it ,
i just never would do it .
i would rather do without some things that really aren 't very important compared to being with my child when they 're growing up .
None
that 's true , because even now , when they 're gone to school , it seems like there 's just not enough time left over  ]
 in the day . 
no  there isn 't ,
 there isn 't any time ,
that 's true .
by the time they have to eat and have homework and they want some free time ,
there 's just not enough time in the day to do anything good quality for them ,
that 's really ,
okay .
i really haven 't thought about the topic of drug testing .
just off the top of my head , i don 't think i see much wrong with it .
if i owned a company and i wanted to make sure that it was run smoothly and that the people that i had , coming in , were trust worthy , et cetera , and so on , i think i would , probably do the random testing just to insure that my company , runs safely and smoothly .
yeah .
i also haven 't thought too much about it .
i suspect it very much depends upon the job .
huh -uh .
maybe .
there are some jobs where i guess it doesn 't really ,
yeah .
if it 's not affecting someone 's performance then i 'm not sure if it 's a problem .
yeah .
if it 's a position where it could potentially affect ,  ]
that 's true
i didn 't think about that ,
like for instance ,
   if , 
 if someone 's working on  heavy machinery ,
 right . 
 or  say driving trucks or city buses or something like that .
then that is something that affects the community .
if you 're drinking or on drugs or whatever , you 're driving a city bus you taking several lives in your hands .
right .
if you 're a computer operator there 's really no big deal ,
i think ,
 yeah . 
 that  maybe it 's not necessary .
for me , i think that drug testing , it follows the path that society is going in .
if more and more people are using drugs then i think that some people have to guard against people that are using drugs .
huh -uh .
it 's just where society is right now ,
something we have to cope with
i think the drug testing is something that the drug users have to cope with .
yeah .
in that respect , i think it may help a lot .
i think it may be hopefully push people away from drug use ,
yeah .
if they no that ,  ]
yeah ,
i think that may be .
if you use drugs , you won 't get the job .
 ]
that means one of the points of it .
of course i 'm not sure , what the time span is ,
if i used drugs last week and i had a , job interview that i wouldn 't use drugs the day before or something
they wouldn 't even see it .
you know , what i 'm saying ?
yeah .  ]
i don 't know ,
they may not be able to trace it .
i don 't know how far they trace .
i don 't know what the , limits are .
 i don 't know 
that would actually be an interesting thing to find out , i think .
i don 't actually know how long those things stay in the system .
i 've heard some things will stay there for six months ,
some stay for less ,
some stay for longer .
yeah .
things like l s d , i guess , stay forever .
 ]
in some ways ,
  you get flashbacks for , forever .
really .  ]
i guess so .
something like that ,
yeah .
 there  must be something ,
people get these little flashback things ,
None
 of  some sort ,
i don 't really know .
yeah .
i don 't use any drugs .
i don 't really drink or anything ,
i 'm pretty , i guess , decisive about that ,
just the fact that since i don 't use drugs , i have no problem with taking a test .
right .
if you actually used drugs at all ,
 yeah . 
  i 'm at most a social drinker ,
 yeah .
yeah . 
 it 's  never a problem .
the only thing i would hate is if i were to go and ,
it 's kind of the same thing with the lie detector test .
if you don 't have anything to hide , you 're not going to mind it .
people that ,  ]
 right . 
 don 't have anything to hide .
there are some things that just aren 't peoples business ,
 right .
that , 
 that come out at  that point
i think that a lot of people have trouble with that .
None
 i can understand that . 
 that 's a fine line to draw . 
huh -uh .
huh -uh .
that 's really  
None
 yeah . 
 do  you worry about , this or that ,
what about the rights ,
 huh -uh . 
 to  privacy ,
what   if they 're doing something legal ,
they would rather have it private ,
 right . 
None
right .
especially in the case of drinking .
if someone is something more than a social drinker , shall we say , yet , they 're not an alcoholic , what do you do ?
yeah .
yeah .
None
i took a lie detector once
i didn 't mind it ,
i was just offended by some of the questions , i guess .
there was one question , do you like your mother ?
you know ?
i said , yes .
do you hate your mother ?
no .
have you ever killed your mother ?
i was going ,
those are just ,
yeah ,
what in the world .
those are to get the shock value out of you .
just to see ,  ]
 is that what it was ? 
   shock .
i 'm a graduate student in psych .
okay .
we sort of , figure out ,
i know a little bit about that kind of stuff .
huh -uh .
what they 're trying to do there is , they want to sort of get a base line measure for you ,
how is it that when you see these things
 huh -uh . 
None
None
kind of get something to measure my responses by .
yeah .
with them they have no idea if you 're just sort of jumping ,
 yeah . 
 around  and being fidgety ,
 yeah . 
 maybe   
it can be shocking
None
 yeah
    shock you .
  they ask why i was going ,
what in the world are you asking me about here .
 ]
yeah .
i guess , i don 't know , some people have probably killed their mothers .
i don 't know
yeah ,
i guess so ,
i guess , i don 't know what actually happens if you have killed your mother
yeah
big jump there .
 ]
yeah .
yeah ,
i think it 's their way of saying how well you do ,
 huh -uh . 
 in  a shock situation without worrying about ,
 huh -uh .   ]
 stuff  like that .
 ]
i never thought about that ,
that makes me feel a little better
of course , that was years and years ago .
yeah .
 ]
yeah ,
i don 't think that you killed your mother though ,
i wouldn 't worry about that .
i don 't think there are some people ,
in society a lot of people are taking drugs .
there is also people that are getting off drugs and trying to do better with their lives .
they take a lie detector test or a drug test , or whatever
the stuff that happened to them , five years ago comes up
it spoils their chances for just making it a little better .
when they might be actually trying to ,
 yeah . 
 improve  their lives .
yeah .
that 's , it could blow things right away for them ,
huh -uh .
they could walk in and say , look , i did do drugs a year ago ,
 huh -uh .   ]
  i 'm off them for a year now .
huh -uh .
  i 'll be happy to take the test ,
it will show up positive .
yeah .
yeah .
versus ,
i would probably do that .
i would probably bring something in showing that i had been to such and such hospital for help or ,
 yeah . 
 whatever  the twelve month program .
whatever it is that they do .
yeah .
although then , they can 't legally discriminate , i think on the basis  
huh -uh .
i don 't really know .
i don 't know what the laws are pertaining to this .
yeah .
yeah .
my wife probably does .
i 'm not sure what they are either .
i don 't  
yeah .
it 's an interesting topic that i never actually thought about  
yeah .
the other day we had talked about , capital punishment .
i  
i really , really hadn 't thought about it .
i think about it because i hear about it ,
i hadn 't had to sit down and well , what do i think about it
that 's kind of like today .
i 'm not real sure what i think about it .
i 'm kind of , in the middle on that one .
yeah .
these are tough .
i sort of like that stuff ,
it makes you think .
huh -uh .
really ,
really .
i think that 's real good .
okay .
it was very nice talking to you .
nice talking to you to .
okay .
take care .
bye -bye .
bye -bye .
i think we pay too much in taxes .
yeah .
how about you ?
i think they waste what we pay .
excuse me ?
i think they waste all the money that we pay
yeah ,
that 's what i think too .
i don 't know how you feel ,
we moved here from another state .
we lived here before , went out and came back ,
that particular state had an occupational income tax , but no sales tax .
uh -huh .
what you find out is , one evil is the same as the other .
here there 's no occupational tax
it 's a heavy sales tax .
uh -huh .
they get you coming and going .
now it 's even higher in dallas county ,
None
 was it .   ]
 yeah ,
 i know , it 's just ,
it 's eight and a quarter i think .
yeah ,
it is .
i was shocked .
i went ,
we bought a new washer
the man said , and that 's eight percent .
i said , eight percent . what
uh -huh .
it 's really kind of sad ,
yeah .
i don 't know how , in terms of when you all do your federal ,
it just seems like , if you 're strictly middle income , it seems like you get hit the worst .
yeah .
is that what you think ?
yeah ,
because at some point it goes up to thirty -three percent
the people that make , five hundred thousand dollars and higher than that , they don 't have to pay ,
sometimes they have to pay even less taxes .
doesn 't seem quite fair , does it ?
no ,
it isn 't .
because they have the money to shelter things
i don 't know , somehow get a ,
what ?
i thought you were going to say something .
huh -uh .
they somehow seem to get around these ,
the things that we can 't ,
don 't make that kind of money .
right .
i don 't know .
if they 're in business , and they 're making money ,
i could see if they 're losing money ,
uh -huh .
they 're making money then they should pay taxes then .
i know ,
just somehow it doesn 't seem ,
you
you look at like , that country singer , what 's his name , willie nelson .
uh -huh .
i was reading about him in the paper i said , he knew he was making money .  ]
he didn 't look that stupid .
why didn 't he pay his taxes ?  ]
right .
uh -huh .
right .
in a way , it 's almost like he had so much debt that , filing bankruptcy was a way to get out of all of it
do you file federal or joint income tax ,
 ]
i just file federal income tax every year .
do you feel like you get hit by , too much ?
yeah ,
i just got divorced ,
i 'm single again .
it 's a lot worse for single people , because they pay the same amount as the people that make the same amount of money and  they 're married . 
 uh -huh .
 right now , we don 't own any property .
we lease .
we 're in the same ,
we don 't have children ,
we 're in the same kind of ,
uh -huh .
it 's not as bad as being single and divorced ,
if you have like x point five children and earn , you kind of get hit with ,
it doesn 't even pay for me to earn a good wage , because ,
doesn 't that sound stupid .
uh -huh .
there 's actually less tax implication if i don 't work full time compared to what my husband does ,  ]
right .
it 's kind of hard .
whoever works less , they can get a tax credit for that .
excuse me .
uh -huh .
if both of the spouses work , then you get a tax credit for that .
right .
uh -huh .
yeah otherwise you 're just ,
if you have kids , you get seven hundred fifty dollars or something
it 's two thousand now .
it is .
yeah ,
for everybody .
my .
uh -huh .
that 's not too bad .
then you get a child care exemption ,
it 's not enough , you know .
uh -huh .
you pay from fifty to a hundred dollars a week in child care they only give you i think it 's about five or ten percent of that .
my goodness .
it 's not even ,
yeah .
i guess that 's my call .
i guess i better go
 okay . 
 okay ,
 it was nice talking to you .
nice talking to  you . 
 uh -huh ,
 bye -bye .
what part of the country are you in ?
pennsylvania .
yeah .
you are ?
east or west , i 'm from pittsburgh .  ]

you have a big ,
do you have a rural house or what do you have ?
that 's a ,
we have a big old farmhouse that we 've remodeled .
those are beautiful .
it had been , of course , a farm .
uh -huh .
it 's a farm community ,

ours is not a working farm

uh -huh .
my husband was transferred around , up to minnesota and now back to texas with t i we 're leasing a , two story town home in a section of dallas they call north dallas .

it 's not little any more .
grapevine ,
do you know grapevine ?
yes ,
that 's out near the airport .
that 's about forty -five miles from us .
yeah ,
my brother has a home there he 's trying to sell .
he 's living now up , in maryland
he ,
it 's ,
yeah ,
lived in grapevine for a long time .
that 's why we 're not sure we want to , buy down here , because we lived up north long enough to appreciate the ,  ]
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
minneapolis -saint paul is very clean in terms of ,  ]
in terms of housing down here , you really have your pick
it 's just everything 's overpriced for the economy .
it 's terrible .
i ,
it really is ,
we 're in a leased town home ,
it 's nine hundred a month .
i 'm not surprised .
you know what ,
right ,
right .
right ,
right .
if you get anything under five hundred you get into what they call high density living the big apartment complexes i just have no tolerance for that .
yeah ,
yeah ,
it 's not good
no .
i pre -,  ]
the people think the income is really great in some of those areas
that 's right .  ]
when they sit down and look at what it costs to live of course , most of the homes are , fairly nice ,
they 're , done up fairly nice ,
yeah
the town home we 're in . i don 't know how , we ,  ]
it 's like a duplex ,
a two by two they call it like in pittsburgh .
right ,
uh -huh ,
right .  ]
it 's nice
the girl bought it for a hundred and ten ,
uh -huh .
now she can 't sell it .
our neighbors ,
prices have come down on the homes , the duplexes .
yeah ,
our neighbors , the attached on the other side , they 're very nice , thank god ,
uh -huh .
they paid fifty -eight for it .
my heaven .
that 's how bad it ,
i know .
i know up in connecticut the same thing happened ,
 ]
that 's right .
people are devastated because they paid so much for their home .
uh -huh ,
yeah .
i have some friends that live in westport
it 's really , really bad .
i mean you ,
we like our area .
uh -huh .
it 's an old house and everything
where is clarion county in relation to ,
we 're considering moving to pennsylvania
that 's not too bad .
we 're about a hundred miles from pittsburgh north .
that 's north .
yeah ,
it 's really not that far .
are you going up toward ,
i 'm trying to think of the name of that town that starts with an m ,
bradford , no that 's too far north .
bradford 's north of us .
you 're not that far north then ,
okay .
no ,
no .
you 're really not too bad .
yeah .
uh -huh .
was it a home that you 've had for quite a few years ,
that you 've ,
we 've been here since sixty -six .
then you have ,
yeah .
do you have a lot of land
None
we have fifty acres .
my ,
then .
pardon me ,
we have forty ,
we gave ten to one of our children
there you go .
did you have a hard time getting used to ,
do you feel like you live in an isolated area
None
no ,
not really ,
towns keep creeping closer and closer ,
yeah ,
i think that that 's ,
i can remember in pittsburgh when ,
this has to do with homes , indirectly
i can remember when upper saint clair was out in
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
the rural end of washington ,
now it 's a terrible connection .
yeah ,
it 's ours up here .
we have ,
our rural connections are real bad
that 's okay ,
we live about ten miles from probably three or four , not large towns but , reasonable .
sub -,
yeah ,
substantially ,
do you like living in an older home and restoring it like that ?
yeah ,
we 're tired of doing it though .
we don 't want to do too much more
how big is it ?
how many square feet do you have ?
golly ,
i really .
how many rooms do you think ,
yeah ?
uh -huh .
we have , four rooms downstairs , and a pantry upstairs we have a bath ,
we , have a half bath downstairs , too .
uh -huh .
we have a bath upstairs , and one , two , three , four bedrooms and a sewing room and a junk room
None
a junk room ,
yeah
i understand ,
we have that too .
that 's large if your children aren 't at home any more .
pardon ?
that 's large if your kids aren 't at home any more .
it really isn 't too big yet .
we li -,
a lot of people say that
None
uh -huh .
it 's ,
we just like it real well
 ]
it 's enough space for two people
yeah .
yeah ,
we had five children ,
okay .
they 've all moved on .
they 're all out on their own now .
yeah ,
right .
that 's okay .
we 've got ,
this town house is pretty big .
it 's about eighteen hundred square feet .
uh -huh .
it 's got three bedrooms , two and a half baths it 's really nice .
it sounds like a good buy .
yeah ,
it is ,
i would never buy it
leasing it is fine .
uh -huh .
it 's just again , the privacy ,
we had a house in minneapolis that was on three acres ,
my husband was raised , on a working farm near dayt -,
that makes a big difference .
right ,
near dayton , ohio ,
he said ,
he 's slowly getting me to , not feel isolated if we move to where there 's more land .
uh -huh .
you really aren 't isolated because it 's ,
the advantages ,
your home is far enough away that you 're not bothered by being too close to people ,
right .
yet you can have your friends ,
you can have them in ,
you can go out .
uh -huh .
you have more of a choice ,
you 're not pressed upon as bad .
that 's kind of what ,
uh -huh .
his parents have , land that they retired to , about a hundred miles out of atlanta in georgia ,
it is too far south for me ,
uh -huh .
they have one of the ,
when they said log cabin , i just laughed ,
that they retired to ,
they built one of these .
it 's just beautiful .
 ]
uh -huh .
it 's like a custom , it 's not like what i would think of when i think of old log cabins .
it 's modern
it 's ,
more luxury .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
right ,
right ,
it 's modern ,
it 's beautiful ,
right ,
yeah .
it 's country it 's
i don 't ,
what else about housing except it 's ,
pittsburgh 's housing economy , i think it 's holding it 's own .
they 're ,
yeah ,
i suppose they are now .
we ,
both of our children who live there have just bought a home .
 ]
what sections are they in ?
in the mount lebanon area .
yeah ,
that 's nice .
the one boy , the house they bought is completely livable .
they didn 't have to do much to it .
great .
the other one needs more work done .
it 's twenty years old , i think .
uh -huh .
they have two children , too ,
uh -huh .
they bought what they could afford .
that 's ,
yeah ,
a really good friend of mine lives in penn hills ,
uh -huh .
they 've been in their house , probably about twelve years now it 's ,
uh -huh .
they 're going to start to see their return on their investment very soon .
it 's a beautiful home
None
they are beautiful homes .
my brother lives ,
is it called baldwin or bebble ?
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
he lives all in that same area going from mount lebanon ,
it 's real pretty up there .
it 's just ,
it is ,
it 's real nice .
uh -huh .
the neighborhoods are stable
it 's ,
when you come to this part of the country , we 've been away from dallas long enough that you see the difference in housing .
my
you do when you mo -.
when we first got married ,
my husband works for the state ,
we moved once a year usually
my goodness .
after they had to start paying to move us ,
uh -huh .
that suddenly wasn 't necessary any more
that 's what it is here ,
yeah ,
that 's why we 're at a point now we 're adopting
we have been married ten plus years
what happens is , you just realize that once you get to a certain age the next house that you get we 'll be staying in
 ]
right , yeah ,
you have to stop some place ,
yeah .
yeah ,
yeah .
that 's kind of like where we 're ,
we 're considering pennsylvania ,
we 're just kind of , toying with what exactly , where we want to be ,
uh -huh .
a lot of people say it doesn 't matter where they live if they have a nice house
 ]
i disagree with that ,
i .
i do too ,
i 've heard too many people say , i hate it here .
uh -huh .
they buy a place
they just hate the area .
i know ,
the economy here in dallas , it 's steady ,
it 's still not going up .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i just refuse to buy it , if i know i 'm not going to be there for at least five years ,
yeah ,
my brother , they 're having trouble selling their home ,
i 'm sure ,
yeah ,
there , you can go down a street ,
right ,
None
yeah ,
yeah .
here , he told you this , every other house , if it 's been foreclosed on even big executives it 's really ,
it 's hard to sell the properties .
people from j c penney 's from new york , came here about a couple of years ago .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
they thought they were getting a great deal , because they could get a five hundred thousand dollar home with , they call it , zero lot lines , no property ,
jean .  ]
uh -huh .
it would make you ill to see this .
yeah .
i mean it would probably be like your house on , a half a city block in pittsburgh or something .
i couldn 't handle that
yeah ,
i know ,
that 's ,
i can look outside right now and look into the next unit .
uh -huh .
it 's across the way ,
it 's landscaped and all that with azaleas ,
uh -huh .
it 's still not that private .
i get tired , sometimes , mowing , because we mow , a good bit of ground around the house area .
yeah
you have a rider .
i do get tired of that
i don 't know ,
i don 't think i 'd want to change it .
no ,
your kids have ,
to tell you the truth , i think that if you can keep that way , kind of like a homestead ,
hello .
hi ,
i wear pants .
i 'm a real pants person
when i 'm at home since ,
i 'll say , i 'm a homemaker since that 's my basic thing ,
i wear a pantsuit most of the time .
not a pantsuit ,
i guess pants and a shirt
in the summertime i wear cotton tops .
cotton top shirts
in the winter i wear , sweaters .
i like sweaters a lot .
i do that .
when i go out for meetings then i will wear either , skirts or , a dress
i have a couple of pantsuits because those are real in at this time ,
that 's basically what i do .
i think our tastes are fairly similar ,
although i am i government worker , i do tend to ,
i 'm , a scientist .
oh .
that technically ,
i suppose , i could get away with extremely casual clothes ,
for the most part i don 't .
i wear fairly respectable looking shoes
right .
a pantsuit of one sort or another
i guess dress it up with a very nice black jacket when i have visitors or have to give talks .
that sounds nice .
right .
it said the seasons ,
do you change much through the season
None
no ,
uh -huh .
i guess this summer i wore some fairly nice jeans more than i have in previous seasons .
no ,
i tend to use the same things because actually our offices are very cold in summer .
i don 't know whether they think by , freezing them up overnight , then they can save electricity during the day or something .
maybe .
no .
you wear a heavy sweater in your office ,
all summer .
right ,
yeah ,
i 'm not a clothes horse in the sense that some of my friends .
uh -huh .
yeah .
yeah .
i guess although in , as i recall the stereotype of secretaries was , overdress , over kill , sort of in a sense , the people i know who spend the most on clothes are secretaries .
right .
although the fact that most of the ones i know are in the government and they 're not meeting the public i find it a little bit strange that their priorities would be to spend this money here
you know ,
uh -huh .
then may -,
i suppose if you were more a receptionist and meeting the public and it was the image of your company at stake perhaps you would have to dress up .
i don 't have the resources to just go out and buy , buy , buy anyway
my don 't change dramatically over the years .
if i need something new , i will go and buy it .
basically i 'm a pretty much the same
in the summertime i wear the light cotton
in the wintertime i change to the sweaters .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
it 's not a whole lot of change for me either .
especially when i go to the meetings and wear the dresses
i enjoy that ,
it just wouldn 't be , smart for me to do that in my home with my children .
uh -huh .
i have to , think about things like that , too .
i have given seminars before in creative writing and things like that .
i don 't know if they consider that a job .
i don 't really get paid for that , often ,
when i do that then i think i become more businesslike .
it doesn 't really change my clothing style .
exactly .
yeah .
you can look businesslike in a the same pant suit you would , wear for other things .
yeah ,
i 'm really glad about that pant suits are popular because i 'm allergic to many of the synthetics .
oh .
uh -huh .
i used to have a problem when i was working in a restaurant while i was in college and had to dress up , and nylons and things like that would just give me a terrible rash .
dear .
None
that 's not helpful .
right ,
right .
otherwise , i guess we 're both pretty practical
yeah ,
i guess so
it 's been great talking to you .
okay .
 have a great day . 
 have a good day . 
bye .
bye -bye .
what do you think ?
this is about drug testing right ?
right .
i 'm certainly under the influence of the idea that the government needs to have less control on what the citizens do ,
i do see this as something that definitely needs to be taken care of .
whether that should be put in the hands of the corporation or the , hands of the government is a different question i think , as far as i 'm concerned .
i -,
in other words , i am in favor of drug testing .
i was drug tested when i came to my job here at t i .
uh -huh .
None
i think it should be more by the private institution .
how about you ?
yeah ,
i think that the corporations should , do all that .
uh -huh .
they should , have drug screening before they hire an employee
any time that an employee ,
uh -huh .
yeah .
if they 're coming to late work all the time and , especially if they 're on the line or any kind of sensitive job where , if they made a mistake , it would cost a lot of money or people 's lives .  *[[ slash
sure .
then they need to be watched carefully  *[[ slash
 ]
uh -huh .
yeah ,
i agree with you .
i would even think that , i could , in theory take that a step further and say anybody in any job , if the corporation felt like , b -,
this is why , drugs are the biggest problem , i think to face america today .
i mean it 's what drives crime ,
it 's what drives , any sort of , pain and discomfort in the world , or in america i think is somewhat , driven by drugs
i think that , were corporations and , private industry to take command in this situation , that maybe we might have some control over that .
we ,
if you can 't work , be a little bit harder to take drugs or whatever ,
i don 't know .
right .  ]
course , that might up crime , when , people go in and steal your television and ste -, and sell it just because they can 't work anymore ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
you got to have a safe work place .
that 's all there is to it .
definitely ,
you 're definitely right .
that , you can 't have it any other way .
uh -huh .
in the case that you brought up , w -,
if it 's a policeman and he 's working with , the public and has a gun in his holster or even , if it 's a guy at mcdonald 's cooking a burger , i think , they 're dangerous in either situation .
uh -huh .
i ,
what do you think ,
what percentage of corporations and , private industry do you think use , drug testing ?
i think it 's more frequent now .
it 's probably like forty , fifty percent .
really ?
yeah .
uh -huh .
because , all the jobs that i 've applied for have , mentioned some type of drug screening .
right .
 ]
what kind of work are you in ?
i work at sears .
uh -huh .
i just do warehouse work .
uh -huh ,
did they give you drug testing ?
not ,
they hired me in nineteen eighty -four
 ]
oh .
yeah .  ]
okay .
uh -huh .
now they issued a statement about that , about three months ago .
are they going to , begin spontaneous , drug testing ?
not that i know of .
it was more about , all the people 's problems .
uh -huh .
they 've been laying off a lot of people .
yeah .
they sent out the employee assistance cards for anyone that had any sort of drug problem or work related problem .
sure .
family problems ,
uh -huh .
they kind of covered everything .
uh -huh .
i know they have a lot of drug problems
None
yeah .
what do you think about ,
something that kind of concerns me is , you and i are tested for whatever work we happen to do .
do you think there should be drug testing for political officials ?
yes ,
i do .
yeah ,
i do , too .
because they 're hypocritical .
yeah .
they talk against drugs they get caught ,
uh -huh .
in stings in washington .  ]
yeah .
whether it 's drugs or any other kind of ,
like the money laundering scams . all that was drug related .
yeah .
that cost us , the country , billions of dollars .
sure ,
sure ,
yeah .
None
i would agree with you .
i can 't see how we can expect the , people working in america to put any trust into our political officials if they don 't ,
just doesn 't make sense to worry about legislation unless they 're doing that themselves .
doug , you want to start ?
sure .
you don 't use any credit cards , i don 't imagine .
no .
of course i use ,
credit cards .
yeah .
i have a couple of credit cards and , use them .
uh -huh ,
do you use them a lot ?
we try not to .
uh -huh .
we 're on a pretty strict and tight budget .
uh -huh .
we use the credit cards , however , when we 're at a situation where we don 't have either the cash or the checkbook handy .
uh -huh .
we use credit cards also , if we want to get an extended warranty on an item that we 're purchasing .
that 's an idea ,
that 's a thought ,
uh -huh .
yes ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
basically we use it mainly when we 're traveling or out of state or somewhere where , they don 't take out of state checks when we 're traveling some .
do you use credit cards often ?
my husband loves them
we do use them .
we try not to ,
he 's one who believes in credit cards ,
he uses them quite a bit .
uh -huh .
he likes using them and then just pay at the end of the month
yeah ,
he likes that ,
uh -huh .
well that 's a good thing , because lot of people don 't pay at the end of the month they just pay the minimum required balance .
that 's when you get into expenses .
yes ,
you get in over your head .
right .
it 'll ,
uh -huh .
some people i know also try to use it as float where they buy something now
say , i 'm going to buy this when it 's good and on sale
uh -huh .
i can go ahead and pay for it when i get my check at the end of the month
when i 'm being paid .
right .
sometimes you do come on bargains and that ,
it 's really useful .
that 's true .
uh -huh .
some places won 't take , personal checks or cash , even they would take a credit card .
right .
how are the laws in pennsylvania , as regard , not the laws , but the credit card rates in pennsylvania ?
uh -huh .
right .
for example down here , when you go up to a gas station you get an extra charge for credit cards than you would by paying for cash .
are they the same there ?
we ,
yeah ,
we have the same thing up here ,
we don 't deal where they do that
we go to places where they don 't charge extra .
some of them charge five cents a gallon , even ,
the gas stations more ,
that 's pretty steep .
we just try to avoid , the ones that do that ,
yes .
we just don 't , go there because there 's enough other ones around that don 't charge you anything
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
extra to me , credit cards are the same as cash ,
to me they are , anyway ,
yes ,
because you make the deduction at the time of the purchase
right .
right ,
yeah .
yes .
so that the end of the month or when you get your credit card bill are you saying that that way you 're not left stranded and high and dry
yeah ,
right .
very good .
you 're one of the i guess , good faithful shoppers that don 't get into a problem when it comes to budgeting their money .
i can 't say we never have .
uh -huh .
now we have , at times , made payments on our things ,
we try not to .
we try hard ,
yeah ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
right .
i see that as an advantage to a credit card , also that you can find yourselves in those situations and use a credit card to help yourself .
right .
i think that there 's a great advantage to a credit card in those situations .
uh -huh .
yeah ,
uh -huh .
because sometimes , there 's times when you maybe couldn 't take advantage of something with a credit card you can .
None
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
do you have , multiple credit cards ?
None
do you find that advantageous
None
i think we 're narrowing it down ,
like i said , my husband likes them ,
we have quite a few ,
uh -huh .
when you get down to the nitty gritty , there 's probably three that we use most of the time .
right .
we 're actually in the same boat .
uh -huh .
we like to use three , basic credit cards .
uh -huh .
that way we 're not confused
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
we don 't have an awful lot of expenses or surprises when it comes the end of the month .
do you find that you get an awful lot of credit card applications through the mail ?
yes .
once a week ,
twice a week ,
three times a week .
it 's not every week ,
you do get them .
they make it very readily available .
yeah .
almost too much so .
i really don 't like it the charges that ,
we try to look at that also ,
right ,
the annual fee .
right ,
right ,
what they charge per year to use our money , they 're charging us to spend our money ,
i 'm not real crazy about that ,
we try to look at that also .
yes ,
uh -huh ,
right .
there is the basic annual fee for the credit card plus they charge any where from seventeen to twenty -three percent based upon what the state will allow ,
okay ,
miss nancy , we should be in business now .
 good . 
 did  you hear the questions that the lady , brought up ?
yes .
such as how much time ,
i 'll ask ,
how much time do you spend with your children ,
how many do you have ?
we have two children ,
they 're both grown and married
we have ,
our daughter has three sons ,
we see them at least once a week ,
we see our son and his wife about every other week
uh -huh .
we baby -sit quite frequently .
we 're a fairly close -knit family .
we 're together a lot on special days
of course , with the holidays and everything .
you 're very fortunate .
my ,
i have two girls and a son ,
 uh -huh . 
  my oldest daughter lives in amsterdam , holland .
oh .
 her husband builds pianos ,
it 's kind of hard for us to visit with them , as much as i 'd like to .
 yes . 
 because  one thing we do have together is we 're both musicians .
i play in several symphony orchestras
None
 uh -huh . 
 she is  a concert , harpsichordist .
oh .
and travels around a good bit in europe .
uh -huh .
her husband builds forte pianos ,
which are harpsichord size  pianos . 
 pianos ,  uh -huh .
that 's why they 're over there .
i have a son who lives in , warrington , pennsylvania .
uh -huh .
i get to see him maybe once every three months .
we 've lost ,
i 'd like to have an everyday contact with children , as well as you do , for that matter ,
 young   , my youngest daughter lives in new jersey ,
  you don 't get to see any of  yours very often . 
  i don 't hardly  get to see any of them .
she works in these , trump type casinos ,
she and her husband  both do .
 yes ,
uh -huh . 
uh -huh .
they 're really both , people who play on stage they 're running lights right now and audio and  that thing   for , 
 uh -huh . 
plays and things that go on .
anyhow
what activities do you do with your children when you are together ?
most the  time , 
right now it 's football season ,
our daughter is a big cowboy fan ,
as is our husband ,
my husband ,
she watches that
i play with the grandchildren
 i enjoy the  grandchildren .
like last weekend , there 's the soviet space exhibit is here in dallas ,
it ends ,
 oh . 
  in january ,
she and the three boys and my husband and i went over into fort worth to see the space exhibit
this  sunday , 
 the soviet  space  exhibit ? 
 uh -huh . 
 my goodness . 
 yeah
 ]
i am surprised they would bring anything over here .
it 's been here for quite , some time .
i think it came here in either september or october 
None
 uh -huh . 
it 's  very interesting , 
 i 'll bet . 
it 's been very well done
next sunday they 're coming over after the cowboy game
None
 uh -huh . 
we 're going to go take the boys to see christmas lights and go to a santa 's village .
when our son 's over , we have a pool ,
he and his wife come and a lot of their friends ,
we have cookouts on sunday  
  that sounds like you have  really ,  wonderful activities that keep you together .
  we do a lot with our kids ,
yeah .
we always have .
we 've taken a lot of trips with our kids when they were younger .
we 're very family oriented .
None
 that 's wonderful .   ]
 we like  being with our kids ,
the kids seem to enjoy being with us ,
their friends enjoy being with us .
uh -huh .  ]
that keeps us very , very young , with all these young people passing in and out and  eating , 
 uh -huh . 
 seems like i 've , 
 the only  problem is , it keeps you pretty busy , keeping everything going ,
doesn 't it ?
it does  
i 'm worried about christmas .
christmas eve they all pass through ,
they all end up spending the night christmas eve night , so  that , 
 uh -huh . 
beautiful .
we open our presents on christmas day they go out to the in -laws in between some of this ,
they 're  all , 
 uh -huh . 
with us ,
have christmas dinner with us and then go to other in -laws and things ,
we see a lot of them .
we enjoy christmas eve night , because they all start arriving by about eleven o 'clock ,
we open presents about five o 'clock  christmas , 
morning ,
None
 uh -huh . 
i go to the kitchen and cook ,
my sister and her husband are coming down ,
there 's going to be eleven of us  for christmas . 
 that 's great . 
there 's a ,
the question now to ask , is it difficult to find time ,
you seem to be making out all right .
yeah .
sometimes i 'm a little exhausted  
 tell me ,
 what do you think of the current trends of how other people spend time with their children  and so forth ? 
  i think the trends are going back to spending more time with families .
uh -huh .
i think parents are definitely , spending more and more time .
i don 't think they 're leaving them with baby -sitters ,
 yes . 
i think family quality time is becoming much more important than it was  there  for about , i don 't know , eight or nine years .
uh -huh .
seems like it went through a spell there where families weren 't that big a deal .
parents kind of went and did their thing ,
kids did their thing .
that 's
 no , 
   ]
that 's exactly what i was going to say .
yes ,
uh -huh .
of course , i find now that i spend more time with my grandchildren in detail .
i know more about them and watch their growth and how they improve and learn much more so than my own kids .
when your own children are growing up , you just take them for granted
you go ahead and do your thing
None
okay .
do you have any children ?
yes ,
i have a daughter .
uh -huh .
i don 't any children
i 'm going to have difficulty with this topic .
okay .
what kinds of things do you and your family do ?
we go out and fly kites
we go fishing .
 ]
we go to movies
we go out to the farm .
uh -huh .  ]
she likes to pick flowers and look at birds .
then your kind family is probably pretty rare now a days .
i don 't see a lot of families fishing and doing things like that .
that 's great .
i 'm divorced ,
when she 's with me that 's what we do .
yeah .
we color a lot
i read her stories .
uh -huh .
that 's great .
yeah .
i think a lot of families now , they probably don 't spend enough time together .
yeah .
whether their parents are together or divorced they don 't spend enough time together
i think that contributes to a lot of why society is going downhill right now is because the basic family unit is being destroyed .
just simply because that time isn 't spent just doing things like fishing
i think that when you spend a lot of time with each other you communicate a lot .
the communication helps just build your family .
uh -huh
even when i was , living with her with did stuff then too ,
uh -huh .
 ]
yeah .
to me that 's pretty rare .
yeah ,
i know .
i like that .
whenever i do have children i 'm going to try as hard as i can to see that we spend a lot of time together ,
maybe just even , if we just rent a movie and watch it together just to make sure that everybody 's not going out and doing and their her own thing all the time .
uh -huh .
that 's good sometimes because you need to , get away .
i don 't think you should spend too much time outside at the detriment of losing the family unit .
yeah ,
that 's right .
then you never get to know them either .
uh -huh .
they 're all grown up
their ,
yeah .
yeah .
as i understand it ,
i don 't know ,
i haven 't experienced it ,
 ]
yeah .
kids these days are growing up so much faster .  ]
uh -huh .
once they hit ten or eleven or twelve , you 've pretty much lost them
yeah ,
they 're out doing stuff by that time .
yeah .
do you think that your family is pretty rare in that you do a lot of things or just the relationship between you and your daughter ?
yeah ,
i really do because i don 't see many others  
whenever we go to the park or something sometimes on the weekdays , we 'll see other families .
uh -huh .
not usually on the weekends we don 't see very many in comparison .
what do you think is the key to just bringing the american family back together ?
what kinds of things do you think can ?
i think they can turn off the t v for one thing .
yeah ,
that 's true .
and go out and do stuff ,
 ]
she always likes to do things whenever the t v off .
she 'll forget about the t v completely .
i think that 's the first thing a lot of people do
i know i 'm guilty of it .
i came in from work today
first thing i did was turn the tv on .
uh -huh .
because i taped the stories from earlier today .
right .
i like to watch  'em
i think that 's that is a big problem . the television
it 's too static ,
it 's something that you can do
there 's no thinking involved , no motion ,
i think that 's another reason why people are , so health conscious now is because america 's becoming really a couch potato society .
uh -huh .
people aren 't doing anything just sitting around , no thinking involved
i think people are trying to get out of that .
at least
there 's a lot of
it 's becoming really health conscious
that people are starting to look out for cholesterol and things like that trying to get out and workout more often and jog and walk and different things like that .
that 's probably good ,
if you get your family involved in exercising and maybe playing tennis or something like that , that also helps .
that 's also something , family oriented that everyone can do .
yeah .
None
yeah .
when she was here last summer we played tennis
she hasn 't brought her tennis racquet over lately .
uh -huh .
when ,
how old is she ?
she 's five .
she has ,
we just been hitting the ball on the ground .
yeah ,
yeah .
she can 't hit it in the air yet ,
then we kick the ball .
we play like soccer .
you 've still have a lot of time before she gets up in years
uh -huh .
that 's good .
that 's good .
yeah .
okay .
it was very nice talking to you .
nice talking to you .
okay .
 okay .
bye -bye . 
 bye -bye . 
you like to fish ,
yeah ,
i like to ,
i don 't have a boat ,
i like to fish
there 's a lot of lakes around here .
are there many lakes up there ?
yeah ,
actually there are quite a bit of lakes around me .
we have the great lakes ,
grea -,
lake ontario is right near here .
uh -huh .
we 're in what 's called the finger lake region of new york
where there 're lots of small lakes everywhere
these are , real good , for , bass fishing and so forth .
they have mostly small mouth in them
None
no ,
we have actually quite a lot of variety .
there 's ,
we have large mouth , small mouth , sort of musky , pike , stuff like that .
uh -huh .
all sorts of fun stuff like that .
we have a pretty large bass masters tournament actually takes place right on lake ontario every year .
yeah ,
that 's right ,
uh -huh .
that 's , a lot of fun .
uh -huh .
how about you ?
what do you like to go for ?
it 's ,
i fish for bass ,
i hardly ever catch one ,
yeah .
they have a tail race over in lake lavon when they open up the dam and let out water , they wash down the fish
you catch that white bass and crappie out of there .
None
every once in a while there 'll be striped bass .
uh -huh .
we have , some friends who live on the lake the lake it just seems , is completely filled with bass to the point where , normally you
in this particular lake , we went out with some friends , once
every time you tossed the line in , you pull up a five , six , seven inch minimum bass
usually you pull up , thirteen to fourteen inch bass .
wow .
yeah ,
it 's a real enjoyable experience to go fishing there because we pull up , bass after bass
 ]
uh -huh .
during perch season as well , you pull up a lot of ,  ]
probably during perch season the perch will run in very large schools ,
what they 'll do is j -,
you 'll be sort of boating around ,
these people own a little row boat ,
they 'll be boating around
uh -huh .
they 'll hit a school of perches in the middle when they do , you can just drop the lines in and just pull them in one at ,
they just drop it in .
they can 't pull it in fast enough .
what do you catch perch on ?
they ,
according to them , when the perch are running , you can catch them on just about anything .
huh .
they tend to use , i guess worms or some kind of lures sometimes ,
i 've ,
she told me that they will sometimes use corn or anything ,
uh -huh .
they 'll ,
corn or salami or bread or anything ,
they 'll hit because they 're just sort of surrounded , these large schools .
yeah ,
it 's ,
sometimes i use corn ,
some fish steal it off the hook sometimes .
yeah ,
it 's a big problem .
yeah ,
the other day i was fishing with bread ,
yeah .
there 's a college across the street they ,
it 's full of carp i caught a carp on a , about , what size is that , i think it was a number two treble hook ,
None
  it 's huge ,
its mouth was full of hooks .
wow .
he was in a bad way .
it 's ,
he was fast .
he ,
a big one ?
yeah .
it 's , it was sixteen inches long .
that 's a nice size carp .
yeah ,
i think it was about a pound and a half ,
all they 're good for is the fight .
boy they really don 't want to come out of the water
they zip through the water ,
uh -huh .
how your line goes , i thought , that , i wasn 't going to be able to get it in , because , the one i hooked just about ten minutes before , when i tried to raise it out of the water , it fell off ,
it wasn 't hooked very well .
i got it that far ,
i figured that ,
 that counts . 
 yeah ,
that 's what i  said .
that 's what i told the guy .
the guy was standing there
he laughed when it fell off
i said , that 's a quick release , right there .
do you actually like the taste of f -,
do you , eat the fish that you catch
are you more of a sport fisherman ?
catfish , yeah .
i haven 't eaten anything else ,
there 's some ,
my dad has a farm
there 's ,
he has two ponds up there
my uncle has a pond upstream
there 's a lot of crappie in there now .
i think he 's the only one that 's , that 's caught a big enough crappie to eat .
the catfish , there 's hundreds of them from like two to six pounds and ,  that ,
yeah . 
 right ,
 you can just ,
i don 't actually like fish .
it 's sort of ,
when i fish , it 's more for sport than anything else .
yeah ,
if ,
right .
when you have to look in their eyes and , hit them in the head or whatever , that 's what you do with a catfish because you have to sever their spinal cord .
be careful you don 't get stung .
yeah ,
yeah .
yeah ,
i know it .
have you ever tried , deep sea fishing ?
not yet .
my brother went off the coast of maine ,
when the ,
i don 't know ,
what they ,
yeah .
mackerel that school up there ?  ]
it 's
he said that it was just like that .
they were throwing hell benders or , some other kind of treble hook lure
each time they bring them in they 'd have at least one ,
sometimes they 've had one on every hook .
yeah ,
i was out in florida with a friend a while ago
we would go and just , drop two or three hooked rig as well down off a boat .
we just dropped it down there
uh -huh .
the captain had , some kind of sonar in the boat he 'd maneuver us into a school of fish
you just drop it in it just ,
you get one or two at a shot ,
None
yeah .
it 's a good deal , too .
it was a , like twenty dollars for six hours of fishing on some big charter boat .
wow .
they 'll clean your fish on a tip basis for you if you want .
yeah ,
down here it 's like two hundred dollars a day .
this is ,
yeah ,
this was for a , large ,
a group party .
there were maybe thirty of us on the boat .
we weren 't all related , just , thirty people off the shop in the boat there .
yeah .
if you want to go on a boat alone , it 's like two hundred dollars a day .
yeah .
this is great , because i think it was nineteen dollars for five hours and twenty dollars for six hours or something .
uh -huh .
None
you 'd get to go out there for six hours and get a nice suntan and bring along some lunch and fish all day .
it 's really nice
it 's real enjoyable .
yeah .
i don 't know if it 's been five minutes yet or not .
i think we 're probably close , though .
yeah .
it 's nice talking to you .
nice talking to you , too .
good luck with fishing this season .
good luck .
bye -bye .
bye -bye .
like in a room filled with what do you think about the benefits in jobs ?
i 'm relatively satisfied with the benefits i have .
i think that , our health insurance is terribly expensive .
uh -huh .
i 'd rather that we got a bit more coverage for a lot less money .
that 's my major complaints , i guess .
what about you ?
yeah ,
a lot of times they turn down your claims
that leaves you paying for all of it .
uh -huh .
maybe that it 's not understood what should be covered and what isn 't .
uh -huh .
yeah .
 right
 yeah ,
 ]
the  health insurance i have is met life ,
if ,
it 's the type that if you go to a certain doctor then , you just pay ten dollars
the insurance pays the rest of the bill .
if you go outside you get , seventy thirty .
i see .  ]
now we ,
i have just the regular insurance so that any doctor is covered
what i found recently is what they 've been doing is they poll somehow the area ,
they have what they consider a justifiable price for the area where your doctor is located based on zip code .
uh -huh .
recently , when we had a claim , they didn 't pay the eighty -five percent they paid much lower
when i called they said , oh well , that 's because your doctor is charging much more than the norm for the area .
i was really surprised because either there aren 't that many of that type of doctor within that zip code , so that , two doctors could balance each other out , or their statistics aren 't very accurate .  ]
right .
they 're probably doing it to their benefit , anyway .
None
yeah ,
i would assume that whatever doctors are willing to do the paperwork and send it in .
uh -huh .
it 's difficult .
what about other benefits ?
are there others that you 're dissatisfied with ?
i work for sears ,
that 's about the only real benefit you have , is health insurance .
you have vacation ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
everybody gets vacation .
t i and some other places , they have recreational facilities ,
they have a driving range and weight room
huh .
i think they even have a swimming pool i don 't know if they have any tennis courts or anything like that .
yeah ,
i 'm not familiar with that sort of thing ,
to me vacation is an issue ,
different places have different amounts of vacation , i would assume .
right .
the leniency with which they let you take leave without pay , perhaps or , um , i suppose , sick days .
some places count the number of hours
some places just sort of believe you .
uh -huh .
ours is based on number of days ,
people try to build them up in case they really do get seriously ill .
right .
right .
otherwise , i 'm not aware of any problems with the benefits around here
maybe that covers the topic then .
yeah .
i don 't know , the working conditions , if you could include that in benefits .
some places aren 't very safe to work .
uh -huh .
some places don 't compensate you for the hazards that you have to work under .
uh -huh .
maybe not really a benefit , either , would be the allowing you to use the telephone for personal calls .
right ,
uh -huh .
i suppose some places are more stringent about that than others .
yeah ,
i think so .
maybe arriving late or something like that ,
how they enforce the rules .
uh -huh
other than that i don 't have much feeling for the benefits ,
since , like i said , i don 't have a big problem with them .
uh -huh .
workmen 's comp is a big thing now in texas because , how much it costs the employers a lot of them are going to their own insurance now .
it reduces some of the length of the benefits , i don 't know besides that .
i noticed right off that was a year less than what the state was allowing .
i didn 't know that somebody could avoid workmen 's compensation .
they still have to pay it
they buy their own instead of going through the state .
i see .
apparently it costs less that way .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i suppose that whenever companies can avoid , benefits , it 's to the benefit of the company at least , financially in the short run ,
i would think they would get a much greater turnover
that people would be dissatisfied
working for them .  ]
yeah .
that 's what i think
they should be able to judge their benefits on how happy their employees are
how much profit they 're making
instead of trying to cut everything down  ]
have everybody be unhappy and have a constant turnover of people .
right .  ]
sure , the payroll is lower that way ,
i would assume that the productivity is way down , also .
yeah ,
the productivity and the training costs ,
if they have to train a new employee every six months , then i don 't see how they can save money .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
once they once they get somebody good , they ought to hang onto them .
that 's right .
no ,
i agree .
okay ,
it was nice talking to you .
thank you for calling .
bye -bye .
yeah .
bye -bye
like a room filled with people >>.
bye -bye .
all right .
she lives in utah ,
None
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
that 's the way we always were .
we always lived away from our family and relatives while the kids were growing up .
yeah .
i guess we 're going to talk about children today .
okay ,
let 's do i -,
you ready ?
my children are all gone already .
uh -huh .
they 're all out on their own .
do you want to start first
okay .
do you work ?
no ,
i don 't ,
uh -huh .
i stay home most of the time
i know that it 's very difficult to find good help sometimes when you want your children to be taken care of .
right .
there 's a ,
my neighbor she tends children though
there 's a big controversy whether they should have to , have a law to have them certified or not .
uh -huh .
right .
there 's pros and cons on both side of that if they were , then you kind of know that they had to go through some kind of testing ,
uh -huh .
or some kind of something to  , get an okay seal .
yeah ,
most of the problems we hear ,
of course , maybe that 's what we hear about is from organized and approved day care centers .
that 's right .
that 's right .
maybe we don 't hear about the other ones though that could be .
yeah .
the individual incidence or something .
uh -huh .
usually when i have someone tend ,
my oldest tends for me now if i go somewhere
None
uh -huh ,
how old ,
before ,
is your oldest ?
he 's almost a teenager
he 's plenty big enough then
yeah ,
he 's very good .
before that i would use , kids from our church ,
uh -huh .
they did a good job ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
for me .
i 've never had to leave them in a day care center ,
uh -huh .
or anything ,
i 've been very lucky just be able to stay home .
that 's the way with me .
i worked four years one time ,
my last two children were , both entering high school age .
uh -huh .
they were , of course , gone while i was working
it wasn 't a problem i saw ,
i stayed home the rest of the time .
yeah .
i didn 't have that problem either .
i ,
my oldest daughter she has two children
they 've been in day care ,
uh -huh .
she works full time .
yeah ,
that 's hard .
it 's difficult
yet she 's the type of person that , i don 't know , if she 'd be happy staying at home .
some people aren 't .
uh -huh .
yeah .
she surprised me though .
she 's done a lot of things that i never thought she would do , with the family because she was the one that said she was never getting married and never going to have any children .
is that right ?
she spends a lot of quality time i think when she is with the children .
i think that 's really important .
they 've used the day care most of the time .
they tried one once .
they had a lady come in .
uh -huh .
she also had a small child she brought with her .
it did not work out . at all
uh -huh .
she thought it was going to .
she was real excited because it was so much easier than taking the children out ,
yeah ,
uh -huh .
in the morning ,
the lady called
her baby wasn 't very old at the time and said she was having trouble .
this baby is the real pleasant baby easy to satisfy usually .
she was having problems with her ,
she called and said things were okay , settled down and was all right .
yeah ,
yeah .
my daughter decided to call them and check
things weren 't okay
oh .
her one son was watching the soapies
which she doesn 't allow them to watch the soapies .
uh -huh .
the baby was in his crib with the door shut just screaming his heart out ,
dear .
the baby -sitter was in the kitchen with her baby .
oh .
that ended that ,
yeah .
episode ,
she was most upset , over finding this .
yeah ,
i bet .
they kind of had decided that the day care was better .
there 's ,
uh -huh .
more people involved ,
more than one adult they ,
the age groups are separated faint >>.
 ]
nannies have been an option ,
i know that at day care they have more of a routine like maybe in ,
uh -huh .
preschool would have where they have lessons and ,
yes ,
so forth ,
story time ,
and so on .
uh -huh .
this one has been particularly nice .
it kept track of what they did ,
uh -huh .
they would tell the parents what they did that day .
if they said anything or did anything .
it kind of kept them ,
gave you an idea of what your child ,
yeah .
was progressing in or doing .
i always thought that if you were checking into a day care , that you would be good to get references ,
 yeah . 
 on  people that had been in that day care but was no longer there .
yeah .
yeah .
they wouldn 't have nothing to worry about saying ,
if there was a problem they would i think be more ready to tell you what it was .
i think so , because if they were still there , they might not ,
they may not say anything .
right ,
right .
how do you judge other than from what others have , what you see , the cleanliness and that type of thing .
you can 't really .
you can 't really unless your child would be old enough to say something ,
uh -huh .
usually they aren 't at that age .
uh -huh .
 ]
uh -huh .
  it would be real difficult to find one and decide .
i know about three years ago i tended some children .
uh -huh .
i wondered if i would have to be certified
whether they 'd just bring them
uh -huh .
we got to where , we were just friends
None
uh -huh .
they said , no , don 't do that , we 'll just bring them .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
if there was a problem
we 'd sit down ,
uh -huh .
and talk about it
it never happened ,
yeah .
to be a problem ,
yeah .
things worked out okay ,
their kids played with my kids
it worked out well .
it worked out good .
i 've decided i 'm going to baby -sit my two granddaughters .
oh .
 since they 'll  be going back at the end of the month .
None
that 's great .
i 'm going to give it a try .
i sell avon and stanley products ,
uh -huh .
i 've got that worked out .
my husband , he 's retired
he 's going to deliver my products
i 'll do my orders and that by phone .
that will be great .
None
yeah .
i 'll be able to keep that up a little bit .
yeah .
i think i 'll enjoy  doing   ,
i bet you 'll have some great experiences with them .
yeah ,
i think i 'll enjoy .
yeah .
i guess i kind of miss having a baby around
a kid around or something
sure ,
why not .
yeah .
the grandparents , i always hear it 's always fun when you can send them home at the end of the day instead of having to ,  ]
right .
that 's right
 ]
they do say you enjoy them more ,
that 's right .
somebody said if they knew grandchildren where so much fun , they would have had them first
my husband 's mother lives right over here ,
she takes care of them sometimes ,
uh -huh .
for me ,
just is a lovely lady ,
uh -huh .
i 've always appreciated when she 's sat with them .
yeah .
my daughter ,
None
oh
uh -huh .
always said she would not let me baby -sit because you do hear grandparents complaining because they 're stuck with their grandchildren so much .
uh -huh .
the ones that complain a lot are the first
i know they have a waiting list and a quota on immigration now .
i 've lost track .
i don 't really know .
i do have some opinions ,
go ahead .
yeah ,
i know that they 're real cautious about letting middle eastern people into the country now because of all the terrorism .
None
 okay   ,
i hadn 't thought about that ,
 what all do you know about it ?
i just have an opinion ,
i thought the terrorism thing was overstated ,
there was nothing over here .
in fact even ,
this is not our subject , i guess ,
maybe it is or isn 't , i suppose .
yeah .
my wife when she talked about the middle east
everyone 's afraid , of how the war was going to go and everything ,
i told her , no ,
it 's just not going to happen .
there 's not going to be any terrorism over him ,
there wasn 't ,
they just didn 't have an organization ,
i 'm concerned that we don 't have enough controls .
i think that , the asian gangsters that we 've let in here
uh -huh .
the guys from , cuba , there 's a lot of criminals down in florida that we 've let in from cuba that fidel pushed off on us ,
the last ,
out of all the asians we brought in , there 's a tremendous criminal element that we let in from asia
 that 's right . 
i think that  there 's got  to be some sort of controls over that .
this asia mafia thing is getting out of hand .
uh -huh .
i don 't even know what our controls are .
i don 't even know what , if we have any guidelines at all , on immigration .
i always thought that we did ,
i don 't know what they are right now .
i don 't think there 's much of one , because i 'm sure all the people from cuba have been released from that camp that they were in .
yeah .
 yeah . 
yeah .
the ,  ]
it 's just like australia , most of them were criminals from cuba   i think that was just an attempt that fidel castro to undermine , the united states to some extent .
he just released and got rid of all his criminals and sent them to us .
yeah .  ]
 because we , 
it 's almost the same thing from asia , because   a lot of them was put out of business in vietnam after the war ,
None
i do have some sympathy with ,
of course we have this big mexican problem ,
not a problem ,
uh -huh .
i think that we need to do something with , the immigration of back and forth across mexico , i 'm sympathetic ,
i don 't know what the answer is ,
i 'm sympathetic certainly with that , that they want to come over here
i guess hundreds of thousands come over every year to work .
if they have jobs , i hear the story that they 're taking away american jobs .
i don 't know ,
i don 't know how many american jobs they are really taking away .
right .
i 'm sympathetic ,
i don 't have an answer .
uh -huh .
i think that we should have good relations with mexico ,
that 's not really exactly immigration .
it is
it isn 't .
i don 't know to what degree we owe the people who come across before they 're citizens ,
owe the children education and all that ,
although , the idea of education is an answer to a lot of problems in the world .
uh -huh .
i guess it 's what they ,
the mexican kids get a good education along the way ,
maybe that 's a benefit to everybody ,
yeah ,
uh -huh .
a lot of the mexican people just cross the border during the daytime to come over here and work they have green cards .
like you said , a lot of ,
i run into people every day that can 't speak english .
yeah .
most of them , are working in janitorial positions
None
yeah .
 that , 
 i don 't know ,
like you said , i don 't know how much they 're taking from the work force ,
yeah ,
i never thought that they were much .
i do cringe when i hear some of the problems we 've had .
uh -huh .
of course you mentioned the language .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i feel so bad that we , here in texas , or certainly the southern part of the united states , california , texas , and all that , why our kids don 't speak fluid spanish , by junior high , as well as us , so that we wouldn 't have the language barrier certainly .
that is a shame that we have this tremendous border of mexico ,
in europe , they speak their french and all
they go out of their way to try to speak their neighbor 's language so they can understand .
uh -huh .
we don 't really even make an effort to speak spanish ,
i feel bad about that
go ahead .
that 's ,
i
yeah
i took spanish in school ,
 yeah . 
that 's , one reason that i did it  is  because whenever you travel anywhere near the border , there more and more people speak spanish .
yeah ,
i guess it 's never too late .
i do have some spanish books ,
i 've always ,
every year i say i 'm going to try to speak some newcomers language ,
i don 't know if it 's costing us any money
how much money they 're putting into it ,
that 's always a factor ,
my wife says , how much the federal government is putting into it immigration .
yeah ,
it 's basically on the ,
i think it 's mostly concentrated toward the borders ,
it 's more ,
the immigration is tied in with , drug trafficking .
they have to watch out who comes in ,
yeah .
they 're always finding drugs on the most , calls out in innocent looking kind of i forgot what they found ,
yeah .
a dog found it the other day , on the border .
yeah ,
i think that certainly is a problem .
i guess our immigration history , that 's a great subject .
they , didn 't say to talk about that ,
that is ,
on ellis island , they ,
you know they 're redoing that and going to make it a national museum .
uh -huh .
that certainly was interesting ,
since all of us had , ancestors that came over that way .
not all ,
i guess if you go back far enough you came over on a boat originally ,
a lot of us have grandparents ,
my grandparents came over in about eighteen ninety or something like that .
i 'm sure they came over , through ellis island ,
that 's right .
 ]
we all immigrants , one way or another ,
we certainly are , coming from europe .
yeah ,
one of the things that really gets to me , about the mexicans is that , once they have children over here , their children are american citizens then .
yeah ,
those were laws are unusual .
yeah ,
then they 'll ship the parents back
that leaves the children without any parents .
yeah ,
i don 't understand , whose rule is that ,  ]
they just follow the rule no matter ,
that doesn 't seem fair to the children .
yeah ,  ]
sometimes common sense should take over rather than ,
yeah ,
right .
that 's a law doesn 't sound like it makes any sense at all that you would do it that way .
uh -huh .
you would think they could at least get a visa or something until they , get citizenship .
i 'm sure they want to .
yeah ,
yeah .
they granted them amnesty if they could prove they 'd been here five years .
i heard something about that , yeah .
a lot of them had been ,
yeah .
some of them moved back and forth ,
 yeah . 
  most of them don 't ever want to go back to mexico ,
 no . 
especially  the way it was then . 
no ,
you could see why .
uh -huh .
i don 't know how much immigration we have from europe and everything .
what the controls are .
yeah .
i think most , like especially the celebrities and everything , they have to get a green card if they going to do any kind of work , in movies and such .
most of them have temporary visas .
yeah .
i guess you can get work visas pretty easily ,
as long , it 's like
it 's a kind of a bad example ,
yeah .
when rafael septien took the job with the cowboys they had to offer his job to any other applicant that could do it .
really ?
yeah .
so that ,
that 's the thing with the jobs .
yeah .
of course no one beat him out .
yeah .
he just ruined his own career ,
None
yeah .
yeah
yeah ,
it 's still interesting after all this time that we 're probably one of the few countries that people are still desperately trying to immigrate to .
although i guess europe , now that the communism is falling apart , that maybe there 'll won 't be that much of a rush to get out of all the communist countries ,
i guess poland now is noncommunist
uh -huh .
maybe not ,
maybe immigration from europe to here will slowly , change ,
maybe it 'll even out like trade ,
so many people will immigrate here at the year two thousand ,
so many of the people will go back overseas .
maybe it will average out ,
i don 't know .
yeah ,
i think  so . 
 it  doesn 't seem so far .
there are other job opportunities ,
uh -huh .
in europe that there aren 't here even ,
like orchestra players can find a job sometimes line in europe when they can 't find one here .
uh -huh .
i 'm a trumpet player .
are you a teacher ?
no ,
i don 't any more .
i just went to school
i was a music major for a while .
really ,
yeah .
i had a trumpet teacher that played in the mexico city symphony .
 yeah . 
 he had to have a work visa there .
oh .
 uh -huh . 
of course they had a lot of musicians from other countries   in the mexico city symphony .
uh -huh .
i think , three out of the four other people in the trumpet section are from mexico now .
really .
i think i don 't know , one of the conductors is from another country .
uh -huh .
it 's like any other symphony .
yeah
eduardo mana 's from mexico
he had to ,
i haven 't really lived in a lot of big cities .
i 'm living in dallas now .
plano is outside of dallas ,
i don 't really have a lot of experience with air pollution .
huh -uh .
i know when i lived down in houston , on the outskirts of houston , there were some towns like pasadena that had oil refineries ,
huh -uh .
if you would drive by there , on your way to the beach or something ,
huh -uh .
there would just be  dumping  this huge amounts of smoke ,
huh -uh .
into the air
it always smelled really bad .
we know that , that was really , really , really bad for the atmosphere .
what have you got up there ?
i live out in the country ,
huh -uh .
that part is good .
we 're maybe one hundred miles from pittsburgh ,
which has a lot of pollution from their plants ,
huh -uh .
right now in our area were fighting against a toxic waste incinerator .  ]
no .
it won 't be too for from where we live .  ]
everybody really has been , fighting against it , because we do not want it .
we don 't want one any place
sure .
we would like the , industry to do more to take care of the waste products before they turn to incineration , because we feel that , the small percentage that they 're going to be putting into the air is too much .
 ]
yeah .
it 's just so bad that there is just so much going into the air
huh -uh .
the little bit you say that there putting in here and there , and everywhere , it all adds up .  ]
huh -uh .
all the problems in the middle east .
with all that smoke and ,
that has to be terrible over there .
yeah .
it 's just , why are we doing this to ourselves
huh -uh .
i just don 't know ,
what really amazes me about , that pasadena area and the oil refineries ,
huh -uh .
is that there would be houses and people living just really close to it .
yeah .
between the freeway and the oil refinery , you would see a neighborhood .
huh -uh .
you just thought , it 's obvious that there 's a lot going up in the air there ,
what comes up , must come down
yeah .
yeah .
we 're breathing it all the time .
yes .
how , if they have all of those ,
toxicity , there 's signs around saying how dangerous it is
here you are living
huh -uh
that just doesn 't make too much sense .
no .
i figure we 're paying to take care of this toxic waste , no matter who does it .
 ]
huh -uh .
they have shown , some of the industries have been real good at , doing their part in , reducing the amount that they have ,  ]
huh -uh .
they 've reused some of it ,
it can be recycled , a lot of their things ,
huh -uh .
that they 've shown , that to begin with , apparently it does cost more ,
huh -uh .
once they get started , it saves them money in the end ,
it cuts down on the end product that has to be dealt with some other way .
huh -uh .
if they would all ,
that 's what we want done .
we want industry to take , more responsibility in taking care of it .
individual companies and things are so selfish ,
huh -uh .
their desires to save a few dollars and that
they don 't care about the environmental impact ,
huh -uh .
that they make .
they 're greedy .
it 's money , is what is .
it 's the money
yes .
they 're making fantastic amounts on these things
even the incinerator , the money and the income that they 're going to make off this , is , just astronomical .
huh -uh .
have you ever visited , los angeles or any place it 's kind of known , that it has , pollution in it 's air ?
we 've never been ,
we went as far as , las vegas ,
huh -uh .
and yellow stone park ,
huh -uh .
we should have gone the whole way over ,
we didn 't .
i understand that ,
we have an aunt that lives out there
None
huh -uh .
when she was visiting here , she would look up at the stars
she said how wonderful it was to be able to look into the sky and see some of the things that she saw .
huh -uh .
she said they couldn 't see those things out there ,
huh -uh .
because of the smog and everything .
that 's so awful .
what about in new york .
i guess you 've gone that way , maybe .
no .
never been in new york
i don 't want to go there
pretty funny .
have you been there ?
i 've been to new york .
i have relatives that direction .
oh .
we have ,
it 's ,
 where you are   ]
is it close to phoenixville , pennsylvania ?
no ,
i never heard of that one .
i have family there
None
we 're near pittsburgh , clarion university .
huh -uh .
it 's pretty neat .
it 's kind of northwest part of pennsylvania .
that 's beautiful country up that way .
i know ,
it 's , very lush and pretty ,
huh -uh .  ]
back in the east .
it 's really ,
you sound very young .  ]
are you a young person ?
i 'm thirty -one .
thirty -one .
you 're young
seems kind of old to me .
no ,
you 're young .
you have a lot of life yet ,
these ,
we have some people who say , this isn 't going to affect me , this air pollution ,
huh -uh .
older people ,
they think they 're far enough away from something ,
huh -uh .
that it 's ,
they don 't realize these things are going to affect everybody .
if you 're older it 's not going to affect you that way .
you have grandchildren ,
you have children ,
yes .
nieces , nephews , whatever , friends .
everybody is going to be affected by it .
that 's really true .
we all , need to be willing to help pay a little bit .
i 've heard some people , grumble about their , cars passing their emission tests ,
huh -uh .
and things ,
how it 's more expensive and things .
huh -uh .
i thought , it 's so much better .
they say it has really made a difference , though .
huh -uh .
we don 't have that here , yet .
you don 't .
no ,
we don 't have that testing in that down here , yet .
huh -uh .
they ,
i have read that it has really helped where where the population is greater ,
huh -uh .
that it has made a difference .
i really think it must .
i think every ,
think about how many automobiles there are .
huh -uh .
huh -uh .
each is putting out ,
we have a car ,
one of our cars is an older car ,
huh -uh .
every time you start it , from the tail pipe , it makes a black spot ,
huh -uh .
on the cement ,
huh -uh .
you know that is a sign .
something is coming out ,
 yeah . 
 yeah .
 all cars are doing that .
yeah .
it 's really polluting the air .
yeah .
if you have to put a price on it . which is more valuable , life or paying a little more .
huh -uh .
it 's causing of lot of the real terrible suffering like cancer ,
 huh -uh . 
 and things , 
huh -uh .
we sure wouldn 't want ,
huh -uh .
so much more people suffering from that .
yeah .
like i said , i think you have to pay for it no matter what you do you with it , because it 's industry .
we 're paying industry to make the products
None
huh -uh .
we 're helping pay for there making these end products that are ,
huh -uh .
toxic waste .
then , we have to pay for them to pay somebody to carry it away someplace ,
then they put it in the dump some place
they find out , this dump doesn 't work
we have to clean this up and move it someplace else .
we end up paying for it again .
now we 're going to end up paying for it again by having it burned in these large incinerators .
huh -uh .
we 're paying to have our air polluted and our water streams polluted .
pretty sad .
the ,
the one area they want to put the incinerator is right in the middle of the two water  sheds  that feed clarion river .
no .
it just boggles our mind that they can consider even putting it there , because ,
huh -uh .
if that water gets contaminated , it will go on down to pittsburgh .
it will ,
it affects so many people .
huh -uh .
it 's just hard to think that they could allow them to do things like this .
no .
no .
it 's scary
huh -uh .
it 's scary .
it really is .
huh -uh .
it 's really awful .
i 've really enjoyed the conversation .
it 's helped me to think more about some issues that i need to be thinking more about
it is really a concern .
huh -uh .
 ]
instead of waiting until it directly affects me , like you say ,
huh -uh .
it 's important to be involved ahead of time .
you have a good day .
you , too .
thank you .
huh -uh .
 bye -bye . 
 bye . 
okay . do you have young children ?  ]
uh -huh ,
i have got two .
one is , two
the other one 's four
this is my first year of staying home .
i 've always had them in child care .
then you are familiar with it ?
uh -huh .
okay ,
i have grandchildren
i know , two of them have gone to preschool .
uh -huh .
i know what the experience my daughter has faced with that .
why don 't you tell me what you have found .
the ,
with our second sitter , the first one didn 't quite work out , there were some things going on that i wasn 't really happy with
i felt that i need to move on with them
i found another baby -sitter
she was wonderful
except i thought that there were too many in the home
it just seemed like it was so hard to find , really good child care .
she was wonderful ,
it 's just that i felt that there were too many in the home .
okay ,
 ]
it was in home child care .
okay ,
it was in home child care .
you took them to someone 's home ?
uh -huh .
both times ?
uh -huh ,
right .
uh -huh .
i worked in the child care centers
i wasn 't really happy with the particular one that i was working in
i just always had a fear about , child care centers .
that 's why i put them in home day care .  ]
uh -huh .
uh -huh .  ]
i just decided that i was just missing a lot of their time whether they were so little
i couldn 't get off of work as often as i wanted to when they were ill
i just decided it was probably best just to stay home for a while until they were a little more , independent
i could go back to work .
i know that in raising my children , i was fortunate ,
i didn 't have to work ,
we didn 't necessarily have a lot of things
yeah
that 's how it 's going now .
i know my daughter ,
she has three
to have three in day care , even though one of them 's in school full time , one of them 's , in kindergarten .  ]
uh -huh .
that is a lot of money .  ]
it 's so expensive .
yeah .
you have to really make a lot of money .
yeah .
i 'm glad that she gets to stay home so that she can then participate with what 's going on in their life .
yeah .
bosses don 't always seem to understand getting off to go to christmas programs in the middle of the day or something .
no ,
yeah .
i know that one of the day cares it 's a well -known chain , she was not at all happy with .
there was too many children per person .
they were just kind of left to play ,
there was no structure to ,
the middle grandson went there as a preschool thing .
uh -huh .
she was wanting him actually to start getting a certain amount of learning and training and stuff .
not just there ,
i think he went , five mornings a week , if i remember correctly .
wow .
it was supposed to be a base ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
starting to learn the colors and learning to associate with children so that when he went to , school and stuff ,
she was most unhappy with it .
None
there was no structure ,
there was nothing to it .
she pulled him out of that one and put him in a , another one that was excellent .
it was like a little kindergarten .
uh -huh .
they had hot lunches
they had classes that , one class they 'd do art .
they even familiarized the children with computers .
oh .
uh -huh .
it was really a very excellent one .
how old was he ?
he 's now five and a half .
he 's in kindergarten .
oh .
this was last year .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
it helped him the first one , he went to a , church preschool that was very good .
uh -huh .
the methodist church in richardson .
oh .
the big one
it was a excellent ,
they ,
very good .
my little boy goes to the methodist , in garland .
does he ?
uh -huh .
i 'm real happy with that one .
yeah ,
the church ones seem to be very well run .
i 've heard that the methodist ones are excellent .
really ?
uh -huh .
even the mother 's day out programs , i heard , are real good .
yeah .
i just assumed that most churches , going by , experience there , that they were good .
uh -huh .
i didn 't know that ,
i 'm not that familiar .
uh -huh .
i just know that , first united methodist of richardson was just a great program .
yeah ,
uh -huh .
this is first united methodist in garland that he goes to
i 'm real happy with that .
yeah ,
it 's a pretty good size church , too , isn 't it ?
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
yeah .
None
that 's a ,
are you enjoying staying home ?
yes ,
i am
uh -huh .
i taught for richardson school district i taught early childhood
i really enjoyed it ,
it was taking a lot of my time
i noticed i was spending less and less time with them
uh -huh .
it just seemed like they were sick more often i just couldn 't get the time off to ,
None
yeah ,
it is .
isn 't it very hard to teach young children and then come home and deal with young children .
it really is .
and have enthusiasm .
yeah ,
it really is .
i felt ,
okay ,
could you tell me what you think contributes most to , air pollution ?
it 's hard to say .
while it 's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories , pollute a lot , if you look at how much pollution is say kicked up by an active volcano , it 's certainly less than clear that anything man can do in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all .
what do you think ?
you talked about , volcanos .
i 'm not sure how many active volcanos there are now , and what the amount of material that they do , put into the atmosphere .
i think probably the greatest cause is , vehicles ,
uh -huh .
especially around cities .
do you live right in the city itself ?
no ,
i 'm more out in the suburbs ,
i certainly work near a city .
okay ,
how about you ?
can you notice ,
it 's ,
i live in a rural area .
uh -huh .
it 's mainly farms and , no heavy industry .
attleboro , itself ,
i live in rhode island .
i see .
it 's in the north ,
i live up in the , northeast corner
attleboro sits in just over the line ,
uh -huh .
where t i 's plant is ,
there isn 't a lot of heavy industry .
there 's the freeways
we get an occasional ,
it depends which way the winds blowing from boston , cause we 're forty miles south of boston ,
we 'll pick up that .
i 've noticed over the past say , maybe five or six years ,
we live about twenty miles away from the state airport
i notice that the fly patterns now of the jets are getting bigger ,
they 're swinging wider so that now they are coming over our homes .
uh -huh .
it seems like , we 're catching all that residue .
i 'm not sure if it 's kerosene or what that 's dropping .
other than that , we don 't have the emissions .
yeah .
from the power plants .
you mean from the coal .
yeah ,
yeah ,
we generate ,
one of our biggest electrical plants in rhode island uses coal to ,
None
generate electricity .
there doesn 't seem to be much emission from them ,
i 'm not sure about the rest of the country .
yeah ,
i notice locally a major problem is kodak .
it 's interesting
in order to , keep with the e p a standards which tend to be visible , what 's coming out of your smokestack , they do all their emissions at night .
people get up ,
okay ,
is that right ?
yeah ,
people get up in the morning in that neighborhood
they 've got this black ash on their cars ,
which , seems to be ,
yeah ,
surprise , surprise .
yeah ,
i really think that if the e p a had anything on the ball they 'd go in there with a few phosphorous grenades , light up the sky , photograph the emissions at that point , and ,
yeah .
there must be , some of the , larger plants up around one hundred twenty -eight .
uh -huh .
we 've got reports that ,
during the night seems like they 'd blow off their stacks from ,
right .
the warehouses , for powerhouses ,
uh -huh .
they do that at night too , because ,
right .
employees been complaining that the cars have been pitted , and , spots all over them .
yeah ,
yeah .
you 're right ,
they could do something about that , i guess .
yeah .
that seems a little ridiculous .
how are your lakes ,
None
they 've been getting cleaner .
they have ?
sure .
yeah ,
i 'm not sure how much the water pollution is directly related to the air pollution , other than acid rain ,
yeah ,
acid rain ,
yeah ,
that 's what i was ,
the stuff i 've read recently in technology review basically indicates that acid rain may be a little bit , overstated . that a lot of the die off they 've seen in forests may not really be due to acid rain at all .
ye -,
i 'm not an expert .
yeah ,
no .
didn 't they just have an article , on ,
they were dumping lime .
None
upstate new york somewhere ,
i haven 't read that .
over huge areas ,
yeah .
they thought that was more beneficial because , some of it does soak in
some of it runs off right away in to the streams and rivers
some of the fish were supposedly making a comeback .
uh -huh .
i can 't remember where
i read that recently somewhere ,
i can 't remember where .
yeah ,
that 's interesti -,
i thought it was up there .
that 's interesting because new hampshire ,
uh -huh .
and parts of vermont , they showed pictures of extensive tree damage that they attributed to acid rain .
None
you kind of think it 's something else then ?
that 's what the environmentalists were claiming in this article .
that ,
they didn 't say what though ,
they just said they thought it was ,
they didn 't say what ,
they just said they thought acid rains contribution may be less than was previously suspected . that it may be other natural things at work .
natural disease ,
yeah ,
it 's less than clear .
like i said , i don 't remember the article that well .
yeah ,
yeah .
i don 't know ,
what do you think we can , i guess as individuals or as a group , do about , air pollution ?
we can demand , more efficient automobiles for one thing .
i still think that 's , one of our major causes of pollutants .
uh -huh .
how we go about that , it 's a little bit difficult .
yeah ,
i think it 's up to individuals too , to ask automakers for less pollutant vehicles .
yeah ,
yeah .
i think you need a vehicle something like , ralph nader , nader 's raiders , or , a a r p , which has a lot of members .
uh -huh .
if you can get those types of groups .
do you really think that new vehicles though is a big problem .
i remember reading an article that said it 's , the older polluters ,
the twelve and fifteen year old cars , contribute ninety percent ,
yeah ,
of the automobile pollution
the new cars is , hardly anything .
yeah ,
they 're better ,
how about all the trucks and buses that are out there .
when was the last time you saw a truck that didn 't belch , smoke , or ,
yeah ,
doesn 't that just mean they 're out of tune .
i 'm not really sure .
you think that the trucking industry is that , incompetent , that they wouldn 't ,
fuel is one of their biggest costs .
right .
you would ,
diesel engines .
yeah ,
diesel engines .
it ,
they do generate a lot of soot
at least , that kind of particulate comes out of the air pretty quickly .
yeah .
yeah .
we could also , push for legislation for , rapid transit systems .
this country seems to be a little behind on that .
yeah .
on the other hand most people don 't use rapid transit because it 's so inconvenient .
yeah ,
only because we got used to , single person , single car ,
uh -huh .
driving .
a lot of people don 't even like to carpool .
uh -huh .
we could that .
that 'll help ,
uh -huh .
air pollution ,
the , united states and canada is , going into , some types of agreements to limit , what 's being given out by power plants ,
uh -huh .
i guess canada 's quite concerned that we 're sending a lot of our stuff up there ,
yeah ,
sure .
that 's helping .
what do you think about a device , a meter right on a tail pipe
you pay the tax based on how much you polluted ?
that 's an idea .
don 't say that too loud though because , every city and town will have a meter on your tail pipe  generating revenue , 
 it just means if you don 't pollute , or you pollute very little  you don 't have to pay any tax
you just buy one of these things
it ,
maybe you could probably devise them so it slowly closed off your tail pipe
the less you pollute the longer the devise lasts
if you pollute a lot then it closed off your tail pipe
you couldn 't start your car anymore .
that 's an interesting concept .
is that your idea ?
yeah ,
it 's ,
i guess the difficulty would be that somebody could obviously just take it right off the tail pipe again
you probably would have to build it right into  the muffler or something . 
 i was going to say , 
right .
it could be installed like a catalytic converter .
right .
i guess you could take those off too
None
you could take ca -,
mufflers would be a little more obvious if you took that off .
yeah ,
if you can take a muffler off and only replace ,
not unless it was built into every muffler .
right .
that 's  
if you was talking about something which was more or less universal that , busses and any kind of vehicle ,
had to pay a pollution tax , this would penalize the heavy polluters and not penalize the light polluters ,
that 's quite a concept .
you should , pursue that i think , or patent it ,
yeah ,
patent it ,
that 's a good idea .
if you could come up with a device that 's the thing .
right .
it shouldn 't be too hard to do something like that .
that 's a thought .
no ,
uh -huh .
you 're right
that will solve , a lot of problems .
i don 't know if you approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on installing something like that .
uh -huh .
a proposal to , i guess the proper authorities ,
uh -huh .
yeah ,
the automobile regulatory agencies or something .
you might , generate some yeah ,
you might generate some interest in it .
that 's a good idea .
other than that i 'm not sure what individuals can do other than like i said get involved through a group or an organization .
uh -huh .
what are your music interests ?
just about any kind of music except acid rock
i don 't care ,
me , too .
for acid rock ,
oh .
i grew up with country and western ,
yeah ,
i did , too ,
None
None
just about any kind of music .
i even like classical music .
yeah ,
i 'm pretty diversified , too .
i don 't like acid rock either .
i grew up in a small town
we only had one radio station
it was country music ,
yeah .
when i ,
yeah ,
i grew up with hank snow , and  lefty frizzell  and hank williams and all of those old country and western songs .
really .
you 're older than i am
i ,
did you happen to see last night the special on channel two with james galway ?
we don 't get channel two .
oh .
our cable doesn 't ,
i wish we got that what ,
None
that is fabulous .
was it ?
None
we ,
we don 't get channel two .
yeah ,
when he played danny boy it just almost brought ,
tears to your eyes , because he can make that flute sing .
really ?
yeah ,
it was tremendous .
he is a ,
actually , i did ,
i played flute for ,
yeah .
almost ten years
i appreciate his too ,
yeah .
his mus -,
he 's from ireland isn 't he ?
yeah ,
uh -huh ,
it was , mostly all irish tunes ,
was i -,
yeah .
they had a band with him that , had a harpist and another flute and then a guy that played the bagpipes plus the , tin whistle ,
yeah .
and a couple of violins and , drum ,
uh -huh .
they played all the irish jigs and so forth ,
it was just fabulous .
yeah ,
he is really good .
yeah ,
i come from a musical background ,
yeah .
i 've played flute and piano ,
None
yeah .
i have a big appreciation for music ,
yeah .
up to a point .
yeah .
i 'm getting now to the age where i don 't like much of the new stuff that 's coming out ,
yeah .
my husband says i 'm getting old
yeah
i especially like instrumentals .
do you ?
yeah .
i love to just lay back on the couch and turn a good instrumental got on and just close my eyes and listen .
yeah ,
that 's nice to do , that is .
i 've got a two year old who 's now getting ,
i 'm getting well versed in kiddy music
yeah .
i 've never played an instrument in my life ,
i 've always wanted too ,
yeah .
i 've always wished my parents had forced me to learn the piano or something ,
yeah
None
i was one of the forced ones
i could never do that
i 'd just love to be able to go to a party or something and sit down at the piano and bang out music
i was never that brave
yeah .
i guess the closest i 've ever come to participating in music is singing in the choir .
yeah ,
yeah ,
i 've done that at church too .
yeah .
i haven 't done that in a long time .
yeah .
let 's see
 what els -, 
what kind of music do you not like ?
like i say the acid rock ,
i just do not ca -,
i don 't care for rap music either .
go -,
that 's not music
uh -huh ,
no .
that is not ,
i don 't know what that is ,
that 's not music
if i can 't understand the words i don 't want to listen to it .
it 's not music ,
it 's just , talking in a beat ,
yeah .
it 's not exciting at all
yeah .
it doesn 't give you relaxation ,
you can 't dance to it ,
you can 't do anything to it
right .
None
yeah .
i like orchestra music too . like the ,
d -,
yeah .
boston pops or anything .
have you ever been to the dallas symphony ?
uh -huh .
have you ?
is i -,
yeah .
are they good ?
yeah ,
they 're good .
are they ?
i have ,
None
never been .
really ?
we went and saw , les miserables the music in that was fantastic .
i 've heard that that is a really ,
yeah .
i heard that was hard to get tickets to .
yeah ,
it ,
i can 't remember how far in advance we reserved ,
tickets
it was out at the state fair music hall
yeah .
yeah ,
that was a real ,
it was well worth the price .
was it ?
yeah ,
i bet it was ,
yeah .
i really bet it was
is that the only , musical ,
do you go see a lot of musicals ?
yeah .
just ever so often a real good one like that one
None
that would be nice
i went and saw , i think it was , sugar babies ,
that was good ,
that had good music in it .
was it ?
how ,
i don 't know what that 's about .
that was the one with mickey rooney
what 's that not real old ,
dancer ,
i can 't think of her name .
i got it right on the tip of my tongue and can 't say it , helen something .
i know who you 're talking about ,
real long legs ,
she 's got black hair ,
and dark hair .
yeah ,
okay ,
i know who your talking about .
i can 't think ever her name either .
i can 't think of it .
yeah ,
that was ,
i remember that being , here a few years ago .
yeah ,
None
the last country music ,
my parents still , really like country ,
yeah .
music
they like the oak ridge boys and the statler brothers ,
yeah ,
yeah .
the blackwoods .
my parents ,
yeah ,
my husband likes , country music real well
he likes some of the new groups like shenandoah ,
yeah .
yeah ,
he really likes shenandoah .
alabama .
yeah ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
alabama ,
None
i think they 're a bit over exposed
yeah
i
of tire -, get tired of every other song being alabama on the ,
yeah ,
radio .
either alabama or hank williams , junior .
i 've never cared for hank ,
i never have either ,
williams , junior .
i never have figured out how he won , entertainer of the year for about ,
oh
three or four years in a row .
we watch those award shows too ,
we enjoy watching the country and the grammies and stuff
i just don 't care for him ,
yeah .
i just never have .
i don 't ,
i guess probably my favorite all time country and western song or singer is , probably eddy arnold .
is it ?
uh -huh .
okay ,
i think , i know who that is ,
uh -huh .
i think my parents have , some of his records .
None
yeah .
i had about a hundred and fifty old seventy -eight r p m records of country and western ,
wow .
songs ,
smiley burnette , i don 't know if you were old enough to remember him .
i 've heard the name .
he played in the old western movies .
None
he was the sidekick of gene autry i believe they ,
i think his name in the movie was froggy
None
i 've never seen a gene autry movie ,
had a real raspy voice ,
None
None
no ,
i never have
yeah .
some of those old ones , of course , bob wills , miss texas playboys ernest tubbs and red foley an ,
yeah ,
those go back quite a way
yeah .
yeah .
i took them up here to collectors records and was able to get a little money for them
it 's hard to ,
my mother and dad use to , own a restaurant ,
yeah .
they had a , nickelodeon , of course , in the restaurant ,
yeah .
that wou -,
that 's neat .
when they would come and change the records the guy would give her the old records that 's where i got my ,
that would be great if they weren 't too worn out ,
yeah .
at the time .
of course , there 's not a whole lot of market for seventy -eight r p m records .
is there not ?
you 'd think there would be .
the problem is most of the record players now will not play them because ,
that 's true .
yeah .
you have to have that , particular kind of needle they ,
just won 't play on a modern day , phonograph .
that 's a shame we go to antique stores a lot
you see seventy -eights ,
yeah .
a lot at record stores ,
you 'd ,
yeah .
think there 'd be a market for ,
i 'm sure you could find old players for them
that would cost a fortune ,
yeah .
if you could find them that worked
yeah .
oh .
of course , they , just don 't have the quality of records nowadays either because ,
no .
you get that scratchy sound .
uh -huh .
those things were big and thick weren 't they ?
yeah ,
yeah .
you could kill somebody with them
yeah ,
th -,
warped real easy .
the ones you buy ,
go out and buy one now
they 're just so thin and ,
yeah .
flimsy
they 're not meant to last ,
yeah .
at all ,
neither are tapes .
we buy cassette tapes ,
yeah .
machines will eat them ,
yeah .
the best bet , these days are compact disk ,
those things are practically indestructible
i guess , the old country and western music you ,
back then when i was a kid , there wasn 't that much t v ,
no .
that 's all you had to listen to was the ,
radio .
radio ,
None
that 's just what you had ,
we -,
None
yeah .
i think it was better back then to ,
yeah .
there 's too much t v now the radio is , more exciting ,
yeah .
really , than television ,
kep -,
yeah .
your imagination i -, kept
yo -,
it just didn 't vegetate your mind like television does
yeah ,
i remember mother and dad always turned on the grand ole opera .
yeah .
yeah .
was it on the radio every week ?
yeah .
what day was that on ,
can you recall .
seems like it was on a friday ,
None
friday or ,
okay .
okay .
what do you think about the idea of , kids having to do public service work for a year ?
do you think it 's a
i think it 's a pretty good idea .
i think they should either do that , or afford some time to the military , or helping elderly people .
yes ,
yes ,
def -,
i think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help
i think that before we expend all our young talent overseas and helping other countries we ought to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home
that 's true .
i 'm not sure that that 's not a bad idea
the military for a year or two ,
yeah .
wouldn 't be bad for ,
i think it teaches kids how to grow .
how about yourself ?
i agree with you .
what i 'm thinking about is back when i was a kid , and much earlier than that , kids were kind of , i -,
the parents kind of pushed them to join , the boy scouts or girl scouts
they did , do a lot of public service activities ,
these days they 're not ,
parents aren 't encouraging their kids to do things like that .
when i was in the girl scouts , we did a lot of public service things , because that 's just part of the scouting , and ,
yeah ,
i 've ,
that 's really great .
i really think that both the boy scouts and girl scouts is two excellent organizations .
they are
parents ,
kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that ,
yeah ,
they do .
they don 't follow it at all ,
there are very few scouts go on ,
no .
and become eagle scouts .
i don 't know what the high rank is for the gals
None
i ,
senior .
oh .
senior ,
okay .
there 's not ,
they 're just not ,
once they get into junior high it just ,
yeah ,
they lose interest .
not done anymore
when they young adults ,
uh -huh .
there 's even less interest there .
they 're more for , i g -,
me
not ,
yeah .
grab ,
grab ,
grab ,
walk out
yeah ,
you 're absolutely right
yeah
i think it 's a really a good thing .
i like to see ,
of course , there 's , third world countries that can use all kind of help
yeah ,
there 's a lot that can be done right here in this country ,
i think ,
too .
we ought to start right here at home .
i 'm ,
yeah ,
i 'm not so sure that helping overseas would be such a hot idea for , a lot of young people .
no ,
it ,
since there is much that needs to be done here .
i think that we need to really address what we 've done here
perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives them much broader outlook .
uh -huh .
it 's been really good .
we talked about this for a few minutes ,
hopefully , we 'll have other good topic maybe another call someday ,
i don 't really have too much more to say on this topic , i guess .
no ,
i agree with you
i guess we both agree that it 's a good thing ,
yeah .
that they should do sometime .
okay .
you take care ,
None
you , too .
enjoy the day .
you , too .
thank you , ma 'am .
bye -bye .
bye -bye .
what would you say your opinion is on gun control ?
i don 't know .
i 've had mixed emotions , i guess , when i listen to , the radio and watch t v about the different , things that are happening .
i 'm against it
on the same token , i went out and purchased a gun just because i wanted the right to do that
  ye -,  
  i have a rifle in the house .
the ammunition is probably so old i 'm afraid to use it .
i bought it for target practicing and also because i wanted a weapon .
how do you feel about it ?
i think , down here in texas they don 't have a waiting period on handguns .
None
i think they need that .
i have a pistol .
it 's a little twenty -two
i have a twenty -two or a twelve gauge shotgun .
uh -huh .
i do like to have my guns .
 i  don 't know if i 'll ever use it ,
like you , my bullets to my little pistol 's probably , about three years old
my gun hasn 't been shot in a year or two .
uh -huh .
i like to have them handy .
up in new england where i 'm from , you had to get a permit before you could buy any ammunition .
i thought that was really good .
i think if they ,
takes two weeks for that system to process , your request not as a gun permit but to buy ammunition .
you have to get a permit from the police station in your local area to do that .
i 've never heard of anything like that .
yeah .
that would be nice .
None
a -,
the criminals that are going to get their guns  one  way or the other .
i agree .
i think , one of the things that needs to happen is , to stop the impulse buyer from , buying it quickly and ,
maybe putting a week 's waiting period or something on it .
if someone 's really determined to pick up a firearm you can pick it up any place .
 yeah
  you can get them really cheap .
i know
i had a waiting period on my pistol because i was down in , tennessee .
uh -huh .
and , they had a waiting period
we bought it there .
None
 how  long was the waiting period out there ?
about nine days .
None
that wasn 't too bad .
no .
no
if you 're going to go buy something , of that nature , i think you 're going to have some idea as to what you 're going to do with it .
you 're not going to react that quickly .
in other words , you don 't have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day .
th -,
somebody wants to do that ,
at times i think they ought to have a waiting period on all firearms .
yeah .
i do too . because it doesn 't make any difference , whether it 's a pistol or a shotgun , i suppose .
they both  do the same kind of job . 
 a shotgun hurts worse  than a pistol does .
yeah .
i suppose .
i never got shot with either one .
i don 't know ,
i think you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun
no ,
a shotgun 's got too much of a spread .
 yeah . 
 at  least ours does .
it 's ,
uh -huh .
you have a little , thing on top of the barrel where you turn it ,
you can make it either tight or as loose as loose can get .
oh .
the spread changes .
i 've got a manual single shot
i guess it doesn 't have any automatic features to it .
yeah .
the further away i get , the , wider the shot gets from the target .
the closer that i get , the tighter that it gets .
it 's got a hell of a kick to it .
yeah .
my husband had a police gun at one time .
i shot that thing one time .
almost knocked me down .
 it just  a li -, 
 i forget ,
i think it was a three fifty -seven .
i 'm not sure .
do you belong to a gun club or you ?
he belonged to one awhile back .
since we moved ,
uh -huh .
 no kidding . 
we 've only been here in texas for about a year we can 't even find a place to shoot .  just for  target practice .
i 'd love to get used to that shotgun .
we traded his pistol for that shotgun .
the , clubs that we 've got around here are kind of expensive
it 's well worth it .
you can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and some targets and have , competition .
i 've never really joined a club because i haven 't got the time . not because i haven 't got the desire .
there 's an annual membership fee , that 's fairly high .
there 's an initiation fee that you have to pay because of first time , member .
the whole process can cost you a hundred fifty dollars to join the club .
you have to pay for the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in .
yeah .
that 's what my husband ,
when he was in that gun club where he was doing that tell if it 's a cough or something was hit >>.
it ,
he went mostly just to , shoot at paper targets .
uh -huh .
they used speed and accuracy and all that .
i think that the gun clubs serve a useful purpose .
in fact , i 'd like to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon you have to , show that you 've gone to school or gone to some class to know how to handle that weapon .
that 's a good ,
i 've never thought of that .
 that 's  a good point .
it ,
even after you wait your nine days , if you don 't know how to handle it , it 's just like putting someone in an automobile that doesn 't know how to drive .
you give him a license because he waited nine days .
yeah .
that 's ,
yeah .
he could not only , shoot himself .
he could , mishandle a weapon . leave it at home and let a child get at it .
it ,
we was living on a navy base down in memphis
this one guy decided to play , lonesome cowboy or something .
he was twirling his gun around and shot himself in his foot .
wow .
he was fortunate .
he could of hit something else  
  he went tumbling down the steps along with , shooting his foot almost off .
wow .
he broke his leg and collar bone and a couple of other things  i 'm sure , being , 
mister cowboy .
i can 't remember what the term was going around .
it was about four or five years ago .
  i guess that would be a good idea
about , private citizens selling a weapons ?
if you wanted to sell your pistol to me .
how do you feel about that ?
do you believe there ought to be legislation guiding the , buyer and the seller ?
do you believe that you ought to be able to sell your system ,
because you own it ?
that 's a hard one because we did that .
i think there ought to be some rule against it .
i 'll ,
the person who sells the gun ought to protect themselves because if that gun 's registered to them and somebody else uses that gun in something , the cops are going to come to you .
yeah .
None
 isn 't  there a way to deregister yourself after you register a gun ?
i have no idea .
 i 've only  had one gun
 i   have , 
i 've kept it ,  the one gun that was in my name .
yeah .
is it registered ?
yeah .
i -,
the rifle that i 've got is not registered ,
i don 't know why i never registered it
the ,
i don 't think you have to register a shotgun
i think it 's voluntary
the ,
my husband has a thing .
if they go to , all right , banning guns . private citizens
yeah .
this ,
my kid is jumping on me .
i can 't hardly talk .
my husband feels that they 'll come and collect everybody 's guns .
yeah .
i guess that could happen .
it 's just like the social security system
once they gave everybody a number
now they 're making you , get one at birth .
 yeah . 
  once they have your number , they have your identification .
if you try to do anything , like , not identify yourself to the government , they know who you are .
yeah .
and everything about you .
   , that 's true
i ,
they know how much money you make a week to , probably your ,
my kid is banging .
i was seeing what they was banging on .
i 've lost my train of thought .
i 'm sorry
that 's all right .
the soc -,
you were talking about , what the federal government knows about people .
yeah .
they probably know everything from , half the time what time you go to the bathroom .
 they probably do . 
 no ,
 that 's a little bit extreme .
they could know anything and everything about you .
i 'd like to have my gun .
if they go to banning them , i 'd lose my gun
we wouldn 't lose our , shotgun .
yeah .
we 're wanting to get a couple of more that no one knows about .
uh -huh .
i don 't ,
do you find it difficult picking up , guns that are not registered ?
no .
no .
i don 't either .
i can buy some , today if i wanted to .
 yeah .
w -, 
 just  put up the money .
yeah .
you can look in the ,
we got a thing down here called a shopper .
uh -huh .
it 's a bargain thing .
you go and always see guns in there .
yeah .
five to seven guns a day .
it comes out every tuesday .
there 's no waiting period on that .
no .
none whatsoever  
you call ,
we sold a refrigerator through it
it took us all of twelve hours .
to sell the refrigerator ?
yeah .
yeah .
i 'm sure it 'd be even less for somebody with a good gun .
i think the federal government is really far away from , control .
i don 't believe in ,
i shouldn 't probably say control .
i mean regulation .
control is something that i wouldn 't want the federal government to have .
i would like to see them have a monitoring capability so that they know who has what weapons .
yeah .
i agree with you there .
they do have too much control over us already .
yeah .
we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have .
unfortunately , we vote for the people who spend the money ,
i can 't complain too much .
yeah ,
i guess so .
i don 't know .
they 're
i haven 't heard anything about the proposal myself ,
None
no ,
i haven 't either .
i don 't know if its their proposal or one that 's being seriously kicked around .
i 've always felt for a long time that i think that all young kids ought to do a stint , primarily in the military .
yeah .
None
most countries require that now ,
yeah ,
yeah .
uh -huh .
they have , it mandatory for at least the young men ,
i don 't know about the young women ,
i don 't know if they have to  serve in the military , 
 yeah ,
a lot ,
yeah ,
too .
 you take israel everybody does .
yeah .
i don 't think it 's a bad idea ,
teaches a lot .
i went in the service when i was eighteen ,
uh -huh .
and , stayed in for ten years .
is that right ?
yeah ,
did a lot of growing up .
i bet .
you have to .
yeah .
yeah ,
my father had been in the military .
i didn 't do it myself .
my father had
that 's , how he put himself through school basically .
yeah .
he came from a poor immigrant family ,
he didn 't have a chance to ,
the family wasn 't wealthy ,
he had to do something to ,
do  it himself . 
 put himself through  school ,
he did .
he was very successful .
my parents wanted to send me to college ,
i was dead set against it
i had wanderlust ,
yeah .
i got in ,
after wasting the first six years , partying and everything else , i decided , uh -huh , time to settle down and do something .
i started to work on my education .
yeah .
uh -huh .
course my job was such that i couldn 't do it as much as i wanted still i ended up going two semesters when i got out just to get my degree .
that 's pretty good .
i 've been in school ever since
that 's good .
yeah ,
i guess .
yeah ,
that 's ,
i don 't know .
there 's other kinds of service to the country that could be done ,
yeah ,
if you don 't like ,
working in the national parks ,
sure .
exactly .
working , clean up the roadsides i 've always felt that people on welfare should be required to spend  ]
yeah ,
at least some of their time to go out and clean up the roads .
absolutely .
None
None
all this money that we 're throwing away to pay people to go out and do things when we 're paying all these welfare recipients ,
 yeah . 
if they 're able -bodied people , i don 't see any problem at all with having them go out there and , if nothing else , get a group of them together and take them around to old folks  places  and let them cut the yards , paint the houses .
yeah ,
 sure   ,
 sure . 
we 'd learn service  to other people   in this  country .
i 'm ,
get something out of that money .
country would benefit ,
yeah
i 've ,
None
yeah ,
yeah ,
my next door neighbor when i was growing up , worked for the unemployment division ,
his sole job was just tracking down people who were getting benefits and able -bodied
None
that right .
yeah ,
he had all kinds of horror stories .
these guys go down there and get their unemployment checks ,
back in those days they also use to give you , booklets good for , clothing and gas , and things like this
yeah .
yeah .
they get all this stuff together and sit down and have poker games
i have a hard time dealing with that .
what i hear one time , that he said that if the money that goes into welfare each year was to be given directly to the people without all the middle people in the government bureaucracy , each person would receive like forty -five thousand dollars .
uh -huh .
i was astounded .
i don 't even make that .
no ,
i know .
you think about the layer of bureaucracy between the money and the recipient ,
yeah ,
somebody 's taking that away .
there 's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy .
yeah ,
no doubt .
it 's totally ridiculous ,
i , started out when i first got in graduate school
i was going into public administration ,
quite honestly i just got so fed up with it i just couldn 't stand it any more .
is that right ,
yeah ,
this is the kind of thing you look at .
yeah .
you sit there
when you 're writing up budgets , you wonder , okay , how much money do we need .
you need x number dollars for the recipients
you need x number dollars to administer the program .
just ridiculous .
yeah .
this is ridiculous .
it 's sad .
it is ,
it 's pathetic .
there 's got to be a different way .
there 's got to be a better way .
it 'll never happen .
yeah .
these people out here getting that money are big voting blocks .
yeah .
what would happen if the   required young people to do service to the country ,
what should they get in return , i wonder .
None
i think there ought to be some kind of assistance as far as ,
i would limit it strictly to something like tuition assistance .
yeah .
give an incentive .
educational or vocational training or something .
yeah .
something that 's going to help them along the way .
they 'll help the country eventually , too ,
sure ,
None
because rather than having a bunch of uneducated people we can have educated people ,
this ,
that 's only going to help .
look at the statistics ,
it 's sad .
yeah .
one in five americans can 't read adults , that is , can 't even read .
we 've got the lowest rates of the civilized countries in science and math .
yeah .
what are we becoming ?
we 're becoming a service country .
as opposed to what we were twenty years ago .
yeah ,
we were an industrial giant ,
now we 're not going to do it because everybody is beating us at the game .
we taught them how to do it ,
they did it better than we do .
yeah
simple as that .
because they have the ambition , i guess .
yeah ,
simple as that .
yeah ,
which is good for them ,
on the other hand , we kind of lose out .
yeah ,
it 's terrible for us .
i think that if , young people had service to the country might give them more ambition .
yeah .
because they learn that serving other people is a good thing .
yeah ,
it can be good for them , too .
yeah ,
 yeah . 
  even the greedy kids that we 've got now
god , you go to the mall
i know .
you see , fourteen year old kids flaunting money , because the parents give them money to go down and play video games all night , for what .
i know .
give me the money
i 'll teach them something good
you know why they do it is so they can get them out of the house .
yeah .
yeah ,
that 's my other complaint .
parents aren 't parents any more .
no .
they 've relinquished their parenting .
yeah .
one of the other subjects is do you think the public school systems are in trouble ?
yeah .
as a substitute teacher for a year , i can say yes .
yeah ,
i talked with somebody else about that another time ,
when i 's in graduate school working on my master 's degree in math , i was , teaching as part of the program .
i just love teaching .
that 's probably the most fun i had .
yeah .
it helped me out because i learned things and learned how to do things differently .
uh -huh .
when come time to get out of school , i thought , boy , i 'd like to teach .
for what .
yeah .
i don 't want to live in a little one bedroom apartment the rest of my life .
exactly .
that 's a sad thing to think ,
that 's kind of selfish on my part ,
i admit that ,
in a way it is ,
yeah ,
that 's right .
you have to look out for yourself
that 's some -,
when we pay garbage men more than we pay teachers ,
that 's wrong .
yeah ,
gosh ,
None
i 'm not saying that garbage men should be paid less ,
i saying teachers should be paid more .
no ,
yeah .
they do an absolutely necessary job ,
i have a great deal of admiration for these people who can go out there and do that .
yeah .
there 's a sense of priorities here , too .
yeah .
we need ,
what 's more important , picking up the garbage or educating our kids .
yeah
they both have their place .
yeah ,
they ,
sure .
when it gets right down to it ,
one 's import -,
on the other hand , you take a garbage man in new york city starts out at twenty -six thousand dollars .
that 's pretty good .
i bet you there 's a whole bunch of homeless people up there who would take that job for thirteen thousand dollars a year .
yeah .
my other pet peeve is unions .
yeah ,
yeah .
it 's ridiculous the way unions have gone .
there was a time when unions were needed .
they served a good function .
they served a good function ,
there are enough laws on the books now that unions are outdated ,
they 're only there to perpetuate their own power structure .
i remember , the company my dad worked for , the people there went on strike against the management .
it was a steel manufacturing place ,
they ,
this was during a time when the import steel was so cheap ,
they were having a hard time .
they told the strikers there , look ,
we need you to come back and get this stuff done .
else we 're going to be out of business .
they wouldn 't come back ,
they went bankrupt .
yeah .
they all lost their jobs .
sure , 
 it 's like   ,  
 that 's  really what happened to the steel industry in this country .
yeah .
so many times , you had the coal miners and steel workers going out at the same time .
that 's right .
that took care of that industry i 'll tell you ,
detroit worked awfully hard on stopping car manufacturing in this country .
they 're trying to do that now with the imports .
yeah ,
we 've never caught up ,
i don 't think we ever will .
it 'll be a tough road , though .
yeah ,
here it is ,
we 've got to go into partnership with the japanese to build cars .
yeah .
yeah .
they only did it because i guess they were embarrassed that they 're so good at it
that 's about right .
gosh .
yeah ,
back to the original subject ,
yeah ,
i think youngsters ought to go out and do some public service ,
i don 't care what kind it is .
it teaches them pride in their country .
yeah ,
and pride in themselves , too .
that 's right .
you could organize something just within your community .
yeah ,
same old thing .
None
that 's right .
that 's like eagle scouts .
sure .
uh -huh .
that 's a great idea .
i think they ought to take them and , i don 't know , just have sort of like a manpower pool and say okay , look ,
we need somebody
okay ,
we 're going to talk about the public school system ,
okay .
what 's wrong with it , or if anything is wrong with it and what we can do about it , what should be done about it .
fantastic .
one thing that pops into my mind real quick is , about the , funding of , the school system right now .
yeah .
evidently , that 's a big problem .
yeah ,
it 's amazing ,
i always thought that teachers never got paid nearly enough ,
right .
to be doing what they 're doing ,
when i was in college i enjoyed teaching ,
i did some teaching part -time
i really enjoyed that
i wouldn 't want to go teach high school or junior high ,
it just , all the problems .
lord , yeah ,
you talk about stress and pressure ,
i tell you what ,
it 's ,
yeah ,
they 're putting in fifty , sixty hours a week ,
i 'm sure , because they 've got to grade papers and get class stuff ready .
do ,
right .
they 're being paid , probably half what most people being paid .
exactly ,
None
we 're paying basketball people , millions of dollars a year for what ,
that 's right ,
they , poof it off , do like tarpley .
yeah .
i  
what gets me is i can 't believe that our state legislature can 't come up with , some kind of workable means to have funds for the school .
it 's ,
i just don 't understand that .
yeah ,
it 's ,
do you have little kids , or what ?
no ,
sure don 't ,
my wife and i 've just been married about two years
i have a sister that 's a , school teacher ,
None
yeah ,
yeah ,
my wife and i have a three year old , almost four and a two year old .
okay .
we 're looking at the older one going to school next year . not this coming fall but the year after that .
okay ,
it 's getting close .
yeah ,
he 's going to be going to kindergarten ,
None
right .
we 're thinking about that .
what 's that going to be like .
are they going to be taught nothing ,
they going be taught something ,
we 're going to be involved in our child 's education .
we 're going to be teaching him what we can at home , of course ,
right .
because , i guess we don 't trust the school system , which is very sad ,
exactly .
if it doesn 't start at home , it 's not going to go anywhere .
right ,
that 's true .
None
we 're going to try to teach him good values , because , when they get to upper level school and they start teaching them , hey , if you can play football or basketball that 's what 's important . not if you can read or write , or understand some science .
exactly .
None
give me a break ,
that 's bogus .
right ,
right .
one thing my wife and i 've talked about , are , private schools .
yeah .
whether , we would want to invest in private schools as they 're growing up , because , just in the dallas area , we 're not real comfortable with the public schools .
dallas , school district just recently got an advised status because of their low quality schooling .
right .
i couldn 't believe that .
right .
that 's one reason we bought a house here in plano .
we were hoping , the school districts going to be good , for resale value , and ,
yeah .
so on and so forth ,
i can definitely , see on down the road , where we do have kids and are getting to that age , that 's going to be a definite concern .
yeah ,
you talked before , about the school funding .
i think there 's only going to be one solution to school funding which i don 't think will be necessarily the best way
i think what 's going to have to happen is there 's going to have to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids .
that 's the only way they 're going to fund it , because if they start raising taxes for property , people are going to throw a fit .
that 's ,
yeah ,
that 's ,
taxes right now are political suicide .
yeah .
None
i don 't think any politician 's going to do that ,
None
yeah ,
the only thing , they would think of would be tuition ,
if it works at colleges it will work down below .
right .
that 's going to affect the people that are having kids in school , of course , which is probably the only fair thing to do .
it will be hard for those that people , that have in school because they have to pay out even more .
exactly .
it 's going to really hurt the middle class , people , i think .
yeah .
because , they 're the ones that will probably have to carry the brunt of the load .
that 's right .
None
most of the problems with kids in school carrying guns and knives and everything ,
good grief what 's  
yeah
that 's just unbelievable to me ,
i can 't believe that .
when i was in junior high and high school that never happened .
you never heard about that .
yeah ,
we didn 't even think about it ,
no .
now , what do we have now .
got kids that ,   either got a magnum gun school ,
good grief .
right .
i 'd be afraid to b -, teaching , or even being a student
think what 's it going to be like for my oldest son , when he goes to school .
what 's going to happen ?
i 'm afraid for him to go .
exactly ,
right .
there  again   , you can 't hold them back .
another reason , yo -,
you want to encourage them , to be active and everything in school ,
with all the peer pressure that 's going on , with all the negative things , it 's a tough environment to be growing up in .
yeah ,
and lot tougher than it was when i was going to school ,
that was ,
i graduated high school in nineteen seventy -nine ,
None
okay .
that was what , twelve years ago , i guess .
right .
it 's lot different now .
what 's it going to be like in another twelve years when my , oldest son is in high school .
that 's right ,
that 's right .
i 'm afraid to even think about it .
yeah , that is a scary thought ,
i don 't know ,
i guess what you have to do is just , keep encouraging them and , try to be open with them , so that you can deal with the problems as they come up .
that 's all you can do .
yeah ,
None
you got to be your child 's best friend , i guess ,
right .
even when they 're a teenager and they , are kind of standoffish ,
still you got to be their best friend because when they 've got problems , who they going to go to , their friends that are dealing drugs , or your parents .
exactly .
None
if they go to their friends dealing drugs , they 're going to be in even worse shape .
that 's right .
the schools don 't really encourage to stay away from that ,
the schools are there to teach history and that we fought the civil war , etcetera , etcetera .
they don 't teach them good values like drugs are bad .
maybe i 'm wrong , because i haven 't , been in that kind of environment for a long time ,
None
right .
it just is amazing ,
need to teach them good values .
that 's true ,
that 's true ,
None
of course , if i say this is a good value , someone else is going to stand up and say , no .
the a c l u is going to get after them and have a lawsuit .
right .
which is going to take twenty years to resolve ,
i think , you touched on it ,
you 've got to start them at the home .
yeah .
None
that 's where they get the deep rooted values
that 's all you can do .
that 's about right .
then you just have to hope and pray that everything , works out okay ,
None
that 's right .
i got to be going ,
None
okay ,
hey , i appreciate the call .
nice talking to you today .
you to .
have a good life ,
hi , wanet is his last name >>.
how are you ?
i 'm doing fine .
where you from ?
i 'm from new england .
massachusetts .
okay .
i 'm from berkeley , california .
wow !
this is quite a long distance .
yeah ,
it certainly is .
do you have any pets ?
no .
use too .
use to ,
none right now .
how come , you don 't have any now ?
you get tired of them ?
i live in an apartment building
 yeah . 
it 's just not feasible  
i 'd love to have a dog ,  
 i 've got  a little doggy , that i 've had quite a long time .
in fact , she just turned sixteen years old new year 's eve .
None
None
is she ?
i beg your pardon ?
what is she ?
she 's , a poodle .
a toy poodle 
she 's , 
 ah .
ah ,
i got  my mom a  teacup  little mutt   , 
not too long ago .
this is a little bigger than a teacup .
yeah .
it 's funny how i , acquired this animal .
when i was , married , my , ex -wife had said that she had a friend who had a little puppy . that she needed ,
the woman needed someone to baby -sit
this is what she had told the kids
she even told me that .
after the two week period was up , she then informed me that the woman no longer wanted the little puppy and wanted to know if we wanted to keep it .
 for sure . 
after you had an animal for a couple of weeks ,  you become attached to it .
yeah .
i 've had this dog now for sixteen years
she 's been a lot of company
she 's , however , getting a little old
things are starting to fail .
i live alone now
she stays in the house all day while i go to work
she 's been holding herself pretty well . up until , recently where she 's been having accidents in the house because she either is losing control or she forgets where she is
i find a little present on the floor sometimes when i come home . 
she 's usually pretty good . 
  yes ,
my mother has one that 's ,
it 's , teacup
it 's made such a difference for her .
just , i , e -,
the way my mom 's presence countenance is , just for having a puppy
having this dog
she 's had it for , i guess three years now .
uh -huh .
possibly four .
it 's really made such a difference for her .
i really would like to ,
uh -huh .
i 'm a disabled person i 'm unable to , really take care of a pet
if that weren 't so , i would certainly have one .
i just ,
it frustrates me sometimes not being able to have a dog 
 yeah  
  you might want to get yourself , an animal that doesn 't require much attention . like a cat .
yeah .
yeah ,
i typically am not a cat person .
i have a friend that , has on occasion , brought her cat over for me to keep from time to time
this cat is like no other cat i have ever seen .
it would sleep on my chest ,
None
yeah .
it 's just a  great cat ,
None
 my personal  preference is a dog .
i don 't know that i would ever want a cat .
i like cats .
i just wouldn 't want to own one .
 you don 't own cats . 
 they 're affectionate
they ,
 yeah 
i don 't know ,
i can 't seem to communicate with a cat like i can with my dog .
yeah .
yeah ,
right
they own you or ,
grant you with you their presence ,  
 yeah .
right .
 that ,
yes ,
we 're supposed to appreciate them .
when i come home in the evenings , my dog greets me at the door .
i don 't know that a cat would do that ,
yeah .
i used to have ,
a cat that could read me better than any human being in my life .
yeah .
i could just walk in the door
she knew whether to quietly come up to me or to just run and knock me over .
 yeah ,
yeah . 
 she  really could pick up on my mood  the  way i walked in the door .
it was , uncanny like a truck >>.
i think , in a way we 're able to read each other pretty well because , she knows when i 'm upset and i know when she 's not feeling good too 
None
 yeah . 
i know when she has an accident , i know she 's not doing it on purpose .
yeah .
when she was younger , she used to do that to get even with me ,
  some people might not believe that
i do
sure
absolutely .
if i put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours , because i was going out . she would , break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to let me know that she was unhappy with what i did
really ?
yeah .
that 's the way ,
i had that cat that i mentioned ,  alfie 
one morning , the first thing you do is you get up and you feed this cat something and you make sure that it can get to its litter box .
uh -huh .
for some reason during the night , the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through
the next morning , when my roommate got up and , did not feed it right away , it decided that it was going to protest .
it jumped up on my bed and anointed my blanket ,
 for me . looking  at me eye to eye ,
 all the time while it was doing it . 
all right .  have i got your attention now ? 
  yes .
animals have a way of talking
 alfie  did .
i tell you if i could have gotten a hold of that cat that day .
i don 't know that i 'd trade my dog in for the world .
it was about two years ago she got sick on me
i took her to the vet 's because she wasn 't eating and , she wasn 't able to jump .
she , lost all her activity
she stayed there for one day
the doctor called me up and said , she had a low white cell count and that , she was dying and , suggested that i take her to a animal hospital
i took his suggestion
i , took the dog to the dog hospital there
they said they 'd keep her there for three days .
she ended staying there five days at a hundred and something dollars a day because she was in intensive care
it cost me over five hundred dollars .
ouch .
the vet sent me a bill for what he did
then she recouped .
she was okay for a couple of years .
she got sick on me again
i brought her to a different vet this time
i told the vet what medication i had given her and everything
he gave me the same medication that i gave her the last time
she was okay
she 's been okay every since .
it 's been about two years now .
that 's great ,
it really is .
i 'm glad  that  she was able to pull out of it  that way  and so cheaply the second time .
yeah .
the problem is if someone would have came up to me and said it 's going to cost you five hundred dollars to keep your dog alive .
what do you want to do ?
i probably would have had second thoughts .
yeah .
 of course , you would . 
  what they do is , is they say , it 's going to cost , twenty dollars for tests and forty dollars for this
it creeps up on you .
you don 't know that ,
you don 't know what it 's going to until it 's all over .
to give you an example . my mom had an elderly cat who , whoever evidently got a hold of it
the cat got sick .
she took the cat to the vet
she had the cat there for two days
the cat died .
the doctor had called her up and said , your cat died
you owe me this bill ,
by the way , do you want me to bury the cat  
it cost her three hundred dollars ,
she didn 't get the cat back .
yeah ,
they had to pay for all the medical , bills that the cat ran up plus the burial expenses .
she just brought the cat in because he wasn 't feeling good
 really . 
geez .
 that was kind of a surprise 
 at lea -,  
 yeah .
 you kind of wonder what really happened .
yeah .
even the ,
they claimed they did the best that they could have
then the cat , died .
my goodness .
i 'm looking for another cat for them .
i 've got a little kitten , that 's still , just being born right now .
another five or six weeks i 'll be bringing the little kitten over to my folks .
that will make their day .
yeah .
i think it will
they 're both in their seventies . and , the cat , although it 's a little bit of work for them sometimes , it turns out to be , a pleasant experience for them .
i think they enjoy that .
only work initially .
yeah .
for cats anyway ,  
 yeah . 
listen
it 's been a pleasure talking to you .
the same here .
you take care .
okay .
bye now .
maybe we 'll talk again sometimes
okay .
what is that sound ?
that 's my buzzer at the door
okay .
i 'll let you go .
okay .
 right 
 thank you 
what do you do to exercise ?
s -,
i , weight train , three days on and one day off .
uh -huh .
i , ride bicycles , fifteen , twenty miles , i don 't know , maybe three times , maybe four times a week .
i play basketball , couple times a week .
i play softball one night a week .
that 's what i do .
None
what about yourself ?
that 's pretty impressive .
i guess i bicycle .
the amount varies
as much as a hundred and fifty miles a week .
uh -huh .
i guess a play softball one night a week .
i backpack a lot over the summer .
really ?
yeah ,
that 's about the extent of it .
i don 't do any of those things particularly , for exercise .
i guess the bicycling is the one thing i 'll sort of , do if i feel like i need to go exercise
i do it mostly for fun .
yeah ,
what do you ride , a bunch of hills or pretty flat ?
it varies .
out near my house is pretty hilly .
sometimes i bike to work which is about , a fifteen mile trip each way .
that 's mostly flat .
how long does that take you to get to work ?
about forty -five , fifty minutes .
how does that work out with , storing your bike and showering and all that ?
yeah ,
it can be a pain .
basically , i work on a campus
uh -huh .
i can store my bike in my office and walk across the , campus to the , gym , use the shower there it 's enough of a pain , that i did it consistently one year ,
i would commute every day ,
it just became such a pain .
we 're talking , forty -five , fifty minutes for biking ,
right .
and sometimes longer if you had adverse wind . and then another half an hour , to cool down and take a shower and all this kind of stuff .
it was a big hunk of the day
of course another hour to get back home .
i 've been doing that less , and concentrating more on , light biking when i get home on the evening and then , some more on the weekends .
yeah .
do you ride a lot of rallies or a lot of those around there ?
not so much .
i guess mostly i bike on my own .
i 've got a touring bike .
uh -huh .
though i haven 't gone on any extended trips with it .
how about you ,
what kind of biking do you do ?
actually my wife just got me into it
i did an internship at the institute for aerobics research in dallas ,
uh -huh .
the cooper clinic ,
i learned all the health benefits of ,
i was a solid weight trainer ,
uh -huh .
all i did was weights and aerobic exercise
my wife got me into the aerobic exercise and said you really need to do it ,
None
uh -huh .
once i got into this , internship , i learned all the physiological advantages to it ,
i began a program i don 't know probably three or four weeks ago
i did my first bike rally this saturday .
i did , forty miles ,
None
that 's the longest i 've ever ridden so far ,
i usually , fifteen or twenty .
uh -huh .
it was kind of hilly
it was pretty tough ,
i 'm looking at , doing a lot more of it because , my wife is really into it ,
i see .
i kind of held her back a little bit this weekend .
she wanted to go , go , go ,
None
uh -huh .
she wanted to stay with me
it 's good to have a partner .
yeah
it really is .
are you think of doing any , centuries , or
yeah ,
that would be cool sometime if i could , work up to that .
uh -huh .
yeah ,
i just wondered if you were going to do that mostly or more like , touring from vermont or , that kind of ,
oh .
thing .
i mean people seem to get into different aspects .
one is more of a distance ,
one 's more , just ,
they want to put some equipment on their bike and go for a tour .
i 've never really looked into that .
that 's ,
my wife would just love that .
uh -huh .
i may do that sometime .
there again , i 'm just kind of a fledgling into this .
uh -huh .
it 's kind of funny .
i called this number
i was just reading through a bicycle magazine and going through all the different tours coming up .
yeah ,
yeah .
around texas , you got about five or six ,
if you live around the dallas area , you got five or six every weekend to choose from .
that 's nice .
because they 're really into it .
None
bicycling is really big here .
i didn 't know that , until i came down here , and ,
wow .
kind of caught the fever .
yeah .
i lived in indiana all my life
uh -huh .
you may say see one or two guys on a bicycle above the age of fifteen or something , other than that it 's nothing up there like it is down here .
yeah ,
i 'm not sure why that is .
generally in the midwest it seems to be much less .
maybe it 's because of the winters .
probably .
or maybe just because , there 's a lot more flat lands , out in the west .
yeah .
it makes biking a better alternative for transportation .
yeah .
there 's a lot of bikers around here .
it 's really neat .
uh -huh .
there are a lot of resources , a lot of magazines , and stuff ,
little texas bicyclist , is a little newspaper that comes out every month .
None
it 's free
just go to the bike shop and pick it up ,
it 's got all the rides coming up ,
i guess i 'm going to be busy about every saturday this summer ,
that 's terrific .
going to a different ride .
yeah ,
see a little bit of texas i 've never seen before .
uh -huh .
how long have you been biking ?
i guess as an adult for just about the past , three years or so
i guess last time i did it before that was college , which was about ten years ago .
yeah .
yeah ,
i guess i just never really thought about it much for a while , until i suddenly discovered all my friends were basically biking a lot .
i thought i 'd try it , too .
have you ever had a blood workup done recently or since you 've been biking ,
no ,
i haven 't ,
no .
to see if it ,
None
from what i understand , it really improves your , cholesterol it kind of knocks down two of the big risk categories for coronary artery disease which is , low cardiovascular fitness , and also , the cholesterol .
uh -huh .
it gives you increased h d ls and decreases your l d ls .
that 's great .
yeah ,
None
yeah ,
i 've definitely noticed it 's had a good effect on my resting pulse .
yeah .
it gets it down to about forty .
really ?
yeah .
that 's good .
yeah .
you say you ride about a hundred , hundred fifty miles a week ?
yeah .
man .
that 's hard -core .
on average ,
yeah .
when do you get to begin with the winters and all that ?
what time of the year do you usually embark on your ,
do you ride inside if you can 't ride outside ?
no ,
i 'm not that hard -core .
there are some people ,
in fact a lot of people will ride outside in the snow .
they 've got a , mountain bike ,
with the big knobby tires .
yeah .
i don 't do that .
i pretty much lay off for the winter .
i was thinking of getting rollers for the last winter , because it will help your balance when you 're indoor training .
None
i just , more or less stocked , an exercise bike and that kind of thing .
yeah ,
winters are kind of a problem
i 'm more or less out of shape now that i 've been biking , i guess , this year for just a couple of weeks .
uh -huh .
up here it 's only stopped snowing since then .
yeah .
yeah ,
it 's pretty good .
it 's ,
the main thing , i guess , for me is just to enjoy it because once it starts seeming like , exercise and a chore i 'll lay off it more .
right .
you , change up your routes a lot , and keep a
yeah ,
yeah .
i try to go someplace pretty different , every week .
i rotate around , about four different routes , from my house
i 'll sometimes come in the school .
it 's nice coming ,
it 's nice riding to school because it 's all along a canal path
it 's along the erie canal up here .
what school is it ?
university of rochester .
okay .
yeah .
it 's fairly picturesque .
yeah .
it 's a good ride
as long as you 're not doing it every day , it 's a good ride
yeah .
that 's true .
sounds neat .
yeah .
it 's kind of ,
i was wondering if i was going to talk with someone that never has exercised before and doesn 't want to and everything else ,
got a guy that rides a hundred and fifty miles a week .
that 's , motivating .
yeah .
that 's really good .
it was good talking to you .
good talking to you
keep up the good work .
okay ,
you , too .
all right .
take care .
bye .
bye .
okay .
far as , crime in the cities , i 'm sure , like in yours it 's pretty bad .
probably the biggest thing we 've got going now is the robberies
uh -huh .
and theft and probably murder are the two top ones that we have .
how about you ?
i don 't actually live in the city ,
i 'd probably say that 's roughly right .
crimes against property seem to outnumber crimes against life ,
i think with the current war on drugs and all this kind of stuff i 'd say probably the police department would claim the number one crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution , and sale of drugs .
uh -huh .
probably right , if you look at it from that stand point .
uh -huh .
what ,
is there anything , that you particularly are concerned with in your particular area as far as security and that sort of thing ?
where i live now it 's not so bad .
i can basically leave my front door unlocked and not have to worry about it .
i do have friends that live in the city
i think that they get a lot of fallout from this war on drug thing . just because there are , crack houses , on their street and stuff like this .
uh -huh .
do you live in a real small town or out in the country ?
i live out in the country ,
yeah .
how far out from the city , do you ,
i 'm about fifteen miles out .
about fifteen miles .
uh -huh .
i live in a little suburb , which i guess from dallas is twelve miles or so it 's pretty congested .
we are considered in the country ,
None
it doesn 't really feel like you 're in the country .
None
uh -huh .
our major crimes in our immediate town , is probably house robberies and very few instances of , alcohol , drugs , reported .
however , i 'm sure they 're there .
uh -huh .
right now our neighborhood is running about , eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed ,
wow .
sometime during their , existence in that neighborhood .
 that 's huge 
uh -huh .
since that time everybody 's got some sort of burglar system or , burglar alarms and including the outer perimeter type , devices ,
uh -huh .
sensors and things like that .
it 's cut back , considerably ,
it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to other neighborhood ,
it still , remains city wide , pretty high .
are there any theories on why this is happening ?
i would say the majority of it 's happening during the day , between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon .
uh -huh .
most ,
why ?
why is it happening ?
most families are young
both people are working .
uh -huh .
they 're happening during the hours they 're gone from work .
uh -huh .
i would say that 's probably their prime motivation .
they 'll stock your house and , look at your pattern and then go from there .
they 're professionals ?
they classify most of them as professionals .
None
you get a few of them that are a little bit sloppier , just taking , just junk items that they can just get , ten to twenty bucks for real quick .
uh -huh .
probably the biggest items that you get in our neighborhood , would be the high classed automobiles ,
uh -huh .
the , mercedes , volvos , things that they can get , big dollars for and the jewelry are the major targets ,
guns , that sort of stuff .
None
very few , penny ante stuff .
what do you think can be done to reduce that sort of crime ?
the police force , for one ,
i think they could , definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use .
it 's ,
right now i think , we are about thirty thousand people
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
there 's only eight officers that patrol for that amount of people which is not very many .
right .
None
that 's going to tend to ,
it seems to me that sort of approach will tend to simply make the cost of committing the crime slightly higher
in other words , you 've increased the probability of somebody being caught a little bit .
the real question is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes in the first place .
the ,
course in our particular state , we have the prison overcrowding , whatever ,
they 're giving the early release ,
right .
they 're doing that in our state , too .
yeah ,
it 's ,
i think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences ,
for the ,
you think that would be a deterrent ?
that would certainly be a deterrent .
uh -huh .
not necessarily , give in to their , human rights desires .
if they 're overcrowded , just keep cramming them in there till they just suffocate .
what about an innocent person who happens to have been found guilty ?
i think they 'd have to go to extra measures to make sure a person 's guilty , in a lot of cases .
course , i know you can 't be a hundred percent foolproof .
right .
None
you 'd rather see it harder to convict somebody .
i 'd rather see it a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence ,
uh -huh .
to convict somebody
those convicted , especially of , murder and , major crimes ,
uh -huh .
to reach the life sentences and , death penalties and follow -through with that .
None
right .
especially , in the case of murder i know in my case , my wife and daughter were kidnapped ,
wow .
my goodness .
during a house robbery back in eighty -five the individuals got caught ,
None
uh -huh .
we went through the court system and all that sort of thing
uh -huh .
right .
two counts of kidnapping , the forty -five to the head , just the mental anguish and the whole nine yards the guy only got five years .
wow .
he was out within two months because of the parole system .
what ,
did you sue him under the civil system ?
do what now ?
did you sue him under the civil system ?
no .
i 'm not real familiar with that .
you could probably sue him for mental anguish or something , right ,
oh .
and try to get money from him
None
the insurance companies and all that tried to go after him
they said , he has no job ,
he has nothing ,
there 's nothing that he has that you could go after .
yeah .
makes you wish that still had indentured servitude , for this sort of thing .
yeah .
very seld -,
they give the guy a job in prison and make him pay his damn debt .
yeah .
they don 't do that here .
course they pay them ,
you don 't ,
you or the insurance companies never see any of that money .
yeah ,
that 's too bad .
right now they 're reluctant to go after him because they 're repeat offenders ,
they , been in jail before
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
they 've been released , several times , which is another ,
uh -huh .
deal i hate to see .
uh -huh .
basically the guy commits , three major crimes
yeah ,
i think that 's re -,
and car theft on top of it ,
yeah .
destroys my car ,
yeah .
we 're out , fifteen thousand dollars
None
that 's awful
the guy gets out in two months
he goes out and commits it again .
fact , he 's back in jail now .
what ,
gives you sympathy for the vigilantes .
yeah .
what deterrent does he really have ?
yeah .
yeah ,
i think in our particular neighborhood , vigilantism is becoming a real possibility .
uh -huh .
my god .
we 've had a couple instances where break ins where the people have actually , shot the people return offenders have ,
they 've actually waited for them , where they 've robbed , particular neighborhood ,
they 'll rob one house ,
then other people will wait up , and wait for somebody to do something else , try to take it in their own hands .
right .
course it doesn 't always work out in their favor .
right .
nevertheless ,
uh -huh .
i think people are just getting fed up and saying , you can 't arrest all of us ,
right .
you can get some of us ,
you can 't get all of us .
uh -huh .
we 're beginning to see more and more of that .
yeah .
that 's a deterrent , too . if you think the home owner might be armed , right , and awake here you break in ,
you 're going to get shot .
yeah ,
that 's certainly a possibility in ,
we have had a few cases where the guy has broken in , during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
it helps for a while then just another different set of people come in ,
most of the people are transients from outside of the state .
None
i would say probably eighty percent of them that are caught , they 're from places like up in oklahoma , and louisiana , arkansas , across the border .
wow ,
uh -huh .
people who don 't readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever it 's not many from the local communities .
uh -huh .
it 's a problem ,
i think that the court systems need to be more stiffer in their penalties ,
yeah .
would be a definite deterrent
yeah .
giving the , police , agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do when they catch these people .
uh -huh .
i tend to agree with you .
right .
i think , what i would like to see is , number one , completely getting rid of these victimless crimes . and worry about these things where people are getting hurt .
i think one of the big things that you can do to increase deterrence is , if someone is found guilty of a , felony level offense , they lose their citizenship .
they lose their constitutional rights .
uh -huh .
None
just a lot of things that we 're trying to worry about , protecting these people from , we just don 't protect them .
i know in my wife 's case , they made her feel like the criminal .
i know ,
i think that 's ridiculous .
they went to all
okay ,
have you painted something lately ?
yes ,
i have .
that room i showed you .
yeah .
since then we have painted the bedroom .
yeah ,
another bedroom .
yeah ,
i showed you that one too didn 't i ?
the brown one .
yeah .
 yeah .
yeah . 
 yeah ,
 the one that looks like a fudgesicle .
yeah
yeah .
heavens .
yeah .
i painted the outside of my house and one bathroom .
i have that problem with the ceiling , the blown , ceiling .
yeah .
where you get around the edge .
that is hard .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i asked janice , or somebody recently how you do that when you paint the ceilings where you have got that textured stuff , that they have special rollers that are real soft and furry  that you paint that with . 
  how do you get the edge though ?
how do you get the edge ?
 the straight edge ? 
 you  just have to be real careful .
i see .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
we use , a two inch brush on a slant that mostly does it even though you still make mistakes .
None
are you going to paint the outside of your house too ?
yeah .
i think i am going to do it this spring actually .
really ?
yeah ,
there are six houses .
the people that own the house they , pay for anything like that , that we do .
 nice . 
 as far as  the materials .
there are three houses on this street the same color of yellow out of six houses .
yeah .
i am thinking i am going to change it to , something ,
the brick is multi color .
uh -huh .
mostly earth tones .
i think i am going to put something like a brown on it , on the outside .
that will be nice .
and maybe , a little deeper brown in the entry way or something so it will stand out a little .
None
 what color did you paint , 
 or two tone .
yeah .
None
there are some columns that could be painted a different color  too . 
 uh -huh . 
what color did you paint your house ?
white .
 on the out , 
 i  have a problem .
i can 't get up high
we can 't paint the chimney
you have got to get one of those ladders .
we have one of those ladders .
we are just not willing to get up that high .
yeah .
a friend of mine that lives out in your neighborhood , he has done his house
that is what he ,
i was out there last week
he has finished everything except the chimney .
we did too .
we did it in the fall
it 's just too high .
it is really scary ,
yeah .
the only thing i would consider a professional , maybe doing that ,
it
other than doing our own work i prefer it to a professional .
our house in new mexico , it was stucco ,
we had all this trim to paint , and lots of it .
yeah .
we did basically seventy -five percent of the house
then i was afraid to do the eaves way up high and stuff .
uh -huh .
i hired this man to come in and do it . a young kid .
uh -huh .
he came with his own raf -,
what do you call those things ?
the blowers ?
no ,
those where you built a rafter thing .
yeah .
scaffold .
i know what you are talking about . scaffold .
that 's it
he came and did it that way
i think he charged me a hundred dollars to finish up .
None
its ,
yeah .
  literally i wouldn 't have done it with the scaffolds because all the places that i had left for him were above huge humongous cactus if he fell , he was dead
he knew that
None
my .
yeah .
that was worth it getting a professional for that .
he cleaned up my mess .
i think that is what we might have to do with this chimney ,
other than that , it was pretty easy doing it ourself and caulking it and everything ourself .
uh -huh .
it wasn 't too bad .
 you think , 
 how much  did it cost you for the paint for the outside ?
shoot , maybe a hundred and fifty .
yeah .
since , it is a one story ,
we did , two heavy coats over it .
 yeah . 
 then that way  you are assured you did a good job than you are , if you hire someone to do it .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
that friend of mine that painted his house out there in your neighborhood he went   i guess to buy his paint yet he bought seventeen gallons .
my word .
uh -huh .
anyway , when he checked out
uh -huh .
they only charged him for one gallon of paint . thirteen bucks or something .
my word .
uh -huh .
he had already carried a ladder outside and told her that
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
she wrung all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint she had to start all over again when he got outside , he noticed his receipt was thirteen ninety -nine or something .
my word .
he saw  
that was really worth it .  painting his own house . 
 yeah ,
 it was over two hundred dollars worth of free stuff .
my word
my word .
he really saved in that way .
yeah .
yeah ,
i think we are going to do , another bathroom ,
i think i will probably just do it , in a roller .
i want to do it about the same color . and just be a little ,
rollers are so messy .
we never   any more .
i know .
it 's the textured wall .
a little paintbrush ,
so what do you think ?
uh , the causes of crime ?
um , i think it was imbalance of power in the united states .
it 's causing the lower class to rebel .
that 's why there 's su -, such high crime ,
yeah .
and , uh , there 's crime in , uh , young people because they don 't have ro -, role models see too much crime on t v
and they think it 's the way to go .
i don 't know .
what do you think ?
what about ,
uh -huh .
i agree with the upper and lower level , you know because that 's the lowest thing for themselves ,
plus there 's nobody for them to look up to .
yeah .
okay .
but i also blame some of it on parents because parents aren 't parents .
yeah .
because i remember even when i was growing up ,
okay .
i 'm thirty -five i remember when i was growing up ,
and i had friends ,
they used to do stuff like , you know , go over to a store and steal stuff .
my mother warned us , it 's like , i don 't care what your friends do .
if you do it , then that was it .
yeah .
from anybody else .
and i knew that i would get in more trouble from my mother than from from anybody else .
yeah .
and i think that 's the basic , is they have no morals any more ,
so they don 't care .
yeah .
so .
yeah ,
i think i can agree with that too .
but now , as far as what they can do about it , i don 't know .
you can 't make parents be parents
that 's true .
you got to kind of make people want to do the right thing .
you know .
i don 't know how you do that .
i guess if you gave the , gave them jobs ,
that 's another problem with the united states ,
there 's no jobs any more .
yeah .
but .
well , i 've heard this one theory , that if , that if a kid commits a crime , that , uh , instead of the , prosecuting the kid , they prosecute the parent .
or both of them .
that would work to a point ,
now , to put the blame on the parent .
well , that 'd work to a point because some kids are just bad anyway .
i don 't care what you do to them .
yeah .
you know ,
so i think it depends on how much trouble that kid has been in , you know .
yeah .
because a , a , a child can get into anything regar -,
yeah .
i don 't care how good you , they are .
yeah .
eventu -, at least one time ,
but now if this is a repeated thing ,
here with this child in juvenile ,
and or , to me , yeah , both of them .
yeah .
because that means she 's still not doing what she 's supposed to do .
uh -huh .
yeah .
because i just watched it on t v one night on one of them , um , twenty twenty , forty -eight hours , one of them shows where this boy had been stealing cars .
um .
i don 't know if you seen this .
 no ,
i didn 't see it .
  it was a little , it was a little gang of them stealing cars , you know ,
i understand .
and then when they caught him , you know , his mother sitting there ,
now they going to take me away from you .
that meaned she was warned .
yeah .
but see , by that , i think sometimes it 's a little late .
yeah .
you know ,
but i 'm sure there 's something can be done .
yeah .
what about with adults ?
anything do any about   adult crime .
yeah ,
start prosecuting they
but really good instead of having a revolving door on the damn court system .
yeah .
well , for one , a major problem with that is the jails are overcrowded .
well , they should start with , the ,
if they would get rid of .
seems to me , i know there 's a lot about court that people don 't understand .
uh -huh .
there 's more people in jail right now for child support , okay then there are for people doing drugs .
um .
yeah .
you ought to take all them little misdemeanor people let them go ,
yeah .
let them go you know , give them a fine , whatever ,
make them do civic duty whatever ,
 yeah ,
i mean seriously ,
 put them fools in there ,
they ought to put those   people to work .
i call them all fools , idiots , whatever .
yeah .
little rock stars , put all them in there .
um .
you know , the murderers , the drug dealers , the user , put them all in
yeah .
jail you know ,
yeah .
and let all the normal people go you know , because , okay ,
if you write a bad check , you go to jail , right .
yeah .
let them people go .
well .
not let them go and get out of it .
yeah ,
they , you still have to punish them .
yeah .
yeah ,
that 's ,
let them go and pay their crime or their time doing something else you know , like cleaning up the city or however they do their community time , you know , whatever that is
but pu -, don 't put them in jail because they 're not hardened criminals .
yeah ,
and they 're , they 're still , they can provide for society ,
whereas some of them are so far gone that they can 't do anything good for society .
uh -huh .
so .
i don 't know ,
some people , boy , they got ,
i think the united states has got too many problems to be worrying about everybody else .
yeah ,
that 's true .
now how they going to fix it , i don 't know .
i don 't think there is a ready solution .
no ,
i don 't think so either .
uh .
because the economy is down , people , you know , the , the , the low man on the pole is getting more of the , i guess , the bulk of it .
yeah .
and he 's got to work extra hard just to make ends meet .
uh -huh .
and they keep taking more money from us and people are get ,
and they don 't have any incentive to work if we 're just going to take fifty percent of it .
yeah .
might as well steal ,
then they don 't have to pay taxes on it
that 's it .
yeah .
so , you know , they , i , i , i know that 's bad , but , you know , just like texas now .
uh -huh .
they could have had a lottery .
they don 't want a lottery .
why not ?
they 'd have a ,
yeah .
i would rather pay for a lottery a dollar , two , three dollars , whatever i 'm paying , you know a week or whatever , and never see any of that money , than to have them take a portion of my paycheck .
yeah .
because , you know , they take ,
and uncle sam takes his ,
um .
the social security which probably won 't be here when i get that old you know .
because we 're paying for social security they using now .
yeah .
who 's going to pay for mine ?
i don 't know
but it 's , it 's
i 'm not counting on it .
no ,
you don 't count on social security .
yeah .
but , it 's , it 's ,
that 's what i 'm saying ,
they need to do something else .
um .
but .
crime is going to go up as long as the economy stays down .
yeah .
and it 's going to get worse .
yeah .
that 's just like last night they killed them people in that store .
where you at ?
i 'm in raleigh , north carolina .
oh
no wonder you don 't know that .
well , where are you from ?
i 'm in dallas .
okay .
but last night , they killed , uh , uh , four people in a chain food .
oh , man .
and killed them ,
well , it was two stores side by side .
uh -huh .
one was a store and one was like a , a fast food place ,
  chicken or something , i don 't know .
yeah .
anyway , they raped the women , beat them all up , including the women ,
i mean , they just beat them .
stuck them in the freezer and then shot them all .
ow .
why did they do in the freezer ?
why was , you know , why you know , why didn 't they just ,
if they was going to lock them , just lock them in the freezer , take the money , you know .
yeah .
they didn 't have to kill them or rape them , or anything .
um .
um .
that 's awful .
yeah ,
we still get some in raleigh .
uh -huh .
i mean , not not too often real bad ones ,
but .
it 's just getting really ridiculous down here .
i wish i could move somewhere where , this , you know , you got to like in the country .
i don 't think there 's anywhere where there isn 't going to be crimes .
well , i think , if it 's ,
uh -huh .
yeah .
yeah .
the town is smaller and everybody knows everybody it 's harder to come in there and do something .
where is ,
and , and , and see that 's another thing .
neighborhoods aren 't neighborhoods any more .
yeah .
there 's nobody is next door to you ,
you don 't know your neighbors , and stuff like that .
yeah .
it 's just , huh -uh , you know ,
because i moved out some apartments before because they were loaded with drug dealers .
um .
and you didn 't even ,
and what the manager , the manager won 't even do anything .
he 's probably a drug dealer himself
uh -huh .
you never know .
you don 't .
and so i moved ,
wow .
because i moved the day probably a week after one of the apartments blew up you know ,
and this is like across the street .
um .
um .
this was a nice part of town and there across the street one of the apartments blew up because they were having that , making that , um , crack stuff and then , the other time i saw the cops break down somebody 's apartment around the corner .
i say , see , this is it .
time to go .
that 's it ,
and i moved .
yeah .
and , you know , now i live in like a fam -, a neighborhood in a town house ,
but it 's nice .
 i don 't , you know .
 yeah .
i 'm kind of in the same , same kind of deal , town house in a neighborhood .
but ,
it 's pretty nice .
i don 't know how they can live , a neighborhood or apartment complex .
that 's what happen , that 's what wrong ,
you know .
i don 't think , don 't rent to them
yeah .
or rent to them and evict them because they drug dealers .
put it on the lease .
yeah .
if you deal drugs , you can 't live here .
yeah .
most of them are too scared to do anything about it .
uh -huh .
that 's it .
yeah .
all right .
well listen , i got to go .
all righty .
nice talking to you .
and i thank you .
all right .
bye -bye .
bye -bye .
um , all right .
i 've , uh ,
as far as i 'm concerned , i find that the young women have lost so much because they have become more aggressive and more dominating ,
and i think that comes about from their being a definite factor in the job market now .
uh -huh .
oh , well , i tend , i tend to agree .
uh , in some ways i think it 's , uh , i think if anything , a lot of , um , the changes that have occurred , uh ,
in some ways they 're for the better
because i think women should have a choice ,
and i do believe in the , being able to have a choice as to , as far as , what you would like to do with your life .
but by the same token , and i know this for myself because i 've worked and i 've not worked , um ,
that it makes it , uh , sometimes it makes life more difficult .
i think when the roles now are less defined , as far as , you know , what , uh , women should or should not be doing , that it , it , it could make life more difficult .
there are more things to work out .
i know when i was working , you know , you have all these problems with , with the child care and , and with , uh , pleasing , you know , your boss on the job ,
so you have added stresses from there
and then you still have all the things that , um , that you need to do at home
and that doesn 't change , you know ,
just because your going out of the house for so many hours a day doesn 't , uh , make those other things go away
and the other responsibilities are still important .
um ,
so , um , have you , have you worked outside , also and , um , feel that , it , that ,
well , how do you feel , as far as , uh ,
what would be a happy medium
or , or what would you like to see ?
i would like , uh ,
yes ,
i have worked outside of the home
and ,
yes .
i was in one of those safe occupations .
i was a school teacher ,
uh -huh .
and we had one child when i taught for my two year career .
uh -huh
uh , we ,
uh , then i stopped teaching after my husband 's bus -, business was established ,
and we had two children
and i stayed home with those children ,
yes .
and raised those children
and now that my husband has retired , i am back substitute teaching ,
yes .
which if anyone has ever been involved in that , some days it 's fun
and some days you wonder why you 're even bothering ,
right
because your fighting for your life .
but ,
yeah .
but , i am a fighter
and i 've always been a disciplinarian .
uh , i 'm , i 'm not real sure that the young girls of today are being forced into the job market as many of them imply .
i think they 're going in by choice .
oh , i think so .
yes .
yes .
and , and i have no problem with that ,
but i think the male needs to be the dominant person .
and i think too many of the young professional wives in our small town of five thousand , uh ,
uh -huh .
are not letting that happen .
they are very aggressive .
uh -huh .
they 're , uh , they almost have what i would call a killer e -, killer bee instinct .
yeah .
and they have to be in charge .
and ,
uh -huh .
and i th -, i think they lose a lot by what i call neutering their husbands .
None
though , um , um ,
i don 't know .
i ,
the , the one problem i guess i have ,
and maybe what so many women , younger women now are choosing to go outside is ,
i feel that in general , in this society , that being at home is not looked upon as , um , a job in itself .
whereas , you know , you hear a lot of women that are home saying that it is a job in itself ,
but i know when i was working ,
and i was a -, an engineer so i was always with men ,
uh , and they were single , many of them ,
and i tried to explain to them , well , my day doesn 't end when i leave at ,
i used to leave at three ,
uh -huh .
i keep going to eleven at night
and they had , they used to look down on women that were home ,
they 'd say , oh , i bet you go home and ,
you know , at least you get out of here at three
and you can go home and put your feet up and watch soap operas ,
oh , sure
and i used to be infuriated ,
uh -huh .
because they really had no idea what was involved once i got home .
now taking care of them , running them everywhere , helping with homework , the bath , the whole , you know , everything .
um , and i think that one reason that so many younger women feel im -, i -, compelled to go into a profession is that they feel that if they stay home they are not respected ,
huh .
and that being home is not a respectable , uh , position in society .
and , there 's a lot of truth to that
and i don 't know how you feel .
i don 't know how you felt when you were home and what kind of feedback you got ,
but i can see with the younger men that they definitely are looking down upon women that are home .
and yet by the same token , i think some of it is jealousy ,
you , you ,
once in a while , you hear them say things like , i wish i had the choice ,
uh -huh .
you know .
i wish i was the one ,
i would stay home with my kids if my wife would go out and support us ,
if my wife had an education and could support us ,
and the only value i see coming out of ,
uh -huh .
this is that children now in , in a two parent home , they now actually have two parents ,
yeah .
because i see my sons -in -law ,
i have a daughter who 's a nurse
and i have a daughter ,
right .
who 's a beautician .
and i see ,
uh -huh .
my sons -in -law cooking and ,
right .
dropping children off at the sitter and ,
right .
right
picking children up from school and ,
uh -huh .
and having a much better relationship with their children ,
that 's true .
than my husband ever did
because he ,
that 's true .
left home at five thirty in the morning ,
and he got home at six fifteen .
yes .
and , uh , he ate his dinner
and he was asleep in his chair because he was exhausted .
right .
so , now the young fathers are having a chance to parent ,
and i think ,
and they enjoy it .
that 's an advantage .
yeah .
and they do enjoy it .
i ,
uh -huh .
i see ,
you 're right .
i see many more men in the supermarket ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
in the parks with their children ,
and i think that is healthy because ch -,
and i think it 's a , a wonderful advantage for the young , for the , for the , particularly for the males , for the little boys to have ,
right .
oh , yeah .
a relationship with their father ,
and , and i don 't ,
yes .
think you , we get into so much of the mother dominating figure , if , if the father has more input there .
yeah .
but , uh , i don 't understand why the young girls feel like they have to build roads ,
and they have to ,
  .
that kind of job , uh , to go out there and shovel that tar and , and drive those big trucks .
and we just recently finished a long drive through the west , a little over five thousand miles ,
uh -huh .
and at one point we sat down , uh ,
i didn 't realize it ,
but i sat at a counter to have a cup of coffee that happened to be for truck drivers only .
uh -huh .
and here 's this young girl with the tattoos
and she w -, has just , had just driven a load of meat from minneapolis to some place in arizona ,
uh -huh .
and she 'd been ,
and i ask her how old she was
and she was the ag -, between the age of our daughters
and she had been driving ,
uh -huh .
a truck for seven years .
and i thought , gosh ,
i mean ,
yeah .
why would a woman choose that rough and tumble life -style when ,
i guess i 'm s -, i 'm a -, maybe victorian
and my husband is a little bit of a male chauvinist ,
in that ,
he 's a very considerate person ,
but he also thinks a woman should be taken care of and , and in the home ,
and she should vote ,
but after she talks to her husband about how she ought to vote .
oh , boy
now it probably doesn 't work that way in our household because i have strong opinions about things ,
yeah .
too ,
but , uh , i like being taken care of .
i like my luggage ,
well ,
carried and , my door opened ,
and i think the young women are losing that
and i think that 's sad .
well , that , that 's true .
there is that part , too ,
and i guess we also have to examine though
and although your husband 's probably been as much conditioned as , you know , anybody else ,
he was raised in the south ,
um ,
i think that 's a little war condition ,
i guess ha -,
both .
oh , oh , yeah .
and , and you have to , i guess you have to question too , why a lot of the men , especially , i think middle age and older men , why they feel that way
and , and i think it gets scary for them to see change , also .
they 've been used to being , really to be honest , in , in society , and in a way , number one ,
and they come home
and everything 's done for them .
uh -huh .
huh .
and their meal is served
and i think it 's frightening to them to see the roles switching .
sure .
and i think , i think this reaction comes more out of fear .
now , my husband is , um , he 's ten years older than me ,
and ,
but he has , his attitudes are very much pro -women , pro -career , which is kind of interesting .
uh -huh .
he comes from a culture where women are , stay at home and do everything ,
uh -huh .
um , and yet , um , he 's the type that he is willing to have to take on more responsibility , um , if that meant ,
i 'm kind of more ,
None
i 'm kind of more middle of the road .
i think that when children are small , i think it 's okay for women to work especially ,
there should be some , a lot more part time ,
but i think it 's , um ,
i don 't believe in this career , you know , this career drive when , when they 're small , because i think ,
uh -huh .
None
i think that 's very , um , unfair to , to children ,
like , uh , engineers usually work fifty or sixty hours a week ,
uh -huh .
huh .
huh .
i refused to work more than thirty .
uh -huh .
i was part -time
and even that was a rat race ,
huh .
but i think you have to put in perspective , that , you know , when the kids came home from school , i wanted to be here .
i didn 't want , i don 't want a job where i 'm traveling around and an -, i 'm away and , uh ,
so i think you can have both .
it 's more hectic ,
but i think you have to put into perspective what your kids need ,
i think a lot of ,
first then
my problem with the young mothers i -,
talk about the activities that we don 't do
yeah .
i , i don 't have any children ,
so ,
but i , i have a lot of friends with children
and i know they spend a lot of time with them .
which is good , you know .
that 's good to hear .
yeah ,
an , i haven 't , uh ,
well i 've been around a lot of people lately at wo -, at my job that don 't have a lot of values
so , it 's , it 's always nice to see people that like each other ,
and like families that get along with each other and like to do things together .
yeah ,
ye -,
ha -, have a lot of values ,
i love that .
do they have children ?
uh , the one , the most valueless girl doesn 't ,
but she 's married ,
and i , i 'm not quite sure why .
i , i think he said that he 'd give her a big ring and she got married to him .
oh , that 's wonderful
but , it , it 's kind of weighed on me
and then the other day my husband and i met a couple who , who ,
they 're just going to have their first child
and they really like each other .
and they 're real happy with one another
and she says things like , i 'm really glad when he comes home
and there 's not enough time to spend with him in the evening
and ,
oh , that 's neat .
i 'm like , really .
that 's good , you know ,
i like to see that .
yeah .
you know , i have , uh , some friends that , uh ,
first of all , uh , the girls joined ,
they have two girls ,
one joined the girl scouts
and the other was in the brownies
and then the mother got involved as a leader
and then all of a sudden the father was getting involved with doing nature hikes for them and working with the girl scout camp he -, here in dallas and then going out to , uh , betty perot camp and working with the horses and stuff
and they 're gone a lot
and they take their girls
and they go away for weekends and in the winter time even , you know , to do work with the girl scouts
and i think it 's neat .
oh , yeah .
you know , they 've really become very much involved in , in just that one organization ,
which the organization can use the help too .
right .
so , i , i wish i could see more of that , you know .
on sunday we just met , uh , a family ,
we were thinking about getting   cat
and we went over to , uh , lady that breeds them here in town
and , uh , her daughter actually was ,
he -, she said that her husband said to her daughter , you need a hobby ,
so , she chose the cats .
oh .
and you can tell , it 's a family hobby .
the -, they 're all a part of it .
and it was really neat because they all were interested in each other and , and the cats
and they raise champion cats .
so , they 've done really well .
ugh ,
those are neat cats , too .
yeah ,
i 've just learned about that breed .
they 're really nice looking cats .
i have seven cats
but they 're all mongrels
well that 's what we 're going to end up getting
well they 're the ones that need the homes .
oh , yeah .
you know , mine were just all , uh , strays in the neighborhood .
little baby kittens dropped and stuff
and it just kind of built .
one at a time , just kin -,
i couldn 't , you know .
one time two of them came at once
and i can 't turn a hungry cat down .
oh , i know .
so , you know ,
and the last one that i pic -, was here , uh ,
the kids brought him over and said he was injured
and it was winter time
and i said , i just can not have another cat ,
i just can not have another cat
and i looked out there
and he was just laying on my lawn just shivering and all ,
oh !
and i said , i can 't stand it ,
i brought him in so .
those are my children .
we don 't have very many activities
but ,
no ,
i know what you mean ,
our cat hates other cats ,
and , th -, we 've tried to get her to like other cats
and she just , uh , she wants to be around human beings
and she does not want to be around other cats .
so our next , uh ,
we 're going to try it with a kitten and see if her maternal instincts come out .
ha , ha , lots of luck .
is she spayed .
yeah .
oh , yeah ,
real maternal
we 're hoping ,
it 's our last hope
she 'll eventually ,
i mean , mine , you know , i have five males and two females .
everybody 's spayed ,
everybody 's neutered
and we still have a scrap every now and then .
nothing real bad , you know ,
a slap here and there ,
but , uh , they put up with each other
and they will eventually .
he -, her nose will be out of joint for a while
and she 'll hiss and growl and slap every now and then ,
but they 'll , she 'll finally accept it .
you know , they really don 't have any choice
they mi -,
in my household , we have a little bit , of , uh , a fight for whose boss .
i mean a male cats are , are re -, you know , real territorial
and so that 's the big battle here , you know ,
of whose , whose top dog , we -, top cat , i guess .
uh -huh .
you know , but , uh ,
we -, i don -, i don 't know ,
i don 't have a problem with it .
i think they just learn to accept .
and i have two dogs too ,
and they 've slapped the dogs around too
yeah ,
yeah .
every now and then ,
so .
that 's true ,
they 've got to keep them in line .
yeah
but she 'll accept another cat eventually .
as long as you make her feel , uh , like she 's still loved and everything ,
so .
yeah ,
well those   cats were great .
they were fourteen pounds and ,
and they 'r -,
oh , they 're just gorgeous ,
but , yeah ,
it ,
three hundred and fifty dollars for a kitten .
oh my gosh
and i think of those ,
i think of the kittens at the pound .
yeah .
three hundred and fifty dollars
yeah ,
yeah ,
and they are lovely
but ,
None
house payment
right .
that is a lot of money .
yeah ,
and then she 's saying , you know , you can 't let them outside
and you can 't do all this stuff
and i 'm like , ugh , you know .
i don 't let mine out anyway ,
but .
i let two of them out just in the back yard every now and then ,
but my cats are insi -,
i 'm afraid , you know , the neighbors will ,
people throw rocks at them ,
and people run over them
and , i , i just , you know , i just don 't .
i know so -,
and , and now they 've lost the desire .
most of them don 't even try to ge -, you know , to go out .
i just have two that drive me crazy ,
that i let out in the back , you know ,
but i won 't let them get ,
if they start going in the front and stuff , i bring them in .
oh .
you know , i just worry ,
i guess i 'm too protective ,
but , you know .
i see these cats that are wandering around the neighborhood
and too they can catch diseases really easy ,
yeah ,
yeah .
just by touching a nose to another cat they can contac -, leukemia , feline leukemia ,
so .
yeah .
we know we try , try real hard to keep them healthy .
uh , we just bought , uh , acre , a house with an acre to try to , so she 'll have some room to walk around ,
oh , how neat .
and not off of a busy street .
we 're , we 're choosing our house for our cat .
isn 't that bad
people do it for their children
i mean , why not .
oh , them too
well you know , why not ,
why not .
we -, because i , she loves , she 's one of those that loves th -, outside ,
yeah .
and , and she doesn 't go far
but she just wants to be able to have that freedom .
yeah ,
well if you 're off , off , of a , you know , away from a road ,
and .
you 're off of the main road , you said ?
yeah ,
yeah .
away from a road , you know , and you keep an eye on her , it 's probably okay .
i 'm just real ,
i don 't know , i guess ,
i 'm in a neighborhood
and it 's , it 's just real tough on animals here , you know .
yeah ,
it gets hard , especially with the cars .
whe -, i , every time i see one run over i just , you know ,
it makes me sick ,
so , you know ,
oh , i know .
but anyway , we kind of got off the subject of children ,
yeah .
except that i consider them my children
yeah ,
our cats are our kids
or ,
yeah .
i , we , we got married a few months ago
and i 'm like , well why can 't ashley be at the wedding
oh , no .
in , in her little bridesmaid dress
yeah ,
you know , if i could have , i would have .
well i 'm sure it 's been done .
i 'm sure it has been done .
well they have weddings for dogs now and cats
and ,
oh .
you know , they have all that parties for them where they dress up .
i 've seen it in magazines and stuff where you dress your animals up and take them to a par -,
oh , my .
i haven 't gone that far .
i 'm not that bonkers .
no
you know , my cats do not wear clothes ,
an
i , i don 't think they 'd like to .
no .
i put a bow on her one ni -, one day
and jerry just kept saying you are the meanest person
i took a picture of her
and that was all it , all it lasted for .
we -, d -, do any of your friends have , have , uh , older children that they do anything with .
do , do you have friends with older children ,
or do they just all have young kids .
um , yeah ,
all the ones i know ,
my brother -in -law has three young kids seven and on down
and they , they go on family vacations
and , uh , they go , like to go skiing ,
we -, the , the middle girl doesn 't get a whole lot of attention ,
but , uh , this last ski trip they took , uh , she had in -, contracted chicken pox first
and then she spread it to her , her li -, younger sister and her brother
and they got it just at the beginning of the vacation , where she got better .
so , sh -, not only is she the better skier , but she got all the attention , because she got to go out .
i think she planned it .
she 's only five ,
but i think she planned it
and she got all the attention from her dad .
oh , see there ,
she needed that ,
wo -,
oh yeah .
didn 't she .
you know , it must be hard when you have a lot of children ,
i , you know , to ha -, i was an only child ,
my mother was an only child
so , i , you know , i wasn 't raised with brothers or sisters
and i always got all the attention ,
so i wouldn 't know .
i think i would be extremely jealous , or would have been , had there been another child in the family .
yeah ,
it 's , it 's , we can see it work with her ,
tough ,
it must be tough .
she 's frustrated .
yeah ,
yeah .
we -, she , she 's the middle one ?
yeah .
so she 's never been the only one ,
so she really doesn 't even know what it is to be the only one .
right .
yeah ,
that 's tough , you know
so , what do you ,
what 's your opinion on the , our policy down there ?
i don 't think we have one .
i didn 't know we had one either
yeah .
i was going to say it 's kind of hard to have , have an opinion .
we seem to , uh ,
yeah .
whoever screams the loudest or whoever we happen to give the most money to at that particular time we seem to support , without ,
 i don 't , 
 regard whether  it 's a democracy or a anarchy , or anything else .
yeah
the only thing that i pretty much know about is the central american policy where , you know , they 're just trying to , you know ,
military action in panama is the only thing that comes to my mind right now ,
 well , uh , 
 and then , 
yeah .
and then , of course , there was , there was the , uh , in columbia , with the drug lords .
right .
but we just talked a lot .
we didn 't actually do anything .
right .
well , that 's , that 's what i was about to say .
we didn 't do anything .
i 'm actually surprised at anything in central america , along with panama .
i 'm just kind of surprised we did that .
yeah ,
 but , uh , 
 that is ,  that is pretty , uh , risky .
i ,
especially ,
mean ,
after our friend jimmy carter gave it away anyway .
uh -huh .
but i guess they had to finally do something .
actually bush has been better at that than i thought .
uh -huh .
he has a little more d -, a little more of a stand on policy than i thought he would .
i always considered him kind of a wimp .
he takes more risks .
yeah .
reagan is kind of m -, mushmouth .
yeah .
he was .
but , but i guess most of the policy that we 're using now is , uh , a combination of reagan and carter ,   much as , you know , policy makers .
yeah .
it seems that the , the policies of pretty much anywhere , not just in central america , that u s has now is , is , you know , more action than just words , than just rhetoric .
but , you know , if we , we back up what we s -, what we say with actions .
uh , yeah .
we have so far ,
but w -, we , r -,
 i don 't know ,
 really haven 't , 
how long it 's going to last .
of course , we really haven 't taken on the drug lords , yet .
yeah .
i 'd be interested to see if we do that .
well , i don 't think it 's possible because , even though , you know , we 're against them , i don 't think we can go into another country and do something about the other country 's problem .
well , we did in panama .
we did in ,
 yeah .
but , 
 saudi arabia . 
no ,
but see the thing when panama was , uh , the , that , uh , noriega was , uh , was , was , uh , was wanted fo -, either the f b i , by the f b i ,
and therefore , they had a reason
but , to go in and take out the whole drug kingdom would be something totally different because ,
it could be an interesting , interesting problem .
right .
i don 't know if they could do it or not .
did you read tom clancy 's a clear and present danger ?
uh , no .
i didn 't .
i think you need to pick that up and read it .
it 's quite , uh , it 's , it 's quite interesting .
it addresses the problem .
oh , the drug problem ?
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
actually , he , he wrote that prior to the , uh , med -, medellin cartel being exposed .
it was on the stands prior to that time .
it , it 's quite timely .
and either he knows somebody
or he has a real good , a real good imagination
because its , it hits pretty close to home .
yeah .
but i don 't think we 're going to have much of a choice in e -, either central or south america .
i don 't think , uh , i don 't think , the , the , uh , problem about drugs is going to be safe any time soon .
i mean , you know , it , i think it pretty much got sidetracked with , uh , with the panama and , and with the c -, cent -,   middle east problems .
things that , that are important take precedent , precedence over the drugs , i think .
i think , i think the big thing is trying to stop here on the home front
and bef -,
you know , it , it 'll take a little bit of time before they 'll realize that this is failing ,
so they 're going to have to go to the source .
um , yeah .
i think we realize it 's failed .
we just don 't , we just don 't ,
nobody ,
 don 't want to admit it yet . 
 wants to make the , nobody wants  to make the unpopular decision of going in and invading ,
right .
we still , there 's still t -, there 's still too many kennedys and misinvolves and udalls all up there .
yep
yeah .
that 's true .
there 's too many liberals in control .
they can 't agree on anything .
and they have blinders on as far as the policy goes .
as long as somebody 's getting killed , as long as nobody knows about it it 's okay .
but , but the minute it hit , hits the paper then , of course , the kennedys and the misinvolves and the udalls and the , and , uh , the dawes from georgia , all stand up and scream and yell about what a horrible thing it is .
yeah .
of course , these are the same people that also drown blonde , the chappaquiddic , and stuff like that , you know .
huh .
but i guess it automa -,
i guess it 's automatic respective .
depends on how much power you have ,
 yeah .
you know , 
 and who you  know .
the people have a right to know except about what it , about what concerns them .
yeah .
and these are the people that make the foreign policy
and it , it 's probably basically , uh ,
i would not be surprised if the kennedy foundation or some of those don 't have a lot of , uh , financial holdings in , in central and south america .
probably .
considering the kennedys made all their money off bootleg whiskey anyway .
huh .
every time you drink scotch , you 're paying kennedys .
i don 't drink scotch .
good .
don 't ever drink scotch ,
it 's terrible .
i quit drinking scotch when i found out about that ,
but , anyway .
but , uh , as far as , as far as , you know , central and south america , we , our policy pretty much , uh , it depends on who we 're , what government we 're buying down there at the particular time .
yeah .
i ,
 we , 
 think  we 're trying to stay , uh , stay friendly with uh , the , uh , the brazilian and , and argentinean governments because they 're producing so much , uh , agricultural exports .
we ,
yeah .
don 't want to piss them off and have them over produce
and then , because then our economy would be pretty bad .
although we do need to do something about , you know ,
of course , in nicaragua and around there with the sandinistas and the contras , that 's been going on for years .
but then , hell , it 's probably still be going on long after we 're dead .
it 'll still be the same thing .
yeah .
those people down there don 't really ,
i mean ,
i think it 's going to have to get worse before it gets better ,
you know ,
 well , i think basically , 
 the same old cliche . 
they can 't figure out what they want down there .
right .
if you give everybody what they wanted there   is a complete democracy , those people wouldn 't know how to react because they have no education .
right .
and they 'll just pick crooked people again .
and then people , the , the wrong people will just fight their way up to the top again ,
and it 'll all ,
 it 's all tradition . 
 be for nothing . 
it 's all traditional .
they have to ,
you have the ruling class
and you have everybody else .
yeah .
well , i guess that 's about five minutes .
appreciate talking ,
 it was very pleasant .
 to you . 
all righty .
good ,
 hey , what was that book ,
 talking to you . 
what was that book that you were saying to read ,
tom ,
again ?
clancy .
it 's called a clear and present danger .
a clear and present danger .
uh -huh .
he wri -, he 's the one who wrote , uh , red october , a hunt for red october .
okay .
all right .
and i think i -, if you read that , i think you 'll get a real kick out of it .
all right .
thanks a lot .
all righty .
bye -bye .
bye .
um ,
hi
one thing you know that i always think about when i think of public education
cause i went through the public , um , school system of boston ,
uh -huh .
and , uh , i always felt that i graduated high school
and i still didn 't even i , i couldn 't put together a map of the united state .
um .
you know what i mean .
uh -huh .
an yet i felt that i got a good education
and i , i did well in school
but you tell me to name , you know , five continents
an i ,
uh -huh .
couldn 't do it .
i just felt like there were some real basics that are missing from education ,
uh .
and the people are , are leaving school   not even knowing some common sense things .
yeah .
one ,
well , talking about public education , um , i 'm , we 're doing a proposal ,
uh -huh .
it 's , we 're doing it at n c state ,
yeah .
we 're trying to improve the computer science curriculum ,
uh -huh .
so that 's kind of in a higher level
right .
so it 's interesting that you chose that topic
yeah ,
um , did you do through a public school system or private ?
yeah ,
well , i went through private an until ninth grade .
uh -huh ,
did you notice a big difference ?
oh , yeah ,
a big difference .
like in what sense ?
well , um , in , uh , public schools i guess there wer -, there are a lot of , of , you know ,
people can take lower level courses an get away with learning nothing .
uh -huh .
but , um , private school you couldn 't do that ,
uh -huh .
you had to learn .
yeah ,
i work in a temporary agency
an they 're people that come in , you know , every day to fill out an application ,
uh -huh .
and they 'll have to bring somebody with them ,
and they will show that they completed , um , four year of high school ,
yet when it comes to even answering the questions on a simple application ,
uh .
they can 't read enough to be able to fill out the answers by themselves ,
that 's bad .
it 's just incredible .
yeah ,
our state cut a whole bunch of a , i think it 's ten million dollars out of the school budget .
really .
so they 're making all kind of cuts
in college people cannot , i mean , the teachers can 't make tests any more ,
and th -, the library canceling all of it 's subscriptions .
yeah .
it 's pretty sorry .
i know ,
um , they , uh ,
i forget
i think it 's , um , some place in new york because they 're having budget problems ,
uh -huh .
they 're closing the libraries .
i mean they 're not getting rid of any of the sports ,
uh .
or anything like that ,
they 're not cutting in any other corner
they 're closing the libraries .
that to me shows a little , uh , switch in priorities .
yeah .
you know .
so do you go to college right now ?
are yo -,
yeah ,
it 's my last year
you 're a , so you 're a senior now .
yeah ,
i 'm working on my projects trying to graduate
oh , good for you .
yeah .
that 's great ,
um , is , is n c university is that , uh , state ,
n c state .
what did you say ?
n c state .
n c state ,
that 's a state university then .
yeah .
i see .
and you 're from there also ?
well , yeah ,
i was , uh , i was born in wylie
and then i lived in   ,
uh -huh .
most of my life .
i see .
and now i 'm back here going to school .
well , pretty soon it 's going to get to the point where no one is going to be able to afford to send their kids to college or to do go to college .
yeah .
it 's just a outrageously expensive .
luckily state is one of the cheap ones .
oh is it .
yeah .
well , still though
i mean , you know , thousands of dollars ,
yeah , state 's not that bad
oh , well , that 's good .
yeah .
that 's good .
i went to a private university
and , um , i don 't know
i look back now
and i , i think that i probably would have done it differently if i , um , you know , could do it over again .
yeah .
but , um , i have a lot of friends that went to state schools or didn 't even go to school , some , some of them ,
and i still feel like they came out knowing just as much as i did .
i really do
and that 's probably a pretty sad thing to say
but , um ,
yeah ,
i don 't know ,
i ,
where did you go ?
i
what ?
where did you go ?
i went to brandice university .
uh -huh .
it 's in massachusetts .
and , um , i really felt like i 've been working now for about four years ,
uh -huh .
and i , i feel like what i 've learned working is a hundred times more valuable then what learned in school .
oh .
and i know that i 'm drawing a lot of what i learned in school , you know ,
i , i probably just subconsciously rely a lot on , on art .
but , um , i don 't know
my sister 's a principal at a school ,
and one thing she 's trying to instill in kids , um , besides just reading and writing are just some , the golden rules ,
uh -huh .
she calls them just some basics about , um , you know , you don 't take what 's not yours ,
uh , and if you want to , you know , you don 't touch anybody else unless you have their permission .
like no hitting , you know ,
uh -huh .
no pulling hair or anything like that ,
and , uh , the school that she 's in is a , um , it 's basically for minorities ,
um , there 's a large minority population .
and , um , she 's really noticed that even some of the teachers that work there
i think they don 't value that type of student as much as you get ,
yeah
that 's ,
in some .
sorry .
that they , that they like pick on th -, the advanced students and pay more attention to them ,
yeah ,
it 's true .
ignore the others .
uh -huh .
yeah .
and i don 't know if it makes them feel better
i mean the do teachers get ,
i mean personally i would get more satisfaction out of taking someone that wasn 't as successful .
yeah .
and seeing what they could do verses somebody that did excel in , in areas and just watching them get better , you know .
yeah .
that 's not much of a challenge .
that 's true .
but ar -, do you have any ideal what you 're going into when you graduate .
um , graduate school
oh yeah .
yeah .
do you know where you 're going ?
i think i 'm going to chappel hill .
where 's that ?
that 's in chappel hill
that 's the name ,
oh is that north carolina ?
yeah .
oh , okay .
never heard of the , uh , tarheels ?
no ,
i don 't know that area .
the a c c tarheels , u n c ?
i just don 't know it .
oh , uh ,
i don 't get down there very often .
they won the final four ,
oh , really ,
in boy 's basket ball .
well the way i pick the final four was , um , by the state that had the warmest climate .
uh -huh .
so that 's how i chose all mine ,
so you can tell that i really didn 't have that much to do with any of it .
but ,
so obviously you 're into education .
yeah .
if you can be going ,
my husband went to , is in graduate school actually right now .
uh -huh .
and , uh ,
i don 't know
i give you a lot of credit .
i couldn 't do it ,
i ,
yeah ,
i know .
i couldn 't wait to graduate and have ,
oh .
it be all over .
i can 't wait to graduate either ,
i know .
now .
i 've got all of this stuff due
oh wow .
overloaded .
yeah ,
i kind of know what you mean .
well , it was really nice talking to you .
all right .
okay .
good luck .
all right ,
thank you .
all righty ,
take care .
all right ,
bye .
bye -bye .
None
well , as much as i 'd , uh , i 'd like to say that i 'll be looking for a flashy convertible or , uh , or a four by four or something ,
i guess the next car i 'll be looking for is a kind of a plain old four door
what kind of a car do you have now ?
oh , we 've got a , uh , an older delta eighty -eight ,
and then , uh , our , our newer car is a , uh , a corsica .
yeah .
and we 'll probably be looking for something about that , uh , that same style .
yeah .
that same kind of four door , hard top style .
you got kids ?
uh , no
but we 're planning for it .
okay .
so , uh , in fact , uh , our oldsmobile is a , is a like an old delta eighty -eight
but it 's in pretty good sh -, in really good shape .
yeah .
and we 've been really pleased with oldsmobiles .
yeah .
so that 's probably where the first place we 'd look .
huh .
but , uh ,
well , we 've always had , uh , fords .
uh -huh .
uh , mostly because my wife 's stepfather works at a ford dealership
that 'll do it .
yeah .
that 'll do it .
um , but , yeah , we 're , we 're in the same shape .
yeah .
i think our next car will be a , you know , some big old four door , uh , something that can haul the kids to baseball practice and piano lessons ,
and we 've got a minivan ,
uh -huh .
and that 's great .
and i d -, drive , uh ,
well i used to drive an escort ,
but it died on me .
so i , i mean i , i , i used to run it , i , uh , where we used to live , i used to commute a hundred and forty miles a day .
oh , geez .
and , uh , and this escort took it all .
and it , it , it got up to , uh , uh , i was at ninety -four thousand miles on it ,
and the engine just went .
uh -huh .
so i , i , i bought a used , uh , dodge aries ,
yeah .
which has been okay .
really ?
i , i mean i 've haven 't had it that long .
uh -huh .
but it , it al -, it 's an eighty -five aries ,
but it only had thirty -four thousand miles on it when i bought it .
oh , geez .
and i just , you know , i just drive it to work .
so it 's just a ten minute commute every day .
uh -huh .
so , uh , it doesn 't get much of , uh ,
i mean , it 's not like i 'm putting it through its paces .
yeah ,
yeah .
but i think , uh ,
and it 's a four door which is nice ,
uh -huh .
but it 's still a little cramped .
i 've got three kids ,
yeah .
so i , i ,
sounds like you , you need at least like a taurus size ,
yeah ,
that 's what ,
or something like that .
i was thinking of ,
was a taurus .
uh ,
yeah .
i , i know a lot of guys at work ,
they , uh , the ones that have , uh , families , uh ,
and they still want kind of a sports car .
they 've been , uh , a lot of them have been getting these taurus s h o 's .
oh , really ?
that i guess it 's the sports version of the taurus ?
yeah
in fact , it comes with a standard stick
and , uh ,
ooh .
and a lot of those .
and it comes with a bigger engine and the things like that .
but , uh ,
yeah .
and usually they 're in like black ,
and gun metal grey and those kind of colors .
you 're not going to see too many , uh , you know , green ones or blue ones or anything like that .
yeah .
they , they put them in sporty colors i guess .
but , uh ,
yeah .
well , my wife wants a miyata .
oh , well sure
that 's what , you know ,
until , until you look at the price tag
right .
and then you go , what ?
right ,
yeah .
what would i , besides tooling around and looking really cool and having a lot of fun , what would i really do with this car ?
i know ,
i know .
it 's like i , i guess i could fit in it
yeah .
i ,
maybe
i went , i went through that when i first got out of , uh , college .
i had an old car that i bought just to get to , to my j -, my first job .
yeah .
and when i got there , the first thing i did was trade it in on a spitfire .
oh .
and i , i knew that was going to be the only time i could afford a two seater , uh , sports car .
yeah .
but that , that just does not make it as an only car .
it 's , uh , it 's like i , i would ,
yeah .
i bought a set of stereo speakers and it was one of those cash and carry deals .
i had to take them one at a time ,
with the top down .
oh , no !
and it was winter , so i was in like this coat with the top down ,
and the speaker in the passenger seat .
yeah
and i drove that one home ,
and then i went back and got the other one and put that in the ,
passenger seat and drove that one home .
and , uh , funny , funniest sight .
yeah .
and da -, you kind of outgrow that real quick when it 's your only car .
yeah .
well , i ,
you know , it 's funny .
most people that i 've talked to did stuff like that when they were in college ,
uh -huh .
or , you know , or when they were single anyway .
yeah .
they 'd , they 'd buy themselves a sporty car because it was their last .
i never did that .
uh , you know , my first car was a toyota corolla .
oh , really ?
yeah .
and , uh , because i got a good deal on it and , uh , that was a great little car .
actually i met ,
that 's how i met girls was , i 'd find out if a girl could drive a manual transmission , which i , i had never ,
i , i 'd learned on an automatic transmission .
uh -huh .
and so , so i 'd go out on dates where they would teach me how to drive this car .
boy , that 's a good deal .
and , uh , in fact i married one of those people
ah , okay .
and it worked .
well , i 'll have to remember that if i ever get in that situation again
yeah ,
it worked all right , real good .
huh .
because i , i know we 've , uh ,
that 's , that 's something that , that we definitely have to go with is an automatic transmission .
my , uh , my wife just does -, can 't , can 't , uh ,
she really doesn 't want to learn i guess ,
yeah ,
yeah .
the , uh , the standard shift .
i fact , i , i remember once we , uh , we , uh , went , uh , went on a , uh , test drive .
yeah .
we got one of these things from lee iacocca that said , you know , i 'll give you a fifty dollar savings bond if you 'll test drive a car .
yeah .
and we went , uh , we went , uh , we went to a dealership
and , uh , it , it was prev -, she , she did pretty well .
yeah
but it was one of those things where we just went to a big parking lot and the , uh , dealer kind of gave her standard shift parking ,
because that was all it was .
it was , it was the funniest thing ,
it was like , uh ,
a big le baron ,
it was a le baron with everything on it ,
wow !
but it had a standard shift .
that 's weird !
it was the craziest thing i ever saw .
yeah .
and , and , and that 's probably why they were trying to sell them , i guess .
huh .
and , uh , we just kind of went back and forth and back and forth .
she did pretty well after a while .
yeah .
but , uh , it 's just kind of hard to learn , i guess .
well , my wife ,
i mean , she 'd always driven standard transmission .
uh -huh .
and , uh , and ,
in fact all our earlier cars were a standard transmission .
in fact , the minivan 's a , has a stick shift .
um , okay .
and in ,
this dodge aries is the first car we 've ever gotten that had anything .
you know , it 's got automatic transmission , cruise control ,
oh , geez .
you know , electric locks .
you know , it 's like , it 's like a luxury car except that it 's the dodge aries
yeah ,
you know .
yeah .
so , uh ,
oh , well .
well , i guess that 's , i guess that 's about all i 've got to say ,
about cars
well , you , um ,
the , the thing about this , uh , th -,
i will say this about the minivan .
uh -huh .
we thought that was a luxury car when we bought it .
uh -huh ,
i would think so ,
yeah ,
it , it ,
because it 's so big .
yeah .
and , and it was quiet ,
it had a stereo system .
oh , yeah .
we never had it , you know ,
we always had the a m radio .
sure ,
sure .
and , uh , of course this has , this   that had s -, speakers that you can control from the back seat .
uh -huh .
and you can change the channels on the , on the radio from the back seat too
uh -huh .
and put s -, speaker phones in it .
so .
now , now , now that used to be a luxury ,
but i bet on the next time you buy a car , that 's going to be mandatory .
right .
you 've got to have that now .
that 's right .
that 's right .
you 're used to it
and you got to have it .
and you 've got to pay for it too .
yeah .
that 's true too .
it ,
and i bet , and i bet it costs twice as much as , as when i bought mine
it probably does ,
it probably does .
but , uh ,
we ,
oh , well .
well , bill it 's been nice talking to you .
nice talking to you .
okay ,
you have a good evening .
thanks a lot .
um .
bye -bye .
bye -bye
what kind , h -,
what kind of cars do you , do you usually drive ?
right now we , i 've got a , uh , four year old subaru and a two year old honda .
oh , my goodness .
well , we 're , we 're , we 're sort of , sort of a general motors family ,
i guess that 's the way we were raised .
and , uh , uh , we were overseas with t i for a number of years
and when we came back we suddenly find out we 've got five licensed drivers in the family .
oh , goodness .
yeah ,
and four cars
and we bought some year old cars from national car rental .
really ?
at least two of them .
we bought an olds calais and a buick skylark .
uh , for , you know ,
they each had twenty -one thousand miles or something like that .
uh -huh .
turns out that 's a pretty good place to buy cars because they maintain them
and they can show you the records they 've gotten all their maintenance on schedule and everything like that .
uh , then we 've got an eighty -six chevy spectrum that we bought new .
my daughter was a freshman in college when we bought it for her .
uh -huh .
and we 've got a eighty -four toyota that we bought used .
so we 've got four cars for our five licensed drivers .
it 's like musical chairs
i bet .
you 're one short .
i bet .
and , uh ,
but you know , it 's interesting the two ,
even though my dad was a chevrolet man forever and ever and ever
and we were in the retail milk business
and he had all chevrolet milk trucks
and , and we bought automobiles and all that ,
it was almost like
and a chevrolet dealer was our friend
and it was almost like the minute we got old and bought anything like a , but a chevrolet it would be like going and spitting on his grave
but , uh ,
yep .
as we got older and got away ,
and then we thought , well , you know , you still could buy general motors products
and it was probably not that bad .
but , uh , we lived in malaysia for t i in nineteen , uh , eighty -one , two , three , and four .
uh -huh .
and , and , of course you don 't buy general motors products over there
no .
but we bought a volvo
and i have never had a car that i 've loved more .
i just can 't afford them here .
uh , but i , i just loved that car .
uh -huh .
and , uh , we bought a , uh ,
we lived in the philippines for t i in eighty -five , eighty -six , and eighty -seven
and we bought a , uh , ford telstar ,
which is somewhat similar to the taurus .
it 's sold in , uh , in uh , the far eastern coun -, uh , far east countries more than here .
uh -huh .
but we really liked that .
and have you had experience with cars other than the ones you have ?
well , yeah
we had , uh , we had ,
these are the first cars that my husband and i have ever purchased ourselves .
um .
the others were hand me downs through the families .
yeah .
and those were always g m cars .
yeah .
uh , buicks and chevrolets .
uh -huh .
and , uh , we were real happy with them ,
but all the ones that we ever had were the , you know , eight cylinder ,
oh , yeah .
really rugged ,
the b -, the big ,
g m cars .
yeah .
and all we had heard was , was a lot of negative press about the smaller cars ,
and we both drive , well , forty -five miles round trip every day .
sure ,
sure .
and so we wanted a smaller car ,
yeah .
when we got ready to buy , we needed a smaller car to get better gas mileage
and quite frankly , we were afraid of the , of the g m small cars .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
you know , as far as durability .
right .
so we kind of ,
when we had our larger cars , we didn 't mind , uh , keeping them up ,
uh -huh .
you know , doing the maintenance and everything on them as long as we didn 't have to do it very often .
yeah .
but , once they got over a hundred thousand miles on them , all of them , you know ,
it just kind of seemed to be the magic number for them
yeah ,
yeah ,
it seems that something goes every month .
yeah
it ,
and i 'm afraid we 're going to be in that in another year with all of ours ,
you know ,
we got three eighty -sixes and an eighty -four
uh -huh .
and we 'll probably be there with all of them .
you know , it 's the same thing , you know ,
i don 't know whether , uh , you classify the skylark and the calais as ,
well i guess they 're intermediate .
uh -huh .
uh , but , uh , we went on a family trip to massachusetts
and there were five of us
and five , five of us never go anywhere together here .
every -, everybody 's heading off in their own direction .
right .
and i rented a buick le sabre ,
uh -huh .
and it 's the first big car i had since i had my nine passenger impala station wagon from seventy -six to eighty .
and it made all the ,
i , i had forgotten what driving a big car was like .
it 's like a yacht .
it was just nice .
it floated .
yeah .
what ,
we , we sold or we , we traded in our le sabre for our subaru .
oh , yeah .
yeah ,
it was a great car .
yeah .
it just ,
we ran the wheels right off of it .
yeah ,
yeah ,
yeah .
and , uh , you know i 've read ,
i 'm in the quality business at t i ,
i 'm a quality manager
and we 're , we 're uh , we deal ,
we sell ,
i 'm in the semiconductor group
and we sell to , uh , ford , chrysler and g m , uh , g m delco .
uh -huh .
and there is a , amazing ,
i am just , uh , really impressed with the , with the quality consciousness that the , tho -, these companies have put into their procurement
and it 's , i , it 's come out as a result of the competition from the japanese .
uh -huh .
and , uh , uh , i
and , you know , we used to think ford products were tinny .
i mean i was growing up ,
i was taught when i was growing up , you know , that , that that real people bought general motors products ,
and peons bought ,
that 's right .
ford products .
but just with the quality requirements that ford is putting on us and the way they come into our plants
and they 're really , uh , uh , stressing this partnerships in quality ,
and you know , g m and chrysler are doing that ,
but i really think ford 's got a leadersi -, ship position in this right now .
and i think it 's showing up in their automobiles .
their automobiles are getting a very good quality reputation right now .
uh -huh .
and , uh , uh , we went to , uh , austin a while back to a basketball tournament
and we were going to be meeting some of my wife 's relatives down there ,
so we decided rather than drive one of our cars down , we 'd rent one ,
uh -huh .
and we went up to the local budget
and we were going to get a olds eighty -eight or something .
he said i 'll tell you what , for a dollar a day more i 'll give you a lincoln town car .
um .
and we drove that down
and i hated to turn that back in .
i bet
we had that for three days .
and i absolutely loved ,
except i couldn 't want to have to park it in tight places all the time .
no .
uh ,
i wouldn 't want to have to pay for the gas , either .
but i absolutely loved that automobile .
and , you know , it wasn 't that i 'd ,
driving around down there we might have got sixteen to eighteen miles per gallon ,
but on the trip down and back i filled up both coming and going
so i knew what i actually got on the trip
and it was about twenty -four miles a gallon .
uh -huh .
uh , and , you know , we just got it out on the highway and put it in cruise control at about sixty and let it , let it float .
uh -huh .
and , it was pretty nice .
are , are ,
  .
are you planning on getting any additional or other cars ?
no time soon .
uh , we 're , our , our , we won 't have any more licensed drivers for about thirteen years .
um .
oh , yours is small .
yes .
so , we , uh , so we don 't plan on purchasing any more any time soon .
both of our cars are getting ,
um .
oh , around sixty thousand miles on them .
oh , yeah .
we drive a lot .
yeah .
you got another , another thirty or forty thousand if you maintain them .
uh -huh .
uh , we 've got ,
probably we 'll get something in the next couple years .
my son will graduate from high school this year ,
and , and he 's going to go to richland college one year behind us ,
uh -huh .
it 's right ,
in fact , uh , our house is adjacent to the richland property .
he wants to go to texas tech
and he 's probably going to have to go to richland a year to get some grades in order ,
but , uh , the next year when he goes out to tech , he wants a pickup ,
and i want ,
a pickup
a pickup .
i may get one and not let him have it
but , we have been looking at these red chevro -,
they , they 're very popular around here .
uh -huh .
these , uh , uh , red chevy pickups ,
and , uh , we 'll probably do something like that ,
uh , uh , incidentally ,
uh , uh , i don 't know ,
uh , the , uh , the credit union has got a deal now where you decide what you want
and you call this number
and , uh , they go negotiate the price for you .
uh -huh .
and , and , or , or send you to a guy with whom they 've already got a deal and , uh , my boss just bought a chevy pickup
and he got three thousand dollars off the sticker price doing it this way .
really ?
yeah .
and , uh , uh , you know , you , you figure out the options , go around look at the dealers and get the best price you can and then go call this guy and , and tell him what you want
and he 'll put you in touch with a certain guy , a certain person at that dealer 's place .
uh -huh .
so i 'm going to try that the next time i buy one .
i think that would be a good idea .
and , and , so , you know , i can go around and comparison shop and see if i can get a better negotiation on my own .
but , once , one thing that 's a pain in the neck buying automobiles is negotiating .
yeah .
i 've , we 've , we 've , we 've kind of been the types that will say , this is what we intend to spend ,
yeah .
this is the car we want ,
will you sell me this car for that price .
and for that price .
and , and we 've had
we , with our ,
when we bought our subaru , the guy was like , you can 't do this to me ,
and we 're were just , like , okay fine , we , we won 't then .
we 'll go somewhere else .
yeah .
you know .
i mean he 's like , no , no , no .
yeah .
but ,
and , uh , and i , i think that 's probably the way you 've got to do it .
when , when i was young , i went in and bought a , uh , or made a deal on a sixty ,
this is nineteen sixty ,
uh -huh .
i 'd first come to texas , and made a deal on a sixty red impala convertible that i just loved ,
uh -huh .
and this guy gave me this deal , you know ,
i told him how much i wanted to pay ,
and for every fifty dollars he 'd have to go in and check with the boss
and then i 'd have to sign something saying that if he could get this rate , uh , we would go ahead and buy .
uh , uh , if he could get this rate i promised to buy
and i left there on a saturday afternoon just totally exhausted .
uh -huh .
i , i was only twenty -five years old or something i , i left there
and i , i , uh , i 'd never done this before because i 'd always bought my previous cars from the guy my dad bought his milk trucks from ,
and , uh , uh , so i , i got back
and a salesman that lived in the apartment had , asked me , uh , uh , if ,
he 'd heard i was going to get a car , and asked me what i paid for it .
he said , well , hey , uh , before you go buying anything ,
he says call this friend of mine at will 's point .
there was a guy that owned a chevrolet dealership up there .
uh -huh .
and i called the guy and made an appointment to come up monday morning
and just driving fifty miles out of town , it was a difference ,
and , i mean it was a difference of four hundred dollars ,
but this was four hundred dollars on only twenty -five hundred ,
goodness .
is all we paid for cars in those days .
and , uh , uh , so i called back the guy in dallas
and i told him that ,
i 'd left him a check for tax , title and license and everything ,
and i said i want to cancel my order and , and don 't try to cash the check because i 'm going to , i 've stopped payment on it already
and he says oh , somebody 's taking ,
he said what did you get a deal for , bill .
and i told him ,
he says , somebody 's taking you for a ride .
and i said , no somebody took me for a ride last saturday
that 's right .
and , uh , uh , and i , i find that , uh ,
and for the longest time then i drove up to will 's point
and , and the , and the fellow died since then ,
and , and some of his relatives have taken over the business
and that ,
but
and , since then i had
okay ,
well yes ,
we do have pollution in houston
and it ,
how bad is it ?
do you have smog like they do in california ?
well it , it
some ,
i think it depends on , uh , you know , what the , ho -, the cloud cover
and like right now , it 's , uh , it 's kind of overcast , you know ,
just , it 's hot ,
uh -huh .
and the sun is trying , tries to shine through
but it 's , it 's holding in this , this pollution
and i ,
it depends on whether you have some sort of temperature inversion , i take it .
i think so ,
and , uh ,
yeah .
and we have , uh , pasadena , texas which is sort of between here an , you know , heading toward galveston ,
i mean it 's still part of , it 's part of the houston metroplex .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
what do you think is your primary cause of it .
well , i think it 's industry
and i think it 's cars .
you do ?
you really think cars contribute a lot now that they 've taken lead out of gas ?
i don 't , i ,
well maybe not ,
but , it , it sure , it sure , se -,
you know , it ,
i , i know that when i 'm , when i 'm behind a car
and , uh , sometimes , uh , i can really smell especially diesel and things like that ,
uh -huh .
you know , comes right into my air conditioner
and , you know , my head and my fa -,
i 'm so stopped up right now ,
um ,
my goodness .
i don 't know if it 's , uh , if it 's partly from what 's blooming , you know , right now , pollen and stuff like that ,
that 's part of it ,
but , um .
uh -huh .
i think a lot of it 's industrial .
i also think , uh , that , uh , there is a certain amount that comes from automobiles
but it 's mostly from older automobiles .
i don 't think the newer automobiles are as polluting , uh , frankly .
uh -huh .
i think that , uh , i think that , uh , uh ,
if , uh ,
i , i , i heard a story a while back
something to the effect that if they could just pay to get twenty percent , or , take all the cars off the road that have been , uh , manufactured say before nineteen seventy -five ,
uh -huh .
that they could cut the automobile pollution by over fifty percent just by getting rid of those cars that are still left remaining .
yeah .
you mean , uh , fifty percent pollution total from that comes from ,
from , from cars
that is , not , not total but just from cars ,
okay .
oh , uh -huh .
so , that i think would be tremendous help .
but i happen to drive an old model car because it 's very economical
and it just keeps getting , uh , gives me good service
and i don 't have an incentive to get rid of it as long as it keeps running good and not costing me any money .
uh -huh .
on the other hand i know it 's a much more polluter than any of the newer model cars i have .
uh -huh .
but i don 't have any incentive to get out of it until it dies .
right .
and , uh , that may be part of the problem .
als -,
do you all have pollution in your co -, part of the country , uh , from industry ?
yeah ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
oh , uh , yeah ,
it 's , it 's , uh , pretty heavy up here i think
but i think it 's mostly industrial , is what i really , uh , believe is the , the main problem .
and , and , uh ,
and , uh , uh , people , uh , i don 't think are paying as close attention to it in this area as they frankly should .
i , i we , we seem to have a high , uh , cancer rate up here in maryland .
really ,
yeah ,
and , uh ,
like what ki -,
any particular kind or just all kinds ?
well , for instance breast cancer seems to be pretty rampant
and , uh , i think ,
of course prostrate cancer 's sort of bad for everybody ,
but , uh , th -, this state was like the second ,
my wife 's a registered nurse ,
and i think this state was like second this year from the top , in terms of , uh , cancer rate for just all kinds .
and i can 't help but believe that 's not partially caused from pollution .
i just don 't know exactly what it necessarily is ,
but i just can 't believe it is .
um .
now we have a lot of pollution being caused by cloruph -, uh , fluorocarbons which is the , like freon twelve and freon twenty -two .
they use freon twenty -two in air conditioning systems in houses and the like and heat pumps ,
uh -huh .
and they use freon twelve in car air conditioners
and that 's also what 's causing our atmosphere to lose it 's ozone layer .
uh -huh .
and i can 't help believe if it 's sufficient enough to make the atmosphere lose it 's ozone layer , that it 's not acting as a pollutant in our lungs also ,
and having all kinds of effects ,
and .
well what can we do about the , the , the , the air conditioning problem ?
well they 're working now ,
i know dupont and dow and several other chemical companies are working , uh , feverishly to try to come up with a substitute for fluorocarbons ,
uh -huh .
and who ever does is going to make , uh , a mint .
because if they ever come up with a reasonable working agent in place of fluorocarbons , then , uh ,
is that also what 's in , uh , hairsp -, aerosol ?
well they used to be ,
but they made them take it out of that .
even , so , so the aerosol is still aerosol ,
right .
but it doesn 't have anything that 's damaging .
no ,
they , they , they passed a law and made them take the fluorocarbons out of the aerosol containers ,
uh -huh ,
well that 's good .
and that was a move in the right direction .
we are doing some things to try to correct the problem .
but there are more things we could do
and getting rid of old cars , like i said is one way to help correct the problem .
uh , uh , just trying to i think be careful , uh , with the way you handle garbage ,
i notice in this state ,
i don 't know if you 're doing it in texas yet or not ,
but in this state we have special containers now we have to put all our cans and bottles and plastic pieces , uh , you know , containers in ,
yeah .
here , they 've just started , started doing that ,
it 's , it 's , you know ,
you 're not , you don 't have to ,
but m -, you know ,
i know i am .
i save ,
yeah ,
well we are doing it pretty religiously in our group too .
but they , uh ,
in one of the counties here , they 're actually doing a trial program of having a trash police .
they have a lady that goes around like a meter maid
and she spot checks people 's trash .
no kidding ,
really ,
oh .
and if they find a bottle or a can or anything like that in your trash ,
is that right .
they 'll fine you fifty bucks i think the first time and two fifty the second time .
well , we need to do something ,
we need to get serious about it .
yeah ,
you ,
right ,
you 've got to get people to see i -,
and surprisingly enough just handling of trash , uh , can cut pollution , uh , from , uh , uh , from just throwing it in a dump , or , or , or , where ever else they used to do with it , maybe used to burn it .
they 've stopped that up here too .
uh -huh .
but that , that will cut pollution too .
because you get a lot of out gassing from these things , i think , decaying and tr -, and trying to ,
for instance cans and bottles , they never go away at all .
uh -huh .
but on , on the other hand , i don 't guess they 're polluting .
but plastic containers and the like , uh , they may be ,
i 'm not sure of that .
how much does , uh , planting more trees and things like that help ?
oh i think that 's very important to do .
  too .
i , i really think that , uh , trying to get along with your environment and help it out is a very , very important thing .
uh -huh .
and , uh , that can help to cut pollution , i guess some .
i , i don 't know how much trees actually act as filtering agents in terms of pulling various pollutants or chemicals out of the air .
i would hope that they would help some , though .
that 's for sure .
i think , uh , it seems like there was something going on , around here , that , you know ,
we have all these chemical plants and oil refineries and those kind of things and that they burn off a lot of stuff ,
uh -huh .
and some of the stuff that they weren 't supposed to do that somebody found out , you know , like in the middle of the night , they would go ahead and do it anyway .
i think they got caught .
oh good .
but i wonder how much of that kind of stuff , you know , goes on .
well that , uh , that i think may go on a lot
and the primary reason i think it may go on a lot is just as you said , somebody happened to stay up late at night or something .
i don 't think we have a adequate policing , uh , particularly on industry .
uh , we have good policing , at least in this state and , and several of the surrounding states and probably yours too , of car pollutants
because we have to go down , uh , once a year here in maryland and get out car 's exhaust systems checked for emission content .
uh , we have to , uh , we have to have a state inspection every year .
uh -huh .
do you all have that ?
uh , no ,
we don 't have a state inspection ,
so ,
which i ,
i don -,
i would assu -,
but any time you sell a car or buy a car it has to be inspected in this state .
so i 'm assu -, i 'm assuming that , you know , they check , they check everything for safety
or ,
i don 't know ,
uh , that 's something that you 'd have to just check with your authorities .
but in this state we have to , uh , pay eight dollars and a half and go to a , an emission station once a year and get every one of our cars checked that are , have been made starting in nineteen seventy -three .
but that 's all they check for ,
they don 't check how good ,
if your tires are good enough or your brakes are good enough .
no ,
no ,
we don 't have inspections like that .
now , i 'm in maryland ,
in virginia they check that every two years , i think .
we do that ev -, every year .
and i think that 's a good idea too ,
not , no -, not that it necessarily has anything to do with cutting pollution necessarily ,
but i think it 's a good idea .
the emission check , though , is required in maryland
and it 's also required in virginia , uh , a sister state to , to this one .
and that 's , that goes a long ways towards cutting pollutants .
well i 'll have to check ,
i 'm not sure if , if our state inspection ever -,
once a year has to do , you know ,
if they check the , uh ,
uh -huh ,
well if they don 't i would imagine in time they 'll get a law with . i -, get around to it ,
and if they don 't then that 's something i would certainly , uh , uh , suggest you be willing to uh , uh , be for in terms of , uh ,
oh , i would
yeah ,
yeah .
i 'm for anything that cleans up the air or the water or , or , or anything .
oh yeah ,
i , i agree .
now that 's another area we haven 't even discussed
and that is water pollution and various of the other types of , uh , of , uh , like food pollution .
i mean you , you hardly ever hear , hear anybody say anything about food pollution .
but i think there we have a pretty good handle on inspection of foods in this countries ,
so , uh , hopefully we 're not ingesting too much in the way of , uh , pollutants in our food .
but water pollution , uh ,
i 've worried , especially the last few years about just how good the water supply we have in this country is for drinking and the like .
uh -huh .
i know a lot more people are going to bottled water .
well
and that 's not necessarily the answer either
because they 've found out that that 's just comes out of somebody 's tap .
yeah ,
tap ,
yeah
so ,
but a lot of these , uh ,
some of this
well , you know , a lot of people have well water ,
in fact in this area too
and , an , you know ,
and , uh ,
uh -huh .
if you don 't get it tested you don 't necessarily know what you 're , what you 're drinking
and i , i know a lot of people , you know , have that
and , you know , you have to wonder if that , you know could have an adverse affect on them too ,
yeah .
if they don 't , i -, they don 't get it checked .
yeah ,
i 'm absolutely for drinking water out of wells as long as you first of course , have it checked
because it seems , uh ,
when i was a kid growing up down south , uh , i used to go out in the country where my grandparents were
and we had a well ,
it was one of those draws that ,
i forget what you call those things ,
uh -huh .
and , and that was some of the best tasting water ,
i mean , i can still to this day taste that water .
when we were ,
when i was growing up i lived in huntsville , alabama ,
yeah .
and their water supply came from , uh , spring .
uh -huh .
and it was like ice cold , spring water
and i guess parts of the , the city still ha -, you know , get that ,
but , uh , that was , that was really wonderful .
oh , i bet it was .
it was really , really good .
yeah ,
the -,
once it 's been filtered an if it 's a deep enough well , filtered through all the earth and everything i think that , uh ,
it depends of course where you are .
a good well , though , i think is very healthy
the latin american situation in ,
uh -huh .
the last development i know of was the military and financial assistance columbia for the , for the drug , uh , control .
and i support that fully .
i 'm not sure we have the right solution to it ,
but at least we 're , we 're going to the source of the problem .
and ,
 uh -huh . 
 the  source of supply .
uh , the problem is here ,
but the source of supply is there .
that 's true .
very definitely so .
in fact i think a lot of the ,
i 've been to , uh , peru several times .
uh -huh .
i 've never been to other parts of south america ,
but , uh , i have been to peru ,
and they need some assistance down there
and i 'm sure that , uh , as an undeveloped country they look , look for it ,
but there is not exactly a lot of , uh , physical responsibility there .  ]
no .
yes ,
right .
very immature in that respect .
and i , i think that , uh , they need guidance and assistance ,
but they need to learn how to stand on their own , own two feet also .
i agree .
uh -huh .
i think that for so long power financially , uh , governmentally , every which way was in the hands of such a few that there 's not the middle class that we , we perceive .
oh , no , the , and the poor are extremely poor .
i know ,
are extremely poor .
that 's correct .
i know , uh , some of the areas in , in texas seem poor ,
but until you 've seen some of those , uh , native ,
 uh -huh . 
 latin  americans come down from the hills , you can 't imagine what poor is .
and , uh , the worst scene i 've ever had i think was , uh , someone eating out of , out of a garbage can on the streets in lima , peru .
and , and just very happy to get that .
oh , yes .
yes .
i have a brother who spent two years in bolivia .
uh -huh .
and this is very much his , you know , reaction that the rich are so rich and the poor are so poor .
oh , the , there 's a joke ,
the , the graft and the , uh , payoffs down there are are an accepted way
and , in a way ,
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
and there 's , there 's a sad joke .
i guess all jokes are really sad ,
but there 's a joke about the , uh , ambassador from latin america that came to visit a senator in the u s and was taken to his home for dinner
and the , uh , home was palatial .
they had five or six servants , you know , and , and , a lot of expensive , uh , holdings and all that ,
and the ambassador said , but i know what you make as a u s senator ,
how can you afford all of this ?
and he said , come i 'll show you
and he walked out in the backyard
and the , uh , senator said do you see that hospital over there ?
and the ambassador said , yes .
and he patted his pocket
and he said fifteen percent .
he said , you see that school over there ?
and the ambassador said , yes ,
and he pot , patted his pocket and said fifteen percent ,
so ,
 oh , gosh . 
 so the next  year the senator went to latin america to visit the ambassador and was treated to dinner in his home
and it was twice as large and four times as many servants .
he said , well i know how poor your country is ,
how can you afford this , uh , in such a poor country ,
and he , he said , come i 'll show you
and he walked out the backyard
and he said , do you see that hospital over there ?
and the senator looked
and he couldn 't see anything ,
he said , no .
and the ambassador potted , patted his pocket and said one hundred percent
so ,
yep
yeah ,
that ,
it 's a sad story
but ,
intentions , intentions
yes ,
yes ,
but it , uh , it is a problem .
i know .
uh , i have a sister -in -law who is from nicaragua
and her family ,
her father was a fairly , uh , high ranking official under somoza .
and when that went down the tubes they had to get out .
uh -huh .
and seventeen children ,
 um . 
 filtered  through into , into america through guatamala , through mexico , through honduras ,
you know , two here , three there , one here , you know , this kind of thing until ,
 yeah . 
 and  now , uh , couple of the older ones stayed or went back ,
but the rest of them now have their american citizenship and are leading productive lives ,
 uh -huh . 
 but ,  you kn -,
well , the oth -, the other instance i think of their inability to , to handle things , the cholera ,
 yes . 
 and  hepatitis epidemics now in , in latin america .
and it shows the , the unpreparedness for such , such a problem .
yes .
and yet they 're so ,
yeah .
oh , the stories she tells , you know , are just unnerving just unnerving .
and they 're , they 're so rich in resources there .
they 're very rich in oil and gas .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
and they 're very rich in gold and silver , and very rich in , in , uh , natural resources such as the fish and , uh timber , and , and copper and all types of , uh , resources
but they ,
and the uranium .
yes ,
and ,
but they don 't have ,
it 's sort of like russia ,
they don 't have the ability to develop it .
the technology .
right .
and they , they 're very ,
well ,
and , you know , they 're very willing to be taught in many cases now , too ,
but , you know , there 's just always this kind of resentment underlying
i think that when they receive help from us , they want it ,
but , they don 't want it , i mean
you 're you 're exactly right .
it 's kind of a catch twenty -two .
uh -huh .
it , it 's sort of illustrated by the , uh , world bank and international monetary fund not wanting to continue to do business there
because they offer assistance , then don 't get repaid .
yeah ,
yeah .
so it 's sort of a thumbing of the nose , uh , approach .
they need it ,
and they need to live up to certain regulations and expectations ,
but uh , then don 't .
of course it 's a very volatile government , uh , situation , too .
well ,
and i think that , you know , it ,
somewhat a sarcastic view ,
but some of those drugs czars , you know ,
uh -huh .
they , they know that by pumping that poison into our system that that 's the way to bring us to our knees , more on their level .
you know ,
you know , that 's really , uh , kind of a far fetched idea ,
i know ,
and i don 't think people probably think those things consciously ,
 uh -huh . 
well the ,
 but  it 's like in any sibling rivalry we 're hearing the same ,
the solution discussed at one time and i think it has real merit on the drug situation is that the g -, the u s government could spend less money by buying the crop and destroying it than they are in trying to , to beef up the military and to do all other things .
i think it would be cheaper to buy it and destroy it ,
which would still give the , uh , the grower in columbia and elsewhere in latin america the , uh , the money that they apparently need and go , go to the illegal crop for .
in the long run .
and it would save the u s money in in the long run in how much they 're trying to do ,
and in the short run probably too .
true .
course , then could , you know , at , at some point , could you ever convince someone to turn around and grow something that was productive for humankind .
no ,
no .
you know .
and , i , i think finding an alternate to that would be very good .
right .
uh -huh .
i mean even their , even their legal crops are things that we don 't perceive as being healthy now from a medical standpoint of view , coffee tobacco you know
argentine beef ,
yeah ,
yeah .
they 're certainly legal ,
but they 're certainly not healthy .
well , have we come up with a solution yet , salina ?
no ,
not that i know of
but it 's been fun hashing about it i suppose .
at any rate ,
yeah .
yeah ,
yeah .
well , one of these days , uh , i hope we 'll find some , some way to substitute the good crops for illegal ones .
well , let 's just hope that the powers that be , uh , have time to , a little bit once in a while to , to think in some farther reaching avenues than you and i do here tonight
but ,
i agree .
well , it 's been nice chatting with you .
yes ,
it has .
i appreciate it ,
and , and tell your wife i hope we , i get her again sometime , too .
this is fun ,
very good
it 's kind of nice to , to see old friends now , you see .
all right ,
thank you salina .

None
okay ,
None
okay , bye .
bye -bye now .
uh , our children are both , uh , basically adults .
they , we 've , we 've got two .
uh , one is twenty -one ,
and one is twenty -five .
uh -huh .
and they , they still live at home .
uh -huh .
well , that 's , that 's a little unusual for , uh , for children of that age , to have both of them that age at home .
but , uh , i guess the activities that , uh , we have with them are , uh , pretty few and far between .
actually the , they 're both going on their own most of the time .
uh -huh .
uh -huh
so , uh , most of our activities are , you know , just discussion type things about what 's going on in the family and what they 're doing and that kind of thing .
well , we have a , uh , three year old and a one year old .
and , uh , so you know it keeps us pretty busy as you know .
sure it does .
and , uh , most of the time with a three year old we 're trying to , to get him , uh ,
well , we play usually in the evening when , when i get home , you know , about five o 'clock or so until about eight , you know , with the exception of dinner .
out in the front or backyard playing like , uh , tee ball off the , you know , off the ball and let him hit a lot of baseball .
uh , since we just got here we got the , uh , uh , new two wheel bike with training wheels on it for him ,
and he really likes riding that around .
uh -huh .
oh , yeah .
i ,
so , you know ,
and trying to supervisor him with that and everything and , uh , playing squirt guns and all that ,
he really likes that .
yeah .
and , uh , the one year old just kind of follows along and does everything ,
trying to do everything he does .
yeah ,
is the one year old a boy ?
no ,
it 's a girl .
a girl ?
yeah .
yea -,
ours , uh , the older one is a girl ,
so .
and the , and the younger one is a boy ,
so .
yeah .
uh , i guess , uh , what i see is so far as , uh , the trends , uh , uh , for children , uh ,
i don 't know what kind of a area virginia beach is ,
but , of course , uh , richardson is in the dallas area .
uh -huh .
and i think , uh , the big city , uh ,
activities for , for children now are ,
they 're good
but there 's so much , uh , potential danger , you know ,
that you really have to watch your children so closely now
that ,
uh -huh .
you can 't let them grow up the way , the way i grew up , you know .
i , i 'm from a smaller town in east texas .
and i could , you know , go and do whatever , pretty much whatever i wanted to do ,
uh -huh .
uh , my whole life .
uh , you know , i never , never had to worry about the bad guys being out there .
uh -huh .
and , uh , you know , i find it 's , it 's quite a bit different now
that , uh , you know , you have to watch your children so closely and , uh , keep up with them .
i , i feel like , uh ,
that it 's , it 's really a sad commentary on , uh , you know , a life in general ,
uh -huh .
that , uh , you know that children can 't , cannot be allowed to grow up , uh , you know , without really close supervision .
well , i , i agree with that ,
and i seem , i seem to feel the same way , you know ,
even just when i grew up and everything .
and , and , the way it is now you get a lot of supervision is , is at hand and everything .
uh -huh .
uh , the only other thing i have noticed though is that , uh , it seems that there 's been a lot of or more empha -, emphasis at least in what we 've been dealing with
and , and the looking , you know ,
just start not even ,
not really looking for a school for him but , uh , like a preschool or something that where he would go maybe a couple hours a couple days a week or something .
uh -huh .
for , for a three year old it 's that , uh ,
there 's a lot of emphasis on , on , on , on education and what these children should know before they reach kindergarten .
right .
and , and it seems like it 's a lot more than the -, they need to know and be able to do than when we are the , when i had to go in t -, ki -, kindergarten .
yeah .
and it seems like it 's more , uh ,
you know , i don 't know .
they 're expecting more or , uh , or just , uh , you know ,
kids just because of the computer age or whatever , it just , know more when they get , you know , to be five or six or something .
yeah .
but ,
um , i guess looking at , uh , back at , at what our children did compared to what , uh , you know , what i had to go through in school .
the , uh , there i -, there does seem to be a lot more in the curriculum .
it 's a lot more complicated .
a lot more available , of course .
uh -huh .
but , uh , this ,
  so much more to learn now that it really makes it more difficult , i would think .
i , i would probably have a hard time getting through school myself .
uh -huh .
uh , you know , just ,
or at least it would be a lot harder than it was when i went to school .
uh -huh .
one thing is i got a home computer too
and , uh , i play , uh , with the three year old
i play some computer games and stuff with him .
uh -huh .
educational games like , you know , concentration type games ,
right .
the matching , things like that .
yeah .
and , uh , he 's , he really likes it
and , uh , and i think it 's important because i think that , uh , you know , it gives him the interaction with the computer
because it sure looks like that 's going to be you -, you know , the big thing for a long time .
huh ,
and given ,
yeah ,
i think , uh ,
given that knowledge and stuff with it
and he seems to enjoy it .
None
and , uh , of course , the one year old hasn 't , hasn 't gotten there yet
but , uh ,
and the other thing we try to do is , uh , since the summer 's time 's here is , uh , sign him up for , and her , for , uh , different activities at like the rec center or something like swimming ,
right .
yeah .
you know , uh ,
or ,
there 's a little soccer thing that he 's going to do for a week or so
and , uh , you know ,
where they go for an hour or so .
yeah .
and , uh ,
because , uh , when he was a baby that we did the swimming too
and he really liked it
so we 're going to do that with our daughter too .
yeah .
that , uh , uh , watching a little , little boys play soccer is , is more fun .
i can 't imagine th -, them having as much fun as the parents ,
had watching them
i know .
well , we were just talking about that too .
and i guess it 's not really soccer it 's just kind of a , well , kick the ball around for a while ,
right ,
yeah
see what happens
the , the disorganized play   really what it was ,
but ,
yeah .
but , uh ,
yeah ,
when ours was a ,
he ,
i guess he was probably five or six , you know , when he first started playing soccer .
uh -huh .
and , uh , and that was , that was more fun to watch those boys trying to , trying to kick the ball up and down the field .
uh -huh .
but , uh ,
and it 's ,
i guess , that was , you know , as important , uh , as much important to the parents as it was to the children that , uh , you know , to get out and watch the kids play ,
so .
uh -huh .
i guess one of the things that i think about is a , talking about education , uh , i kind of feel like , uh , that , uh , the , the school systems in this , particularly in this area , the systems are not under enough control .
the , the students have a little too much , uh , too much leeway .
uh -huh .
excuse me .
um , an -, an -, and the , and that 's kind of contradictory to what i said
but , you know , you ,
the , hell
you have to be under control so much when they 're out
but when they 're in school they , they don 't have quite , quite as much control ,
right ,
right .
over them as , uh ,
right .
as what i would liked to have seen .
uh -huh .
uh , uh , i kind of feel like there 's , there 's too much allowed to go on in at , at school .
uh -huh .
and , uh , you know , it tends to , uh , to encourage students to not be as , you know , to not concentrate as much on the education .
uh -huh .
you know , they 're , they 're there for a good time .
right .
and , you know , to , to see how little they can get by with .
uh -huh .
well , i know of number of people that are in the , in the , uh , school district an -, down in , in , uh , san antonio .
and , uh , it seems like it 's ,
a lot of the problem is to , you know ,
you always have the lack of funds
but it seems to be getting worse and worse
and so they don 't settle the resources to draw on to give as much supervision as , as , as ,
right .
kids need .
and , uh , you know ,
but , uh ,
that 's just a problem that who knows how that 's going to , that 's going to come out or anything .
but ,
None
but , uh , i , i don 't , i don 't know
i think , uh , you know , some of the thing has to do with , uh ,
with the civil rights program .
not that the civil rights program is bad
but that there 's ,
it carried over ,
uh -huh .
into , you know , individual rights
and it , you know , trickled ou -,
well , tom , just tonight , i was working on my car out of necessity ,
and i had , uh , uh , had a long age -old problem of my bright lights not working ,
yeah .
uh , this is the type of , uh , switch where you flip the , the lever , the turn signal on the column and when i would , uh , put it in the bright light position the lights would go out completely ,
which is even worse than them just not getting bright
exactly .
and i had presumed that it was the switch ,
and , uh , this is , uh , an older car ,
it 's a seventy -two m g ,
so i had to mail order the part , uh ,
which i had done ,
and tonight i went out and , uh , at least hooked in the new part , only to discover that that apparently is not the problem ,
it 's not in the switch , because it does the same thing with the new switch .
oh .
so i 'll be faced with having to return that product and , uh , hoping that , uh , you know , that they will accept it ,
although it 's been removed from the box it 's obviously not been really used .
did you do the diagnosis , or was it just an assumption that that 's probably the part that failed ?
uh -huh .
uh , i had done what diagnosis i could , primarily by looking at a wiring diagram that i did have of the car and , uh , pretty much decided that that had to be the problem .
i talked to one mechanic about it ,
and he suspected the switch also .
uh , but i 've not , you know ,
i really don 't know what the problem might be .
uh -huh .
it , it , the other switch could be the main switch itself , uh , that turns the lights on or off , which is on the dashboard uh , it might be tied into the equation somehow ,
but ,
yeah , i know ,
uh , when working with the , uh , flashers , there is , uh , usually a , a special fuse that operates the flashers .
do you have a separate fuse for your high beam as opposed to your low beam ?
i i don 't know ,
i should look at that .
diagram .
i don 't remember seeing one in the , uh , in the diagram so i 'll have to go back and look at that .
yeah ,
i don 't even know if my current cars have a separate fuse .
uh -huh .
i know sometimes when you think there are things running while they 're at the same unit , like the headlamp you tend to think , well , there 's one fuse operating the whole thing ,
but sometimes the extra amperage that a high beam drives as opposed to a low beam requires , uh , the use of a , of a maybe a higher fuse .
yeah ,
that 's a good idea .
so , that 's a possibility .
what i 've typically found when that , uh ,
companies are pretty good about accepting returns on products like that when they 're not needed after all ,
and i hope that that 's the case this time .
is this a , a mail order parts house that specializes in , in parts for parts for , uh , old imports ?
right ,
who ,
exactly it 's out of kansas somewhere .
um so , it 's not j c whitney or somebody like that .
no ,
it 's not .
i also got a piece of chrome for the , the hood that they had indicated was the right part for this car ,
but it is not either ,
it 's obviously doesn 't quite fit ,
so it must be for a different year ,
so i 'll have to try to return that as well .
yeah ,
have you found any , uh , uh , reliable import service people in the metroplex ?
well , i had one person that i used for years and years on this car ,
because i 've owned this car since it was new ,
and , uh ,
oh , yeah .
uh -huh .
but it 's over like in the brook hollow industrial district down on stemmons and inwood area and i hadn 't used him for some years ,
and the last time i called him back it turned out that he had further specialized
instead of , uh , all import cars , he has narrowed it down to where he only works on , uh , german cars and
i 'll be darned .
i 'm not sure that he works on much else at all ,
but he doesn 't work on british cars any more , and gave me the name of somebody else to take a look at it .
so , uh , uh , i may have to check with that person ,
as it turns out that one , that shop is near where i now work .
so , i 'll , uh , i should be able to take it in and check that part out .
i 've not had to exchange any other parts recently , because they were defective .
now , i 've had , had pretty good luck ,
i just , however , did , uh , have to get a , a , uh , one of these jam box portable dual cassette players , uh , repaired .
uh -huh .
i purchased it at sam 's ,
and i had assumed that it had a ninety day warranty ,
and i should have checked more carefully and done a better job of saving the receipt ,
because i didn 't take it in right away , and let a whole year go by .
uh , some of the buttons didn 't work right , where you had to actually physically hold them down to get it to record or to play ,
and as it turned out , it had a full year 's warranty ,
and i could have gotten it repaired for free
oh , my goodness .
but i had to take it in ,
while it was in the shop i ended up finding the receipt that i thought had long since been lost ,
uh , but it didn 't do me any good , because i had , i had missed the window by about a week or two .
oh , no .
so i didn 't even , i didn 't really , uh , even bring it up when i went in to pick it up .
but , uh , that 's really my only experience in the past year where i 've had to take a product back because of a defect .
well , ours wasn 't within the last year .
i guess it 's been within the last two years , uh ,
judy has an oldsmobile that we bought new ,
and it 's one with the , uh , electronic ignition and the computer controlled mixer , and , uh ,
i don 't know what else it all controls , but the fuel mixture and cruise control and things of that sort ,
and we found that the , uh , uh , we were having two problems .
it was idling fast , when you first started the engine , to the point that we park on a hill , under our car port ,
and , it , when you first dropped it into geared it would immediately want to back up into the alley ,
and knowing that , you always had to keep your foot on the brake hard ,
otherwise it would just wrench control away from you .
good grief .
uh -huh .
and the other problem judy would have is occasionally she would , uh , be driving along , uh , decelerating , like coming to a stop sign , but not yet stopped at the stop sign and the engine would just quit .
so , we took it back to the , uh , oldsmobile place and asked them to check it out ,
and at first they thought it was just a matter of timing ,
so they adjusted timing
and the problem didn 't go away ,
so we ended up taking it back again ,
and i don 't know why they don 't look at these things the first time around ,
but the second time around they looked at their , uh , recall service and their service reports from region or headquarters whatever ,
huh .
and , and they had a description of the exact problem we were experiencing that apparently was a programming error in the , uh , computer control unit ,
my goodness .
huh .
which fortunately they replaced under warranty , because it was about a three hundred or three hundred and fifty dollar part and , uh , so once they replaced it , then the , the car seemed to work fine for a considerable period of time ,
and now it seems to be ,
we don -, we 're not experiencing the stalling ,
but we 're still experiencing a very uneven ,
okay .
what do you think about it ?
uh , well , immigration ,
i know they 're really strict right now because my hundr -, husband is from out of the country
and , uh , we had to go through a whole , very long process to , uh , to , assure the government that he was , uh , marrying me uh -huh .
and not to be a resident here .
that 's interest -,
yeah ,
i think that 's , uh , i think it 's a little crazy .
uh -huh .
i worked with spanish people for about two years
and just , it was incredible to me to see the things that they had to go through when they were really some of the best workers .
yeah ,
that 's true .
i mean , you can 't just come over to the country because , uh , you want to .
right .
you know , that 's not good enough .
you have to have a , have to have a darn good reason of , political or whatever .
right ,
exactly .
not a good , not a good easy way to get in .
yeah ,
i think , you know , i think in a lot of ways the law is good because it tries to , to protect , you know , the people who are in the states .
exactly .
uh -huh .
my mother , uh , actually knew a woman in another state that used to marry men just ,
n -, she 'd never even meet them
and she 'd just get money for it .
oh , you 're kidding .
huh -uh .
so , uh ,-
sounds like a lot of fun .
yeah ,
it 's amazing to me how , how many things they would allow to occur before , you know , you can come in .
exactly .
right .
but , i mean , with the new laws , it 's it 's tough now .
yeah ,
it 's kind of frustrating , too , for those who are legitimate now .
exactly .
you know , i think ,
uh -huh .
well , and , you know , uh , my grandparents came to this country just wanting a better life , you know and they got here ,
but now it 's a , you know , it 's so strict that you can 't just do that .
right ,
exactly .
and i think it 's important that they , you know , they allow a good number of people in every year
because really they 're the ones who work the hardest and do the jobs that , that we don 't want to do .
i agree .
and i just ,
i don 't know ,
i have , personally i have a problem with it ,
exactly .
i think , that , you know , if someone wants to come in and they can prove that they 're going to work and they 're going to be a good citizen that we shouldn 't close our door .
if they 're not going to be on welfare or , or , or whatever .
they 're going to be a productive citizen zen .
and , you know , i , i believe that if someone goes on welfare that 's when , you , you know , send them back to their country .
yeah .
and , i think a lot of times we 're so busy trying to keep them out that we 're spending twice as much money as we would just allowing them in
and ,
well , think of how many illegal aliens have , have , have been , uh , uh , sent back to mexico just to find their way back .
yeah ,
and that 's , that 's what i think .
you know , i , i have to laugh
because , like i said , i worked with a lot of those
and they 'd been deported two or three times
and just basically what they do is they get caught when they wanted to go home for christmas .
that 's right ,
that 's our money .
or for any other time .
yes ,
that 's true .
but , i think , you know , i think all in all there 's a lot of improvements .
i think the general idea is good
but , but there could be some work done in the area .
i , i think
i , i agree .
well good
uh , i , uh ,
anyway , do you have anything else in the , the subject , uh that you might want to talk about ?
boy this is spur of the moment , uh ,
but , i , i don 't really see any , any changes that i think of really blatant right now
other than i think they ought to take , you know , on a case by case basis and not necessarily make it a , uh , political refugee .
yeah ,
absolutely .
i think a lot of times we take , you know , basically who we want to
because if you , if you have connections , it 's a lot easier to get in .
exactly .
connections and money .
yeah ,
and i think , you know , it should be more of a thing that 's based upon someone 's intent , you know .
yeah .
and that it should be equal to all
and then not like the united states ,
basically , it 's not who you know ,
it d -, it doesn 't become a thing of who you know , but , but how the type of person you are .
i agree .
and it should be based on those kinds of things so the good people , like probably your husband , can get in
yeah
well , we got him past that ,
well , great .
but , uh , i know there 's a lot of other people out there ,
would probably do a good job here .
yep .
well , let 's see ,
is there anything i believe in
i think that 's it .
is this like a very short call ?
no ,
i 'm not sure how long they 're supposed to be ,
but , i 've enjoyed it .
it 's good hearing your , your point of view
and i think that 's neat .
i think we agree a lot on that
i did , too .
and i 've learned something from it .
well , it was nice talking to you .
well , thanks ,
i 'm glad you 're home .
you have a good evening , all right ?
you , too .
thanks ,
bye -bye .
bye .
well , seems to me the , one of the reasons that people don 't go out to vote is maybe they 're bored with the whole election process .
well , i agree with the boredom of the election process ,
but i also , uh , think that people don 't realize that their boat , vote will make a difference .
uh , they feel like that , you know , it 's going to go however it 's going to go
and their one little vote is not going to make that much difference
and it 's , just why make the effort .
well , sometimes , strangely enough , one vote has made the difference .
well , i agree with that
and i , and i do know that , you know , all those votes are counted
and , and they do make a difference .
uh , also i think that people have a tendency to , to vote in the larger elections and not vote in the , the more local elections .
well , it 's kind of strange
because in the local elections is the ones that have the most influence on their day -to -day lives .
exactly ,
and , i , i even have a tendency to do that myself .
and i have to really make a concerted effort to , to get involved .
i live , i live in a suburb in mesquite
and , uh , so i really have to make an effort to read the local paper and to see what 's going to because that directly affects me .
but i , i think on the whole , most people don 't , uh , feel that way .
or don 't look , even look at that .
i think they just don 't even ,
i , i don 't think they 're conscious of it .
well , maybe part of the problem is they don 't , they think they have enough choices .
well , that may be true , too .
i hadn 't thought of that .
you know , in some of the european countries , they have numbers of parties that run
and then lot of more voters come out to vote than vote in this country .
uh -huh ,
right .
and sometimes it 's , uh ,
well , not sometimes , but many times it 's who has the most money to spend on the largest campaign
and , and issues get , uh , bogged down .
well , maybe it 's a matter of , you know , voter awareness .
uh , i think voter awareness ,
i , i did some work for the , uh , women 's league of , uh , voters , uh , several years ago
and , i think there are some organizations that used to , uh , do some voter awareness , uh , things .
they don 't get a lot of participation .
they don 't get a lot of , uh , activity .
most of the league of women voters , what they did was they put out information , so that it , it would just be made available to everyone .
now , other areas that i 've worked in , like in the chambers , they would just have the candidates come
and it would just , you know ,
that was not a lot of community involvement
and those were people that would mostly vote anyway .
well , i think part of the problem is the election goes on way too long .
in britain , you know , they have a set period of time
and , and for campaign , that 's it .
in this country , it seems like it 's a continuous ongoing campaign .
it 's a , it 's an ongoing campaign
and it 's expensive campaign
and it , it , uh , eliminates a lot of qualified people .
uh , maybe more qualified and , uh , more dedicated to the issues .
well , the , they don 't want to spend the time
or they don 't have the money .
exactly ,
exactly
and it , it ,
i , i can 't b -, i just can 't believe ,
i 've , i 've worked in a couple of local campaigns .
i just cannot believe the dollars that are spent just even locally .
well , it 's a matter of name recognition .
people aren 't going to vote for someone they 've never heard of .
oh , well , i agree with that ,
but also ,
and i , and i 'm not for controlling how much is spent ,
but do you know ,
that 's one thing ,
if a , if the time wasn 't so ,
if it wasn 't such a long , uh , campaigning time , then they couldn 't spend as much money .
and even debates don 't seem to help much .
no ,
they really don 't .
uh , it 's al -, it 's , a lot of it is who looks the best , who , uh , who happens to say the right thing at the right time , who , not , who may not be the most qualified and can get the b -, uh , the job done .
so we 're really voting for the best makeup person and the best handlers .
exactly .
and it 's a , it 's a lot ,
i 've worked in public relations a lot
and , uh , that kind of thing can make and break , make or break you
as you can remember uh , clayton williams ' campaign .
well , that was certainly a media event .
it really was
and it 's just , uh , uh ,
he possibly could have , uh , won that election had it not been for some of the the , uh , the way he presented himself .
well , he had a classic case of hoof in mouth disease .
hoof , is , is , i guess the right term for him .
night ,
fine ,
thank you .
i understand we 're supposed to talk about spaceflight .
yes .
i hope you know more about it than i do .
i just got through reading , space by , james michener .
is that right ?
that , helped out a little bit i think .
i haven 't read his book .
i was so upset with texas that i haven 't gotten into any more of his books because i thought it was just horrible .
he tends to go into a lot of detail sometimes .
None
i don 't think he was truthful in a lot of what he did in texas
i wasn 't sure how credible he was .
is that right ?
what do you think we 've gained from the spaceflights ?
i 'm not sure to be honest with you ,
this going to the moon seemed to be a exciting adventure
None
ego trip .
yeah ,
it was nice to go there ,
i don 't know that it really benefitted mankind that much .
uh -huh .
i happen to live not too far away from ,
is that right ?
i 've actually worked for the company that , has been blamed for the challenger disaster . morton thiakol .
uh -huh .
that 's been kind of a real negative feeling here
right .
is it was , very unfortunate thing that occurred there
it 's ,
where do you live ?
we live in , utah .
you live in u -,
am i talking to utah right now ?
uh -huh .
great .
yeah .
None
i 'm in dallas .
oh .
i have a sister that lives in dallas ,
i see .
that 's how we got hooked up to the program was her husband works for penney 's there .
i see .
None
carolyn rash ?
pardon me ?
is her name rash , carolyn rash ?
no , my last name is skidmore .
i see .
her husband 's name is , his last name is weight .
i see .
None
you probably know a lot about it .
i wasn 't sure that they were blaming that space disaster on one company .
i hadn 't heard that .
they were .
there was ,
apparently the specifications for the joints ,
they were not to perform in , cold weather
apparently there was definitely a joint that did not seal ,
uh -huh .
if you 've ever seen the size of those , motors that put them into space ,
uh -huh .
they 're as long as a football field practically and about twelve foot in diameter
there is a lot of thrust to get that much weight up in the air .
yeah .
this book was interesting , though .
i ,
talked about how a lot of the problems they have to overcome to ,
it 's a very complex , situation to go into space .
yeah ,
i would think so , too
they would ,
the thing that he went into quite a bit of detail about how much of a problem it is to re -enter the earth 's atmosphere .
you never think about that do you ?
yeah .
yeah
i would think it would be harder to get up than it would be getting back down .
they have to come in at just the right angle .
uh -huh .
if you come in at the wrong angle , what happens is they bounce off and go back into space if they come into it at a different angle there is so much friction that it burns them up .
right .
None
i saw some of those early space capsules at smithsonian .
oh .
i 'm sure you 've seen more of them than i have ,
uh -huh .
you could see the scorch on them ,
yeah .
they had though piles you could see how hot it got because it was still the scorch on them which was quite interesting .
yeah ,
i ,
go ahead .
i 've , i 've never , i 've never seen an actual capsule .
yeah .
uh -huh .
i 've seen more of the motors that they produced out there .
uh -huh .
these were the ones that john glenn went up in and the old , old ones .
yeah .
the very first ones ,
the little bell type things .
people have commented how , they were surprised at how small they were .
yeah ,
they really were ,
they just ,
looked pretty confining ,
yeah ,
the whole thing was small
you actually put it on
is that right ?
you put it around you pretty much ,
it was so small .
None
i thought there was some medical benefits that we have learned from space ,
did he go into that in the book ?
not really .
i guess that 's just to sell us on it .
one thing 's ,
i know one thing they 've mentioned that i didn 't get from the book , by the way ,
it talked about ,
yeah .
they 're able to manufacture , different kinds of crystals and ball bearings and things like that in a zero gravity state that they turned out being nearly perfect as far as a ball bearing goes .
it 's perfectly round .
uh -huh .
i 'm not sure you have to go to outer space to achieve that zero gravity .
that 's true
None
yeah .
that 's right
do you think we should continue to support it at the level ,
i thought probably one of the things they were doing that they didn 't tell us was spying .
uh -huh .
i think those satellites , or not satellites , but the spaceflights could really spy
yes .
with russia 's demise , i didn 't know if we should continue to support it at the current level .
i think they have cut it back , to be honest with you .
yeah .
from the glory days when they did the apollo shots to the moon .
None
i appreciate having the satellites .
that 's certainly made it nice for other purpose .
i don 't know if you have a satellite dish or not .
no ,
i don 't .
i don 't either .
yeah .
we don 't i know that 's certainly helped a lot in that regard .
okay .
uh , go ahead .
what are we supposed to discuss again ?
aids research is something that ,
more money   ,
that , i think th -, whether our country is putting enough money into it
and actually i 'm concerned that they 're not .
i have a friend who is working with , uh , who works with , uh , travel groups ,
uh -huh .
and one of the ones that he 's w -, worked with was professionals who came in for an aids , uh , conference in , uh , california .
uh -huh .
and these were from other , people from other countries .
he 's a translator .
uh -huh .
and in talking to the people from france he said , you know ,
he says , one of the things that really concerns me is your government is not telling you enough about how it pervasive and frightening this epidemic is .
and they 're letting ,
huh .
the information out slowly about how , you know , how big it is .
which is scary , you know , pretty scary when so many people get it .
so , i guess i 'm , i 'm , i 'd like to see us spend more .
i don 't know that spending more always gets it .
yeah .
i 'm , i 'm ambivalent about it because , um , uh , i -, well it is very frightening and scary .
i have no perspective on how it relates to other diseases ,
and , uh , i mean whether ,
you mean more money for that means less for cancer or ,
yes .
y -, yeah .
and , uh , whether those diseases can yo -,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
some difference could be made if you did pour more money in like diabetes research uh didn 't , uh , you know ,
but i , uh ,
then t -, part of it 's lack of education .
i don 't know whether , whether , you know , where our money would be most effectively spent .
well it ,
i , i agree with you there
because i know every time that i -, something comes into vogue all the money goes to that one
and you don 't know whether it 's still also going to the other or if it 's a limited pie .
uh -huh .
money from , money for taking care of the infants takes money away from taking care of the elderly ,
or do they both get served ?
uh , that 's a good point .
and i 'm , i am concerned a lot about , uh , i 'm concerned about , uh , two things .
one is preventing the spread
and the other is for , uh , for , uh , treating the illness .
uh -huh .
and i 'm not certain ,
i , i ,
again this ,
i 'm telling you ,
basically i don 't have any opinion .
uh -huh .
but whether or not it would be , uh , our money would be better spent , uh , teaching , you know , working on the drug problems and the , and the sex problems , uh , rather than trying to cure the people that already have it .
well , and one of the things i 'd ,
and i 'm with you that i don 't know is , is that really the only way it 's being transmitted or was that the easier way to tell us and we 're going to find out more .
yeah ,
well , you know ,
that 's , that 's the part that ,
t -, d -, whether my dentist or
that 's the part that scares me , you know .
i mean beginning with this is , this is just for homosexuals ,
well no ,
it 's for homosexuals and gays ,
well no ,
actually , it 's ,
i mean , you know .
did they know that all along ?
an -, and i heard something the other day , this sounds ridiculous , about mosquitoes .
and , you know , they 've been saying oh , no , absolutely not .
can 't get it from mosquitoes .
and , uh , and now they are saying well maybe in the right conditions ,
yes .
oh
and i don 't know that 's true or not .
i mean , i just heard it in passing ,
but so what does that ,
right .
what does that mean for people that you work with and shake hands with and
and how is it really transmitted ,
yeah .
et cetera .
which is , i think , what they also don 't know .
i mean that 's ,
i think they , they told us what was convenient and felt safe to say , you know .
uh -huh .
it was nice to isolate it to one particular community that they have trouble , you know , they just as soon not approve of anyway ,
but , but that isn 't how it was in africa .
no .
in africa was the men and women and , and had nothing to do with that ,
and it 's huge over there .
so i , i , you know ,
and it 's beginning , t -, other countries
that 's what 's his point .
this was an international ,
uh -huh .
conference where people are saying , well , but in my country it 's , you know , like this .
and does that mean like flus and everything else , there are all these different strains of it ?
oh .
i mean i don 't know .
all i 'm saying is i think it 's scarier than we know .
uh , or maybe they understand but ,
i think maybe more information should be given out about it .
yeah ,
and , uh , and then the people that have it ,
it does seem that there are , are some drugs that are there that , you know , they keep holding back .
if you , if i were dying , i 'm not sure i would care .
i , i , give me cyanide .
i mean , is it   ,
yeah ,
right .
uh -huh .
i 'll take anything you know .
i mean if i 'm dying , if i know i 'm dying ,
ri -,
you can experiment on me .
exactly .
go ahead .
and why can 't you , why can 't the f d a say , you know , i -, if these people knowingly consent to be ,
exactly .
research monkeys and well , let them ,
let them ,
yeah .
do it .
yeah .
and that 's what i think they 're saying too .
have you s -, had any snow up your way ?
no ,
we haven 't had any since , uh , oh , just before christmas
um .
and , uh we had a lot before christmas .
the ski resorts were really
and , uh ,
but , now we have , we 've had fog , for about forty days in a row and temperature inversion ,
so ,
but no , uh , no snow .
um .
the snows all melted off mount , uh ,
well , i talked to a woman who lived up in the hills , uh ,
mountains in , uh , utah , i guess this last weekend
and she had , uh , quite a bit of snow on the ground her way .
uh -huh ,
i guess there 's different parts of the state of utah that , that , does have some ,
but not ,
usually we have up to a hundred and fifty inches up at the ski resorts
and they 're down between thirty -eight and , uh , forty inches .
um
at this time of the year ,
and we 've been in a drought for the last five years
and this is the sixth year
and it 's getting quite serious , as far as water next summer .
yeah ,
well , the weather , uh , here , is always a topic of conversation in texas .
right .
but , uh , we have wide variations and have warm weather when most people have cold weather ,
but we have our share of cold weather as well .
the , uh , temperature this morning was right at freezing .
it didn 't stay there ,
but it was right at ,
oh , that 's , that 's different , isn 't it ?
um .
we usually have some of our coldest weather toward the , uh , end of january ,
but this year it wasn 't bad at all .
i guess that 's because we had so much rain .
i know my son was telling me about the rain down there .
he said it was just ,
oh , yeah .
and we read in the newspaper , southern part of texas i guess flooded out ,
and , uh ,
well , my , uh , my sister lives in houston
and they , uh ,
the river there was , uh , in the flooding stage near where her son lives ,
and that , uh , caused some , uh , concern , of course .
oh , boy .
they have a , uh , lake cabin
oh , my gosh .
and , uh , their dock was completely under water on the lake .
so we really had a lot of rain .
yeah my son in plano , he lives fairly close to ,
right .
there 's quite a wash that goes down , uh , through plano and , uh , there 's walking trails on both sides , a walking path ,
and , uh , when i 've gone down to visit him i 've gone on that ,
but , uh , that was clear full and up to , up to some of the streets , i guess .
it just k -,
yeah ,
we had a lot of flash floods in the area .
we had a few people who ran into , uh , water and a few fatalities , uh , just a few .
uh -huh .
not more than ten
but ,
that 's funny that , uh , we can 't have it in moderation instead of having either a drought or having too much .
well , the , uh ,
there 's an old profane expression about texas weather ,
it 's always too damn cold , too damn hot , too damn windy
yeah ,
well , it 's , uh , interesting ,
uh ,
i 'm going down to el paso next week
and , uh , i was wondering what the weather was ,
but i imagine if it 's that cold in dallas it ,
well , el paso won 't be cold .
it 's not a , doesn 't get that cold , i guess , huh ?
no ,
it 's , it 's , quite southern
and it 's , it 's rare to get real cold in , in el paso .
uh -huh .
the , uh , you 'll be flying in there ?
yes .
well , uh , take off is , uh , fun from el paso because you normally ,
yes .
the way the winds are you take off right toward the mountain , the rockies and they 're towering above you
and so you circle back over the air and then make a circle around and come back over again .
yeah ,
we 're kind of used to that here in utah ,
course , there are mountains ,
and i fly into montana a lot
and we have a ,
the mountains are , are really , uh , high
and a lot of places we go in to , you just kind of , uh ,
it 's in the little valley ,
but , i , uh , sure hope we ,
we really need the moisture .
i hope we can get , uh , get some .
oh ,
there 's supposed to be a storm ,
but it split , went down through , uh , northern arizona and southern utah
and they 're not predicting any for the next , uh , week anyway up here
so ,
well , i noticed on the weather map on , uh , cable network that there was supposed to be a storm front moving into california and on down your way ,
but i guess it didn 't pan out , huh ?
yeah ,
well , that 's , that 's what the ,
 *[[listen ; dropped phone is probably comment not utterance , should be in fixed 7 -14 -97 nc
  above , uh ,
some of it went to the south and some to the north up into montana ,
so that just left us ,
huh .
we got a high pressure system which has been sitting in the air
oh , boy .
and , uh , we broke the record for the amount of fog that we 've had , uh , you know airport 's been shut down , uh , till about noon every day
uh -huh .
and then they seed the clouds , or seed the fog to try to to get the airplanes in and out .
huh .
well ,
we , uh , had a bad siege last , uh , christmas a year ago .
we went up to visit my wife 's , uh , sister who lives in , uh , calgary , alberta , can ,
the topic 's about government .
i 'm not altogether sure that that 's my best topic .
yeah .
i thought it was kind of a strange topic about corruption in the government and how many people are self serving .
uh -huh .
uh -huh
i , i think people tend to think that the government is not corrupt
uh -huh .
and that people aren 't self serving .
uh -huh .
that 's what i would like to think .
yeah ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i , i think that the last , part of that question was particularly interesting , about , how much unethical behavior can be made illegal because it seems to me that when government or public service of any kind degenerates so much that you have to have so many explicit ethical codes parallel to the legal codes that , we 're focusing on the wrong thing .
uh -huh ,
yeah .
maybe that 's what is happening .
right
maybe so many things have become public with the media over the past , ten to twenty years that , it becomes more evident .
uh -huh .
perhaps things that we didn 't think of before and just concentrated on the lawmaking or the results that would be seen in public works or bills that are passed or , et cetera like that we were just not exposed to the personal lives of these persons .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i couldn 't help thinking when that last part of the question came about how many things can we , actually put a legal code on how much , should it be our , prerogative to see into the private lives of these people .
yeah .
None
yeah ,
that makes sense .
None
you start prying in people 's private lives , you ruin their lives as well as ,
that 's right .
sometimes , i don 't even know how much of a difference it really makes ,
yeah .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i guess in some cases , we care about what they did in the past sometimes , i don 't know i think it gets in the way of the better judgment .
just because you did something in the past doesn 't mean he 's not a good enough person to be a politician .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i , i agree with that and also that if the results that they 're putting out and what they actually seem to be accomplishing by legitimate means is what 's , going to the public then they 'll pay for their private life in their own private conscience .
that 's it .
uh -huh .
when it becomes public , though , it becomes scandalous .
yeah .
that 's , that 's the thing that ,
uh -huh .
things that you don 't know do , do not worm their way around and influence other people or perhaps lead other people astray .
yeah .
people could say , they do it ,
i guess ,
uh -huh .
None
as soon as things do get public there is that terrible concern .
uh -huh .
sometimes i ask myself , what are , people doing that are in the media when somebody , comes up to office ,
uh -huh .
it seems that one of the first thing that 's done is to dig up any kind of a thing they can on them and get it all over the headlines .
yeah
i guess it 's what sells newspapers ,
it 's a very low way of living .
uh -huh .
None
as far as , myself having any particular personal , knowledge or insight into politics or politicians , i 'm not terribly involved in it .
uh -huh
just in a very cursory way .
right .
i vote
i , try to do whatever i can on the little local area ,
yeah .
i , i -, it just is not one of the things that i have , placed , a lot of my particular time and effort into ,
uh -huh .
i always feel very outside this kind of an issue .
yeah .
None
i am kind of the same way .
yeah .
uh -huh .
yeah ,
right .
yeah ,
None
uh -huh .
i just kind of read the paper follow up on peop -, just keep an eye on what 's going on i don 't really play an active role in any kind of politics
i 'm not in there ,
i 'm not one of those , volunteers that 's down at headquarters and whatever , although i admire the people that do that
uh -huh .
right .
right .
they certainly do get inside information of course , the better you know a person that might be affiliated with that kind of thing , the more you can trust their judgment and their insight .
uh -huh .
the media insight , as you said ,
yeah .
yeah .
i just kind of read and kind of be aware i don 't like to make a whole lot of , judgment myself unless things are so absolutely out of whack that ,
okay .
all right .
that 's a real different topic .
i 'm not sure i 'm familiar with , with what they mean of invasion of privacy .
i know .
i guess that , i guess you consider just things that every day that would , you would think of about .
see , i 'm a college student ,
yeah .
so i can think of lots of things that my roommate does that bother me you know , that i think 's like is an invasion of my privacy , stuff like that .
yeah .
but i think it 'd be , it is kind of a tough topic .
i think , personally , you know ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
i 'm , i used to be a college student ten years ago but uh , now i think an invasion of my privacy is when someone calls me on the telephone and says , mrs miller , have we got a deal for you .
oh , golly .
you 're like , no , you don 't , no .
it 's like , how do you know my name ,
where did you get my phone number ,
and why do you think it 's a deal for me ?
uh -huh .
yeah .
i mean , those people , they 'll call you any time of the day or night with , try to solicit and that 's an invasion of my privacy , i think .
they call late ,
now , i mean , now there 's , i heard that they were going to start calling on saturdays or some -,
oh , they do already .
see , that 's ridi -,
i would be so mad
well ,
and i 've even had the computer generated calls on sundays , too .
really .
uh -huh .
huh .
but i do know of a way to get around the computer generated calls .
how ?
don 't answer your phone , hello .
the computer 's geared to , to start talking to you on the , on the word hello .
really ?
uh -huh .
huh .
i don 't know ,
i think like things that , that
i think 's like privacy is like , just like , not going through my stuff , like going through , just like my clothes or my drawer , just going through my stuff , basically .
oh , yeah .
that drives me up a wall .
are you and your roommate a similar size .
no ,
see , we 're not ,
and , uh .
and she still goes through your clothes ?
yeah ,
she 'll take all my shirts and stuff ,
uh -huh .
because she can 't wear like my pants but she 'll take all my shirts and my blouses and stuff .
ooh .
man , i 'm just glad she can 't wear my pants or my skirts or my dresses , you know .
oh , yeah .
but still , she 'll just take them ,
and she won 't even think about it ,
and then , i 'll like see her that day ,
and she 'll be wearing my clothes ,
and i 'll be like , you know , i don 't like to borrow my clothes out , you know ,
i really don 't .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
so i prefer that you just not go in and get them because she doesn 't even ask me .
stuff like that really
like that 's an invasion of my privacy , i feel like .
oh , yeah ,
i agree .
stuff like that ,
when you have your door closed , people just walking in and stuff like that .
uh -huh .
i was thinking like my mom .
i know this ,
oh , yeah .
she would think this is like an invasion of her privacy , is like going through her purse , like if you ever needed money and stuff we always just give her her purse , you know ,
yeah .
and she 'll get it out or whatever .
uh -huh .
i was trying to think ,
i was thinking that 's the only thing i could really think of that would really be .
my mom doesn 't even like for us to go through her cabinets .
really .
i mean , we 're all grown ,
all her kids are grown ,
uh -huh .
and we have our own families and now if we go through her cabinets she 's like , well , what are you digging for ?
yeah ,
get out of my cabinets .
like , what are you doing ?
don 't you have your own house to dig through ?
that 's great .
yeah ,
so , i guess , privacy is really ,
and at the work place , i suppose ,
oh , well , actually yes .
i can say definitely ,
privacy at the work place .
uh -huh .
see .
yeah .
i hate it for people to open up my drawer to my desk because that was , that was where i kept all my stuff ,
and i could tell i mean , even if a pen was turned the wrong way .
you could tell ,
you know you put your stuff where it 's ,
  .
yeah .
that would drive , that would , that
it would drive , it drove me batty for a while .
really .
yeah ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
well , i worked a second shift and everybody else in my area worked first shift and our shifts overlapped so i would come in ,
and there would be people sitting at my desk , working ,
and i 'm wondering , you know , um , what is this ,
it 's my vitamins ,
i wonder , what is , you know , yeah , what is ,
why are they working at my desk ,
and can i have it back .
yeah .
can i have it back soon , maybe .
then you start missing stuff ,
and .
oh , yeah ,
no mommy is going to take the vitamins ,
i 'm sorry ,
i have  
that 's okay .
see that would , that would make me really mad ,
because you can always tell when someone 's touched your stuff ,
just because ,
  .
i mean , i know i have everything like a certain way and you know how it looks and everything .
oh , yeah .
well , you know how you left it the day before .
uh -huh .
that would bother me , definitely .
oh , yeah ,
so , that 's ,
yeah ,
i agree ,
it 's , it 's pretty tough that way ,
and , i know , even like with your school books and papers .
uh -huh .
do you miss your papers sometimes ?
see ,
yeah .
uh -huh .
you know .
that 's the only thing i can really think about being an invasion of privacy , like something every day , though .
yeah ,
well , actually i do know ,
uh -huh .
and i have used it once and it , it really is an invasion of privacy ,
but in the library there 's a book that you can find out what people 's phone numbers are by where they live , their street address .
oh , really ?
yeah .
uh -huh .
and that ,
i mean , i 've , i 've used it once ,
okay .
all right ,
well d -, d -, do you play any musical instruments or ,
no ,
i don 't play any .
i used to .
oh well ,
i think everybody took piano lessons
so ,
everybody ,
sure .
i , i started when i was in , uh , third grade ,
and i 've , i still play the piano as of today .
do you ?
yes ,
i do .
i started ,
i think i was in the fifth grade
and i played it for maybe three months
but , then , again , i was also in , uh , the marching band .
i played the drums ,
i played the clarinet ,
i played the trumpet .
wow
uh , you know , whatever
and so i ,
i still sing ,
and i sing in the choir today
so ,
all right
i en -, i enjoy the music ,
it gives me an out .
yeah .
it always sounds like ,
for my playing the piano when i was depressed and didn 't have anything else to do and there was no one to play with i could always go play with the piano , you know .
true
so , how long did you play ?
only for about three months .
three months .
yeah ,
me and my brother both took the classes
and we got pretty bored quick
i was going to say , y -, y -, you got as far as the , uh , chop sticks , huh .
um , well , i could play , uh , the wood chuck song .
oh , the wood chuck song
and i still can to this date .
yeah .
and your mother 's saying , and although , the money that we spent for those piano lessons this is all we got was the wood chuck song
yep ,
they went out and bought us a piano
and for three months
oh , bless your heart .
did you ever , did you ever just bang on it or do anything with it at all .
oh , yeah ,
any time i got bored
oh , okay ,
but i mean , can you play anything on it , other than wood chuck song ?
no .
no .
and jaws ,
but i think everybody can .
okay .
i c -, i , i can still read music if i 'm lucky
because i ,
if i work real hard i can still barely read the music ,
yeah .
but , see , i played the piano from the third grade all the way through high school ,
yeah .
so i played chic -, uh , concertos and other stuff
but ,
i got to the point where i wasn 't really reading music , i was memorizing music ,
so because of that , i can 't read music as well as i used to ,
yeah .
but anyway ,
but i enjoy it , though .
i find it to be a good out
and i still enjoy the marching band
and i still enjoy , uh , singing in the choir
so ,
do you sing at choir at your church ?
yes ,
i do .
yeah .
yes ,
i do .
that 's ,
yeah .
in fact , that 's about the only musical thing that i still do is sing in the choir .
i tried out for choir when i was , think , in the seventh grade
and they wouldn 't let me in .
so ,
i never tried again .
well ,
i sing in the choir ,
i do know if they want me to or not ,
but at least i do sing in it
yeah ,
that 's pretty good .
well ,
i never really learned the music or anything .
i never learned ,
i got right to where i was figuring out where all the keys were on the piano
and that 's about when i quit .
i was at ,
i actually went to the university of texas at one time thinking that i would , c -, be a musician .
i wanted to be a high school band director .
yeah .
but after one semester of that , i said n -, no ,
no ,
this isn 't for me .
enjoy it , but not for profession , no .
yeah .
and besides that i kind of learned i wasn 't really that good
i gave up .
yeah .
course , my mom thought i was ,
but , uh , you know ,
of course ,
parents always do .
oh , yeah ,
so ,
they 're nice that way .
yes .
well , what else can we d -, uh , talk about ,
uh ,
uh , well , i don 't , d -,
so you listen to kind of church music , gospel ?
no ,
no ,
i , i listen to k v i l .
oh , yeah ?
yeah .
yeah .
so i listen to the radio ,
i like the pop music .
oh , yeah .
i like people like neil diamond and all , all the folks that you 're not supposed to like ,
but that 's who i go for
oh , yeah ,
the jeezer music as i call it .
oh , the jeezer music .
yeah .
oh , okay ,
well ,
my boss listens to that .
we listen to ninety -seven point nine
and that 's his station , so i call it the jeezer music .
okay ,
now what d -, kind of music do you listen to ?
well , i listen to like ninety -seven point one , you know , more ,
what d -, what is that ?
it 's more , uh ,
i don 't know how to explain it ,
kind of pop , you know , rock .
rock .
yeah .
hard rock ?
well , not hard
not hard rock .
just kind of ,
not like the eagle .
huh ?
is that the eagle ?
yeah .
okay ,
i know , i know what the eagle is .
it 's not too hard ,
it 's ,
that 's not too hard .
you know .
but it 's not enough to put you to sleep
true ,
true .
which some of the songs on k v i l can .
well , course , see , i listen to k v i l for the contests .
i mean
oh , yeah ,
got the bumper sticker , too ?
oh , yes ,
oh , yes .
you can 't drive a car without bumper sticker
and you know they 're going to call you up .
someday .
yeah
well , listen , i 've enjoyed talking .
i , i 'm sure that the switchboard will probably give us that sign off message very shortly anyway .
okay .
i appreciate it .
okay .
catch you later .
bye -bye .
bye -bye .
okay
okay
have you done this very long ?
uh , well , yeah ,
for the last , uh , couple of months .
yeah ,
that 's the same with us .
yeah .
well , what kind of car would you buy ?
well , it 's kind of hard to say ,
uh , because i don 't think we 're going to buy another car for about three years .
we just oh , okay .
o -,
bought , uh , a car , uh , last year and then bought one in eighty -nine and , uh ,
wait a minute ,
we bought one in ninety .
we 've got three cars , of all things .
uh -huh .
so , uh , probably we 'll be in at least a midsize , four door sedan .
okay .
what kind do you have now ?
uh , we have a , a mazda nine twenty nine and a ford crown victoria and a little two seater c r x .
oh , okay .
uh , it 's rather difficult to , to project what kind of , uh ,
uh -huh .
we 'd , look , always look into , uh , consumer reports to see what kind of , uh , report , or , uh , repair records that the various cars have and then , of course , we look into the prices .
yeah .
and , uh , f -, uh , we 're not adverse to buying along in the summer when , when the cars could get to be discounted
because we keep , we 've begun to keep them , uh , long -, a longer period of time .
uh , i traded off an eighty -two oldsmobile for the eighty -nine mazda .
oh , uh -huh .
so , uh ,
and did you find that you like the foreign cars better than the domestic ?
uh , yeah ,
yeah .
we , we 've had thirty some odd cars in our married life ,
and , uh , we , we 've had a good many foreign cars .
uh -huh .
and , uh , they , they , uh ,
i 've been extremely ,
we 've had three mazdas .
we 've been extremely pleased with our mazdas .
oh , really ?
yeah .
we 've always bought american made cars , mostly oldsmobiles .
yeah ,
well , we , we 've had , uh ,
let 's see ,
we had , uh , we had a , uh ,
let me think .
None
and a , uh , we had , uh , two fifty -threes which is a long thirty minute story
uh , and we had a sixty -five
and then we had this eighty -two .
uh -huh .
so we , we really can 't complain about oldsmobiles , really .
yeah ,
we 've been real pleased with ours .
yeah .
i think we 've had , one , two , three and most ,
we have a cutlass , we still have a cutlass supreme which is like , a seventy -seven .
uh -huh .
then we have a cutlass sierra
and we 've had the ninety -eight .
uh -huh .
so ,
but i don 't know ,
we 'll , we 're going to be in the market for a car , probably in the next year
uh -huh .
and the financing is always something we consider , you know , the four percent or when they give good financing through the , the motor company .
uh -huh .
but , i don 't know what we 're going to buy .
i always thought i would like to try a foreign made car ,
but , boy , with all the auto workers being laid off , makes me feel guilty
so ,
well uh , my son over in shreveport , uh , sold porsches , audis , mad -, mazdas and volkswagons for ten years
and that was one of the deciding factors in getting the mazdas .
oh .
uh , so , uh , the first foreign car that we had was a , a seventy -seven m g , m g b
oh the ,
was british gr -, racing green , with real wire wheels and a hard top and a soft top .
ooh , boy .
and , uh , i drove it mostly .
and ,
i 'll bet it was hard to part with that .
yeah ,
it really was .
my husband was in the air force
and we got transferred to okinawa .
oh .
so , uh , we had to sell it .
w -, which really tore me up
oh , yeah .
because , uh , it , it w -, it was great fun .
and then , uh , when we got to okinawa , well , we bought a second hand ,
we , uh , we decided that , uh ,
we had this , uh , sixty -five oldsmobile
and it , and it was just too big ,
so we , we sold it to a fellow who was coming back to the states
and we got a little fiat , uh , and a , and the little , uh , forty horse power mazda , four door sedan .
oh .
so what do you think about caring for older folks dale ?
well , i think , uh the elderly is a really neat population to care for .
uh -huh .
they 've got a lot of special needs
and at the same time , uh , the majority of them don 't want to give up the independence that they have .
right ,
very definitely .
and so you 've got a real balance to make there .
uh -huh .
what about you ?
well , i 'm thinking about it more in terms of my parents that are starting to get old .
they aren 't really that old ,
but they are , sort of wearing out .
uh -huh .
my mamma is a dialysis patient and she is only about sixty -four ,
but she 's had some pretty close calls
and my daddy has to drive her to dialysis now
and so she 's phasing out
uh -huh .
and , but she 's also a very , very , very independent person and doesn 't like having having people , uh , not being able to do things for herself when she wants to uh , i know they certainly don 't want to be in a nursing home ,
but my daddy keeps talking about it .
i don 't ,
i couldn 't possibly ,
None
couldn 't never see him in a nursing home .
and my grand daddy also doesn 't like , wouldn 't want to be in a nursing home .
oh really .
he 's ninety , i think right on ninety right now and he 's living by himself .
oh , okay .
my grand mamma died a couple of years ago so but , he 's , you know ,
as long as you can have the families take care of the people , i 'd like to see them stay at home .
yeah ,
but it gets hard .
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
right .
my , my grandmother is in her mid eighties and she 's , uh , suffering from , uh , well , uh , progressive alzheimer 's disease so she doesn 't remember anybody and , uh , she remembers things ,
right .
but they are things back whenever she was real young and so , with ,
she was living by herself
uh -huh .
but my , uh , uncle has moved in with her to take care of her and it 's creating a lot of problems .
right ,
especially for your uncle i bet .
oh yes .
yes .
now a friend of mine who was studying social work here in philadelphia worked for an adult day care program for mostly for patient 's with alzheimer .
do they have anything like that in dallas .
in dallas ,
uh , yeah .
i 've , i 've heard of several things
and they are really neat programs to be able to do if you can link up with them ,
but sometimes it 's hard to either find the connections to get them in or , uh , to be able to get them there for the day program and pick them up .
right .
so they are pretty limited .
right .
oh , another interesting thing ,
another good friend of mine who got her degree in social gerontology wa -, well had a job for a while where she went around to to folks and had them , sort of kicked them in the pants to make them take good care of their older relatives .
oh really .
to make sure that they would take care of their responsibilities .
uh -huh .
i don 't think that was mainly with alzheimer 's patients , but just patients , people in general who were not as independent as they use to be .
uh -huh ,
uh -huh .
well , it , it 's , it 's a really , day care programs are really neat , you know
and if the , if the people are able and and can get up and move and everything like that , that is one of the best things to do ,
uh -huh
right .
uh -huh .
but i think the hardest thing to do is whenever you 've got a person who 's mentally very alert and active and their body just hasn 't kept up with them and i think that 's in a way it 's more , some , an area where some of the day care , uh , programs have left off because you really kind of have to be a little bit mobile to be able to do those .
right
to , uh , get there and to participate in the activities .
right .
cause i know , there 's one not too far from from me here in dallas .
right .
uh , and they have ceramics and pottery and needle work and sports .
right .
but if your vision is gone and you have arthritis real badly ,
that 's true .
you can 't play those things .
yeah ,
you can 't do it .
well , that 's true .
but you can sing songs and , uh and tell stories about the old times .
i guess , you know , you were talking about your ,
uh -huh .
uh -huh .
was it your grand mother that was having alzheimer uh , being able to tell old stories .
you can perhaps get a group of people that aren 't too far along with alzheimer talking about the old times and enjoying it themselves that way .
and they love to recollect .
i mean they just , you know ,
and they will just go on and on with these stories
and they have such a memory .
do they like to listen to other people recollect though ?
my grandmother doesn 't
she , she wants to te -, to tell you about her story over again
right .
so which is fine , you know ,
so ,
well , that is good because we ,
um , so what do you think ?
um ,
i lived , i lived in sweden for two years .
uh -huh .
and in sweden they have socialized medicine .
and so i saw some of the good
and also i saw some of the bad that results from such a program .
uh -huh .
uh , some of the , some of the good obviously that nobody has to worry about health care .
right .
so it 's a very , it 's a very , uh , comfortable ,
i mean our people are very comfortable in the sense that , you know , there 's no medical emergency that 's going to make you destitute for life .
right .
um , the bad was more apparent i think at least for me
because i think it affected people 's lives on , in a way that you could see .
one , one thing that i noticed is it 's very , very convenient to be alcoholic in sweden .
oh , really ?
because it 's treated as a disease .
now i don 't know if that necessarily has to be part of socialized medicine ,
but , uh , if you 're , if you 're alcoholic , then you 're treated as if you 're on disability , long -term disability
and so there was very little incentive for people to get out of that .
huh .
also , um , another thing that , that i noticed that was very strange ,
i was , uh , i would go down all these , uh , uh ,
i remember this one row of houses
and they were , uh , row houses or townhouses ,
uh -huh .
all connected together so it was like lower middle -class housing .
well , it would be lower middle -class housing here .
it 's probably middle -class housing there .
uh -huh .
um , and there was a taxi driver that lived in one of these
and there was a doctor that lived in one of these .
the one guy was a doctor
and one was a taxi driver ,
and so their , their incomes were about the same .
huh .
whereas here , there is a great incentive to be a doctor because there 's a great financial reward .
right .
and that , that didn 't exist in sweden .
right .
and , uh , overall i gue -, their , their health care suffered fair amount from just the fact that the doctor salaries were lower
and it was , it was less professional
and it was treated more ,
like a , like a taxi driver type job ,
yeah .
then a , then a doctor type job .
i -,
that is , uh , that is something i 've heard .
uh , i had a friend , uh , that i worked with that was from sweden
and that was , uh ,
probably the , the major concern i have is that , you know , we are leading in the technology realm of , of medicine just because it is such a great incentive to , to get into , uh , the medical field ,
but at the same time it 's real hard .
i mean my husband works for a company that provides insurance
and so , you know , i 'm real , you know ,
it 's like well , you know , you know ,
there 's got to be better ways , you know , to do some things
but , you know , i hate to , uh ,
the , the competition , i -, in a lot of ways is , is wonderful just because you can choose your doctor
and , and , uh , they have to compete to be , to be good and to be knowledgeable .
but at the same time , there 's a , you know , they 're regulating themselves
and , and the hospitals are charging just enormous amounts for products that they don 't have to pay very much for .
my , i have a brother who 's a vet
and for something that he can get , you know , wholesale
right .
and i 'm sure they can get a lot cheaper because they , they , hospitals buy in such a bulk rate , um you know , they could charge you twenty dollars for a dollar fifty item
and that 's ridiculous .
and i don 't think that is , that is , uh , abnormal in any means to be doing things like that .
and ,
you don 't think it 's abnormal ?
i don 't think it 's abnormal for hospitals to be doing that at all
oh , i see .
you 're not saying it 's right ,
you 're just saying it 's common .
i -,
yeah .
and so i -, i -, it 's , i think , i -, to me i think , uh , something that 's going to help our medical , uh , arena is for , um ,
and i don 't know how to , i don 't know how to do this
but i think people are too lawsuit happy .
and i mean things will happen
and , and you 've got to , uh , keep up
or you 've got to realize that , you know , i -, it is just men or women that are , that are making , um , decisions
and they will make mistakes
and e -, e -, you know , i -, if people , you know , i -,
there are some people that i 'm sure make mistakes because they just don 't keep on top of it ,
but there are other things that just happen that you can 't , you know , you can 't say , you know , well , if you had just done this , you know , things would have done differently ,
and , um , i don 't know .
i , i think the fact that malpractice has gone up i think has raised our prices just dramatically . um ,
yes .
in the , in the last number of years
and i think that 's something that if , if they could work on the cause of that and ,
well it 's , uh ,
i 'll start off here .
uh , i don 't know .
i get , probably , most of my information either from the newspaper or from c n n .
uh , i like c n n because it , uh , you know , repeats it ,
well headline news repeats every half hour
right ,
yeah .
but it makes it really convenient cause i keep a rather hectic schedule
and , uh ,
yeah .
but the newspaper p -, provides a little bit of depth that you can 't really get from ,
i , i think i 'd agree .
a , a s -, similar method of getting the news with me too .
it 's , uh , uh , c n n has been a welcome addition to   the t v scene here in the ,
 .
last , uh , number of years .
uh , p -, prior to cable , you know , you didn 't get much news off of normal , uh , television broadcasts .
right .
uh , just usually pretty local in , in nature
uh -huh .
and , and i like , uh , c n n because you get some world , world events too uh , which is not too common on , on the other format , newspapers , and so forth .
right .
yeah .
i know , the ,
my only major objection is that , uh , i don 't think american media spends enough , uh , attention on , on our closest neighbors like mexico and canada .
uh ,
that , that 's true , you know .
you hardly ever see , uh , headline articles about the , uh , either the economics or , or other wor -, news events going on in either of those countries .
uh -huh .
yeah .
uh , whereas if you pick up a , a european paper , you know , uh , it , all the surrounding countries , soviet union , and everything has , uh , major news , uh , articles in them .
right .
yeah .
i mean , you know , canada has gone through a lot of problems now with , with quebec and , and everything
and , uh , it 's amazing that ,
you know , i , i listen to d c area and the washington post , you know ,
i mean the most they 'll give it is the back of the a section .
yeah .
uh , you know .
i 'm , i 'm currently living in dallas
and it , it won 't even give it the back section  .
you just ,
 .
never see , you just never see anything about it ,
uh , which is a shame because you go to other countries , uh ,
and , and they carry quite a bit about the u s on the other hand .
uh -huh .
and if you go up to , uh , canada , those people are usually pretty , uh , familiar with the politics going on and and the news   u s
and we 're pretty , uh , limited in our understanding of , of leaders up in canada or mexico .
yeah ,
definitely .
you just don 't know what 's going on .
yeah .
i 'd , i ,
every once in awhile , i have to travel overseas
and lately i 've taken the , taken a little shortwave radio , uh , around and picking up the b b c
and it 's sort of like , uh , a c n n too .
uh -huh .
you you can tune into some stations
and you get some , like thirty minute summaries of , of news events .
uh , i occasionally get into some of the middle eastern , uh , area
and that 's the only way you can tell what 's going on at all
 .
right .
there 's not much in the way of television in some of those places .
uh , but that 's a good point about , about the neighboring countries .
i hadn 't really thought about it
but i guess you don 't think about it cause you don 't hear it .
right .
exactly .
yeah .
i , uh , spent this past summer up in canada .
uh , well part of it , touring .
and , uh , you know , i -, i was amazed cause i 'd pick up a local paper and i 'd read about all of these , you know , really interesting things going on .
there 's some serious talk about whether there 's actually going to be a , a canada , you know , in the next five years .
yeah .
you know , because of the problems with quebec
and n -, i had never heard any of that before .
yeah ,
you know , there was , a , a ,
what is it called ,
is it meech lake accord ?
uh -huh .
or , or , i -, that 's just something , uh , i 'd say ninety percent of the people here would never have heard of
and i think that i heard of it about the first time when i was up in calgary a couple of years ago and , you know , picked up a , a paper and started reading a little bit more detail about it .
and , and c -, came   ,
it was a big thing going on there
and i came back here
and nothing in the papers .
right ,
right .
i didn 't see a thing about it .
so it 's , uh , we 've got a long ways to go , i guess .
it 's improved .
and like i say , with c n n and , and , uh , the cable news .
even , even there 's , uh , uh ,
it 's sor -, it 's semireligious in some respects .
but what is it ?
it 's , uh , i mean it 's news is not , not that way ,
uh , oh , i 'm trying to think of the channel .
the , the christian science monitor .
oh , yeah .
uh , i , it surprised me .
i 've caught it a few times
and they , they do some pretty good news .
uh , seemingly unbiased news broadcasts .
uh -huh .
uh uh , the , the title of the network is sort of surprising .
you 'd think it would carry mostly religious
but it , it doesn 't seem to .
so i 'll flip through and listen to it once in awhile too , uh , and catch something maybe a little different than , than c n n might be covering .
uh , some more in -, interest type topics in , in other countries .
but it 's kind of world , world , uh , network too .
yeah .
uh , i , i guess i 've never seen the t v show .
i used to get the , uh ,
a , golden retriever .
yeah .
that 's one of my favorite kinds of dogs .
is it really ?
how long have you had it ?
we 've had him for ,
he just had his fourth birthday .
fourth birthday .
yeah ,
we got him when he was about eight weeks old
he 's pretty okay ,
we like him .
does he shed a lot ?
he does .
that 's the one thing we don 't like about him .
in fact , we threaten him in the summertime that we might just shave all of his hair off .
he 'd probably look pretty funny if we did that .
how much does he weigh now ?
he just went to the vet yesterday to get his shots and everything ,
they put him on the scale
he 's up to ninety four now .
oh .
he 's not a real tall , dog for a golden retriever .
he 's kind of stocky , shorter and stockier .
None
None
is he good with family ?
he is .
it 's , just me and my wife
he 's kind of our temporary substitute for having kids .
we treat him like our kid right now so he 's spoiled rotten .
yeah ,
i ,
i can understand that
get away with that a little bit more with pets than you can with kids
uh -huh .
how about you ?
we have a cat who 's also about four years old .
oh .
he 's our spoiled child right now , too
uh -huh .
he also sheds a lot .
yeah .
we hope to get a golden retriever someday .
we figure we 'll get the kids and then the dog
that 's probably a good idea .
they 're good though .
have you ever had a retriever before ?
no ,
my husband had one when he was growing up .
i find that they 're good around other animals like cats and other dogs .
they don 't tend to get real jealous or territorial .
they like to play .
None
especially with the kids .
they love to play with kids .
is your dog an inside and outdoors ?
no ,
he 's pretty much an inside dog .
None
he stays in .
we 're kind of in not a real busy neighborhood , but more so than i 'd want him to be out too much
he doesn 't like it if we tie him outside .
really ?
he 's really a wimp .
when it comes to being alone ,
if you give him the freedom to walk around and go wherever he wants , he likes that ,
he does not like to be tied outside .
he 'll just bark and bark and bark .
when he gets outside , does he run away and then eventually come back ?
no ,
he 's , taken to the training pretty well
he knows where our yard is
we have a pretty small yard ,
he seems to know the boundaries .
None
he usually is good about staying within them ,
our next door neighbors have a dog , too
she is good friends with my dog .
yeah ?
he often gets to smelling her scent and will go over there to sniff around and stuff
None
he 's pretty good .
he stays out of the street
if i catch him i call him
he comes back .
None
he 's pretty good about taking to commands and things .
no we never did .
did you bring him to a doggy obedience school or just train him on your own
None
i trained him on my own
this is the first dog i 've had all my own as an adult .
uh -huh .
we 've had dogs when i was a kid ,
this is the first one that i , took in ,
i wasn 't sure if i 'd be able to get it all right the first time ,
he seems to have picked it up pretty well .
uh -huh .
i never really to hit him or anything .
None
really ?
just , firm tone of voice and those sorts of things .
i see other people out there
they hit their dogs and try to ,
those horrible collars that they put on them with invisible fencing ,
least i ,
invisible what ?
invisible fencing ,
have you heard of that ?
no ,
what is that ?
oh .
it 's a system you can put in your yard where you bury these little , transducers or emitters in your yard at the perimeter
they wear a collar with a special little attachment on it
oh .
if they get too close to that perimeter , it zaps them .
boy .
yeah
i 'd be afraid to walk around if i was that dog
yeah ,
a friend of mine at work here said that he tried it with his dog
he wanted to see what he was subjecting his dog to
he held on to the collar
he walked out to the perimeter .
he said it was a good jolt .
really ?
yeah ,
None
i don 't take too well to those sorts of training techniques .
i don 't think they 're always necessary .
if you put enough patience into ,
yeah ,
uh -huh .
just be consistent and diligent with it
None
is your cat an indoor cat or an outdoor cat ?
yeah he 's indoor and all declawed because i know the , average life span of an outdoor cat is eighteen months .
yeah .
somebody just told me that because of the leukemia ?
yeah ,
that and also just , getting hit , i guess , or getting beat up .
the average life span of an indoor cat is eighteen years
wow .
None
quite a difference .
yeah .
what kind of climate do you have ?
we just moved recently
now we 're in the , dallas area
oh .
it 's very nice
None
the only experience i have ,
i don 't have any children
but i 've , uh , i was a baby -sitter in high school .
and then , just recently , after we were married , i baby -sat for a dentist while she worked .
and i just , uh
yeah .
that 's the only thing i 've ever done also , is baby -sit .
is it ?
but , uh , i 've heard people that i work with talk about , you know , child care .
especially , i guess it 's even harder on single mothers .
oh , yeah .
the expense .
yeah .
having to pick up the kid by , you know , six o 'clock
or it 's five dollars for every minute you 're late . and stuff like that
uh -huh .
which is understandable .
just sit around
i mean , these people can 't , you know , stay there till eight o 'clock because somebody has to work late
but
that that 's true .
see the lady i did it for ,
that 's why she picked me is because i would go to her house so she wouldn 't have to get her little girl up .
so she could sleep in .
and , uh , then she could be at home
and then i 'd bring her to my house for a couple of hours if i wanted too or whatever .
but , uh , she paid , i think it was two or , i think it was about two fifty , three dollars a hour
and by the time i paid taxes on it , it , i was getting like eighty cents
oh , no .
and that wasn 't counting food or gas or anything .
yeah .
it 's hardly worth your time .
yeah .
yeah .
that 's pretty bad .
the only time i baby -sat was in high school
and it , you know ,
of course you don 't ha -,
i didn 't pay taxes on that ,
so .
right .
it was easy , you know , go over to some , uh ,
it was these people that lived in our neighborhood
and i 'd just go over there .
every thursday night , they went to the theater .
they had permanent tickets
and they 'd give me ,
it was supposed to be two dollars an hour for two kids ,
but they would usually give me like five dollars more at the end of the night .
oh , wow .
and , i mean , they 'd , you know ,
it was great .
i 'd go over there
and there would be like , uh , you know , there 's , we have these videos over here .
watch ,
 .
whatever you want .
and there 's some oreos in the , in the cupboard .
and there 's some coke
and you know , just help yourself to anything .
wow .
so it was , it was , you know , the best ,
that was a long time ago
and that was only for a few years .
just once a week .
yeah .
but i don 't know .
i think people that treat their baby -sitters like that get a lot better baby -sitters .
oh , yeah .
that 's true .
and they stick around for longer .
because i mean after i figured out i was getting eighty cents an hour , i said bag it .
and i quit you know .
yeah .
i was just like but i 'm wasting my time .
yeah .
i really liked the little girl and everything
but i thought
she does take up ,
and they do take up a lot of your time .
that
yeah .
yeah ,
i
they 're very demanding
uh -huh .
well , and she was really spoiled .
they didn 't make her eat anything she didn 't want or anything .
so , basically , they fed her cookies for breakfast and lunch .
and the mom was a dentist
and i was just like , we 've got to quit this .
and she 's like no i don 't want her to starve .
but i don 't want to make her eat something she doesn 't want to eat
oh , shoot .
like .
eat this or  .
my mom would be like , uh eat it or don 't eat anything .
that 's right .
so , i can see the concerns on what different people want .
yeah .
because some ,
yeah .
i mean , you know , if i was setting up a daycare , there would be so many needs you would have to customize your service to .
uh -huh .
cause some parents won 't put up anything . where others would .
i think ,
yeah ,
i think the best way to go would just be to , to be able to do it out of your basement .
uh -huh .
and just have like t -, at the most , like ten kids .
no .
and all from maybe people that you know type of thing .
instead of trying actually to set up a daycare where you don 't know the people coming in and
that 's true .
i , i 'd love to do it .
but i just don 't trust people now .
there 's too many lawsuits .
yeah .
i just , i think it 's a bigger risk than
more than what it 's worth ?
yeah .
yeah .
it would scare me .
with ,
i don 't know ,
cause i 'm sure some of them have good reason to sue
but i think a lot of them are just , you know , they 're negligent
and they get happy about money
yeah .
and they just want to sue you .
well , yeah .
that 's ,
yeah ,
exactly .
uh -huh .
when you have like a kindercare or something set up and th -, when they get greedy or whatever , that 's when they have maybe one assistant to twenty kids or something
oh , yeah .
and that 's just , you know ,
that 's impossible .
you can 't watch that many little kids getting into things at one time
you know , you never know what they 're going to get into .
i have a girlfriend that works at a daycare
and she takes her little girl with her
and , i mean , she told me about half the people that they hire
and half of them she 'd like to turn them into the state
and that 's the people that are working there , you know .
and then she would like to turn in half of the parents that drop their kids off because of the condition the kids are in , you know .
oh , that 's horrible .
like they 'll be in the same clothes they were the day before , the same diaper .
huh .
you know , just awful things .
and so i don 't know .
i don 't have kids
but i always think man i just don 't know if i could trust anybody .
i mean , you just don 't know .
yeah .
that 's i -,
yeah ,
that 's a hard thing about it .
if , i mean , i don -, i can 't foresee myself getting married
but if , you know , if i ever wanted to have a kid , how could i work .
i mean , i don 't think i could trust somebody with my kid either .
oh , yeah .
that 's true .
unless it was a friend that , you know , did it in
yeah .
i just , i couldn 't do it i don 't think .
it would just rip me apart , i think
i don 't know .
yeah .
just not knowing .
yeah ,
just besides the fact that , you know , your , when your child gets out of school at three o 'clock and then has to wait .
what do you usually wear to ,
well , let 's see .
it turns out that , uh , tek -,
i work at tektronix
and it 's a very , uh , low key place as far as dress goes .
uh -huh .
you just wear , uh ,
let 's see .
when i first came here , i wore suits
but after a while i got , uh , found out that that wasn 't all that important .
i 'm an engineer .
oh , i see .
uh -huh .
and , uh , so , i get to wear just , uh , how shall i say it , uh , walking shoes as opposed to dress shoes and well walking , how shall i say it , kind of like avia , uh , walking shoes , uh ,
well , that 's nice comfortable stuff .
yes .
open shirt , open at the neck , you know , no tie .
wow .
and , uh , just , uh , reasonable looking , how shall i say it , uh , sports clothes or some guys wear , some people even wear levis .
wow .
that 's nice .
now , being from philadelphia , i don 't expect your dress code to be quite that relaxed , right ?
well actually right now i 'm a full time college student
so my dress code is very , very   .
oh , okay .
yeah ,
i usually wear jeans and stuff to classes or shorts in the summertime .
but over the summers i 've had a job , internships with the newspaper .
uh -huh .
and that 's   so ,
generally then i dress , you know , nicer .
usually nice summer slacks or more , sometimes skirts , stuff like that .
so , then it 's still , you know , the emphasis is on comfort a lot because it 's a lot of walking and coming in , out of the office
but you still have to have a professional imagine kind of thing .
yes .
to go out to meet people and interview people and stuff like that
so .
yeah ,
well i , uh , i just recently applied for a different job in the company here
oh , really .
and so i decided well i 'd wear a suit .
uh -huh .
and it , it was very interesting ,
uh , like i said , most of the people at , at this company don 't wear suits .
uh , most of the engineers and technical people are just very casual , almost the same clothes that , that you 'd wear to school .
wow .
that must be nice atmosphere then .
well , it has been .
although the new president and c e o of the company is from a much more formal eastern , uh , background .
oh .
and so the result is that , uh ,
so anyway i wore this suit
uh -huh .
and i went over to , uh , uh , to one of the buildings that has a lot more of the financial people in it and it , and i , i was almost converted because , uh , the effect of that suit on the way people res -, reacted and responded to me as opposed to the ,
uh , just to kind of ,
how shall i say it ,
they know you 're there
but they don 't
uh , you don 't ,
there 's no notice at all .
but when i wore a suit that day , uh , it was obvious that people didn 't know whether i was a worker bee or a manager .
wow .
so people , uh , how shall i say it , made a , made much more effort to notice you , acknowledge your presence , say hello and , uh , things like that ,
so .
that 's interesting .
it 's like a mini , little study there
yeah .
that 's really interesting .
and so this dress for success thing , i think is , uh ,
right .
by and large i 've , i 'm kind of , uh , convinced that , uh , by that , just that one , uh , uh , experience and then having talked to several other people that , that , uh , unless you 're in a , an environment where they 're going to make fun of , of , of better clothes , that better clothes always pay off .
huh .
that 's interesting .
doesn 't mean they have to be , uh ,
how shall i say it ,
uh -huh .
th -, they don 't have to be the , the most , uh , the absolute best but , uh , a little dressing a little bit above the standard , i think , would , uh , pay off
so i 'm in the process of telling my wife we got to go shopping for clothes again .
 that 's neat ,
that 's neat
and , uh , i , i don 't know ,
now i , i know eastern ,
now the other thing we do here , of course , is a single , not quite a single climate .
we have , uh , we do have some snow in the wintertime
and it can be quite warm in the summertime .
uh -huh .
not hot like , uh ,
i lived in the midwest for a while .
oh .
and i know that , uh , you know , it can be freezing cold in the wintertime ,
and hot and , uh , sticky in the summertime .
uh -huh .
we don 't have that much .
it 's , uh , it 's a very mild climate .
oh , well that 's nice .
that 's good for the clothes budget , i would imagine .
yes ,
it is .
because here , gosh , we had , uh ,
the winter hasn 't been bad this winter .
it 's , it   it 's only snowed maybe once or twice
but it 's been cold .
low twenties , let 's say ,
and then the summer gets up to eighties , nineties
so ,
you interested in woodworking ?
yeah .
i guess i am
it just seems kind of funny that this is a topic of discussion .
i do , some , woodworking myself
in fact , i 'm in the middle of a project right now making a bed for my son .
None
what kind of pine ?
it 's , it 's , plywood , face , i guess .
i cut it out in the shape of a crayon box
i painted , about eight different , colors ,
uh -huh .
i guess he 's young .
the crayons that are sticking up , it will be the headboard  {c and then ,
yes
he 's about five and a half years old .
he 'll be delighted .
yeah .
uh -huh .
now i just have to finish it though .
it got delayed for a little bit because of work
now , i 've got to jump back in and finish the ,
i 've got it all cut out ,
it 's all ,
i 've done most of the coloring
i 've got to go a second layer with the yellow .
did you do it with a jigsaw
do you have powered ,  {d you know , 
 {f uh , yeah .
i did , jigsaw , and the , regular straight saw for some of it .
None
yeah .
  to do th -, the turn cut .
how about yourself ?
i am interested in woodworking .
i don 't have lots of tools .
oh .
our local schools have adult education in the evening i use their tools a -, an -, and , some of their guidance .
i 'm an artist .
okay .
i 'm very handy
that 's great .
if i touch it , it turns into something usually .
 ]
what type of art do you focus on ?
i 'm very ,  ]
i have a master 's degree
my projects had to do with acrylic painting ,
i 'm really interested in the crafts .
 {f huh .
i make stain glass .
i 've done some silver jewelry making
i kind of ,
once i get really pretty good at something , i want to try something else
yeah .
kind of jack of all trades , master of none .
yeah ,
no ,
i get good enough to sell it or have people say wow ,
you didn 't buy it ,
you made it .
that 's great !
it 's like the thrill is gone
let 's do something else .
right .
you want to , explore a new field
None
 {d well ,  yeah ,
i 'm signed up for a class in pottery making because i 've never tried that yet  {c but ,
 {d so you have a m f a in what division of art ?
 {d well , i actually have a masters of art
it 's in art education .
okay .
i 'm a licensed teacher
yeah .
jobs being what they are , i substitute teach that way i have time for my kids too .
i 've been fortunate that i can afford to work part -time .
i don 't know how long that 's going to last
yeah .
they 're cutting back ,
i don 't go in all that often
 ]
i 've been real interested in some of those cute country kind of things .
yeah  ]
i see stuff in craft galleries for five hundred dollars
i say , no
i go
i make it .
yeah .
that 's how i started jewelry making .
i love to cook .
that 's great .
 {f huh .  ]
i saw a silver necklace that had these little teeny weeny silver spatulas and , and knife and a fork and all kinds of stuff i went
i signed up for class because then again , you get someone to guide you
yeah .  ]
you get the tools you don 't feel like buying .
exactly .
i made a necklace that i saw in a gallery for three hundred twenty dollars
it took me a lot of time
 {f oh , yeah .
 {c but it didn 't ,
if it cost me twenty dollars ,
 {c and then i ,
and your time ,
then you 're that much farther ahead
yeah .
then i saw one of these country looking wood watermelons .
it was a solid watermelon with a wedge cut out of it .
right .
i 've seen them
the watermelon , the red with the seeds painted in
None
 {f oh , yeah .
uh -huh .
that 's neat .
i went there ,
we have home depot out here .
i don 't know if you 've heard of it .
i went
yes .
we have one .
i got two six foot inch thick boards turned into a watermelon .
i had to cut into slabs and build up this big square and turn it on the lath
 {f huh .
cutting that wedge out was no joke
i 'm sure .
a band saw ?
i had a , i did it through adult ed again .
what ?
i did it through adult ed again .
uh -huh .
the teacher was one of these negative people ,
that 's dangerous ,
we can 't do that ,
we just can 't do that .
i 'm going how about this way ?
i want to do that ,
that was the plan here
right .
a cradle for it .
we did get the wedge cut out by building some kind of a cradle for it .
yeah ,
so you can steady it
you used a handsaw or a backsaw ?
 {d well , the instructions in the book i had said use a coping saw
right ,
right .
there 's no coping saw big enough for a fourteen inch wide watermelon that he wanted me to do it by hand with a regular saw .
i said i 'm not that steady ,
it 's not going to happen .
yeah .
we built a cradle for it
we got one cut out on the radial saw ,
getting the other one out without the slice now flying in your face was something you had to think about
right .
 {d so ,
 {d now did you cut a quarter wedge in this ?
i 'd say it 's about an eighth .
 {d you know  jus -,
 {d well , i 'm envisioning , a watermelon like a log
what i 've seen of this kind before is you have the ,
it 's ,
if you 're looking at adding on you have ,
up here in rochester , uh , we 're the second cleanest metropolitan city as far as air pollution .
i think grand rapids was number one .
uh , we really don 't have too much of a problem as far as , uh , industry since we 're pretty technologically based as far as our industry in the city here .
but we do have the same problem a lot of ar -, other areas up here in the northeast have
and that is the effects of acid rain .
right .
com -, coming basically from coal plants in ohio and illinois and indiana .
well , tha -, that 's true .
actually down here we don 't have a big problem with , uh , with air pollution .
mainly because we don 't have anybody to th -, to either side of us .
uh , which helps out a lot as far as that goes .
i wouldn 't even necessarily thought of that except when i lived up in boston and up in , uh , you know ,
debates would come up up there in massachusetts and , you know , in that area over , uh , air pollution
and their attitude 's , basically , well , prevailing ins , winds are to the east
so why should we have to worry .
yeah .
i 've , i 've , uh , was in los angeles once
and that was quite a difference as far as pollution goes .
i mean you couldn 't really see that much
oh , yes
nothing ,
every once in a while we have these air inversions , the weather inversions
and then it gets hazy around here
but they 're really ,
we don 't have a big problem with it .
i think that , uh , what most of the people here in new york state are going after right now is ,
it 's , it 's the , uh , ongoing acid rain problem .
especially out in the , uh , uh , adirondack areas where , you know , the lakes are becoming , uh , changing the acidity of the lakes
right .
and we 're having problems now because the fish are dying and certain acidic loving plants , uh , or alkaline liking plants are j -, not lasting anymore because the soil levels , the p h is changing as this acid rain continues to fall .
and i know that there 's been battles over the states up here .
uh , you know , governor mario going after , you know , governors of ohio and il -, and indiana to fix what 's going on down there .
i remember when i was in florida ,
the only problem was that it seemed like it may ,
it wasn 't really pollution , just the steamy weather  .
oh absolutely ,
yeah ,
just muggy .
so , yes
i think ,
yeah ,
i think you 're right .
our most pollute substance down here is just water .
yeah
it ,
but i i , i , i think , you know , the biggest causes even then a lot of times are , uh , uh , like when i was up in boston just all the cars . you know , just all over the place .
you just got a lot of , you know , a lot of pollution from those
and , uh , you know , if you don 't have a wind , it sticks around .
oh , yeah .
i , you know , i was in boston once
and i remembered seeing some of these things coming through at rush hour , even with the tee .
absolutely .
uh , just this , it looked like billions of cars massing and if they sit there and then there 's nowhere for the air to go .
i mean , yeah , that 's what 's in , you know , los angeles is ,
i think that 's biggest problem
because when i was in los angeles for a time , it 's all , you know , from los angeles to san diego it 's like all city .
right .
and there 's really , there 's nowhere for this to be absorbed , really .
uh , tree planting sometimes can handle , you know , stopping some of the air pollution and that and help
but if you have nowhere to do anything .
that 's , that 's very true .
uh , you know , of course then when , when you 're not recycling , you 've got these incendiary plants and stuff , that can give you some pretty disgusting stuff going up in the atmosphere .
but i , you know , you 've got , you 've got the industry ,
you 've got that ,
and you got the cars .
i think the cars are where , where it 's at right now as far as pollution goes , air pollution i mean .
yeah .
i , you know , florida doesn 't seem to be , at least maybe miami ,
but i , i , uh , you know ,
fort lauderdale i , i don 't know what the big industries are down there , uh ,
right .
but , you know , up here we have kodak and that 's the worst polluter .
they put , uh , uh ,
you can smell ether in the air sometimes
it keeps the neighborhoods happy i guess .
i guess so .
uh , cause they clean the , uh , the lenses for cameras
and they , they make film here
and they 're the worst offender
but it 's , you know , it 's under so much control .
you know , sulphur dioxide is the big emittant from them
but that 's really getting under control now .
right .
i , you know , i don 't know in the air what they do .
uh , i , i haven 't run across any major pollutants down there that i 've , i 've really seen a lot of , you know , upsettedness about .
uh , i , i know i 've seen like , uh ,
my grandparents live in corpus christi , texas
and i know they 've , there 's a lot of refineries down there
and that , that 's some pretty potent stuff they put up in the air .
i , but i don 't know how , uh , you know ,
there 's a difference in what you can smell and what you , uh , you know , what 's bad .
be interesting to see when , as mexico develops industrially whether , you know , without ,
